Understanding how climate change, population growth, and development patterns will affect the area burned by and emissions from wildfires and how populations will in turn be exposed to emissions is critical for climate change adaptation and mitigation planning. We quantified the effects of a range of population growth and development patterns in California on emission projections from large wildfires under six future climate scenarios. Here we show that end-of-century wildfire emissions are projected to increase by 19-101% (median increase 56%) above the baseline period (1961-1990) in California for a medium-high temperature scenario, with the largest emissions increases concentrated in northern California. In contrast to other measures of wildfire impacts previously studied (e.g., structural loss), projected population growth and development patterns are unlikely to substantially influence the amount of projected statewide wildfire emissions. However, increases in wildfire emissions due to climate change may have detrimental impacts on air quality and, combined with a growing population, may result in increased population exposure to unhealthy air pollutants.","[Hurteau, Matthew D.] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Westerling, Anthony L.] Univ Calif, Sierra Nevada Res Inst, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Wiedinmyer, Christine] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Div Atmospher Chem, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Bryant, Benjamin P.] RAND Corp, Pardee RAND Grad Sch, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of California System; University of California Merced; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; RAND Corporation; Pardee RAND Graduate School,"Hurteau, MD (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",matthew.hurteau@psu.edu,"Hurteau, Matthew D/D-2301-2009; Liu, Yifan/S-6217-2017","Hurteau, Matthew D/0000-0001-8457-8974; Wiedinmyer, Christine/0000-0001-9738-6592; Bryant, Benjamin/0000-0002-9505-7012",NOAA Regional Integrated Science and Assessment Program via the California-Nevada Applications Program; California Energy Commission via the California Climate Change Center; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [GRANT11026720]; US Department of Agriculture Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station [08-CA-11272170-102]; Bureau of Land Management; National Science Foundation,NOAA Regional Integrated Science and Assessment Program via the California-Nevada Applications Program; California Energy Commission via the California Climate Change Center; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; US Department of Agriculture Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Bureau of Land Management; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the NOAA Regional Integrated Science and Assessment Program via the California-Nevada Applications Program, by the California Energy Commission via the California Climate Change Center, and by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant no.

J,"Geneletti, D; Zardo, L",,,,"Geneletti, Davide; Zardo, Linda",,,Ecosystem-based adaptation in cities: An analysis of European urban climate adaptation plans,LAND USE POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ecosystem-based adaptation; Urban ecosystem services; Urban planning; Climate change,HEAT-ISLAND; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; SERVICES; MANAGEMENT; AREAS; CITY; EXPERIENCES; INNOVATION; BENEFITS; ROOFS,"Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) measures have been increasingly promoted in the literature, as well as in policies and practices, for their environmental and socio-economic co-benefits. The recent scientific literature has shown a growing interest to assess climate adaptation plans at the urban level, in recognition of the important role played by urban areas in addressing climate change challenges. However, little information is available on the combination of these two issues, i.e., the actual inclusion of EbA measures in climate adaptation plans at the urban level. This paper addresses this gap by developing a framework to analyze the treatment of EbA in urban level climate planning, and apply it to a sample of climate adaptation plans in Europe. The framework consists of a classification of EbA measures, and a scoring system to evaluate how well they are reflected in different components of the plans. The results suggest that there is in general good awareness in plans of EbA measures, and of their potential role in addressing climate change challenges. However, their treatment in climate adaptation plans at the urban level often lacks sufficient baseline information, as well as convincing implementation actions. The paper concludes by offering recommendations to improve future practice, in terms of enhancing the baseline information to improve the proposal and design of EbA measures, improving the treatment of co-benefits associated to EbA measures, and strengthening coordination with other planning tools. Possible future development of this works include the integration of the proposed EbA classification, and the analysis of a larger sample of territorial plans. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Because of these threats, there is a growing need to develop and reinforce the adaptive capacity of tourism systems to cope with current and future challenges. In tourism studies, resilience assessments are a relatively new approach used to ascertain stakeholders' opinions regarding the human and natural conditions that are likely to increase the capacity of the tourism system to successfully cope with disturbances. This study examined local communities in and around Dana Biosphere Reserve (Jordan), specifically perspectives regarding the social, environmental, governance and economic dimensions of resilience that theoretically support the capacity of the ecotourism system to withstand or adapt to climate change. The results indicated perceived moderate resilience to climate-change-related threats in the environment dimensions of the study, and scope for further development of resilience in the social, economic and governance dimensions. Ultimately, further adaptation planning and policies appear necessary, to ensure robust and proactive measures are in place to respond to climate change threats and to protect the ecotourism socio-ecological system in Dana Biosphere Reserve.","[Jamaliah, Malek M.] Univ Jordan Aqaba, Dept Tourism Management, Aqaba, Jordan; [Powell, Robert B.] Clemson Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Clemson, SC USA",Clemson University,"Jamaliah, MM (corresponding author), Univ Jordan Aqaba, Dept Tourism Management, Aqaba, Jordan.",m.jamaliah@ju.edu.jo,"Jamaliah, Malek/I-5948-2018","Jamaliah, Malek/0000-0001-5114-7158",,,,,133,34,35,5,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

This idea is based on the argument that the local scale is where climate change impacts are felt and experienced. However, sustainable and just climate futures require transformations in systems, norms, and cultures that underpin and reinforce our unsustainable practices and development pathways, not just local action. Governance interventions are needed to catalyse such shifts, connecting multilevel and multiscale boundaries of knowledge, values, levels and organizational remits. We critically reflect on current adaptation governance processes in Victoria, Australia and the Gothenburg region, Sweden to explore whether regional-scale governance can provide just as important leverage for adaptation as local governance, by identifying and addressing intersecting gaps and challenges in adaptation at local levels. We suggest that regional-scale adaptation offers possibilities for transformative change because they can identify, connect, and amplify small-scale (local) wins and utilize this collective body of knowledge to challenge and advocate for unblocking stagnated, institutionalized policies and practices, and support transformative change.","[Granberg, Mikael] Karlstad Univ, Dept Polit Hist Religious & Cultural Studies, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Granberg, Mikael] Karlstad Univ, CCS, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Granberg, Mikael] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci CNDS, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Bosomworth, Karyn; Moloney, Susie] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Kristianssen, Ann-Catrin] Orebro Univ, Sch Humanities Educ & Social Sci, SE-70182 Orebro, Sweden; [Fuenfgeld, Hartmut] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Fuenfgeld, Hartmut] Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",Karlstad University; Karlstad University; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Uppsala University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Orebro University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Freiburg,"Granberg, M (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Polit Hist Religious & Cultural Studies, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.;Granberg, M (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, CCS, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.;Granberg, M (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci CNDS, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",mikael.granberg@kau.se; karyn.bosomworth@rmit.edu.au; susie.moloney@rmit.edu.au; ann-catrin.kristianssen@oru.se; hartmut.fuenfgeld@geographie.uni-freiburg.de,"Granberg, Mikael/B-5399-2013; Funfgeld, Hartmut/C-5962-2011; Bosomworth, Karyn/A-6435-2016","Granberg, Mikael/0000-0002-5356-4112; Funfgeld, Hartmut/0000-0003-0359-8207; Bosomworth, Karyn/0000-0001-9907-0858","Stiftelsen Lansforsakringsgruppens Forsknings-och Utvecklingsfond [P2/14]; RMIT University, Melbourne","Stiftelsen Lansforsakringsgruppens Forsknings-och Utvecklingsfond; RMIT University, Melbourne","The Swedish research was funded by the Stiftelsen Lansforsakringsgruppens Forsknings-och Utvecklingsfond, grant number P2/14.

Resulting rankings predictably mirror more general rankings of economic development, such as the Human Development Index. This approach is incomplete since it does not consider the normative or motivational context of adaptation. For what purpose or toward what goal does a nation aspire, and in that context, what is its adaptive capacity? This paper posits 11 possible national socio-political goals that fall into the three categories of teleological legitimacy, procedural legitimacy, and norm-based decision rules. A model that sorts nations in terms of adaptive capacity based on national socio-political aspirations is presented. While the aspiration of maximizing summed utility matches typical existing rankings, alternative aspirations, including contractarian liberalism, technocratic management, and dictatorial/religious rule alter the rankings. An example describes how this research can potentially inform how priorities are set for international assistance for climate change adaptation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This study measures the change in electricity demand in response to weather shocks at the household level in Delhi, and at various aggregate levels in India. Our econometric analysis uses a semi-parametric model to capture the nonlinearity of short-run temperature response. On average, aggregate electricity demand in India increases by 11% or more at temperatures above 30 degrees C from demand at temperatures of 21-24 degrees C, with substantial heterogeneity across states. Aggregate demand in Delhi increases by 30% or more at temperatures above 30 degrees C. Using rich micro-data on electricity demand in Delhi, we do a first-of-its-kind estimation of household-level temperature response. We find evidence that low-income consumers, especially those living in slums, show limited incremental response to high temperatures, likely due to an absence of cooling options. These findings underscore the need to improve our understanding of the constraints posed by poverty on climate change adaptation, and for interventions to mitigate risks of heat stress among the poor. This also suggests rising affluence will lead to sharp increases in electricity demand for cooling.","[Harish, Santosh] Ctr Policy Res, New Delhi, India; [Singh, Nishmeet] Int Food Policy Res Inst, New Delhi, India; [Tongia, Rahul] Brookings India, New Delhi, India",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Harish, S (corresponding author), Ctr Policy Res, New Delhi, India.",santosh@cprindia.org,"Singh, Nishmeet/AGR-1820-2022; Singh, Nishmeet/HNJ-3940-2023","Singh, Nishmeet/0000-0003-0358-4964",Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation,Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation,"The authors would like to thank Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd.

It employs a qualitative text review of the policy documents such as National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), relevant National Missions and selected State Action Plans for Climate Change (SAPCCs) and uses an illustrative case of action responses from the multilevel network of non-state actors. Through this exercise, it finds that the multilevel structure of these domains here offer facilitations as well as obstacles for proposed mainstreaming. The obstacles are in two forms. The first is yet an incomplete process of policy integration across different levels of governance. The second is the already existing set of challenges before watershed development in India, such as governance fragmentation, equity concerns in participation, and capacity-building and intercommunication between the levels. The facilitation comes through extra sources of knowledge and innovation from various state and non-state actors and their networks in multilevel systems, which need to be tapped in the current drive of mainstreaming for achieving the ends of climate adaptation in rainfed farming systems.","[Chaudhari, Vrishali Ramkrishna; Mishra, Arabinda] TERI Univ, Dept Policy Studies, 10 Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India",TERI University,"Chaudhari, VR (corresponding author), TERI Univ, Dept Policy Studies, 10 Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India.",vrishc@gmail.com,,"Parab, Vrishali/0000-0003-3219-5159",,,,,44,3,3,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

J,"Niiro, S",,,,"Niiro, Samuel",,,An Injury to the Inheritance: Locating an Affirmative Obligation to Climate Adaptation in the Law of Waste,COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF LAW AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DUTY,"As global temperatures continue to rise, most climate policy conversations have focused on mitigation measures, aimed at reducing the proliferation of greenhouse gases and curbing the rise in temperatures. Discussions, especially in legal literature, about climate adaptation measures-those intended to, for example, prepare for rising sea levels or increasing incidence of extreme weather events-have generally focused on the powers and responsibilities of government actors. Private citizens too, however, may also have a duty to prepare for climate change. The law of waste is a longstanding doctrine under which holders of a current possessory interest in real property, such as tenants or mortgagors, bear certain responsibilities towards holders of concurrent or future interests, such as lessors or mortgagees. This Note argues that a subset of the law of waste, called permissive waste, may be read to impose a duty to affirmatively pursue climate adaptation measures on tenants and other similarly-situated individuals. Part II provides background information on current efforts to find a legal basis for a duty to pursue climate adaptation. Part III examines the history of the law of waste, with particular attention to the concept of permissive waste. Parts IV and V outline how the law of waste could be applied to the problem of climate adaptation, exploring the necessary conditions for such a claim to be made as well as the uses and limitations of using the law of waste in this fashion.","[Niiro, Samuel] Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Niiro, S (corresponding author), Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,65,0,0,0,0,COLUMBIA JOURNAL TRANSNATIONAL LAW ASSOC,NEW YORK,"COLUMBIA UNIV, SCHOOL LAW, 435 W 116TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA",0010-1923,,,COLUMBIA J LAW SOC P,Columbia J.

The Huang Huai Hai (HHH) Plain, one of the most important grain production areas in China, is heavenly stricken by drought. Motivated by formulating drought risk prevention strategies that adapt to climate change on the HHH Plain, therefore, the present study aims to quantitatively evaluate the winter wheat drought risk under multiple climate scenarios using the Environmental Policy Impact Climate (EPIC) model. Based on the well-validated EPIC model, the drought hazard intensity (dHI), physical vulnerability (pV), and drought risk (dR) of the HHH Plain from 2010 to 2099 are assessed. Temporally, the dR showed an increasing trend in the long term, the high dR areas increased by 0.63% and 1.18% under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Spatially, dR showed a pattern of high in the south and low in the north whether under RCP4.5 or RCP8.5 scenario. Comparatively, the dR was 0.211 under the RCP4.5 scenario which was slightly higher than that under the RCP8.5 scenario, i.e. 0.207. The Huanghuai Plain agricultural subregion will be a high dHI-pV-dR region.

Spatio-temporal variation in selection potentially maintains differences, but relationships between metabolic traits (standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), and aerobic scope) and fitness across contexts are unresolved. We show that associations between SMR, MMR, and growth rate (a key fitness-related trait) vary depending on the thermal regime (a potential selective agent) in offspring of wild-sampled brown trout from two populations reared for approximately 15 months in either a cool or warm (+1.8 degrees C) regime. SMR was positively related to growth in the cool, but negatively related in the warm regime. The opposite patterns were found for MMR and growth associations (positive in warm, negative in the cool regime). Mean SMR, but not MMR, was lower in warm regimes within both populations (i.e. basal metabolic costs were reduced at higher temperatures), consistent with an adaptive acclimation response that optimizes growth. Metabolic phenotypes thus exhibited a thermally sensitive metabolic 'floor' and a less flexible metabolic 'ceiling'. Our findings suggest a role for growth-related fluctuating selection in shaping patterns of metabolic variation that is likely important in adapting to climate change.","[Archer, Louise C.; Hutton, Stephen A.; Harman, Luke; McGinnity, Philip; Reed, Thomas E.] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Cork, Ireland; [Archer, Louise C.; Hutton, Stephen A.; Harman, Luke; Reed, Thomas E.] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, Lee Rd, Cork, Ireland; [Poole, W.

Despite being two primary energies, their planning and management often does not consider the effects of climate change. To determine the size of a PV plant appropriate for integration into a hydropower system, this study developed a climate-hydrology-operation framework to identify system resilience in a changing climate. This bottom-up framework comprises four modules: (1) a weather generation and hydrology simulation module; (2) a GCMs forecast information module; (3) a hydro/PV integrated operation optimization module; and (4) a resilience evaluation module. With a case study of the China's Longyangxia hybrid hydro/PV power system, our analysis revealed conclusions as follows. (1) This complementary propertity of precipitation and radiation in the study area provides a driving mechanism for complementary operation of the hybrid power system. (2) Precipitation and radiation are the factors dominating the variation of the system reliability and economy under climate change, respectively. (3) The optimal size of the PV plant is 600-800 MW, in this range, the hybrid power system exerts an excellent operational capacity adaptive to climate change, and it performs satisfactorily in terms of reliability and economy.

To do so, a good understanding of the vulnerability of cities to these extreme events is necessary, lending special attention to the specifics of the different urban areas, such as historic city centres. In the present study, a vulnerability evaluation methodology is presented for cities against extreme rainfall and flooding, which follows a holistic and multi-stakeholder approach, integrating architectural, socio-economic, and cultural perspectives, that supports evidence-based decision-making for the sustainable development of the agents that intervene in the process. The MIVES method, based on a multiple criteria decision-analysis process and a CityGML-based data model are used for that purpose, with which a process for capturing, evaluating, and representing information in an objective, organized, and systematic way has been developed. These advantages are demonstrated through the application of that process to a case study in Donostia-San Sebastian (northern Spain), located on a river estuary in front of the sea, with a wide diversity of building styles.","[Gandini, Alessandra; Prieto, Inaki] TECNALIA, Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Parque Tecnol Bizkaia,Edificio 700, Derio 48160, Spain; [Garmendia, Leire] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Sch Engn, Mech Engn Dept, Bldg 1,Plaza Ingeniero Torres Quevedo S-N, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [Alvarez, Irantzu] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Sch Engn, Graph Design & Engn Projects Dept, Bldg 1,Plaza Ingeniero Torres Quevedo S-N, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [San-Jose, Jose-Tomas] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Sch Engn, Dept Engn Min Met & Sci Mat, Bldg 1,Plaza Ingeniero Torres Quevedo S-N, Bilbao 48013, Spain",University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,"Garmendia, L (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Sch Engn, Mech Engn Dept, Bldg 1,Plaza Ingeniero Torres Quevedo S-N, Bilbao 48013, Spain.",alessandra.gandini@tecnalia.com; leire.garmendia@ehu.eus; inaki.prieto@tecnalia.com; irantzu.alvarez@ehu.eus; josetomas.sanjose@ehu.eus,"ALVAREZ GONZALEZ, IRANTZU/ABA-3618-2021; Gandini, Alessandra/ADO-3635-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Garmendia, Leire/O-8006-2015; SAN-JOSE, JOSE-TOMAS/I-9400-2014","ALVAREZ GONZALEZ, IRANTZU/0000-0003-4444-292X; Gandini, Alessandra/0000-0001-5872-5774; Garmendia, Leire/0000-0002-3363-1015; SAN-JOSE, JOSE-TOMAS/0000-0003-4904-6731; Prieto Furundarena, Inaki/0000-0002-8407-6023",Basque Government through the ADVICE project; European Commission through the SHELTER project [GA821282]; University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU [GIU19/029]; Basque Government [IT1314-19],Basque Government through the ADVICE project(Basque Government); European Commission through the SHELTER project; University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU; Basque Government(Basque Government),"The authors would like to acknowledge the assistance of the Municipality of Donostia-San Sebastian without which the completion of this study would not have been possible, and the funding provided by the Basque Government through the ADVICE project and the European Commission through the SHELTER project (GA821282), as well as the support of research group IT1314-19 of the Basque Government and GIU19/029 of the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU.",,66,17,17,6,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

Cities require redesign and retrofit so they can become complex systems that create rather than diminish ecological and societal health. One way to do this is to strategically design buildings and cities to generate and provide ecosystem services. This is an aspect of biomimicry, where whole ecosystems and their functions are emulated, in order to positively shift the ecological performance of buildings and urban settings. A small number of methodologies and frameworks for ecosystem services design have been proposed, but their use is not wide spread. A key barrier is the lack of translational work between ecology concepts and practical examples of ecosystem services design for a built environment context. In response, this paper presents research underpinning the creation of a qualitative relational diagram in an online interactive format that relates ecosystem services concepts to design strategies, concepts, technologies, and case studies in a format for use by built environment professionals. The paper concludes that buildings and whole cities should be expected to become active contributors to socio-ecological systems because, as the diagram shows, many strategies and technologies to enable this already exist.","[Zari, Maibritt Pedersen] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington Sch Architecture, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Hecht, Katharina] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Padualaan 8, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands",Victoria University Wellington; Utrecht University,"Zari, MP (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington Sch Architecture, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.",maibritt.pedersen@vuw.ac.nz; katharina.hecht11@gmail.com,,"Pedersen Zari, Maibritt/0000-0003-4664-7558",,,,,69,13,13,4,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2313-7673,,BIOMIMETICS-BASEL,Biomimetics,JUN,2020,5,2,,,,,,,18,10.3390/biomimetics5020018,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biomimetics5020018,,,17,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Materials Science,MO0VO,32408595,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000551255100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

These responses are, in part, modulated by political relationships under cultural norms that dominate the institutional and collective decisions of public and private actors. The legacy of these decisions, which are often associated with investment in hard and soft infrastructure, has lasting consequences that influence current and future vulnerabilities. Making those decisions visible, and tractable is, therefore, an urgent research and political challenge in vulnerability assessments. In this work, we present a modeling framework to explore scenarios of institutional decision-making and socio-political processes and the resultant effects on spatial patterns of vulnerability. The approach entails using multi-criteria decision analysis, agent-based models, and geographic information simulation. The approach allows for the exploration of uncertainties, spatial patterns, thresholds, and the sensitivities of vulnerability outcomes to different policy scenarios. Here, we present the operationalization of the framework through an intentionally simplified model example of the governance of water in Mexico City.

The model is an expansion of Protection Motivation Theory (PMT [Rogers, R. W. (1983). Cognitive and physiological processes in fear-based attitude change: A revised theory of protection motivation.

Data were collected after conducting two surveys in Taiwan that involved a total of 394 respondents. The results indicated that perceived responsibility and SEAS predicted the support of only one to three of the policies. Regarding the PMT variables, severity and vulnerability did not affect the support of almost all policies. Policy support was primarily affected by the other three PMT variables: self-efficacy, response efficacy, and relative benefit.

The methodology followed includes the recording of the baseline situation and the assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerabilities. For the assessment, climate projections produced by regional climate models were used. The climate change factors, which are considered to affect the water resources in Cyprus, refer to the increase in temperature, the decrease in precipitation as well as the increase in droughts and in heavy rainfall. For the impact assessment, the changes in river and groundwater flows as well as other WSIs were studied. For the adaptation assessment, the degree of freshwater and non-freshwater resources exploitation and the measures for water demand reduction and the enhancement of drought preparedness were examined. At first, priorities with regard to climate change vulnerability, the water availability for domestic water supply and irrigation in mountain areas and the water availability for irrigation in plain and coastal areas were identified, while water availability for domestic water supply was estimated to present limited vulnerability to climate change.","[Papadaskalopoulou, Christina; Loizidou, Maria] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Chem Engn, GR-15773 Athens, Greece; [Giannakopoulos, Christos; Lemesios, Giannis] Natl Observ Athens, Athens 11810, Greece; [Zachariou-Dodou, Maria] Minist Agr Nat Resources & Environm Republ Cyprus, Water Dev Dept, CY-1047 Nicosia, Cyprus",National Technical University of Athens; National Observatory of Athens,"Papadaskalopoulou, C (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Chem Engn, 9 Iroon Polytechniou Str,Zographou Campus, GR-15773 Athens, Greece.",chpapad@chemeng.ntua.gr,,"LEMESIOS, GIANNIS/0000-0001-6050-7004; Giannakopoulos, Christos/0000-0003-1822-7716","European financial instrument for the Environment, LIFE+ [LIFE10 ENV/CY/000723]","European financial instrument for the Environment, LIFE+","The authors acknowledge the European financial instrument for the Environment, LIFE+, for part financing this work in the framework of the CYP-ADAPT project LIFE10 ENV/CY/000723.",,25,5,5,1,34,DESALINATION PUBL,HOPKINTON,"36 WALCOTT VALLEY DRIVE,, HOPKINTON, MA 01748 USA",1944-3994,1944-3986,,DESALIN WATER TREAT,Desalin.

In order to formulate appropriate programs and policies addressing this vulnerability, it is essential to understand their adaptive capacity. This study analyzed the adaptive capacity to climate change and vulnerability of 520 farming households in Dumangas, a town in central Philippines confronting climate/weather-induced risks. The objectives were: to determine the levels of adaptive capacity of farming households to climate change, analyze the factors that cause the differences in adaptive capacity and find out whether adaptive capacity translates to adaptation. The level of adaptive capacity of each farming house hold was determined using a composite index based on previous studies. The index included five indicators namely human resources, physical resources, financial resources, information and diversity Results showed that variations in adaptive capacity were caused by differences in information resources, physical and financial resources. Farming households that scored low in these three indicators had lower adaptive capacity. It was also found out that despite their level of adaptive capacity, households employed measures to adapt to climate change and variability. Households with higher adaptive capacity however employed more adaptation strategies.","[Defiesta, Gay] Univ Philippines Visayas, Coll Arts & Sci, Div Social Sci, Iloilo, Philippines; [Rapera, Corazon L.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Econ & Management, Dept Agr Econ, Los Banos, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Visayas; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Defiesta, G (corresponding author), Univ Philippines Visayas, Coll Arts & Sci, Div Social Sci, Iloilo, Philippines.",gay.defiesta@gmail.com,"Defiesta, Gay/I-8039-2019",,,,,,41,42,43,0,16,"UNIV PHILIPPINES LOS BANOS, COLLEGE",LAGUNA,"SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & MANAGEMENT, LAGUNA, 4031, PHILIPPINES",0119-1144,,,J ENVIRON SCI MANAG,J.

The paper gives an overview of the first outcomes of the analysis of the status quo and assessment of the most likely developments regarding GHG emissions, climate impacts and resource use in Wuxi-the Chinese pilot city for the LCFC project. As a first step, a detailed emission inventory following the IPCC guidelines for Wuxi has been carried out. In a second step, the future development of energy demand and related CO2 emissions in 2050 were simulated in a current policy scenario (CPS). In parallel, selected aspects of material and water flows for the energy and the building sector were analyzed and modeled. In addition, recent and future climate impacts and vulnerability were investigated. Based on these findings, nine key sectors with high relevance to the three dimensions could be identified. Although Wuxi's government has started a path to implement a low carbon plan, the first results show that, for the shift towards a sustainable low carbon development, more ambitious steps need to be taken in order to overcome the challenges faced.","[Dienst, Carmen; Schneider, Clemens; Xia, Chun; Saurat, Mathieu; Vallentin, Daniel] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, D-42109 Wuppertal, Germany; [Fischer, Thomas] CMA, NCC, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration,"Dienst, C (corresponding author), Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Doeppersberg 19, D-42109 Wuppertal, Germany.",carmen.dienst@wupperinst.org; clemens.schneide@wupperinst.org; chun.xia@wupperinst.org; mathieu.saurat@wupperinst.org; tom.fischer8@gmx.de; daniel.vallentin@wupperinst.org,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Fischer, Thomas/G-1906-2010","Fischer, Thomas/0000-0002-3067-8619; Vallentin, Daniel/0000-0001-7132-2822",LCFC project by Stiftung Mercator,LCFC project by Stiftung Mercator,We also would like to acknowledge the financial support of the LCFC project by Stiftung Mercator.,,15,12,12,4,67,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2013,5,8,,,,,3224,3243,,10.3390/su5083224,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su5083224,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,213IR,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000324050300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These extreme events potentially affect the health status of millions of people, increasing disease and death. Since mitigation of climate change is a long and complex process, emphasis has recently been placed on the measures required for adaptation. Although the principles underlying these measures are universal, preparedness plans and policies need to be tailored to local conditions. In this paper, we conducted a review of the literature on the possible health consequences of extreme weather events in Israel, where the conditions are characteristic of the Mediterranean region. Strong evidence indicates that the frequency and duration of several types of extreme weather events are increasing in the Mediterranean Basin, including Israel. We examined the public health policy implications for adaptation to climate change in the region, and proposed public health adaptation policy options. Preparedness for the public health impact of increased extreme weather events is still relatively limited and clear public health policies are urgently needed. These include improved early warning and monitoring systems, preparedness of the health system, educational programs and the living environment.

Vulnerability affects community participation in hazard mitigation, influences emergency response and governs adaptive capacity for the changing environmental and hazards characteristics. However, despite increased awareness, assessments and understanding of the processes that produce vulnerability, disaster risks prevail. This raises questions on the effectiveness of vulnerability assessments and their applications for hazard mitigation and adaptation. The literature includes a range of vulnerability assessment methods, wherein frequently the selection of any particular method is governed by the research objectives. On the other hand, hazard mitigation plans and policies even though mention vulnerability, their implementation pays less attention to the variations in its nature and underlying causes. This paper explores possible reasons for such gaps by exploring a case study of the Hutt Valley, New Zealand. It brings out the limitations of different vulnerability assessment methods in representing the local vulnerability and challenges they bring in planning for the vulnerability reduction. It argues that vulnerability assessment based on any particular method, such as deprivation index, principle component analysis, composite vulnerability index with or without weight, may not reveal the actual vulnerability of a place, and therefore, a comprehensive vulnerability assessment is needed.","[Khan, Shabana] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Khan, S (corresponding author), Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, Dept Geog, New Delhi, India.",Shabana.Khan@hotmail.co.nz,,"Khan, Shabana/0000-0002-4863-6417","New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology [VICX0805]; New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE) [VICX0805] Funding Source: New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)","New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology(New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology); New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE))","This research was in part funded by the New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology under contract VICX0805 Community Vulnerability and Resilience.

Actions on forestry, soil carbon and damaged peatlands each have the potential to reduce Scottish emissions in 2020 by hundreds of thousands of tonnes. Most actions to reduce emissions from land use have beneficial effects on other ecosystem services, so if we can cut emissions we can in many circumstances improve the environment. The cost of reducing emissions through land use change can be low in relation to other means of cutting emissions. The Scottish Land Use Strategy and the Ecosystem Approach it calls for, employing the concept of ecosystem services, offers a way of balancing environmental, social and economic demands on the land. Scotland's land, soils, forests and waters are all likely to be significantly altered by future climate change. Each of these components of the land-based environment offers opportunities for mitigation and adaptation to climate change.

This is particularly important because as populations age and new technologies come on the scene, much local knowledge is lost to newer generations. For this reason, we have systematically examined 90 societies from the ethnographic record to explore and document the strategies that people in the past have implemented in response to serious natural hazards. Our review reveals a rich diversity of coping mechanisms and contingency plans used by societies around the world in response to different hazards, particularly floods and droughts. We collect, classify, and compare different types of coping mechanisms, focusing on four major types: technological, subsistence, economic and religious. We find that most societies employ multiple types of coping mechanisms, although our data suggest that technological coping mechanisms are the most common coping mechanisms in response to fast-onset hazards, whereas religious coping mechanisms are the most common mechanism used in response to slow-onset hazards. We also find that religious and nonreligious coping strategies are not antithetical to each other. In fact, an increased number of religious coping mechanisms is associated with an increased number of practical, nonreligious coping mechanisms.","[Pierro, Rachele; Ember, Carol R.; Pitek, Emily; Skoggard, Ian] Yale Univ, Human Relat Area Files HRAF, Time Res, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Pierro, Rachele] Collect Refugee & Immigrant Womens Wellbeing CRIW, New Haven, CT USA; [Pitek, Emily] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Yale University; George Washington University,"Skoggard, I (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Human Relat Area Files HRAF, Time Res, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",IAN.SKOGGARD@YALE.EDU,,"Ember, Carol/0000-0002-8725-1691",National Science Foundation [SMA-1416651]; Human Relations Area Files,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Human Relations Area Files,"This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (SMA-1416651) with additional support from the Human Relations Area Files.

In this Review, we examine evidence from observational, theoretical and modelling studies for the intensification of these rainfall extremes, the drivers and the impact on flash flooding. Both short-duration and long-duration (>1day) rainfall extremes are intensifying with warming at a rate consistent with the increase in atmospheric moisture (similar to 7%K-1), while in some regions, increases in short-duration extreme rainfall intensities are stronger than expected from moisture increases alone. These stronger local increases are related to feedbacks in convective clouds, but their exact role is uncertain because of the very small scales involved. Future extreme rainfall intensification is also modulated by changes to temperature stratification and large-scale atmospheric circulation. The latter remains a major source of uncertainty. Intensification of short-duration extremes has likely increased the incidence of flash flooding at local scales, and this can further compound with an increase in storm spatial footprint to considerably increase total event rainfall. These findings call for urgent climate change adaptation measures to manage increasing flood risks.","[Fowler, Hayley J.; Blenkinsop, Stephen; Guerreiro, Selma; Lewis, Elizabeth] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Lenderink, Geert] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Prein, Andreas F.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res NCAR, Boulder, CO USA; [Westra, Seth] Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Allan, Richard P.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Allan, Richard P.] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Reading, Berks, England; [Ban, Nikolina] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Atmospher & Cryospher Sci, Innsbruck, Austria; [Barbero, Renaud] RECOVER, Natl Res Inst Agr Food & Environm, Aix En Provence, France; [Berg, Peter] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Hydrol Res Unit, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Do, Hong X.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Do, Hong X.] Nong Lam Univ, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Haerter, Jan O.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Haerter, Jan O.] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res, Complex & Climate, Bremen, Germany; [Haerter, Jan O.] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Phys & Earth Sci, Bremen, Germany; [Kendon, Elizabeth J.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Schaer, Christoph] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sharma, Ashish] Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Villarini, Gabriele] Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA USA; [Wasko, Conrad] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zhang, Xuebin] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Toronto, ON, Canada",Newcastle University - UK; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Adelaide; University of Reading; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Earth Observation; University of Reading; University of Innsbruck; INRAE; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Nong Lam University; University of Copenhagen; Niels Bohr Institute; Leibniz Zentrum fur Marine Tropenforschung (ZMT); Jacobs University; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Iowa; University of Melbourne; Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Fowler, HJ (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",h.j.fowler@ncl.ac.uk,"Zhang, Xuebin/ABD-7511-2021; Do, Hong/HKW-2239-2023; Allan, Richard Philip/B-5782-2008; Do, Hong/U-3268-2017; Prein, Andreas/N-4928-2017","Allan, Richard Philip/0000-0003-0264-9447; Do, Hong/0000-0001-9169-579X; Fowler, Hayley/0000-0001-8848-3606; Prein, Andreas/0000-0001-6250-179X; Ban, Nikolina/0000-0002-1672-3655","European Research Council (INTENSE) [ERC-2013-CoG-617329]; UK Natural Environment Research Council (FUTURE-STORMS) [NE/R01079X/1]; Wolfson Foundation; Royal Society through a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award [WM140025]; US National Science Foundation; Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme - UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy; Department for Environment, Food Rural Affairs [GA01101]; European Union [690462]; Villum Foundation [13168]; European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme [771859]; Novo Nordisk Foundation Interdisciplinary Synergy Program [NNF19OC0057374]; US Army Corps of Engineers' Institute for Water Resources (IWR); NERC [NE/V00378X/1, NE/S017348/1, NE/K00896X/1, NE/R01079X/1, NE/V004166/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Novo Nordisk Fonden [NNF19OC0057374] Funding Source: researchfish","European Research Council (INTENSE); UK Natural Environment Research Council (FUTURE-STORMS); Wolfson Foundation; Royal Society through a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme - UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy; Department for Environment, Food Rural Affairs(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); European Union(European Commission); Villum Foundation(Villum Fonden); European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); Novo Nordisk Foundation Interdisciplinary Synergy Program; US Army Corps of Engineers' Institute for Water Resources (IWR); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Novo Nordisk Fonden(Novo Nordisk Foundation)","H.J.F., G.L., R.B., S.B., S.G. and E.L. have been supported by the European Research Council (INTENSE; grant no.

The MD conditions, combined with intensive agricultural activities and the current water management system, have led to water scarcity problems in Mediterranean and Semi-arid regions of Chile. An emblematic case is the Petorca basin, where a water crisis is undergone. To characterize this crisis, we analyzed water provision by using tree-ring records, remote sensing, instrumental data, and allocated water rights within the basin. Results indicate that the MD is the most severe dry period over the last 700-years of streamflow reconstruction. During the MD, streamflow and water bodies of the upper parts of the basin have been less affected than mid and low areas of this valley, where consumptive withdrawals reach up to 18% of the mean annual precipitation. This extracted volume is similar to the MD mean annual precipitation deficits. The impacts of the current drought, along with the drier climate projections for Central Chile, emphasize the urgency for faster policy changes related to water provision. Climate change adaptation plans and policies should enhance the current monitoring network and the public control of water use to secure the water access for inhabitants and productive activities.","[Munoz, Ariel A.; Klock-Barria, Karin; Aguilera-Betti, Isabella; Rojas-Badilla, Moises] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Geog, Lab Dendrocronol & Estudios Ambientales, Ave Brasil 2241, Valparaiso 2390302, Chile; [Munoz, Ariel A.; Klock-Barria, Karin; Alvarez-Garreton, Camila; Christie, Duncan] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR 2, Santiago 8340589, Chile; [Alvarez-Garreton, Camila; Christie, Duncan; LeQuesne, Carlos] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Conservac Biodiversidad & Terr, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; [Aguilera-Betti, Isabella] Univ Austral Chile, Ctr Transdisciplinario Estudios Ambientales & Des, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; [Gonzalez-Reyes, Alvaro] Univ Mayor, Fac Ciencias, Hemera Ctr Observac Tierra, Escuela Ingn Forestal, Santiago 8340589, Chile; [Lastra, Jose A.; Chavez, Roberto O.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Geog, Lab Geoinformac & Percepc Remota, Valparaiso 2390302, Chile; [Barria, Pilar] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Forestales & Conservac Nat, Santiago 8340589, Chile; [Christie, Duncan; Rojas-Badilla, Moises; LeQuesne, Carlos] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Forestales & Recursos Nat, Lab Dendrocronol & Cambio Global, Valdivia 5090000, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; Universidad Austral de Chile; Universidad Austral de Chile; Universidad Mayor; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; Universidad de Chile; Universidad Austral de Chile,"Munoz, AA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Geog, Lab Dendrocronol & Estudios Ambientales, Ave Brasil 2241, Valparaiso 2390302, Chile.;Munoz, AA (corresponding author), Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR 2, Santiago 8340589, Chile.",ariel.munoz@pucv.cl; karin.klock@pucv.cl; calvarezgarreton@gmail.com; isabella.aguilera@pucv.cl; alvaro.gonzalez@umayor.cl; jose.lastra@pucv.cl; roberto.chavez@pucv.cl; pili.barria@gmail.com; duncanchristieb@gmail.com; moisese.rojasbadilla@gmail.com; carlos.lequesne@gmail.com,"Chávez, Roberto O./ABC-3608-2021; Aguilera-Betti, Isabella/AAF-6446-2019; Alvarez Garreton, Camila/M-1232-2016","Chávez, Roberto O./0000-0001-6782-3579; Aguilera-Betti, Isabella/0000-0001-5052-6033; Rojas-Badilla, Moises/0000-0002-1101-2280; Alvarez Garreton, Camila/0000-0002-5381-4863; Lastra, Jose A./0000-0002-6159-2201; Klock-Barria, Karin/0000-0001-7647-282X; Christie, Duncan/0000-0003-2540-0986","Chilean Research Council, FONDECYT [11161061, 1181956, 3170428]; Center for Climate and Resilience Research (CR)2 [FONDAP 15110009]","Chilean Research Council, FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Center for Climate and Resilience Research (CR)2","This research was funded by Chilean Research Council, FONDECYT 11161061, 1181956, 3170428 and the Center for Climate and Resilience Research (CR)2, FONDAP 15110009.",,66,42,42,8,40,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2020,12,3,,,,,,,648,10.3390/w12030648,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12030648,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,LI1MS,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000529249500033,View Full Record in Web of Science

These are journeys that occur without formal institutional support, utilising migrants' own agency. Learning from these community-driven relocations has merit in rethinking climate change adaptation at the regional level. In this paper we present stories of 17 families who have progressively relocated to the fringes of Khulna city in southwestern Bangladesh. We observe three key attributes: first, relocations are slow, neither singular nor immediately completed, but rather take months of careful back and forth journeys of family members between their places of origin and destination. Second, relocations rely on small networks of relatives and acquaintances at the destination. Third, relocations are built on shared responsibilities distributed among a range of actors in places of origin and destination. We conclude that these slow, small and shared relocations are likely to be realised as forms of ongoing adaptation by rural farmers if their aspirational mobilities, social relations and supports are maintained at a regional scale. This kind of migration as adaptation may bring about just outcomes for those displaced without necessarily promoting rigid planning interventions that tend to fix resettlement solutions in place and time.","[Alam, Ashraful] Univ Otago, Sch Geog, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Miller, Fiona] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Otago; Macquarie University,"Alam, A (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Sch Geog, Dunedin, New Zealand.",ash.alam@otago.ac.nz; fiona.miller@mq.edu.au,,"Alam, Ashraful/0000-0001-6529-4423; Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4427-6466",,,,,59,8,8,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1360-7456,1467-8373,,ASIA PAC VIEWP,Asia Pac.

In the present review paper, after outlining a process-based perspective, we examine observed and projected changes in flood hazard. Spatial and temporal variability of large floods is analyzed, based on a time series of flood information, collected by the Dartmouth Flood Observatory in 1985-2016. Model-based projections of future flood hazard are critically reviewed. It is difficult to disentangle the climatic change component from strong natural variability and direct human impacts. The climate change impact on flood hazard is complex and depends on the river flood generation mechanism. It has not been possible to detect ubiquitous changes in flood characteristics in observation records in Europe, so far. However, we found an increasing tendency in the number of floods with large magnitude and severity, even if year-to-year variability is strong. There is a considerable spread of river flood hazard projections in Europe among studies, carried out under different assumptions. Therefore, caution must be exerted by practitioners in charge of climate change adaptation, flood risk reduction, risk insurance, and water resources management when accommodating information on flood hazard projections, under considerable uncertainty.","[Kundzewicz, Zbigniew W.; Pinskwar, Iwona] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Agr & Forest Environm, Poznan, Poland; [Brakenridge, G.

Countries in West Africa, which are heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture, are projected to experience more frequent and intense droughts, altered rainfall patterns and increases in temperature through the end of this century. Changes in hydrology and temperature are likely to affect crop yields, thereby placing pressure on scarce resources in a region that is characterised by limited social, political, technical and financial resources. The success with which communities cope with the impacts of climate change is influenced by existing conditions, forces and characteristics which are peculiar to each of these communities. This paper assesses the preferred adaptation strategies during floods and droughts of males and females in three different occupations (farming, fishing, and charcoal production). Findings are based upon an analysis of focus group discussions and a ranking of preferred adaptation options in three communities in the Afram Plains of Ghana. Assessments of this nature should aid in the selection and implementation of adaptation options for communities and households, which is the level at which climate change adaptation is likely to occur in West Africa.","[Codjoe, Samuel Nii Ardey; Atidoh, Lucy Kafui] Univ Ghana, Reg Inst Populat Studies, Legon, Ghana; [Burkett, Virginia] US Geol Survey, Many, LA 71449 USA",University of Ghana; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Codjoe, SNA (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Reg Inst Populat Studies, POB LG 96, Legon, Ghana.",scodjoe@ug.edu.gh; lucyatidoh@yahoo.com; virginia_burkett@usgs.gov,,,United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) [CCP 07 08]; Climate Change and Learning Observatory Network in Ghana [EEM-A-00-66-00014]; United States Agency for International Development,United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR); Climate Change and Learning Observatory Network in Ghana; United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"We are grateful to the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) for providing funds for the Food Security and Adaptation to Climate Change in the Afram Plains Project (# CCP 07 08).

Still, the variations that exist among participatory approaches and the merits and tradeoffs associated with each are not well understood. This article examines the experiences of Quito (Ecuador) and Surat (India) to assess how civil society actors contribute to adaptation planning and implementation. The results showcase two distinct approaches to public engagement. The first emphasizes participation of experts, affected communities, and a wide array of citizens to sustain broadly inclusive programmes that incorporate local needs and concerns into adaptation processes and outcomes. The second approach focuses on building targeted partnerships between key government, private, and civil society actors to institutionalize robust decision-making structures, enhance abilities to raise funds, and increase means to directly engage with local community and international actors. A critical analysis of these approaches suggests more inclusive planning processes correspond to higher climate equity and justice outcomes in the short term, but the results also indicate that an emphasis on building dedicated multi-sector governance institutions may enhance long-term programme stability, while ensuring that diverse civil society actors have an ongoing voice in climate adaptation planning and implementation. Policy relevance Many local governments in the Global South experience severe capacity and resource constraints. Cities are often required to devolve large-scale planning and decision-making responsibilities, such as those critical to climate adaptation, to different civil society actors. As a result, there needs to be more rigorous assessments of how civil society participation contributes to the adaptation policy and planning process and what local social, political, and economic factors dictate the way cities select different approaches to public engagement. Also, since social equity and justice are key indicators for determining the effectiveness and sustainability of adaptation interventions, urban adaptation plans and policies must also be designed according to local institutional strengths and civic capacities in order to account for the needs of the poor and most vulnerable. Inclusivity, therefore, is critical for ensuring equitable planning processes and just adaptation outcomes.","[Chu, Eric; Carmin, JoAnn] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Anguelovski, Isabelle] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Chu, E (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",ekc@mit.edu,"Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615; Anguelovski, Isabelle/0000-0002-6409-5155",United States National Science Foundation [0926349]; United States National Security Education Program,United States National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); United States National Security Education Program,Fieldwork for the Quito case was initially support by the World Bank.

The growing demand for climate adaptability calls for the development of normative criteria for the design of forms of urban settings that integrate vegetation. Climate-responsive urban design reacts to the challenges of urban physics, which depend heavily on the forms of urban structures and the role of greenery. This method includes research on vegetation indexes and their impact on urban regulatory functions. The goal is to propose a comprehensive framework for assessing the functioning of urban public space, which considers the role and maintenance of green infrastructure. The intersection with the subject matter of analytical urban morphology is evident, in terms of the resolution of the urban fabric and its transformations over time. The framework of climate-responsive urban design also covers examining the parameters of surrounding built structures, such as the floor area ratio, the building coverage ratio, and building heights. In particular, the requirements of climate adaptation have an impact on the design of outdoor spaces in cities. In this article, we apply the selected methods that contribute to the climate-responsive urban design model to recommend the transformations of two urban nodes, in Lodz and Warsaw (Poland). Our goal is to indicate the future form of nodal public spaces with a focus on the needs of urban greenery, and to determine indicators for the local climate zone. After an initial literature review, we discuss a number of available indicators from the perspective of how they might contribute to determine the environmental conditions. We focus on urban water cycle, the requirement of trees for water, and insolation conditions.","[Hanzl, Malgorzata] Lodz Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn Architecture & Environm Engn, Lodz, Poland; [Tofiluk, Anna; Zinowiec-Cieplik, Kinga; Grochulska-Salak, Magdalena; Nowak, Anna] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, Warsaw, Poland",Lodz University of Technology; Warsaw University of Technology,"Hanzl, M (corresponding author), Lodz Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn Architecture & Environm Engn, Lodz, Poland.",malgorzata.hanzl@p.lodz.pl; anna.tofiluk@pw.edu.pl; kinga.cieplik@pw.edu.pl; magdalena.salak@pw.edu.pl; anna.nowak@pw.edu.pl,,"Grochulska-Salak, Magdalena/0000-0001-6790-984X; Hanzl, Malgorzata/0000-0003-2495-5867; Tofiluk, Anna/0000-0002-5082-6746",Faculty of Architecture of the Warsaw University of Technology,Faculty of Architecture of the Warsaw University of Technology,We express our thanks to the referees on the initial draft of this article.

Design/methodology/approach - By developing an in-depth case study using methods of organizational ethnography, the research traces phases of climate adaptation planning and implementation in Cape Town. Applied thematic analysis surfaces issues of coordination, decision-making, resource constraints and tracking progress as key constraints to urban climate adaptation. Findings - While considerable progress has been made on developing a citywide climate adaptation plan for Cape Town, implementation is constrained by poor monitoring and feedback within and between departments and a lack of oversight and impetus from central authorities within the government hierarchy. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed on the interface between technical and political decision-making, governance arrangements that facilitate coordination and iterative adjustment and the organizational uptake of externally commissioned work on climate adaptation. Practical implications - The paper points to the need for a climate adaptation coordination function situated higher up in the municipal government structure than the environment department to implement, monitor, evaluate and revise measures to reduce climate risks and vulnerabilities citywide. Originality/value - The paper is of value to those seeking to understand local government decision-making, as it pertains to climate adaptation and those looking for means to address climate risks and vulnerabilities in cities, especially in South Africa.","[Taylor, Anna] Univ Cape Town, African Ctr Cities, Environm & Geog Sci Dept, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Taylor, A (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Ctr Cities, Environm & Geog Sci Dept, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.",anna.taylor@uct.ac.za,"Taylor, Anna/GYU-1386-2022",,"Mistra Urban Futures, a global research and knowledge center in sustainable urban development; Swedish International Development Agenday (SIDA); Mistra Foundation for Strategic Development","Mistra Urban Futures, a global research and knowledge center in sustainable urban development; Swedish International Development Agenday (SIDA); Mistra Foundation for Strategic Development","This work was supported by Mistra Urban Futures, a global research and knowledge center in sustainable urban development, funded by the Swedish International Development Agenday (SIDA) and the Mistra Foundation for Strategic Development.

However, efforts to secure recognition of these special circumstances of African countries within the UN climate negotiations have been unsuccessful, despite this being a continental priority prior to and following adoption of the Paris Agreement. Such status is linked to global priorities for funding adaptation to climate change. This article explores why some other groups of developing countries have been successful in securing such recognition when African countries have not. It provides a historical institutionalist explanation of the path-dependent politics of such institutional recognition, emphasising the timing of when different groups have advanced vulnerability claims, which shapes the opposition that African countries have encountered in their efforts, as relative late-movers, to exercise agency. It highlights contestation surrounding what vulnerability to climate impacts means, and how this contestation has divided Global South solidarity.","[Chan, Nicholas] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia",Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Chan, N (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Malaysia Campus,Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 46150, Malaysia.",nickchan@hotmail.com,,"Chan, Nicholas/0000-0002-7386-6724","School of Arts and Social Sciences, Monash University, Malaysia","School of Arts and Social Sciences, Monash University, Malaysia","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: A version of this article was presented at the International Studies Association International Conference in Accra, Ghana, in August 2019.

There are multiple reasons for differences in projections, including uncertainties in greenhouse gas emissions and patterns of climate change; assumptions on future management, aggregation, and spatial extent; and methodological differences. Still, all projections agree that climate change poses a significant risk to African agriculture. Most projections also see the possibility of increasing agricultural production under climate change, especially if suitable adaptation measures are assumed. Climate change is not the only projected pressure on African agriculture, which struggles to meet demand today and may need to feed an additional one billion individuals by 2050. Development strategies are urgently needed, but they will need to consider future climate change and its inherent uncertainties.

Innovative and effective approaches, such as Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA), are required to alleviate these environmental pressures without hampering efficiency. In countries with unequal distribution of land, where issues of access to and use of land rank high on the policy agenda, policymakers are confronted with the challenge of implementing interventions such as land reforms, whilst endeavouring to ensure that sustainable agriculture approaches be adopted by farm-households. The aim of this study is to investigate how land reforms can provide an opportunity for policymakers, particularly in lower-income countries, to enhance not only equity and efficiency but also environmental sustainability. In particular, this study builds on an extensive review of the theoretical and empirical literature and employs a conceptual framework analysis method to develop and describe a framework that explores how land reforms can be associated with the CSA approach. The resultant Climate Smart Land Reform (CSLR) framework contains four driving pillars, namely land redistribution, tenure reform, rural advisory services and markets and infrastructure. The framework disentangles relevant channels through which land reform, via its four pillars, can foster CSA adoption and thus contribute to the attainment of sustainable increases in agricultural productivity, climate change adaptation and climate change mitigation. The framework also includes relevant channels through which more 'traditional' objectives of land reformers, including economic, social and political objectives, can be achieved. In turn, the (partial) attainment of such objectives would lead to improvements in agroecological and socioeconomic conditions of rural areas and populations. These improvements are considered within the framework as the 'ultimate' objective of land reformers. The CSLR framework represents an innovative way of conceptualising how land reforms can generate beneficial effects not only in terms of equity and efficiency but also of environmental sustainability.","[Rampa, Alexis; Gadanakis, Yiorgos; Rose, Gillian] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Earley Gate,Whiteknights Rd, Reading RG6 6EU, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Rampa, A (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Earley Gate,Whiteknights Rd, Reading RG6 6EU, Berks, England.",alexis.rampa@pgr.reading.ac.uk; g.gadanakis@reading.ac.uk; g.rose@reading.ac.uk,"Gadanakis, Yiorgos/AGU-0342-2022","Gadanakis, Yiorgos/0000-0001-7441-970X",University of Reading,University of Reading,"The APC was funded by The University of Reading.

Particularly, vulnerable groups are hit harder by heat waves. A gender-sensitive perspective has not been taken into account sufficiently in scientific studies on climate change and health. This study examined the health impact of extreme heat events from a gender-sensitive perspective and measured gender-specific individual behavioural adaptation and mitigation strategies. A cross-sectional population survey was done in Leipzig, Germany, from July to October 2014. The survey was used to determine the relationship between the influencing factors such as gender, adaptive and mitigation measures and the health burden resulting from extreme heat waves. Gender-specific differences were found for type of income, personal net income and individuals who are strongly affected by persistent heat. A significant gender difference was also found for headaches, cardiovascular diseases, different climate adaptation measures and types of mitigating behaviour. These findings confirm other study results and indicate the need for further studies on gender and diversity aspects which take into account sociodemographic, socioeconomic and climate ecological differences.

Here, we analyze the frequency of fire and its influence on postfire forest trajectories between 2001 and 2018. We account for similar to 1.1% of Latin American forests burnt in 2002-2003 (8,465,850 ha). Although 40.1% of forests (3,393,250 ha) burned only once, by 2018, similar to 48% of the evergreen forests converted to other, primarily grass-dominated uses. While greater fire frequency yielded more transformation, our results reveal the staggering impact of even a single fire. Increasing fire frequency imposes greater risks of irreversible forest loss, transforming forests into ecosystems increasingly vulnerable to degradation. Reversing this trend is indispensable to both mitigate and adapt to climate change globally. As climate change transforms fire regimes across the region, key actions are needed to conserve Latin American forests.","[Armenteras, Dolors; Barreto, Joan S.; Gonzalez-Delgado, Tania M.; Meza-Elizalde, Maria C.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Lab Ecol Paisaje & Modelac Ecosistemas ECOLMOD, Bogota, Colombia; [Davalos, Liliana M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 630 Life Sci Bldg, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Davalos, Liliana M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Consortium Interdisciplinary Environm Res, 129 Dana Hall, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Miranda, Alejandro; Zamorano-Elgueta, Carlos] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR2, Santiago, Chile; [Miranda, Alejandro] Univ La Frontera, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Lab Ecol Paisaje & Conservac, Temco, Chile; [Hernandez-Moreno, Angela] Ctr Invest Ecosistemas Patagonia CIEP, Camino Baguales S-N,Km 4, Coyhaique, Chile; [Zamorano-Elgueta, Carlos] Univ Aysen, Dept Ciencias Nat & Tecnol, Coyhaique, Chile; [Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF, Barcelona 08193, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Universidad de La Frontera; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); University of Barcelona,"Armenteras, D (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Lab Ecol Paisaje & Modelac Ecosistemas ECOLMOD, Bogota, Colombia.",darmenterasp@unal.edu.co,"Gonzalez, Tania Marisol/AAD-4882-2022; Armenteras, Dolors/A-4000-2010","Gonzalez, Tania Marisol/0000-0002-9083-8637; Armenteras, Dolors/0000-0003-0922-7298; Miranda, Alejandro/0000-0002-8211-0179; Zamorano-Elgueta, Carlos/0000-0002-5588-3248; Hernandez-Moreno, Angela/0000-0001-5433-096X; Meza Elizalde, Maria Contanza/0000-0002-9833-2980; Davalos, Liliana/0000-0002-4327-7697; Barreto, Sebastian/0000-0003-4895-0067","NAS [2000007526, 2000010972]; Chilean National of Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT) [REDI170329]; NSF-DGE [1633299]",NAS; Chilean National of Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT); NSF-DGE(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),NAS Subaward Letters nos. 2000007526 and 2000010972 awarded to D.A.

Our analysis of the circulation and precipitation shows significant local improvement in three aspects: 1) The Gibbs oscillations present in the cloudiness and shortwave radiative forcing fields in the spectral simulation are absent in the FV simulation. 2) The along-shore component of wind stress in the western coastal regions of North and South America increases in the FV simulation. This tends to reduce the persistent biases in sea surface temperature through enhanced oceanic upwelling. 3) The FV simulation shows improvement in the wet-dry contrast of orographically forced precipitation.

Drawing on approaches suggested by multi-level governance and learning literature, this paper seeks to fill this knowledge gap by focusing on the ways in which the UNFCCC multilateral process enables multi-level learning for the governance of adaptation and how it could be enhanced. This will be accomplished through a legal-technical analysis of the enabling factors of multi-level learning in the governance of adaptation under the UNFCCC. Qualitative research methods have been applied for the thematic analysis of selected documentation, complemented by interviews and personal observations of adaptation negotiations in the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. Results are presented according to three research questions oriented to understand how institutional design of adaptation under the UNFCCC enables multi-level learning; the learning strategies adopted across levels of governance; and the way the UNFCCC regime understands the contribution of multi-level learning for adaptation outcomes.","[Gonzales-Iwanciw, Javier; Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen, Sylvia; Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Gonzales-Iwanciw, Javier] Univ Nur, Inst Invest Cient & Social, Santa Cruz, Bolivia",Wageningen University & Research,"Gonzales-Iwanciw, J (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Gonzales-Iwanciw, J (corresponding author), Univ Nur, Inst Invest Cient & Social, Santa Cruz, Bolivia.",jgonzales@nur.edu,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

A successful integration of such bodies of knowledge demands a systematic understanding of UF-NBS. To achieve such an understanding, this paper presents a conceptual UF-NBS model obtained through a semantic, trait-based modelling approach. This conceptual model is subsequently implemented as an extendible, re-usable and interoperable ontology. In so doing, a formal, trait-based vocabulary on UF-NBS is created, that allows expressing spatial, morphological, physical, functional, and institutional UF-NBS properties for their typification and a subsequent integration of further knowledge and data.

However, these systems significantly altered their respective hydrological regimes, often creating worse socio-ecological conditions and greater vulnerability to floods and seawater intrusion than existed previously. Despite this history of disaster experience, climate change adaptation measures in the Ganges-Brahmaputra and Mekong Deltas use contemporary socio-ecological conditions as the baseline for disaster mitigation efforts. Paradoxically relying on old approaches to address future climate threats, disaster planners overlook how current conditions in both deltas are unstable outcomes of historical processes. These cases illustrate that large-scale and capital-intensive climate responses may fail to measurably reduce disaster risk. The concept of shifting baselines, borrowed from fisheries science, becomes helpful for selecting more appropriate reference points for disaster mitigation than current conditions.","[Thomas, Kimberley Anh] Temple Univ, Dept Geog & Urban Studies, 1115 Polett Walk,308 Gladfelter Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Thomas, KA (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Geog & Urban Studies, 1115 Polett Walk,308 Gladfelter Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",kimthomas@temple.edu,,"Thomas, Kimberley/0000-0002-9600-385X",,,,,41,3,3,1,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Within this context it is illustrated using three case studies how development policy indicators in practice can be used to assess climate change impacts and adaptation measures based on three case studies, namely a road project in flood prone areas of Mozambique, rainwater harvesting in the agricultural sector in Tanzania and malaria protection in Tanzania.

This paper highlights the disconnect between how planners and academics are approaching the task of planning and managing the urban forest for climate change adaptation. Although planners tend to focus on maximizing canopy coverage, academics utilize microclimate simulation to evaluate the impact of different interventions on heat island mitigation. We argue that while the i-Tree suite is the most commonly used tool and is immensely helpful for urban forest planners, cities and communities concerned with heat island mitigation should also leverage microclimate simulation tools to better understand the likely impacts of a plan. This study provides a general critique of the i-Tree tool for planning and illustrates how, when used with a microclimate simulation tool, the siting of street trees can have a greater impact on heat island mitigation. The focus here is on the community-scale impact of trees and a microclimate simulation model of a neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois where tree canopy coverage is less than 10% and consistently declining is presented. We find that when microclimate is considered during the tree siting process, trees have a greater impact on surface and air temperatures during the summer. Reduced ground surface temperatures of around 3 degrees C to 7.5 degrees C were achieved around 13:00 (1:00 pm), whereas the impact of trees from shading had the greatest impact (0.75 degrees C to 7.75 degrees C) on nearby buildings in the mid-afternoon (15:00 to 17:00 h).","[Petri, Aaron C.; Wilson, Bev] Univ Illinois, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, 111 Temple Buell Hall,MC 619,611 Lorado Taft Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Koeser, Andrew] Univ Florida, Gulf Coast Res & Educ Ctr, IFAS, Dept Environm Hort,CLCE, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Petri, AC (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, 111 Temple Buell Hall,MC 619,611 Lorado Taft Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",petri@illinois.edu; bevwilso@illinois.edu; akoeser@ufl.edu,,"Wilson, Bev/0000-0003-3892-456X",,,,,56,15,16,1,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,NOV,2019,88,,,,,,,,104117,10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104117,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104117,,,14,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JK5MF,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000494886800030,View Full Record in Web of Science

The goal of this study is to compare approaches and results of our own ecohydrological zonation and standardized LCZ delimiting in the city of Pilsen. Both methodological approaches differ in input data, resolution details and parameters used. The results showed that the areas of the individual LCZ classes show different levels of ecohydrological qualities. Internal heterogeneity of LCZ classes demonstrated by variance of ecohydrological parameters' values can be partly explained by different techniques and data sources for delimitation of both zonations, but by different sets of delimitation criteria.

The increasing transference of capital from governmental control to private hands, and the increasing concentration of such capital into the hands of fewer individuals raises further concerns about capacity to mitigate or adapt to climate change. In addition, conflicts arise regarding the choice of climate change solutions. Ironically, the people of the Fateful Ellipse, who are most vulnerable to climate change, produce the lowest amount of carbon per capita. As a result of the colonial enterprise, including slavery, they also paid a heavy price toward the economic ascendency of Europe and North America and the Industrial Revolution that fueled the rise in greenhouse gas production.

Heat wave risk provides a typical example: air conditioning (AC) equipment may trigger large energy consumption and worsen outdoor heat stress. Alternative adaptation strategies exist, but it is not clear whether they can prevent the massive use of AC. Here, with an interdisciplinary modeling platform, taking Paris as a case study, we provide a first quantified analysis of the efficiency of adaptation strategies (large scale urban greening, building insulation policy, and generalized behavioral changes in AC use) in reducing future potential AC need. We find that even ambitious strategies do not appear sufficient to totally replace AC and ensure thermal comfort, under a median climate change scenario. They can, however, reduce AC energy use by half during heat waves and compensate for the heat released to the outdoor environment. Our results show that adaptation actions, implemented early, may play a key role if we are to remain on a low-carbon pathway.","[Viguie, Vincent] Ecole Ponts ParisTech, CIRED, Site Jardin Trop,45Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Lemonsu, Aude; Beaulant, Anne-Lise; Marchadier, Colette; Masson, Valery; Pigeon, Gregoire] CNRM, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France; [Hallegatte, Stephane] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Salagnac, Jean-Luc] Ctr Sci & Tech Batiment, Vincennes, France",AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; The World Bank,"Viguie, V (corresponding author), Ecole Ponts ParisTech, CIRED, Site Jardin Trop,45Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",viguie@centre-cired.fr,,,"French Agence Nationale de la Rercherchemg,vb [ANR-08-VULN-013, ANR09-VILL-0003, ANR-14-CE22-0013-03, ANR-14-ORAR-0005]","French Agence Nationale de la Rercherchemg,vb(French National Research Agency (ANR))","This study received funding from the French Agence Nationale de la Rercherche through the projects VURCA (ANR-08-VULN-013), MUSCADE (ANR09-VILL-0003), VITE (ANR-14-CE22-0013-03) and DRAGON (ANR-14-ORAR-0005).

It further examines if market values disaggregated measure of sustainability, that is, environmental performance differently from others. Results of the study are consistent with the theoretical work suggesting that green investing is reflected in demand differences between green and nongreen stocks. It also establishes a link between alpha's and green investing. The results show that all green portfolios outperformed market at 1% significance level over 12-year period and various subperiods.

The paper analyses emerging policy narratives about climate change and agriculture that are stimulating, shaping and influencing these debates. The motivation for this paper draws from an increasing number of government and non-government actors involved in climate change debates on agriculture with different starting points, narratives and goals. Based on extensive empirical data, the paper argues that prevailing narratives on climate change and agriculture in Malawi shape policy discussions and interventions that are implemented in both complementing and competing ways. Interests held by actors determine the policy trajectory in that where interests are colliding, policy interventions are competitive. Complementing policy interventions emerge where common interests exist among policy stakeholders. This is demonstrated by programmes that undermine ability of smallholder farmers to adapt to climate change whilst others advocate for crop diversification and agricultural subsidies. The paper concludes that policies and programme activities are framed in diverse way depending on how climate change and agriculture issues are perceived and narrated as well as how power is exercised among different players, mainly, policymakers, donors and civil society organizations.","[Chinsinga, Blessings] Univ Malawi, Chancellor Coll, Ctr Social Res, Zomba, Malawi; [Chinsinga, Blessings; Chasukwa, Michael] Univ Malawi, Chancellor Coll, Dept Polit & Adm Studies, Zomba, Malawi; [Chasukwa, Michael] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Malawi; University of Malawi; University of Leeds,"Chasukwa, M (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Chasukwa, M (corresponding author), Univ Malawi, Dept Polit & Adm Studies, Zomba, Malawi.",mmchasukwa@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,35,7,7,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0974-4053,0974-4061,,AFR REV-ABINGDON,Afr.

We believe that relevant policies for adapting to climate change can be initiated at this level. Thus, this article assesses the adaptive capacity of Mexican municipalities and populations to address climate change to measure the challenge that climate change represents. The method was developed as follows. We selected 19 indicators organized into four categories: human, social, financial, and natural. The information was standardized, and we used empirical formulas to obtain an adaptive capacity index. The index was mapped, and the distribution showed the spatial capacity for the adaptation of Mexican municipalities. We discuss the contributions these indicators made to the adaptive capacity and show that the human capital variables were the most relevant for defining the adaptive capacity of municipalities. We also applied this index to the observed climate exposure and sensitivity of Mexican municipalities to climate change. Thus, we propose a matrix to measure the dimensions of the challenges posed by climate change in terms of both decision-making and policy management for increasing the adaptive capacity of municipalities and populations within a nation.","[Monterroso, Alejandro] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Dept Suelos, Texcoco, Mexico; [Conde, Cecilia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Atmosfera, Coyoacan, Mexico; [Conde, Cecilia] Inst Nacl Ecol & Cambio Climat, Coordinac Gen Adaptac Cambio Climat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico,"Monterroso, A (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Dept Suelos, Texcoco, Mexico.",aimrivas@gmail.com,"Conde, Cecilia/R-1621-2018; Monterroso Rivas, Alejandro Ismael/GRE-7561-2022; Rivas, Alejandro Ismael Monterroso/ABB-3809-2020","Rivas, Alejandro Ismael Monterroso/0000-0003-4348-8918",Government of Mexico by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) [233663]; Departamento de Suelos at the Universidad Autonoma Chapingo [17019-EI]; CIRENAM at the Universidad Autonoma Chapingo [17019-EI]; Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Instituto Nacional de Ecologia y Cambio Climatico (INECC),Government of Mexico by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Departamento de Suelos at the Universidad Autonoma Chapingo; CIRENAM at the Universidad Autonoma Chapingo; Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Instituto Nacional de Ecologia y Cambio Climatico (INECC),"Support for this research was provided by the Government of Mexico by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT funding) [233663].

While these provide quantitative evidence on climate trends and the likely effects thereof, they incorporate limited qualitative analysis of farmers' perceptions of climate change and/or variability. The present study builds on the quantitative methods used elsewhere to analyze climate trends, and in addition compares local narratives of climate change with evidence found in meteorological records in Zambia. Farmers offer remarkably consistent reports of a rainy season that is growing shorter and less predictable. For some climate parameters-notably, rising average temperature-there is a clear overlap between farmers' observations and patterns found in the meteorological records. However, the data do not support the perception that the rainy season used to begin earlier, and we generally do not detect a reported increase in the frequency of dry spells. Several explanations for these discrepancies are offered. Further, we provide policy recommendations to help farmers adapt to climate change/variability, as well as suggestions to shape future climate change policies, programs, and research in developing countries.","[Mulenga, Brian P.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Wineman, Ayala; Sitko, Nicholas J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Michigan State University,"Mulenga, BP (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",pingulani@yahoo.com,,,"United States Aid for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Food Security [AIDOAA-LA-11-00010, CDG-A-00-02-00021-00]",United States Aid for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Food Security(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the United States Aid for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Food Security (Associate Award AIDOAA-LA-11-00010 under Food Security III, CDG-A-00-02-00021-00).

However, in spite of considerable international press, there is still little evidence to substantiate this claim. This study proposes a method through which the cost-effectiveness of EbA strategies can be evaluated against alternative adaptation options, and contributes to South African literature on the subject. The potential cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration is assessed as a means of securing the carrying capacity of land for pastoralist communities of the Kamiesberg communal area in South Africa under projected future climate conditions. The conventional alternatives would be to respond to increasingly dry conditions by drilling boreholes and using supplemental feed for livestock. It was assumed that the EbA interventions would occur upfront, whereas the alternatives are more likely to be implemented in reaction to droughts over a longer time period. The study found the implementation of conventional alternatives to be more cost-effective than EbA as a means to sustaining livestock stocking rates, with EbA being twice as costly. However, this is framed from the perspective of those directly affected (the landowners), and does not include the benefits to broader society.","[Black, David; Turpie, Jane K.] Univ Cape Town, Environm Econ Policy Res Unit EPRU, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Rao, Nalini] Conservat Int, Arlington, VA 22202 USA",University of Cape Town; Conservation International,"Black, D (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Environm Econ Policy Res Unit EPRU, Rondebosch, South Africa.",,,"Turpie, Jane/0000-0003-1220-6295",,,,,34,4,5,1,12,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Besides, the research has benefitted from secondary sources like research reports, online publications, scientific journals, international reports, books and journal articles. Findings The findings reveal that in Ethiopia, there is no national climate change-specific policy and legislation. Although there are scattered sectoral climate-related policies and strategies, they are not consistent with the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Originality/value This study argues that having comprehensive specific climate change policy and legislative frameworks consistent with UNFCCC guiding principles could help to mitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change in the country.","[Bisare Bitire, Bilate] Arba Minch Univ, Sch Law, Arba Minch, Ethiopia",Arba Minch University,"Bitire, BB (corresponding author), Arba Minch Univ, Sch Law, Arba Minch, Ethiopia.",bilatebisare3@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,0,0,5,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

The difference in warming is a result of a stronger climate response to external forcing in China. Global warming exhibits distinct differences at continental scales, yet whether models capture these differences is unclear. Here, we show that Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models underestimate warming unevenness for China and the United States, possibly leading to a biased estimation of anthropogenic influence on warming over the two regions. Observational records suggest that the surface air temperature warming trends over China are 1.53 +/- 0.10 and 1.38 +/- 0.12 times those of the United States for 1900-2017 and 1951-2017, respectively. We find that surface air temperature changes over China seem more sensitive to external forcing owing to stronger long-range persistence, leading to substantially different warming trends between China and the United States. Our study provides insight into the drivers of contemporary climate warming that could help in devising climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies for the future.","[Li, Qingxiang; Sheng, Bosi; Huang, Jiaying; Song, Zhaoyang; Chao, Liya; Sun, Wenbin; Yang, Yang; Jiao, Boyang; Guo, Ziyou; Liao, Longshi; Li, Xuqian; Sun, Chenglong; Li, Wen; Dong, Wenjie] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Minist Educ, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Qingxiang; Sheng, Bosi; Huang, Jiaying; Song, Zhaoyang; Chao, Liya; Sun, Wenbin; Yang, Yang; Jiao, Boyang; Guo, Ziyou; Liao, Longshi; Li, Xuqian; Sun, Chenglong; Li, Wen; Dong, Wenjie] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Key Lab Trop Atmosphere Ocean Syst, Minist Educ, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Qingxiang; Song, Zhaoyang; Dong, Wenjie] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Chao] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geosci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Boyin] NOAA, Natl Ctr Environm Informat, Asheville, NC USA; [Jones, Phil] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Climat Res Unit, Norwich, Norfolk, England",Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; East China Normal University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of East Anglia,"Li, QX (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Minist Educ, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Li, QX (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Key Lab Trop Atmosphere Ocean Syst, Minist Educ, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Li, QX (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.",liqingx5@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"; Li, Qingxiang/G-3834-2013","Chao, Liya/0000-0002-8192-2271; Li, Qingxiang/0000-0002-1424-4108","Natural Science Foundation of China [41975105]; National Key R&D Programs of China [2018YFC1507705, 2017YFC1502301]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Programs of China,"This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41975105, to Q.L.) and the National Key R&D Programs of China (grant nos. 2018YFC1507705 and 2017YFC1502301, to Q.L.).",,78,2,2,24,67,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

We surveyed planners and reviewed more than 150 plans to determine how communities responded to the state mandate along three domains: planning intelligence, SLR responses, and collaboration. We learned that the mandate spurred SLR planning, but that local SLR planning responses varied widely, ranging from complacent compliance to progressive planning responses. Further research is needed to clarify underlying motivators for these varied responses, as well as connections between policy adoption and implementation. Takeaway for practice Flexible mandates allow for discretion in how localities respond to complex, ever-changing, long-term, and uncertain phenomena like climate change and SLR. Commitment to addressing these challenges can be bolstered by state mandates that provide political cover and an impetus to move adaptation planning forward. Such flexibility can lead to inconsistent and vague policies. Thus, mandates can spur local policy adoption but cannot ensure substantive responses to climate change.

Yet, they are not passive victims; local-level programs are being implemented across the region to maintain livelihoods and promote adaptation. At the same time, there is a recent call within global governance literature to pay attention to how global policy is implemented and affecting people on the ground. Thinking about these two processes, we ask the question: (how) can global governance assist northern Indigenous communities in Canada in reaching their goals of adapting their food systems to climate change? To answer this question, we argue for a community needs approach when engaging in global governance literature and practice, which puts community priorities and decision-making first. As part of a collaborative research partnership, we highlight the experiences of Ka'a'gee Tu First Nation, located in Kakisa, NWT, Canada. We include their successes of engaging in global network building and the systemic roadblock of lack of formal land tenure. Moreover, we analyze potential opportunities for this community to engage with global governance instruments and continue connecting to global networks that further their goals related to climate change adaptation and food sovereignty.","[Johnston, Carla] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada; [Spring, Andrew] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Laurier Ctr Sustainable Food Syst, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada",University of Waterloo; Wilfrid Laurier University; Wilfrid Laurier University,"Spring, A (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Laurier Ctr Sustainable Food Syst, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada.",cjohnston@balsillieschool.ca; aspring@wlu.ca,,"Spring, Andrew/0000-0001-8524-8926; Johnston, Carla/0000-0003-0509-4889",Social Science and Humanities Research Council [895-2015-1016]; Government of Canada's Climate Change Health Adaptation Program and Climate Change Preparedness in the North Program,Social Science and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Government of Canada's Climate Change Health Adaptation Program and Climate Change Preparedness in the North Program,This research was funded by Social Science and Humanities Research Council (#895-2015-1016) and through the Government of Canada's Climate Change Health Adaptation Program and Climate Change Preparedness in the North Program.,,110,2,2,3,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,4,,,,,,,2415,10.3390/su13042415,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13042415,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QQ8QY,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000624785300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, few cross-national studies provide evidence of conditional scarcity-conflict relationships. This analysis of drought severity and civil conflict onset in sub-Saharan Africa (1962-2006) uncovers three sociopolitical conditions that influence the link between environmental scarcity and civil conflict: social vulnerability, state capacity, and unequal distribution of resources. Surprisingly, we find drought does not exacerbate the high risk of conflict in the vulnerable, incapable, and unequal states thought to be especially susceptible to increased scarcity. Instead, drought negates the peace-favoring attributes of stable states with less vulnerable populations. During severe drought, states with sociopolitical conditions that would otherwise favor peace are no less likely to suffer conflict than states with sociopolitical conditions that would otherwise increase the risk of violence. These findings, which are robust across several measures of these sociopolitical concepts, suggest environmental scarcity is most likely to increase the risk of conflict where populations have more to lose relative to periods with more favorable weather.","[Bell, Curtis] One Earth Future Fdn, Broomfield, CO 80021 USA; [Keys, Patrick W.] Keys Consulting Inc, Sacramento, CA USA; [Keys, Patrick W.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Bell, C (corresponding author), One Earth Future Fdn, Broomfield, CO 80021 USA.",,"Keys, Patrick/AAK-1359-2021","Keys, Patrick/0000-0002-7250-1563",,,,,100,10,10,3,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1743-8586,1743-8594,,FOREIGN POL ANAL-US,Foreign Policy Anal.,JAN,2018,14,1,,,,,1,23,,10.1093/fpa/orw002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/fpa/orw002,,,23,International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations,GW9TN,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000447345600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To tide over data uncertainty, a detection-produced dataset is utilized as a homogeneous dataset with five available best track datasets. Typhoon experienced interdecadal changes around the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s in their genesis conditions. Even under the oceanic warm state, typhoon frequency has decreased since the mid-1990s, showing a northwestward movement of its genesis location over the main formation region. The eastward gradient of vertical wind shear is the most significant factor for the change in typhoon genesis condition in recent decades. The vertical wind shear behavior is strongly linked with zonal asymmetry of local SST. We demonstrate that a westward gradient of local SST is the most important modulator of the recent typhoon behavior through the movement of favorable genesis location. The present results indicate that the horizontal distribution, not magnitude, of local SST can be a key factor for prediction of future typhoon activity, thus contributing to natural disaster mitigation and climate change adaptation strategies.","[Choi, Yumi; Ha, Kyung-Ja] Pusan Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst, Busan 609735, South Korea; [Ho, Chang-i] Seoul Natl Univ, Climate Phys Lab, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Chung, Chul Eddy] Univ Nevada, Desert Res Inst, Div Atmospher Sci, Reno, NV 89506 USA",Pusan National University; Seoul National University (SNU); Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE; University of Nevada Reno,"Ha, KJ (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst, Busan 609735, South Korea.",kjha@pusan.ac.kr,"Ho, Chang-Hoi/H-8354-2015; Ha, Kyung-Ja/D-7584-2018","Ha, Kyung-Ja/0000-0003-1753-9304; Choi, Yumi/0000-0002-8124-2954","GRL Grant of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korean Government [MEST 2011-0021927]; National Research Foundation of Korea [2013H1A2A1034227, 2011-0021927] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)",GRL Grant of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korean Government; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was supported by GRL Grant of the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Korean Government (MEST 2011-0021927).,,40,36,36,3,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Communities of practice (e.g. conservation researchers, protected areas managers) have different interpretations of climate change impacts on biodiversity and different ways of defining, operationalizing and implementing adaptation. Their cognitive and motivational expectations for the future are associated with different paths to reach such desired futures. To understand how adaptation is framed in conservation, we undertook a systematic review with a thematic synthesis of the definitions of the term as used in the academic conservation literature. From a sample of 150 articles, only 36 provided a definition of adaptation. We critically appraised the explicit definitions to identify emergent themes that represent particular adaptation approaches. Themes were then grouped, and each group was assigned to a scholarly tradition, onto-epistemological approach and theoretical perspective. Based on theoretical perspectives on social change, we propose a framework (including individual cognitive basis, social interactions, and openness to alternatives) to analyse how change is framed in the definitions and how the framings influence adaptation options. The grouped themes represent passive, active, or indirect adaptation approaches. We used these themes to generate a conceptual model to guide conservation researchers and practitioners engaged in climate adaptation research, policy and management to aid reflection and understanding of the options available to design adaptation agendas and allow negotiation of diverse interests, views and expectations about the future.","[Munera-Roldan, Claudia; Colloff, Matthew J.; Wyborn, Carina] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Locatelli, Bruno] Univ Montpellier, Cirad, Forests & Soc, Montpellier, France; [Locatelli, Bruno] Cifor, Climate Change Team, Lima, Peru",Australian National University; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Munera-Roldan, C (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Claudia.Munera@anu.edu.au,"Locatelli, Bruno/C-9957-2009","Locatelli, Bruno/0000-0003-2983-1644; Wyborn, Carina/0000-0002-4314-347X","Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment","Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment","C.M.R. is grateful to the Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment for the provision of an Endeavour Postgraduate Scholarship as part of the Endeavour Leadership Program.

Under these circumstances, science based stakeholder involvement is required. However, there is often a gap between the information produced by science and the need for information from stakeholders. Along with the design and implementation of adaptive management strategies and policies, efforts must be taken to adjust messages about conservation and adaptation issues, to make them easier to understand, relevant and acceptable for stakeholders. In this paper, the experience of closing the gap between scientific information and the user needs of stakeholders in the Biebrza Valley is documented. The requirements of efficient stakeholder dialogue and the raising of awareness are then indicated. We conclude that many attempts to raise awareness of environmental conservation require improvements. Messages often need to be adjusted for different stakeholders and their various perception levels to efficiently anticipate the potential impacts of the changing climate on ecosystem management. We also revealed that the autonomous adaptation measures implemented by stakeholders to mitigate impacts of climatic change often contradict adaptive management planned and implemented by environmental authorities. We conclude that there is a demand for boundary spanners that can build a bridge between complex scientific outputs and stakeholder needs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Civic agriculture is a social movement that attracts a specific type of activist farmer, who is linked to a strong social network that includes other farmers and consumers. Positioning farmers' practices within a social movement broadens the understanding of adaptive capacity beyond how farmers adapt to understand why they do so. By drawing upon qualitative and quantitative data and by focusing on the cosmological, organizational, and technical dimensions of the social movement, the study illuminates how social values and networks shape production and marketing strategies that enable farmers to share resources and risks. We propose a conceptual framework for understanding how technical and social strategies aimed to address the sustainability goals of the movement also increase adaptive capacity at multiple timescales. In conclusion, we outline directions for future research, including the need for longitudinal studies that focus on consumer motivation and willingness to pay, the effects of scale on consumer loyalty and producer cooperation, and the role of a social movement in climate change adaptation. Finally, we stress that farmers' ability to thrive in uncertain climate futures calls for transformative approaches to sustainable agriculture that support the development of strong social networks.","[Furman, Carrie] Univ Georgia, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Roncoli, Carla] Emory Univ, Dept Anthropol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Nelson, Donald R.] Univ Georgia, Dept Anthropol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Hoogenboom, Gerrit] Washington State Univ, AgWeatherNet, Prosser, WA USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Emory University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Washington State University,"Furman, C (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",cfurman@uga.edu; carla.roncoli@emory.edu; dnelson@uga.edu; gerrit.hoogenboom@wsu.edu,"Hoogenboom, Gerrit/F-3946-2010; Nelson, Donald R/C-3225-2014","Hoogenboom, Gerrit/0000-0002-1555-0537; Nelson, Donald R/0000-0002-7878-2853",United States Department of Agriculture-Risk Management Agency (USDA-RMA); US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Climate Program Office (NOAA-CPO); USDA Cooperative State Research and Education and Extension Services (USDA-CSREES); Southeast Climate Consortium,United States Department of Agriculture-Risk Management Agency (USDA-RMA); US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Climate Program Office (NOAA-CPO)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USDA Cooperative State Research and Education and Extension Services (USDA-CSREES); Southeast Climate Consortium,"This work was conducted under the auspices of the Southeast Climate Consortium (www.SEClimate.org) and supported by a partnership with the United States Department of Agriculture-Risk Management Agency (USDA-RMA) and by Grants from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Climate Program Office (NOAA-CPO) and the USDA Cooperative State Research and Education and Extension Services (USDA-CSREES).

The new lands that emerge from retreating glaciers provide a host of challenges for ecological and human adaptation to climate change. In these novel proglacial landscapes, ecological succession and natural hazards interplay with local agriculture, hydroelectric production, mining activities, and tourism. Research has emphasized the importance of understanding adaptation around socio-environmental systems, but regional and global management efforts that support local initiatives and connect novel proglacial landscapes to ecological, social, and cultural conservation opportunities are rare and nascent. The characteristics of these emerging lands reflect the nexus of alpine ecosystems with socio-political histories. Often overlooked in glacial-influenced systems are the interdependencies, feedbacks, and tradeoffs between these biophysical systems and local populations. There is no coordinated strategy to manage and anticipate these shifting dynamics, while affirming local practices and contexts. There is an opportunity to initiate a new conversation and co-create a governance structure around these novel landscapes and develop a new framework suitable to the Anthropocene era. This article first synthesizes the rapid socio-environmental changes that are occurring in proglacial landscapes. Second, we consider the need for integrating bottom-up with top-down approaches for the sustainable management of proglacial landscapes. Finally, we propose establishing a transdisciplinary initiative with policy-related goals to further dialogues around the governance and sustainable management of proglacial landscapes. We call for increased cooperation between actors, sectors, and regions, favoring multiscale and integrated approaches.

We classify the database with regard to 18 variables bearing on the characteristics of the paper, the description of the risk and the adaptation strategy, the topic and the corresponding results. To achieve a high level-of-evidence, we realize a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to identify which variables were found in combination with one other in the literature and make distinct groupings affecting adaptive decisions. We identify three groups: (i) profit and production; (ii) microeconomic risk-handling; and (iii) decision and behavior. The first group includes economic costs and benefits as the driver of adaptation and prioritizes simulation, and a mix of theoretical and empirical economic approach. The second group distinctly involves risk-related issues, in particular its management by adaptation.

Such an approach allows the identification of gaps in the literature, concerning the impact of owners' preferences towards risk and uncertainty regarding adaptation decisions, the fact that adaptation was often reduced in an attempt to adapt to the increasing risk of wildfire, or the existence of a regional bias.","[Brunette, Marielle] Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, Paris Inst Technol Life Food & Environm Sci AgroP, Lab Forest Econ LEF, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Bourke, Robin] Freiburger Str 24, D-79112 Freiburg, Germany; [Hanewinkel, Marc; Yousefpour, Rasoul] Univ Freiburg, Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",INRAE; University of Freiburg,"Brunette, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, Paris Inst Technol Life Food & Environm Sci AgroP, Lab Forest Econ LEF, F-54000 Nancy, France.",marielle.brunette@inra.fr; robinabourke@gmail.com; marc.hanewinkel@ife.uni-freiburg.de; rasoul.yousefpour@ife.uni-freiburg.de,"hanewinkel, marc/E-5639-2011","hanewinkel, marc/0000-0003-4081-6621; Brunette, Marielle/0000-0001-8192-4819",French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir program (Lab of Excellence ARBRE) [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01],French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir program (Lab of Excellence ARBRE)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This work was supported by a grant overseen by the French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir program (ANR-11-LABX-0002-01, Lab of Excellence ARBRE).

They have also been suffering from climate change and extreme events, along with a variety of weather and climate threats, which pose many challenges to herders. On the one hand, pastoralist communities have little influence on policy decisions; however, on the other hand, they suffer to a significant extent from such policies, which limit their options for sustainable development and poverty alleviation. Also, the socio-cultural legacy of herders, and their role in food security and provision of ecosystem services, as well as their efforts towards climate change adaptation, are little documented, particularly in Eastern and Southern African countries. There is a perceived need for international studies on the risks and impacts of climate change and extreme events on the sustainability of pastoralist communities in Africa, especially in eastern and southern Africa. Based on the need to address this research gap, this paper describes the climate change risks and challenges that climate threats pose to the sustainability and livelihoods of pastoralist communities in eastern and southern Africa. Also, it discusses the extent to which such problems affect their wellbeing and income. Additionally, the paper reports on the socioeconomic vulnerability indices at country-level; identifies specific problems pastoralists face, and a variety of climate adaptation strategies to extreme events through field survey among pastoralist communities in a sample of five countries, namely Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. The study has shown that the long-term sustainability of the livelihoods of pastoral communities is currently endangered by climate change and the risks and hazards it brings about, which may worsen poverty among this social group. The study suggests that a more systematic and structured approach is needed when assessing the climate vulnerability of individual pastoral communities, since this may help in designing suitable disaster risk reduction strategies. Moreover, the paper shows that it is also necessary to understand better the socio-ecological systems (SES) of the various communities, and how their livelihoods are influenced by the changing conditions imposed by a changing climate.","[Filho, Walter Leal; Wolf, Franziska] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Fac Life Sci, European Sch Sustainabil Sci & Res, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Filho, Walter Leal; Wolf, Franziska] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Chester St, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Taddese, Habitamu] Hawassa Univ, Wondo Genet Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, POB 128, Shashemene, Ethiopia; [Balehegn, Mulubrhan] Mekelle Univ, Dept Anim Rangeland & Wildlife Sci, POB 231, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia; [Nzengya, Daniel] St Pauls Univ, PO Private Bag, Limuru 00217, Kenya; [Debela, Nega] Wolkite Univ, Wolkite, Ethiopia; [Abayineh, Amare] Jimma Univ, Dept Rural Dev & Agr Extens Jimma, Coll Agr & Vet Med, Jimma, Ethiopia; [Mworozi, Edison] Makerere Univ, Mulago Natl Referral Hosp, Dept Pediat & Child Hlth, Coll Hlth Sci, POB 7072, Kampala, Uganda; [Osei, Sampson] Univ Western Cape, Inst Social Dev, Private Bag X17, ZA-7535 Cape Town, South Africa; [Ayal, Desalegn Y.] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Food Secur Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Nagy, Gustavo J.] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Ecol, Igua 1425, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay; [Yannick, Nsani] Ardhi Univ, Fac Sch Environm Sci & Technol SEST, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Kimu, Saizi] Malawi Univ Sci & Technol, Bingu Sch Culture & Heritage, Dept Language & Commun Studies, POB 5196, Limbe, Malawi; [Balogun, Abdul-Lateef] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Geospatial Anal & Modelling Res GAMR Grp, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Alemu, Esubalew Abate] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Rural Dev Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Inst Global Innovat & Dev, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Sidsaph, Henry] Univ Chester, Business Res Inst, Riverside Campus,Castle Dr, Chester CH1 1SL, Cheshire, England","Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; Manchester Metropolitan University; Hawassa University; Mekelle University; Jimma University; Makerere University; Mulago National Referral Hospital; University of the Western Cape; Addis Ababa University; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universiti Teknologi Petronas; Addis Ababa University; East China Normal University; East China Normal University; University of Chester","Li, CL (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Inst Global Innovat & Dev, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",walter.leal2@haw-hamburg.de; habtu1976@gmail.com; mulubrhan.balehegn@mu.edu.et; dnzengya@yahoo.com; Nega.debela@gmail.com; abaytana82@gmail.com; emworozi@gmail.com; sampsonosei96@gmail.com; desalula@gmail.com; gnagy@fcien.edu.uy; nsaniyannick@gmail.com; saikimu@must.ac.mw; geospatial63@gmail.com; esubalewabate@gmail.com; 15598022233@163.com; h.sidsaph@chester.ac.uk; Franzika.Wolf@haw-hamburg.de,"Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022; Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; Ayal, Desalegn Yayeh/AAG-3042-2021; Wolf, Franziska/GWZ-9701-2022; Amare, Abayineh/GQA-4216-2022","Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Wolf, Franziska/0000-0002-9724-5586; Woldeamanuel, Abayineh Amare/0000-0001-7674-9665; Nzengya, Daniel/0000-0001-6588-364X; Berie, Habitamu Taddese/0000-0002-0381-8874; Ayal, Desalegn Y/0000-0001-8966-2673; Sidsaph, Henry/0000-0003-0538-0906; S.

They have large harmful potential and a correct simulation of their evolution in climate projections is important for an adequate adaptation to climate change. Different studies suggest that ocean-atmosphere coupled models provide a better representation of medicanes, especially in terms of intensity and frequency. In this work, we use the regionally-coupled model ROM to study how air-sea interactions affect the evolution of medicanes in future climate projections. We find that under the RCP8.5 scenario our climate simulations show an overall frequency decrease which is more pronounced in the coupled than in the uncoupled configuration, whereas the intensity displays a different behaviour depending on the coupling. In the coupled run, the relative frequency of higher-intensity medicanes increases, but this is not found in the uncoupled simulation. Also, this study indicates that the coupled model simulates better the summer minimum in the occurrence of medicanes, avoiding the reproduction of unrealistically intense events that can be found in summer in the uncoupled model.","[Gutierrez-Fernandez, Jesus; Gonzalez-Aleman, Juan J.; de la Vara, Alba] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Inst Environm Sci, Toledo, Spain; [de la Vara, Alba] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Matemat Aplicada Ingn Ind, ETSI Ind, Madrid, Spain; [Cabos, William] Univ Alcala, Dept Phys, Madrid, Spain; [Sein, Dmitry V.] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Sein, Dmitry V.] Russian Acad Sci, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow, Russia; [Gaertner, Miguel angel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Environm Sci Fac, Toledo, Spain","Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad de Alcala; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha","Gutierrez-Fernandez, J (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Inst Environm Sci, Toledo, Spain.;Gaertner, MA (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Environm Sci Fac, Toledo, Spain.",jesus.gfernandez@uclm.es; Miguel.Gaertner@uclm.es,"Sein, Dmitry/AAI-1352-2021; Cabos, William/L-7374-2014; Sein, Dmitry V/GLS-0252-2022; DE LA VARA, ALBA/AAA-7409-2021; Sein, Dmitry V./P-6419-2018; de la Vara, Alba/AAC-1654-2021; Gaertner, Miguel Angel/ABH-1938-2020","Sein, Dmitry/0000-0002-1190-3622; Cabos, William/0000-0003-3638-6438; DE LA VARA, ALBA/0000-0001-8877-6361; Sein, Dmitry V./0000-0002-1190-3622; Gaertner, Miguel Angel/0000-0001-9909-8826; Gutierrez-Fernandez, Jesus/0000-0003-4239-9315; Gonzalez-Aleman, Juan Jesus/0000-0001-5940-7356",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [CGL2017-89583-R]; European Social Fund; University of Castilla-La Mancha; European Regional Development Fund; Spanish State Research Agency; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia [0149-2019-0015],"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); University of Castilla-La Mancha; European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Spanish State Research Agency(Spanish Government); Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: CGL2017-89583-R; European Social Fund; University of Castilla-La Mancha; European Regional Development Fund; Spanish State Research Agency; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia, Grant/Award Number: No. 0149-2019-0015.",,45,0,0,3,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

In this context, the main objective of this research is to analyze the impacts of climate change on dairy cattle farms in terms of costs, according to different future scenarios and farms scales. Interviews were conducted with 140 dairy farmers in Thrace Region. To analyze the change in costs, the model developed by Calil et al. (2012) was used. According to the results of cost analysis, it was determined that climate change will lead to a 10-50% cost increase on dairy farms by the year 2044. The heat stress is responsible for 48-71% of the increase in the cost of production, where 24-52% is due to increase in feed prices. Based on the outcome of this research, it was suggested that agricultural extension activities should be carried out in order for farms to get adapted to climate change.

The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of the time series shows prominent long-time correlations. Furthermore, the probability distribution of number of faults per day has a power law tail. Thus, the time series of power system fault seem consistent with SOC. Detailed analysis showed that time series of fault in transmission systems derives its SOC from cascading outage within power system and SOC of atmosphere system, while the time series of fault in distribution systems derive its SOC from that of atmosphere system. The roles that cascade outage play in SOC of the time series of fault in distribution systems remain unknown. Since extreme climate will be more intense and frequent with climate variation, the skewed distribution of power systems fault will be intensified as a consequence. Potential application using SOC feature of time series of fault can be developed to facilitate power systems adaptation to climate change in an economical way.","[Duan Xianzhong; Su Sheng] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Elect Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Su Sheng] Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Elect Engn, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Changsha University of Science & Technology,"Duan, XZ (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Elect Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",xz-duan@mail.hust.edu.cn; eessheng@gmail.com,,,"State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China [2009CB219701]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [50595414, 50907005]; National Science Foundation for Post-doctoral Scientist of China [20090460930]; State Grid Corporation [SGKJJSKF[2008] 469]; Changsha University of Science Technology",State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China(State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation for Post-doctoral Scientist of China; State Grid Corporation; Changsha University of Science Technology,"Manuscript received August 07, 2008; revised April 17, 2009; accepted May 25, 2009.

Climate change may affect health through a range of pathways-eg, as a result of increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, reduction in cold-related deaths, increased floods and droughts, changes in the distribution of vector-borne diseases, and effects on the risk of disasters and malnutrition. The overall balance of effects on health is likely to be negative and populations in low-income countries are likely to be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects. The experience of the 2003 heat wave in Europe shows that high-income countries might also be adversely affected. Adaptation to climate change requires public-health strategies and improved surveillance. Mitigation of climate change by reducing the use of fossil fuels and increasing the use of a number of renewable energy technologies should improve health in the near term by reducing exposure to air pollution.","Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1E 7HT, England; WHO, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; World Health Organization,"Haines, A (corresponding author), Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",Andy.Haines@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Haines, Andy/0000-0002-8053-4605; Kovats, Sari/0000-0002-4823-8099",,,,,56,330,345,7,122,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JUN 24,2006,367,9528,,,,,2101,2109,,10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68933-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68933-2,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,058HZ,16798393,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000238657400035,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examines the effects of environmental taxes, corruption, urbanization, economic growth, ecological risks, and renewable energy sources on CO2 emissions in India from 1978 to 2018. Therefore, the ARDL model is used to draw inferences, and Pairwise Granger causality is also applied to demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship. The empirical results show that corruption, environmental dangers, GDP, and urbanization positively influence India's carbon emissions. However, the results of short-run elasticities show that carbon emissions reduce ecological sustainability. Environmental hazards and costs, like other countries, impact India's carbon emissions. Therefore, decision-makers in India should set up strict environmental regulations and anti-corruption measures to combat unfair practice that distorts competition laws and policies. In addition, the government concentrates more on energy efficiency policies that diminish carbon emissions without hampering economic growth in the country.","[Hamid, Ishfaq] Mudra Inst Commun MICA, Ahmadabad 380058, India; [Uddin, Mohammed Ahmar] Dhofar Univ, Coll Commerce & Business Adm, Dept Finance & Econ, POB 2509, Salalah, Oman; [Hawaldar, Iqbal Thonse] Kingdom Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Accounting & Finance, POB 40434, Riffa, Bahrain; [Alam, Md Shabbir] Univ Bahrain, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ & Finance, POB 32038, Sakhir, Bahrain; [Joshi, D.

Often adoption is investigated in isolation focusing on factors influencing farmer decision making and overlooking the effects of technology adoption on farmers' livelihoods and perceptions of change. Therefore, the present study investigated technology adoption and its effects on farmers with a special focus on additional revenue allocation and perception of social, economic and environmental change. Using a digital survey platform, 153 farmers (21.6% female) were interviewed in three sub-districts of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. On average, farmers adopted two technologies or practices, adopted high-yielding rice varieties, and increased their revenue from US$105 to US$122 per hectare per season. Barriers to adoption included time constraints, unsuitability for field conditions and incompatibility with cropping systems. Farmers invested the extra income in farming business and improved diets. Furthermore, farmers perceived changes in social and human capital and also poverty reduction due to technology adoption. This study highlights the importance of including an analysis of social impact in agricultural research.","[Connor, Melanie; de Guia, Annalyn H.; Hellin, Jon] Int Rice Res Inst IRRI, DAPO Box 7777, Manila 1301, Philippines; [Pustika, Arlyna Budi; Sudarmaji; Kobarsih, Mahargono] Yogyakarta Assessment Inst Agr Technol, Jl Stadion Maguwoharjo 22 Ngemplak Sleman, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"Connor, M (corresponding author), Int Rice Res Inst IRRI, DAPO Box 7777, Manila 1301, Philippines.",m.connor@irri.org; a.deguia@irri.org; arlynabudi@gmail.com; sudarmaji2@yahoo.com; mahargonojogja@gmail.com; j.hellin@irri.org,,"Connor, Melanie/0000-0002-9066-602X; kobarsih, mahargono/0000-0002-9838-182X; Hellin, Jon/0000-0002-2686-8065",Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) [81016734],Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),"This research was funded by Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), grant number 81016734.",,42,6,6,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,MAY,2021,11,5,,,,,,,881,10.3390/agronomy11050881,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11050881,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,SG2TO,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000653296300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, one way of promoting sustainability thorough PPPs is the adoption of social responsibility (SR) initiatives/factors. This paper aims to empirically investigate the SR factors in PPPs through a comparative study between China and Ghana. An empirical questionnaire survey was conducted in both China and Ghana. Further, the mean score ranking, Kendall's coefficient of concordance, and Mann-Whitney U test were used for data analysis. Results show that SR factors related to the economic efficiency of PPP projects and climate change adaptation are critical in China, whereas in Ghana, SR factors directly related to job creation and environmental protection are critical. The outputs of this study inform investors of the critical SR initiatives to consider when engaging in PPPs in Asia and Africa. In addition, they provide a solid knowledge base for the continuous international debate on how sustainability could be enhanced through PPP policy.","[Osei-Kyei, Robert; Tijani, Bashir] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Chan, Albert P.

Yet, its consistent adoption in the rhetoric and more importantly policy remains elusive. This paper evaluates the extent to which different actors in policy and planning arenas consider relocation as a viable response to climate change as inferred from the extent to which relocation rhetoric permeates documents designed to inform and guide adaptation. The study examines 56 local, state, and national climate change adaptation texts to determine how many are considering and/or referring to relocation, what language they employ, and in which context. The content analysis was performed to measure the occurrence and frequency of keywords relocation, retreat, migration, and abandonment, as well as their frequency. The results show a significant inconsistency and lack of coherence in the use of relocation rhetoric among examined contemporary adaptation documents that are impeding a more comprehensive consideration and the development of relocation policy and planning. To address this barrier, the author proposes a unifying definition of the term relocation within the context of climate change.","Virginia Tech, Urban Affairs & Planning, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Bukvic, A (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Urban Affairs & Planning, 213 Architecture Annex 0113, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",ana.bukvic@vt.edu,,,,,,,33,11,11,3,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

An Emergent Constraint (EC), to correct the projections of ISMR by the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project-6 (CMIP6) models for systematic model biases is urgently needed but has been lacking. Founded on an observed association between the multi-decadal variability (MDV) of ISMR and North Atlantic (NA) sea surface temperature (SST), here we unravel a strong correlation between future changes in ISMR and biases in simulating the present-day ISMR MDV. The new emergent constraint renders a 32% reduction in the multi-model ensemble mean of projected ISMR increase, making the corrected future ISMR change (3.64 +/- 2.5) %/K. The estimate based on this EC is robust and more reliable than previous estimates for basing policy interventions toward adaptation and mitigation.","[Rajesh, P. V.; Goswami, B.

Yet, our knowledge of the spatiotemporal dynamics of MHWs is very limited. Here, I combine network theory with topological data analysis and event synchronization to high-resolution satellite data and to a set of Earth System Model simulations to reveal the dynamical organization of complex MHW networks. The analysis reveals that MHWs have already crossed a tipping point separating highly synchronized preindustrial MHWs from the more extreme, but less coherent warming events we experience today. This loose spatiotemporal organization persists under a reduced RCP 2.6 emission scenario, whereas a second abrupt transition towards a permanent state of highly synchronized MHWs is foreseen by 2075 under a business-as-usual RCP 8.5 scenario. These results highlight the risks of abrupt ocean transitions, which may dramatically affect marine life and humanity by eroding valuable time for adaptation to climate change.","[Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro] Univ Pisa, Dept Biol, Via Derna 1, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro] CoNISMa, Piazzale Flaminio 9, I-00196 Rome, Italy",University of Pisa; Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn di Napoli; CoNISMa,"Benedetti-Cecchi, L (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Biol, Via Derna 1, I-80121 Naples, Italy.;Benedetti-Cecchi, L (corresponding author), Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy.;Benedetti-Cecchi, L (corresponding author), CoNISMa, Piazzale Flaminio 9, I-00196 Rome, Italy.",lbenedetti@biologia.unipi.it,,"Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro/0000-0001-5244-5202","University of Pisa [PRA_2017_19, PRA_2020_76]",University of Pisa,"I thank Manish Saggar for guidance on the basics of topological data analysis.

Theoretically, the study draws on the attention-based view to highlight the potential biases that might occur as a consequence of firms' preconceptions as well as organizational structure and context. In the empirical analysis, the article derives a model that explains the influence of the attentional process on how awareness and perceived vulnerability lead firms to adopt either routine or non-routine measures to adapt to climate change. The article also explores the relevant underlying factors of awareness and perceived vulnerability. The findings suggest that how firms channel attention to climate events has a distinctive influence on the measures firms take to cope with physical impacts.

However, mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests, and the most carbon-rich forests in the tropics that provide a wide range of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Carbon emissions are likely to have been the dominant cause of climate change and blue carbon emissions are being critically augmented through mangrove deforestation. Because of mangrove deforestation, different climatic variables including coastal flooding, cyclone, drought, rainfall, salinity, sea-level rise, and sea surface temperature have dramatic effects on coastal aquaculture. Mangrove forests have been instrumental in augmenting resilience to climate change. The Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) program can help to restore mangroves which in turn increases options for adaptation to climate change.

There is much discussion about how industrial crop cultivation could promote social-ecological outcomes such as environmental protection, biodiversity conservation, climate change adaptation, food security, greenhouse gas mitigation, and landscape appearance. In Germany, maize (Zea mays L.) is the main biogas substrate source, despite being associated with problems such as erosion, biodiversity losses, an increase in wild boar populations and lowered landscape diversity. The cultivation of perennial wild plant mixtures (WPM) addresses many of these problems. Despite being less developed than maize, WPM cultivation has received notable attention among scientists in Germany over the past decade. This is mainly because WPMs clearly outperform maize in social-ecological measures, despite their methane yield performance. This review summarizes and discusses the results of 12 years of research and practice with WPMs as a social-ecologically more benign bioenergy cropping system.","[von Cossel, Moritz] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Dept Biobased Prod & Energy Crops 340b, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"von Cossel, M (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Dept Biobased Prod & Energy Crops 340b, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",moritz.cossel@uni-hohenheim.de,"Von Cossel, Moritz/I-6596-2019","Von Cossel, Moritz/0000-0002-1132-3281",University of Hohenheim,University of Hohenheim,"This work was funded by the University of Hohenheim.

It has become particularly popular to describe the intersection between these two fields and those of poverty and development, and climate resilient development' is rapidly becoming a catch-all for tackling climate change impacts in a development context. This paper reviews academic use of the concept of resilience' in social, ecological and socio-ecological systems and its application to the climate, disaster and development nexus. From this review, we distil 10 key characteristics of resilience: high diversity; effective governance and institutions; the ability to work with uncertainty and change; community involvement and the inclusion of local knowledge; preparedness and planning for disturbances; high social and economic equity; robust social values and structures, acknowledging non-equilibrium dynamics, continual and effective learning and the adoption of a cross-scalar perspective. Finally, we highlight knowledge gaps and suggest directions for further research.","[Bahadur, Aditya V.; Tanner, Thomas] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Ibrahim, Maggie] World Vis, London, England",University of Sussex,"Bahadur, AV (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",a.bahadur@ids.ac.uk,,"Tanner, Thomas/0000-0001-7975-4267",,,,,68,95,95,5,90,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Out of a total 13,488 journal articles in eight key journals for Central Asia research, only 33 articles (0.24%) were on climate change or a related topic. Climate change has been similarly neglected at the events of 17 Central Asia area studies associations. Out of 1305 conference panels, none was focused on climate change. Out of 10,249 individual presentations, only two (0.02%) were focused on climate change. The very same scholars who have been most active in the securitization of Central Asia have ignored the severe security threats that climate change poses to the region. The article contributes to the field of Central Asian studies by drawing attention to severe knowledge gaps that hinder the Central Asian countries from adapting to climate change.

The multiobjective model was applied to maximize agricultural revenue and minimize nutrient discharge to the Minab reservoir. The calibrated and verified model was utilized to estimate future (2021-2099) variables. The annual precipitation and reservoir inflow will decrease by 14% and 46%, respectively. Climate change analysis indicated that the precipitation temporal pattern will change to early fall or late spring. The results of optimization showed that the agricultural revenue increased by 37%, and total nitrogen (TN) load decreased by 70%, compared to the current condition. Also, applying climate change to the optimum strategies could reduce total revenue and TN load by 57% and 41%, respectively.","[Yousefi, Hossein; Moridi, Ali] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Civil Water & Environm Engn, Tehran 1658953571, Iran",Shahid Beheshti University,"Moridi, A (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Civil Water & Environm Engn, Tehran 1658953571, Iran.",a_moridi@sbu.ac.ir,"Moridi, Ali/ABA-6353-2021","Moridi, Ali/0000-0002-3974-2170; Yousefi, Hossein/0000-0003-1098-0105",,,,,33,4,4,2,5,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9437,1943-4774,,J IRRIG DRAIN ENG,J.

Given the long-lived nature of perennial crop investments and the high level of uncertainty regarding both the quality of the seedlings and the climate to which they will be exposed as mature trees, there are clear linkages to farmers' subjective beliefs regarding yield differentials between certified and uncertified seedlings, risk behaviours, and time preferences. We consider these aspects using a recently developed survey-based tool for measuring risk and time preferences and link those to stated preferences and observations on the adoption of certified seedlings. Results show that farmers' beliefs regarding yield and variance of yields of certified and uncertified seedling along with the risk attitudes are significant correlates with seedling choice behaviours. Our results also indicate that information asymmetries in the certified seedling market may play a role in limiting the benefits of certification programs both due to cheating and due to lower levels of adoption.","[Hasibuan, Abdul Muis; Stringer, Randy] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Hasibuan, Abdul Muis] IAARD, Indonesian Ctr Estate Crops Res & Dev, Bogor, Indonesia; [Hasibuan, Abdul Muis] Indonesian Ctr Estate Crops Res & Dev, Jl Tentara Pelajar 1, Bogor, Indonesia; [Gregg, Daniel] Univ New England, Business Sch, Armidale, NSW, Australia",University of Adelaide; Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research & Development; University of New England,"Hasibuan, AM (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia.;Hasibuan, AM (corresponding author), IAARD, Indonesian Ctr Estate Crops Res & Dev, Bogor, Indonesia.;Hasibuan, AM (corresponding author), Indonesian Ctr Estate Crops Res & Dev, Jl Tentara Pelajar 1, Bogor, Indonesia.",am.hasibuan@pertanian.go.id,"Hasibuan, Abdul Muis/O-1127-2016","Hasibuan, Abdul Muis/0000-0002-5571-0056; Gregg, Daniel/0000-0002-2308-0790",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) [AGB/2009/060],Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res),This research was undertaken as a part of the research project funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) (Indohort project AGB/2009/060) 'Improving market integration for high-value fruit and vegetable production systems in Indonesia'.,,64,1,1,3,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Cities can influence their adaptation, resilience, and eventually their sustainability through spatial planning with the use of more ecosystem-based planning tools, such as Green Infrastructure (GI). The present paper is an attempt to assess whether and how city strategies address the objective of an adaptation which interconnects the criteria of vulnerability, adaptability, and resilience through spatial planning. For this purpose, the paper examines the Resilience Strategies of seven European cities of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative (100RC). Based on a thematic analysis, the paper investigates whether these strategies incorporate a spatial planning approach which contributes to adaptation to climate change, focusing on GI as a spatial planning tool. The paper argues that there is room for improvement in all the examined strategies, as none of them fully incorporate the concept of GI, and, furthermore, that some critical planning principles which contribute to adaptation are missing.","[Salata, Konstantina-Dimitra; Yiannakou, Athena] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Engn, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Salata, KD (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Engn, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece.",salatadg@plandevel.auth.gr; adgianna@plandevel.auth.gr,"Salata, Konstantina-Dimitra/L-7749-2019","Salata, Konstantina-Dimitra/0000-0003-0306-0554; Yiannakou, Athena/0000-0003-3674-1401",,,,,35,6,6,5,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2020,12,14,,,,,,,5548,10.3390/su12145548,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12145548,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MU8JK,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000555913500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In response, some people adapt, but others may not. The aim of our research was to understand what factors influence successful adaptation to climate change in context. We surveyed rural small-scale farmers in Eswatini who had recently experienced a severe drought, and collected data on adaptive capacity, measured as household access to five types of capital: natural (access to and use of natural resources), social (integration within local social networks), financial (income and wealth), physical (access to assets and infrastructure), and human (education and employment). Our goals were to identify which type of capital was most important in driving adaptation and to identify the specific ways in which capital supported adaptation. We found that social capital and natural capital increased successful drought adaptation more than other types of capital. Primarily, social and natural capital increased access to other resources and opportunities that enabled adaptation.

The existing evidence in agricultural insurance is scattered across regions, topics and risks, and a structured synthesis is unavailable. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of 796 peer-reviewed papers on agricultural insurance published between 2000 and 2019. The goal of this review was twofold: (a) categorizing agricultural insurance literature by agricultural product insured, research theme, geographical study area, insurance type and hazards covered, and (b) mapping country-wise research intensity of these indicators vis-a-vis historical and projected risk and crisis events-extreme weather disasters, projected temperature increase under SSP5 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) scenario and livestock epidemics. We find that insurance research is focused on high-income countries while crops are the dominating agricultural product insured (33% of the papers). Large producers in production systems like fruits and vegetables (South America), millets (Africa) and fisheries and aquaculture (South-east Asia) are not focused upon in the literature. Research on crop insurance is taking place where historical extreme weather disasters are frequent (correlation coefficient of 0.75), while we find a surprisingly low correlation between climate change induced temperature increases in the future and current research on crop insurance, even when sub-setting for papers on the research theme of climate change and insurance (-.04). There is also limited evidence on the role of insurance to scale adaptation and mitigation measures to de-risk farming. Further, we find that the study area of livestock insurance papers is weakly correlated to the occurrence of livestock epidemics in the past (-.06) and highly correlated to the historical drought frequency (.51). For insurance to play its relevant role in climate change adaptation as described in the SDGs, we recommend governments, insurance companies and researchers to better tune their interest to risk-prone areas and include novel developments in agriculture which will require major investments, and, hence, insurability, in the coming years.","[Vyas, Shalika; Aggarwal, Pramod] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr BISA CIMMYT, Borlaug Inst South Asia, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, New Delhi, India; [Vyas, Shalika; Dalhaus, Tobias; Meuwissen, Miranda P.

By incorporating indicators of adaptive capacity and sensitivity, we develop empirical models of the relationship between extreme weather disasters and agricultural output between 1995 and 2010. Using panel data models, we find that the greater the adaptive capacity of a country, the more attenuated are the expected agricultural losses from extreme weather disasters. In effect, climate-related agricultural consequences vary as a function of the heterogeneity across countries. Much of this heterogeneity in adaptive capacity is a result of policy choices about structural preparedness. Our results allow us to draw inferences about crop yields under different levels of adaptive capacity in the context of climate change.","[Regan, Patrick M.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Polit Sci, 217 OShaughnessy Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Kim, Hyun] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame Global Adaptat Initiat, 1400 East Angela Blvd, South Bend, IN 46617 USA; [Maiden, Emily] Univ Notre Dame, Kroc Inst Int Peace Studies, Hesburgh Ctr Int Studies 100, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame,"Kim, H (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame Global Adaptat Initiat, 1400 East Angela Blvd, South Bend, IN 46617 USA.",pregan3@nd.edu; hkim9129@gmail.com; emaiden@nd.edu,,"Kim, Hyun/0000-0003-0681-5828",,,,,52,17,17,4,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Drawing on Poststructuralist Discourse Theory, light is shed on the implicit values and assumptions that underpin this recent policy initiative. The findings demonstrate a tension between the declared ambition to act on adaptation and implicit suggestions that nothing really has to change, and the challenge can be addressed by market and technological innovations, and by mainstreaming adaptation into existing sectoral policies. The policy discourse effectively serves to depoliticize choices societies make in response to climate change, presenting adaptation as a non-political issue.

The policies of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) encourage homeowners to implement permanent static elevation (PSE) to increase their flood resilience. However, substantial elevation can increase a structure's vulnerability to wind. In effect, by protecting against a rare but catastrophic flood occurrence, these houses are made considerably more vulnerable to less severe but more regularly occurring wind events and thus face an increased likelihood of wind damage. This study introduces amphibious construction as an innovative retrofit flood-mitigation and climate-change-adaptation strategy. It also evaluates the increased vulnerability to wind damage that accompanies PSE, to which amphibious retrofit construction is an alternative. The results of our investigation suggest that amphibious construction could provide a beneficial alternative solution to mitigating hurricane damage because it is a strategy that can reduce vulnerability to flood damage without increasing vulnerability to wind damage.

However, it remains unclear to what degree human activity intensity has impacted the alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau. Here we quantify human activity intensity on alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau based on the relationship between actual and potential net primary production. We found that human activity intensity decreased by 16.1% from 2000 to 2017 across the alpine grasslands, which might be driven by recent ecological conservation policies, especially reductions in livestock numbers. Critical thresholds, which show marked grassland responses to different levels of human disturbances, were identified for each ecozone. The net primary production of dry grasslands on the western ecozones was more resistant to human disturbances but with lower resilience than other alpine grasslands on the plateau. Our findings are beneficial to design practical countermeasures to adapt to climate change and recover damaged grasslands on Tibetan Plateau.","[Li, Meng; Zhang, Xianzhou; Niu, Ben; He, Yongtao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Lhasa Natl Ecol Res Stn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Meng; Ding, Qiannan] Nantong Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Nantong 226007, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jianshuang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jianshuang] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Theoret Ecol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Nantong University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development in Agriculture, CAAS; Free University of Berlin","Zhang, XZ (corresponding author), A11 Datun Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangxz@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Niu, Ben/HNB-7768-2023; Zhang, XZ/HJA-4189-2022; zhang, xian/GYA-0290-2022","Li, Meng/0000-0001-7445-0336",Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program [2019QZKK1002]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19050502]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Young Talent Scientist Program of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Young Talent Scientist Program of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,The study was jointly supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program (2019QZKK1002) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA19050502).

Due to the complexity of associated processes, particularly at unresolved temporal and spatial scales this continues to be a major challenge. As a result, climate simulations of precipitation often exhibit substantial biases that affect the reliability of future projections. Here we demonstrate how a regional climate model (RCM) coupled to a distributed hydrological catchment model that fully integrates water and energy fluxes between the subsurface, land surface, plant cover and the atmosphere, enables a realistic representation of local precipitation. Substantial improvements in simulated precipitation dynamics on seasonal and longer time scales is seen for a simulation period of six years and can be attributed to a more complete treatment of hydrological sub-surface processes including groundwater and moisture feedback. A high degree of local influence on the atmosphere suggests that coupled climate-hydrology models have a potential for improving climate projections and the results further indicate a diminished need for bias correction in climate-hydrology impact studies.","[Larsen, Morten A.

This begs the question: How do we protect the well-being of populations living with climate impacts without causing unintentional harm via poorly planned or managed adaptation actions? This Perspective presenting an exploratory pilot study surveyed populations affected by the historic and unprecedented widespread public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) to mitigate the risk of wildfires by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and Southern California Edison (SCE) in October and November 2019 that left millions without power. The results suggest that PSPS likely represents a 'looming threat' that is associated with reported poorer recent physical and mental health, exacerbated by self-reported trauma lingering from previous experience with wildfires, especially among the most vulnerable. This threat is apparently most acute in northern California, where people experienced greater widespread shutoffs, more recent experience with devastating wildfires, and expressed anger toward how their utility contributed and responded to recent wildfires. Despite this, people are largely supportive of PSPS as an important way to reduce the bigger risk of wildfires, even as they report suffering from this adaptation measure. These results suggest that people understand and are sympathetic regarding the need for PSPS; yet without holistic consideration of the consequences of climate adaptation, unintended health impacts may arise.","[Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, 473 Via Ortega,Room 160, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, 473 Via Ortega,Room 160, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Wong-Parodi, G (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, 473 Via Ortega,Room 160, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Wong-Parodi, G (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, 473 Via Ortega,Room 160, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",gwongpar@stanford.edu,,"Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle/0000-0001-5207-7489","Stanford University's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences","Stanford University's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences","This work was supported by Stanford University's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences.

Previous studies reached different conclusions due to inconsistent methods, disparate meteorological indicators, and specific time periods or regions. This manuscript is based on seven daily meteorological indicators in the NCEP reanalysis data set and COVID-19 data repository of Johns Hopkins University from 22 January 2020 to 1 June 2021. Results showed that worldwide average temperature and precipitable water (PW) had the strongest correlation (p > 0.9, p < 0.001) with the confirmed COVID-19 cases per day from 22 January to 31 August 2020. From 22 January to 31 August 2020, positive correlations were observed between the temperature/ PW and confirmed COVID-19 cases/deaths in the northern hemisphere, whereas negative correlations were recorded in the southern hemisphere. From 1 September to 31 December 2020, the opposite results were observed. Correlations were weak throughout the near full year, and weak negative correlations were detected worldwide (vertical bar rho vertical bar < 0.4, p <= 0.05); the lag time had no obvious effect. As the latitude increased, the temperature and PW of the maximum confirmed COVID-19 cases/deaths per day generally showed a decreasing trend; the 2020-year fitting functions of the response latitude pattern were verified by the 2021 data. Meteorological indicators, although not a decisive factor, may influence the virus spread by affecting the virus survival rates and enthusiasm of human activities. The temperature or PW threshold suitable for the spread of COVID-19 may increase as the latitude decreases. Plain Language Summary Climate change has altered life's living environment; humans seem to be able to adapt to climate change within a certain range. This adaptability seems to be human talent, but how about a coronavirus? The impact of environmental variables on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread varies between regions. The two meteorological variables that are most likely to affect the distribution of COVID-19 have significant latitude patterns, which means that in areas with higher climate temperatures, the temperature range for the maximum spread of COVID-19 is higher, while in areas with lower climate temperatures, the temperature for the maximum spread of COVID-19 is lower. Perhaps it indicates that the virus also has the ability to adapt to climate change, even more so than humanity. The complete cessation of COVID-19 pandemic requires everyone's efforts.","[Zhang, Sixuan; Wang, Bingyun; Wang, Shigong; Hu, Wendong; Feng, Hongmei] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Yin, Li] Panzhihua Cent Hosp, Panzhihua, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shigong] Zunyi Academician Work Ctr, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Song, Xueqian] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Coll Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Information Technology; Chengdu University of Information Technology,"Wang, BY; Wang, SG (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China.;Wang, SG (corresponding author), Zunyi Academician Work Ctr, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China.",bywang@cuit.edu.cn; wangsg@cuit.edu.cn,,,"Panzhihua Science and Technology Bureau Innovation Center Construction Project [2021ZX-5-1]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41775147, 42005136]; National Key Research Project of China-Strategy on Black Carbon Reduction and Evaluation of the Health Effects of Climate Change [2016YFA0602004]; 2020 Innovation Fund project of the Public Meteorological Service Center of China Meteorological Administration [K2020010]; Sichuan Province Science and Technology Plan Applied Basic Research Project [2020YJ0428]; Research on Excavation and Service Technology of Climate Resources for Hainan Kangyang Tourism [SCSF202007]; 2021 Graduate education reform project Reform Project by Chengdu University of Information Technology [CUITGOMP202102]; second batch of Panzhihua Municipal Science and Technology Plan Projects in 2021 [2021CY-S-4]",Panzhihua Science and Technology Bureau Innovation Center Construction Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research Project of China-Strategy on Black Carbon Reduction and Evaluation of the Health Effects of Climate Change; 2020 Innovation Fund project of the Public Meteorological Service Center of China Meteorological Administration; Sichuan Province Science and Technology Plan Applied Basic Research Project; Research on Excavation and Service Technology of Climate Resources for Hainan Kangyang Tourism; 2021 Graduate education reform project Reform Project by Chengdu University of Information Technology; second batch of Panzhihua Municipal Science and Technology Plan Projects in 2021,This research was supported by Panzhihua Science and Technology Bureau Innovation Center Construction Project (2021ZX-5-1); National Natural Science Foundation of China (41775147 and 42005136); National Key Research Project of China-Strategy on Black Carbon Reduction and Evaluation of the Health Effects of Climate Change (2016YFA0602004); 2020 Innovation Fund project of the Public Meteorological Service Center of China Meteorological Administration (K2020010); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Plan Applied Basic Research Project (2020YJ0428) Research on the Spatial Equilibrium of Medical Resources in Sichuan Province Based on the Spatial Distribution of Precise Population and Spatial Behavior Preference for Medical Treatment; Research on Excavation and Service Technology of Climate Resources for Hainan Kangyang Tourism (SCSF202007); 2021 Graduate education reform project Reform Project by Chengdu University of Information Technology(CUITGOMP202102). the second batch of Panzhihua Municipal Science and Technology Plan Projects in 2021 (2021CY-S-4).,,67,0,0,1,8,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2471-1403,,,GEOHEALTH,GeoHealth,MAR,2022,6,3,,,,,,,e2021GH000502,10.1029/2021GH000502,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021GH000502,,,15,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0E1TK,35317468,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000776467000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our research draws on the Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPACC). We developed a survey instrument incorporating the main aspects of the MPPACC and other factors from related research work that are assumed to explain why some people show self-protective behavior while others do not. The interview survey was conducted with a non-random sample of 210 respondents from three Philippine cities, namely Baguio, Dagupan, and Tuguegarao. The results reveal the importance of adaptation appraisal, including the perceived feasibility of self-protective measures, the perceived adaptation knowledge, and, with limitations, the perception of actions taken by neighbors or friends. We also show that perceptions of past weather trends are closely linked to risk perception but are only partly corroborated by weather station data. Implications for fostering self-protective behavior are making use of time windows right after an extreme weather event and focusing on enhancing adaptation appraisal.","[Werg, Jana Lorena; Mieg, Harald A.] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Grothmann, Torsten] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ecol Econ Grp, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Spies, Michael] Eberswalde Univ Sustainable Dev, Ctr Econ & Ecosyst Management, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development,"Werg, JL (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",jana.werg@hu-berlin.de; torsten.grothmann@uni-oldenburg.de; michael.spies@hnee.de; harald.mieg@hu-berlin.de,,"Spies, Michael/0000-0002-4009-0544","International Climate Initiative by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU)","International Climate Initiative by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU)","The project Asian Cities Adapt, in which the data collection and part of the data analysis were conducted, was funded within the International Climate Initiative by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU); the project lead was with ICLEI European Secretariat GmbH.

While extended weather forecasting has become an indicator for NG management, seasonal (2-3 month) prediction could mitigate the impact of extreme winters on the NG market for consumers and industry. Interrelated climate patterns of ocean and atmospheric circulation anomalies exhibit characteristics useful for developing effective seasonal outlooks of NG storage and consumption due to their influence on the persistence and intensity of extreme winter weather in North America. This study explores the connection between the Pacific-North American climate systems and the NG market in the U.S., connecting macro-scale oceanic and atmospheric processes to regional NG storage and consumption. Western Pacific sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure patterns describe significant variation in seasonal NG storage and consumption. Prediction of these coupled climate processes is useful for estimating NG storage and consumption; this could facilitate economic adaptation toward extreme winter weather conditions. Understanding the implicated impact of climate variability on NG is a crucial step toward economic adaptation to climate change.","[Stuivenvolt-Allen, Jacob; Wang, Simon S-Y] Utah State Univ, Utah Climate Ctr, Dept Plants Soils & Climate, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Wang, SSY (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Utah Climate Ctr, Dept Plants Soils & Climate, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",simon.wang@usu.edu,,"Stuivenvolt-Allen, Jacob/0000-0002-2611-284X",NSF Research Traineeship grant [1633756]; US Department of Energy [DESC0016605]; SERDP [W912HQ-17-P-0013]; USU Agricultural Experiment Station,NSF Research Traineeship grant; US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); SERDP; USU Agricultural Experiment Station,"Funding was provided in part through a NSF Research Traineeship grant (Award #1633756).

However, non-linear changes in well yields as aquifer saturated thickness is reduced may have large impacts on irrigated production that are currently neglected in projections of the long-term sustainability of groundwater-fed irrigation. We conduct empirical analysis of observation data and numerical simulations for case studies in Nebraska, USA, to compare the impacts of changes in well yield and groundwater depth on agricultural production. Our findings suggest that declining well pumping capacities reduce irrigated production areas and profits significantly, whereas increased pumping costs reduce profits but have minimal impacts on the intensity of groundwater-fed irrigation. We suggest, therefore, that management of the dynamic relationship between well yield and saturated thickness should be a core component of policies designed to enhance long-term food security and support adaptation to climate change.

Then the Mann-Kendall method is used to discriminate the variation points of precipitation series at each station. The results show that, during the study period, there was an overall reduction in annual precipitation across the basin and there were two spatial patterns: increase in the northwest, decrease in southeast and increase in the west, decrease in east. Variation points in the annual precipitation series at each meteorological station in the basin were detected, and they occur earliest in the southeast and downstream, then progressively later in the northwest and upstream areas. These variations were most frequent during the 1970s and 1980s.

Results demonstrate a complex relationship between perceptions and observed changes. On the one hand, observed changes in land cover match perceptions of deforestation as the primary cause of increasing water scarcity. On the other hand, perceptions of climate driven changes in water availability are not reflected in observed precipitation data. Furthermore, water scarcity was perceived in regions where seasonal rainfall variability is higher but not in regions where annual rainfall is lower.

Using data from a survey of more than 9,000 farmers across 11 African countries, a cross-sectional approach estimates how farm net revenues are affected by climate change compared with current mean temperature. Revenues fall with warming for dryland crops (temperature elasticity of -1.9) and livestock (-5.4), whereas revenues rise for irrigated crops (elasticity of 0.5), which are located in relatively cool parts of Africa and are buffered by irrigation from the effects of warming. At first, warming has little net aggregate effect as the gains for irrigated crops offset the losses for dryland crops and livestock. Warming, however, will likely reduce dryland farm income immediately. The final effects will also depend on changes in precipitation, because revenues from all farm types increase with precipitation. Because irrigated farms are less sensitive to climate, where water is available, irrigation is a practical adaptation to climate change in Africa.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Univ Pretoria, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy Africa, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",Yale University; University of Pretoria,"Kurukulasuriya, P (corresponding author), Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",pradeep.kurukulasuriya@yale.edu; robert.mendelsohn@yale.edu; rashid.hassan@up.ac.za; james.benhin@up.ac.za; ttderessa@yahoo.com; mbaye.diop@isra.sn; yfosu@ug.edu.gh; ggbetibouo@postino.up.ac.za; sjain@natsci.unza.zm; cresa@intnet.ne; rtmano@mweb.co.zw; jmariara@uonbi.ac.ke; samiaelmarsafawy797@hotmail.com; emolua@gmx.net; samihaouda@yahoo.com; oued_mathieu@yahoo.fr; isisene@ucad.sn; d.maddison@ucl.ac.uk; niggol.seo@yale.edu; adinar@worldbank.org,"Diop, Mbaye/AAX-5167-2021; Ouda, Samiha/A-6760-2015; Hassan, Rashid/CAG-5246-2022; Mendelsohn, Robert/GZA-9112-2022","Ouda, Samiha/0000-0002-8468-1207; Seo, S.

In the last decade, many studies assessed impacts of climate change and specific adaptation strategies. However, adaptation to climate change must be considered in the context of other driving forces that will cause farms of the future to look differently from today's farms. In this paper we use a historical analysis of the influence of different drivers on farm structure, complemented with literature and stakeholder consultations, to assess future structural change of farms in a region under different plausible futures. As climate change is one of the drivers considered, this study thus puts climate change impact and adaptation into the context of other drivers. The province of Flevoland in the north of The Netherlands was used as case study, with arable farming as the main activity. To account for the heterogeneity of farms and to indicate possible directions of farm structural change, a farm typology was developed. Trends in past developments in farm types were analyzed with data from the Dutch agricultural census. The historical analysis allowed to detect the relative importance of driving forces that contributed to farm structural changes. Simultaneously, scenario assumptions about changes in these driving forces elaborated at global and European levels, were downscaled for Flevoland, to regional and farm type level in order to project impacts of drivers on farm structural change towards 2050. Input from stakeholders was also used to detail the downscaled scenarios and to derive historical and future relationships between drivers and farm structural change. These downscaled scenarios and future driver-farm structural change relationships were used to derive quantitative estimations of farm structural change at regional and farm type level in Flevoland. In addition, stakeholder input was used to also derive images of future farms in Flevoland. The estimated farm structural changes differed substantially between the two scenarios. Our estimations of farm structural change provide a proper context for assessing impacts of and adaptation to climate change in 2050 at crop and farm level.","[Mandryk, Maryia; Reidsma, Pytrik; van Ittersum, Martin K.] Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst Grp, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Mandryk, M (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst Grp, POB 430, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands.",maryia.mandryk@wur.nl,"Lobo, Diele/I-9106-2012; van Ittersum, Martin/J-8024-2014","van Ittersum, Martin/0000-0001-8611-6781; Reidsma, Pytrik/0000-0003-2294-809X",Wageningen University; AgriADAPT,Wageningen University; AgriADAPT,"We appreciated the input from all stakeholders in the region and experts that contributed to this paper by sharing their visions on future farms in Flevoland ( Ben Schaap and Wolf Joost).

Many investors are integrating ESG considerations into their mainstream portfolios. This article aims to study the impact of board factors on the ESG disclosure score of Indian listed companies. Using panel data for 327 firms listed on NSE and BSE over 7 years, this study examines the impact of board characteristics on the ESG disclosure score of a firm. We apply two-way fixed effect panel regression for analysis and find that board size and board gender diversity are the two significant factors playing a positive influence on the ESG disclosure score for the sample companies.

The global crisis poses one of the most severe challenges to reducing poverty and existing inequalities, especially in developing countries that are projected to be highly vulnerable to climate variability. However, the education sector provides an untapped opportunity for successful climate change adaptation and mitigation through knowledge and skill acquisitions, and consequently, positive behavioral change. Specifically, education can capacitate individuals and communities to make informed decisions and take practical actions for climate-resilient sustainable development. This study is focused on East Africa, a region whose economy heavily relies on climate-dependent activities. At present, East African governments are already embedding climate change in their school curriculum. However, they lack coherent approaches to leverage climate change education as a tool in their adaptation and mitigation strategies. Therefore, this review explores some of the critical barriers to climate change education and possible opportunities for leveraging learning to promote sustainable development in East Africa.","[Apollo, Abigael] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Arts & Humanities, Dept Int Dev, Nottingham NG1 4FQ, England; [Mbah, Marcellus Forh] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Social Sci, Inst Educ, Nottingham NG1 4FQ, England",Nottingham Trent University; Nottingham Trent University,"Apollo, A (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Arts & Humanities, Dept Int Dev, Nottingham NG1 4FQ, England.",abigael.apollo2020@my.ntu.ac.uk; marcellus.mbah@ntu.ac.uk,,"Mbah, Marcellus F./0000-0002-4199-0819",,,,,58,9,9,10,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,JUN,2021,9,6,,,,,,,93,10.3390/cli9060093,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9060093,,,16,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,SX6XC,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000665344200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such action will burden contractors with additional costs that will lower their economic performance. There are few research studies on how sustainability relates to a firm's competitiveness. This paper represents an empirical study of the relationship between sustainability performance and business competitiveness of international construction contractors. An inverse U-shape relationship between contractors' sustainability performance and their international revenue, and a U-shape relationship between contractors' sustainability performance and their international revenue growth was discovered. The findings can help international contractors have a better understanding of the relationship between sustainability performance and business competitiveness, evaluate their current position in the relationship, optimize their resource allocation on sustainable development and integrate sustainability into their strategic planning. Therefore, contractors with high sustainability performance can expect higher international revenue growth, and sustainability performance is likely to become an opportunity for competitive advantage in the international construction market.

This article explores how this progressive turn in adaptation compares with past progressive movements. I argue urban progressive politics have cyclical tendencies toward liberalism and radicalism, and that the evolution of planning for climate adaptation mirrors these waves. I review 10 recent guidance documents that recommend strategies for enhancing racially just adaptation. I then assess how these recommendations advance the three pillars of progressive reforms: redistribution, expansion of democracy, and structural reform. I find that proposed strategies for racially just resilience are a welcome advance from mainstream, unjust resilience planning. However, history suggests that the focus on procedural justice for oppressed communities seen in recent discourse may limit their scope and durability. I conclude with suggestions for areas where climate activists and scholars can expand given emerging political space for ambitious thinking under a Green New Deal.","[Shi, Linda] Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, 213 W Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Shi, L (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, 213 W Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",lindashi@cornell.edu,,"Shi, Linda/0000-0002-2444-367X",,,,,102,20,20,5,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1078-0874,1552-8332,,URBAN AFF REV,Urban Aff.

Variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes 13 subunits of the respiratory chain complexes, may contribute to climate adaptation by regulating thermogenesis and the use of bioenergy. However, studies looking for a relationship between mtDNA haplogroups and climate have obtained mixed results, leaving unresolved the role of mtDNA in climate adaptation. Since mtDNA content can regulate human bioenergy processes and is known to influence many physiological traits and diseases, it is possible that mtDNA content contributes to climate adaptation in human populations. Here, we analyze the distribution of mtDNA content among 27 Chinese ethnic populations residing across China and find a significant association between mtDNA content and climate, with northern populations having significantly higher mtDNA content than southern populations. Functional studies have shown that high mtDNA content correlates with an increase in the expression of energy metabolism enzymes, which may accelerate thermogenesis. This suggests that the significantly higher mtDNA content observed in northern populations may confer a selective advantage in adapting to colder northern climates","[Cheng, Yao-Ting; Liu, Jia; Yang, Li-Qin; Kong, Qing-Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, State Key Lab Genet Resources & Evolut, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Yao-Ting; Liu, Jia; Yang, Li-Qin; Kong, Qing-Peng] KIZ CUHK Joint Lab Bioresources & Mol Res Common, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chang] Yunnan Univ, Lab Conservat & Utilizat Bioresources, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chang] Yunnan Univ, Key Lab Microbial Divers Southwest China, Minist Educ, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Yao-Ting; Liu, Jia] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Zoology; Yunnan University; Yunnan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Kong, QP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, State Key Lab Genet Resources & Evolut, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",kongqp@mail.kiz.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81272309, 31123005]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCXZ-EW-J-23]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81272309, 31123005) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCXZ-EW-J-23).

In this paper, we assess strategic climate adaptation actions in the cities of Durban (South Africa), Indore (India), and Medellin (Colombia), and examine different approaches to integrating emerging adaptation priorities into urban, plans, programmes, or governance arrangements. We highlight sources of planning tension - particularly between aspects of the planning process and larger urban political economic forces - that reshape how subsequent adaptation interventions are framed and implemented. We find that when advanced with a focus on alignment with development, strategic actions that transcend individual actor or sectoral interests have a better chance at taking root. However, we note that a procedural focus in strategic urbanism must also be accompanied by an integrated assessment of planning outcomes in order to ensure more equitable and inclusive development in cities. Although strategic approaches may facilitate coherent policy framings, targeted actor coalitions, and opportunities for collaborative action, such approaches are often unable to adequately capture the difficult policy trade-offs or contestations that are required to further overall adaptive capacities of cities.

Drawing on a series of field studies in the lower Ba River Catchment on Fiji's main island Viti Levu, the objective of this paper is to determine how climate adaptation strategies - employed by indigenous Fijian communities and households - are influenced by socio-cultural values and access to resources, information and power. Our multi-method approach has been conceptually informed by Agrawal and Perrin's (2008) climate adaptation framework and included semi-structured interviews at the household level, and participatory hazard mapping with diverse focus groups at the community level. Our study finds that due to diverse value-based assessments of livelihood opportunities and climate-related risks, communal and household adaptive strategies can differ widely, even in a very localized cultural context. We also show how decisions to relocate from 'risky environments' are influenced by a combination of local power relations, attachment to cultural and social space, and the provision of external assistance. Our findings comment on the need for disaster risk reduction strategies to recognize how different groups and households respond to climate-related events in distinct socially determined ways.

It is generally agreed that science is important for the adaptation process but specific guidance on how and to what degree science should contribute and be embedded in this process is still limited which is at odds with the high demand for science contributions to climate adaptation by international organizations, national governments and others. Here we present and analyze experiences from the tropical Andes based on a recent science-policy process on the national and supra-national government level. During this process a framework for the science contribution in climate adaptation has been developed; it consists of three stages, including (1) the framing and problem definition, (2) the scientific assessment of climate, impacts, vulnerabilitis and risks, and (3) the evaluation of adaptation options and their implementation. A large amount of methods has been analyzed for stage (2), and a number of major climate adaptation projects in the region assessed for (3). Our study underlines the importance of joint problem framing among various scientific and non-scientific actors, definition of socio-environmental systems, time frames, and a more intense interaction of social and physical climate and impact sciences. Scientifically, the scarcity of environmental, social and economic data in regions like the Andes continue to represent a limitation to adaptation, and further investments into coordinated socio-environmental monitoring, data availability and sharing are essential.

Temperature response functions are introduced into estimating the effect of heating degree days and cooling degree days on the electricity consumption of urban and rural residents, using city-level panel data. The results show that both higher cooling demand in the summer and higher heating demand in the winter leads to increased electricity consumption. The electricity demand will be increased as rural disposable income and the urbanization rate in Jiangsu increase due to residents having greater demands for temperature regulation. While the marginal effect of urban disposable income is negative. When estimating the electricity demand of urban and rural residents, it should be considered that the random fluctuations in the annual precipitation, as well as the population movements (inflow/outflow) among cities with different development levels.","[Zhang, Mingyang; Zhang, Kaiwen; Zhu, Bangzhu] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Inst Climate Change & Publ Policy, Dev Inst Jiangbei New Area, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wuyang] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Wang, Ping] Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Jinan University; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Zhu, BZ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Inst Climate Change & Publ Policy, Dev Inst Jiangbei New Area, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Wang, P (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China.",wpzbz@126.com; wyuwangping@126.com,"Zhang, Mingyang/HIU-1008-2022","Zhang, Mingyang/0000-0002-0979-6266","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603129, 71771105, 71974077, 71671013, 71774088]; National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China [16ZZD049]; Research Project of Institute of Climate Change and Public Policy in Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology [18QHA020]; Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar [Yue Jiaoshi [2016]95]; China Meteorological Soft Science [2019ZDIANXM23]; Guangdong Key Base of Humanities and Social Science-Enterprise Development Research; Guangzhou key Base of Humanities and Social Science-Centre for Low Carbon Economic Research",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China; Research Project of Institute of Climate Change and Public Policy in Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology; Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar; China Meteorological Soft Science; Guangdong Key Base of Humanities and Social Science-Enterprise Development Research; Guangzhou key Base of Humanities and Social Science-Centre for Low Carbon Economic Research,"Our heartfelt thanks should be given to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71603129, 71771105, 71974077, 71671013 and 71774088), National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China (16ZZD049), China Meteorological Soft Science (2019ZDIANXM23), Research Project of Institute of Climate Change and Public Policy in Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (18QHA020), Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar (Yue Jiaoshi [2016]95), Guangdong Key Base of Humanities and Social Science-Enterprise Development Research, and Guangzhou key Base of Humanities and Social Science-Centre for Low Carbon Economic Research for funding supports.",,50,24,24,8,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2020,140,,,,,,,,111398,10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111398,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111398,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LI9KP,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000529795600028,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, none of these benefits will be possible until changes in C stocks can be documented accurately and cost-effectively. This is particularly challenging when dealing with changes in soil organic C (SOC) stocks. Precise methods for measuring C in soil samples are well established, but spatial variability in the factors that determine SOC stocks makes it difficult to document change. Widespread interest in the benefits of SOC sequestration has brought this issue to the fore in the development of US and international climate policy. Here, we review the challenges to documenting changes in SOC stocks, how policy decisions influence offset documentation requirements, and the benefits and drawbacks of different sampling strategies and extrapolation methods.","[Conant, Richard T.; Ogle, Stephen M.; Paul, Eldor A.; Paustian, Keith] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Conant, Richard T.] Colorado State Univ, Sch Global Environm Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Paul, Eldor A.; Paustian, Keith] Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University; Colorado State University,"Conant, RT (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",conant@nrel.colostate.edu,"Conant, Richard T/B-7586-2013; Paustian, Keith H/L-7593-2016","Conant, Richard T/0000-0001-7315-2476; Ogle, Stephen/0000-0003-1899-7446",Robertson Foundation; USDA/CSREES [2005-35615-15223]; NASA [NNG05GL07G]; US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-04ER63890]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1027253] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Robertson Foundation; USDA/CSREES(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This work was supported by a grant from the Robertson Foundation, the USDA/CSREES Carbon Cycle Science Program (Agreement #2005-35615-15223), the NASA Applied Science Program (Agreement #NNG05GL07G), and the US Department of Energy (Grant #DE-FG02-04ER63890).",,28,99,102,4,114,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1540-9295,1540-9309,,FRONT ECOL ENVIRON,Front.

Over time, these organizations' climate activity has grown considerably richer and more nuanced despite continuing to face the same ongoing headwinds: the lack of governmental coordination over local climate effects and vulnerability data and policy; gaps in the distribution of resources to groups; and the inability to coalesce operations that address the intersections of new environmental exposures and long-standing social disparities.

The continuously rising sea level is projected to submerge - or to otherwise make uninhabitable - not only large swaths of the territory of e.g. Bangladesh and the Netherlands, but also all of the island nations of e.g. Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Maldives. Therefore, we must adapt to climate change rather than merely attempt to mitigate it. In particular, territorial losses must be compensated. Noncompliance makes the ideal of territorial compensation elusive and grounds the need for non-ideal theory. Here, I seek to develop such a theory. Specifically, I (i) introduce background considerations, (ii) address challenges to compensatory liability, (iii) situate the paper within non-ideal theory, (iv) offer an ideal of territorial compensation to guide non-ideal theory, (v) discuss previous migration proposals, and (vi) argue for a non-ideal theory of collective climate migration.","[Wundisch, Joachim] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Philosophy, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Wundisch, Joachim] Bielefeld Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res, Bielefeld, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; University of Bielefeld,"Wundisch, J (corresponding author), Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Philosophy, Dusseldorf, Germany.;Wundisch, J (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res, Bielefeld, Germany.",joachim.wuendisch@hhu.de,,,,,,,90,3,3,3,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-8230,1743-8772,,CRIT REV INT SOC POL,Crit.

However, in many regions there are limited focused syntheses of the climate impacts, risks, and potential adaptation strategies for coastal marine areas and sectors. We report on a regional assessment of climate change impacts and recommendations for adaptation strategies in the NE Pacific Coast (British Columbia, Canada), conducted in collaboration with a regional planning and plan implementation partnership (Marine Plan Partnership for the North Pacific Coast), aimed at bridging the gaps between climate science and regional adaptation planning. We incorporated both social and ecological aspects of climate change impacts and adaptations, and the feedback mechanisms which may result in both increased risks and opportunities for the following areas of interest: Ecosystems, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Communities, and Marine Infrastructure. As next steps within the region, we propose proactive planning measures including communication of the key impacts and projections and cross-sectoral assessments of climate vulnerability and risk to direct decision-making.","[Whitney, Charlotte K.; Ban, Natalie C.] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, David Turpin Bldg,3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada; [Whitney, Charlotte K.; Conger, Tugce] Pacific Inst Climate Solut, 2489 Sinclair Rd, Victoria, BC V8N 6M2, Canada; [Conger, Tugce] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 2329 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [McPhie, Romney] Marine Plan Partnership North Pacific Coast MaPP, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Victoria; University of British Columbia,"Whitney, CK (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, David Turpin Bldg,3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada.;Whitney, CK (corresponding author), Pacific Inst Climate Solut, 2489 Sinclair Rd, Victoria, BC V8N 6M2, Canada.",ckw@uvic.ca,,,Tides Canada Initiatives-MaPP Implementation Funding Support Project [GI00128],Tides Canada Initiatives-MaPP Implementation Funding Support Project,Thank you to all the researchers who generously shared their time with us to offer insights on the status of climate change research and future recommendations in this area.

Based on a survey of 1,653 rice farmers in China, our econometric analyses show that the severity of drought and flood in the study areas significantly increases the risk and downside risk of rice yield. The applied farm management measures respond to severe drought and flood and can be considered as adaptation to climate change, an issue often ignored in previous studies. We model adaptation and its impact on rice yield for adapters and non-adapters. Utilizing a moment-based approach, we show that adaptation through farm management measures significantly increases rice yield and reduces the risk and downside risk of rice yield. Several policies, including scaling up the cost-effective farm management adaptation and providing public services related to natural disasters, are recommended to improve adaptive capacity of farmers, particular the poor, in response to extreme events.","[Huang, Jikun; Wang, Jinxia] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yangjie] Cent South Univ, Sch Business, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yangjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Central South University; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Huang, JK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,"International Development Research Center [107093-001]; Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2012CB955700]; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [71161140351, 71333013]; Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research [ADP/2010/070]","International Development Research Center; Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research","The authors thank two anonymous reviewers and the editor for their excellent comments and suggestions.

Serious climate change effects can often be represented by frequent heavy rainfall events and floods. In response, municipalities should improve existing drainage systems to adapt to climate change. However, it is difficult to properly determine when or how to improve these systems because different investment strategies could result in entirely different outcomes. This study proposes a decision framework that can assist municipalities in identifying an optimal infrastructure investment strategy under climate change using a real option approach. The framework considers the uncertainties of climate change based on the volatility of flood damage and estimates the value of wait option for the improvement investment using binomial model. A case study is conducted to verify the proposed framework and assess how different investment strategies affect the value of a drainage system. The results showed that the system improvement with 100 year-flood design in 2019 was the most beneficial among available alternatives.","[Park, Taeil] Korea Inst Construct Technol, Construct Management & Econ Res Div, Goyang 411712, South Korea; [Kim, Changyoon] Korea Inst Construct Technol, ICT Convergence & Integrat Res Div, Goyang 411712, South Korea; [Kim, Hyoungkwan] Yonsei Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, H (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",taeilpark@kict.re.kr; ckim@kict.re.kr; hyoungkwan@yonsei.ac.kr,"Kim, Hyoungkwan/G-8205-2012",,"National Research Foundation and Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology of Korea [2011-0030841]; BIM/GIS Platform based Construction Project Management Technology from Korea Institute of Construction Technology; National Research Foundation of Korea [2011-0030040] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)","National Research Foundation and Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology of Korea; BIM/GIS Platform based Construction Project Management Technology from Korea Institute of Construction Technology; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work was supported by grants (2011-0030841) from the National Research Foundation and Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology of Korea.

Yet the regional hydroclimate and precipitation dynamics remain poorly understood. Using running trend and spectral analysis with multiple gauge-based, remote sensing, and reanalysis precipitation datasets, this study analyzes precipitation temporal variability, its subregional variations, and the main seasonal drivers, particularly the South Asian monsoon. The results uncover remarkable alternation of long-term positive and negative interdecadal precipitation trends in the basin over the past half century. These trends have led to substantial changes in water input over the region at the time scales comparable to climate assessment periods (30 years), and therefore this high intrinsic variability must be accounted for in climate change adaptation studies. This study also reconstructs onset and withdrawal dates of the South Asian monsoon that exhibit interdecadal variability, but their dominant modes differ from that of annual precipitation. The findings hypothesize that higher-frequency variability in El Nino-Southern Oscillation is likely to have a pronounced impact on monsoon onset and duration in the studied region.","[Minallah, Samar; Ivanov, Valeriy Y.] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Minallah, Samar] Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Ivanov, VY (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ivanov@umich.edu,,"Minallah, Samar/0000-0001-8419-5850","Fulbright Grant; NSF [EAR 1151443, 1725654]",Fulbright Grant; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This study was supported by the Fulbright Grant to S.M. and NSF Grants EAR 1151443 and 1725654 to V.I.

The argument being that we need a similar rapid and total shift in our industrial social and economic environment to prevent or at least address the pending impacts of climate change. This argument and these studies have inspired us to think with them on what it means to use the WWII war analogy as a security claim in energy and climate change debates. Here, we would like to use this opportunity to draw attention to some of the implicit dangers of a call to war in such discussions. Among others we observe, first, the absence of any attention to the actual mobilization policies, in terms of garnishing public support. Second, based on the insights from Critical Security Studies, we question the historical incongruence of the case study especially by comparing the perceived enemy in both cases. Lastly, building on that same security literature, we point to some undesirable and perhaps unintended consequences of the use of war analogies in climate change debates.","[Kester, Johannes; Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, SPRU, Energy Policy, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",Aarhus University; University of Sussex,"Kester, J (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",j.kester@btech.au.dk; benjaminso@btech.au.dk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; Kester, Johannes/0000-0001-5384-0247",Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant [EP/K011790/1]; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant [4182-00033B],Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant,This work is supported by the Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant EP/K011790/1 Center on Innovation and Energy Demand and the Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant 4182-00033B Societal Implications of a Vehicle-to-Grid Transition in Northern Europe.

The strategy specifically focuses on the requirements for mobilizing large amounts of capital for adaptation and other urban risk reduction above and beyond the amounts that will likely be mobilized through new international adaptation funds. The paper, based on a report published by ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability,(1) proposes a re-framing of the urban adaptation and disaster reduction challenge. The approach shifts the adaptation focus from risk reduction as a primary end in itself to a broader development focus on financing the performance of urban assets, areas and/or systems. This emphasis is elaborated through the concept of resilience, an urban design and investment metric that measures the ability of urban areas and their individual assets to perform for users and their investors under a wide range of conditions. The paper argues that such a performance-oriented approach provides a business logic that can attract conventional, private investment flows to climate and disaster risk reduction measures and thereby mainstream them.",,,"Brugmann, J (corresponding author), 401 Richmond St W,Studio 204, Toronto, ON M5V 3A8, Canada.",jeb@jebbrugmann.com,,,,,,,14,47,48,2,45,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

We applied the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) to estimate household (social group and gender-based) vulnerability in farming communities in the Melamchi River Valley, Nepal. The results identified female-headed families, and those belonging to disadvantaged social groups as more vulnerable and in need of being preferentially targeted by policy measures. Higher exposure to climatic extremes and related hazards, dependency on natural resources, lack of financial assets, and weak social networking were identified as components that determine overall vulnerability.

The performance of the large-scale road network of the Tokai region in Japan (prone to both typhoons and earthquakes) is analyzed by considering three scenarios of hazards: flash flood, earthquake, and the combination of both hazards. The model considers two key traffic performance characteristics: postdisaster reduced road capacity and hourly variations in travel demand. Overall, several areas in the region are found to be currently severely at risk, thus providing direct information that can help authorities test the effectiveness of future road infrastructure projects.

In contrast, SEAL allows the users to retrieve the necessary data by using metadata associated with contents, such as physical values, of a data file.

Designing resilient landscapes,RITA-REVISTA INDEXADA DE TEXTOS ACADEMICOS,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,,,"We are in a post-ecological era in which nature, as a distinct archetype of the human, no longer exists. An era known as the 'Anthropocene', in which global warming commonly known as climate change, is for many, the most emblematic crisis. A moment therefore, of personal and global responsibility, in which imagination and action become necessary. An imagination nourished by the creativity inscribed in ecology, to produce molded strategic scenarios and tactical designs capable of catalyzing cultural and physical processes for climate change adaptation. In this global context, world coastal areas are one of the most densely populated territories where the dynamic cascading effects of climate change are more intense. For that reason, a coast free from the metaphysical concept of a static nature that needs to be protected is claimed, while reinventing itself by design is proposed. This reinvention entails their understanding as complex adaptive systems. It involves, on one hand, the reconfiguration of the conceptual framework of coastal planning and design and, on the other, the creation of a typological and technological toolbox for the design of resilient coastal landscapes.","[Garcia Garcia, Miriam] Univ Politecn Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia Garcia, Miriam] LANDLAB, Lab Paisajes, Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia Garcia, Miriam] Univ Camilo Jose Cela Madrid, Grado Paisajismo, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia Garcia, Miriam] Politecn Milan, Master Degree Landscape Architecture, Milan, Italy; [Garcia Garcia, Miriam] Univ Pontificia Bolivariana, Maestria Diseno Paisaje, Medellin, Colombia; [Garcia Garcia, Miriam] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Master Arquitectura Paisaje, Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia Garcia, Miriam] Inst Nacl Adm Publ Madrid, Master Univ Urbanismo & Estudios Terr, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Camilo Jose Cela University; Polytechnic University of Milan; Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Garcia, MG (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Madrid, Spain.;Garcia, MG (corresponding author), LANDLAB, Lab Paisajes, Barcelona, Spain.;Garcia, MG (corresponding author), Univ Camilo Jose Cela Madrid, Grado Paisajismo, Madrid, Spain.;Garcia, MG (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Master Degree Landscape Architecture, Milan, Italy.;Garcia, MG (corresponding author), Univ Pontificia Bolivariana, Maestria Diseno Paisaje, Medellin, Colombia.;Garcia, MG (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Master Arquitectura Paisaje, Barcelona, Spain.;Garcia, MG (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Adm Publ Madrid, Master Univ Urbanismo & Estudios Terr, Madrid, Spain.",miriamgarcia@landlab.es,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,REDFUNDAMENTOS SL,MADRID,"CALLE BAHIA 29, MADRID, 28008, SPAIN",2340-9711,2386-7027,,RITA-REV INDEXADA TE,Rita-Rev.

One stream of thought relates to the thematic area of barriers or challenges that adaptation faces. This article explores local adaptation trajectories and challenges in a tribal development block in south India. Through the lens of key livelihood strategies pursued in the block - namely income from development interventions, migration and on-farm strategies - it explores the challenges and factors that contribute or have contributed, to impeding successful adaptation outcomes in Attappady. The article argues that development interventions (i.e planned adaptations) have not succeeded in addressing structural causes of vulnerability; they have, however, provided an important coping mechanism. Migration is a socially and culturally differentiated phenomenon and is not a viable diversification option for the most vulnerable population segments in Attappady. Finally, it is found that recent on-farm adaptation strategies present a case of maladaptation that promote marginalisation and are ill-suited to the local ecological and cultural landscape.","[Adam, Hans Nicolai; Kjosavik, Darley Jose; Shanmugaratnam, Nadarajah] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragric, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Adam, HN (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragric, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",hans.adam@nmbu.no; darley.kjosavik@nmbu.no; n.shanmugaratnam@nmbu.no,"Adam, Hans/AAG-7786-2021","Adam, Hans/0000-0001-9810-5262",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Department of International Environment and Development Studies,Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Department of International Environment and Development Studies,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

Using a household survey in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, we compare the vulnerability of farming and fishing households. We find that the farming households were more exposed to the triple stressors while the fishing households were more sensitive to the triple stressors owing to their poor physical and natural asset base. In addition, we find that the two groups share similar adaptive capacity and composite vulnerability scores.

If this means that it will usually be optimal to use both mitigation and adaptation to deal with climate change; and that a perceived increase in the damages caused by climate change should require an increase in both mitigation and adaptation, then simple economic analysis would support such an interpretation. However, complementarity has a more technical meaning in economics, which implies if the costs of mitigation fell, then the optimal response would be to increase the level of both mitigation and adaptation. We develop a range of economic models to explore the relationship between mitigation and adaptation; and show that in general adaptation and mitigation will be substitutes. We also find that it is possible for complementarity to occur in the special case where adaptation costs depend on the amount of mitigation.","[Ingham, Alan] Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Econ Div, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Ma, Jie] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Dept Int Trade, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Ulph, Alistair M.] Univ Manchester, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Southampton; University of International Business & Economics; University of Manchester,"Ma, J (corresponding author), Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Dept Int Trade, 10 Huixin Dongjie, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",ai@soton.ac.uk; pkujiema@gmail.com; alistair.ulph@manchester.ac.uk,,,Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research,Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research,"We thank Massimo Tavoni, and three anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

Prior to starting such endeavor, it may therefore be useful to explore the maximum potential benefit that can be gained through adaptation measures. In this work, simple, extreme yet realistic adaptation measures are proposed in terms of changes in albedo and vegetation fraction. The impact of these land-use scenarios is explored by use of the land surface model SURFEX on the summer climate in terms of heat waves and the urban heat island for the city of Brussels.

Several key climate adaptation frameworks call for adoption of experimental management whereby different strategies are viewed as experimental treatments requiring untreated controls by which to compare alternative approaches. At the same time, a variety of traditional conservation approaches (e.g., protecting land as connected network of reserves) continue to be emphasized as critical climate adaptation strategies, assuming that reserves are sufficiently representative of ecological diversity. Lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System could be used as untreated control landscapes while also serving as cores within protected area networks. The value of NWPS lands to serve as both untreated controls and representative ecological reserves will require maximizing ecological diversity within protected areas. Here, we assessed ecological representation across wilderness, potential wilderness, and other lands located on the Flathead National Forest (FNF). Our aim was to quantify and map ecological cover types currently underrepresented in wilderness. Underrepresented land cover types included diverse low-elevation mixed-conifer forests. These cover types were well-distributed within potential wilderness, suggesting opportunities to expand untreated controls while diversifying ecological reserves. Investigating the proportion of potential wilderness composed of underrepresented ecosystems provides a means to prioritize areas for future wilderness recommendations. However, on the FNF large potential wilderness areas provide opportunities for significantly increasing the representation of individual ecosystems from minimal representation in wilderness. The method demonstrated here could be used in other national forest planning efforts to prioritize recommended wilderness based on increasing ecosystem representation at national and forest-wide scales.","[Belote, R.

Introduction to the Special Feature",ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,adaptation; climate change; governance,CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIES,"The governance of climate adaptation involves the collective efforts of multiple societal actors to address problems, or to reap the benefits, associated with impacts of climate change. Governing involves the creation of institutions, rules and organizations, and the selection of normative principles to guide problem solution and institution building. We argue that actors involved in governing climate change adaptation, as climate change governance regimes evolve, inevitably must engage in making choices, for instance on problem definitions, jurisdictional levels, on modes of governance and policy instruments, and on the timing of interventions. Yet little is known about how and why these choices are made in practice, and how such choices affect the outcomes of our efforts to govern adaptation. In this introduction we review the current state of evidence and the specific contribution of the articles published in this Special Feature, which are aimed at bringing greater clarity in these matters, and thereby informing both governance theory and practice. Collectively, the contributing papers suggest that the way issues are defined has important consequences for the support for governance interventions, and their effectiveness. The articles suggest that currently the emphasis in adaptation governance is on the local and regional levels, while underscoring the benefits of interventions and governance at higher jurisdictional levels in terms of visioning and scaling-up effective approaches. The articles suggest that there is a central role of government agencies in leading governance interventions to address spillover effects, to provide public goods, and to promote the long-term perspectives for planning. They highlight the issue of justice in the governance of adaptation showing how governance measures have wide distributional consequences, including the potential to amplify existing inequalities, access to resources, or generating new injustices through distribution of risks. For several of these findings, future research directions are suggested.","[Huitema, Dave] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Huitema, Dave] Open Univ Netherlands, Heerlen, Netherlands; [Adger, William Neil] Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England; [Berkhout, Frans] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Massey, Eric] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Mazmanian, Daniel] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Munaretto, Stefania] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Plummer, Ryan] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Plummer, Ryan] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Termeer, Catrien C.

The project has made significant advances in addressing the current deficit integrated assessments for shaping governance propositions. Such propositions argue that the diverse levels of vulnerability and resilience convey important bases for (1) targeting at-risk older individuals; (2) developing vulnerability reduction actions; (3) resilience building actions; and (4) understanding 'success cases' and learn from them for developing appropriate policy measures.

Interviews with farmers, policymakers and members of civil society organizations about the challenges and opportunities that agroforestry faces, as well as field visits to agroforestry projects revealed a wide range of agroforestry initiatives in Bolivia that provide ecosystem services, food and income to local families. All interviewees attributed a high potential to agroforestry, for example, to promote biodiversity, water conservation, food sovereignty and adaptation to climate change impacts. However, agroforestry initiatives lacked support because government incentives were channelled to cattle rearing and large-scale monocultures rather than diversified farming systems, and agroforestry initiatives tended to be small and isolated. A nationwide policy is needed which is coordinated with civil society organizations and individual farmers and strategically and efficiently supports agroforestry initiatives-especially in the most vulnerable first years of establishment-through extension services and access to materials, markets, knowledge and financial resources.","[Jacobi, Johanna] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jacobi, Johanna] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Hallerstr 10, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Bern,"Jacobi, J (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Hallerstr 10, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",johanna.jacobi@cde.unibe.ch,,"Jacobi, Johanna/0000-0003-3432-4938",Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"I thank Miguel Altieri and Stephan Rist for important inputs, as well as the farmers who gave of their time to show their plots and explain their activities and experiences.

Across a diversity of contexts, high temperatures and irregular rainfall have been causally linked to a range of conflict outcomes. These findings can be paired with climate model output to generate projections of the impact future climate change may have on conflicts such as crime and civil war. However, there are large degrees of uncertainty in such projections, arising from (i) the statistical uncertainty involved in regression analysis, (ii) divergent climate model predictions, and (iii) the unknown ability of human societies to adapt to future climate change.

The authors, who were involved at the time, consider a number of key factors for place leadership: vertical and horizontal partnerships; scale in landscape; the sustainability of outcomes; institutional context; and leadership itself. Some challenges of the approach are also briefly considered. We suggest that this experience has a wider relevance to current challenges in place leadership - decarbonisation, climate change adaptation and the conservation of biodiversity-offering lessons for mobilising practical and lasting change.","[Barton, Phil] Ctr Connected Practice, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Handley, John] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Sharland, Richard] Terre Verte Contemporary Art Gallery, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Barton, P (corresponding author), Ctr Connected Practice, Manchester, Lancs, England.",pbarton1@btopenworld.com; john.handley@manchester.ac.uk; p.wilmers@ntlworld.com; richard.sharland@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,2,2,0,1,POLICY PRESS,BRISTOL,"UNIV BRISTOL, 1-9 OLD PARK HILL, BRISTOL BS2 8BB, ENGLAND",2040-8056,2040-8064,,VOLUNT SECT REV,Volunt.

Here, we use a historical atmospheric circulation-precipitation relationship to constrain future modelled wet-season precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau. Our constraint reduces precipitation increases to half of those from the unconstrained ensemble and reduces spread by around a factor of three. This constrained precipitation is used with estimated glacier melt contributions to constrain future runoff for seven rivers. We estimate runoff increases of 1.0-7.2% at the end of the twenty-first century for global mean warming of 1.5-4 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Because population projections diverge across basins, this runoff increase will reduce the population fraction living under water scarcity conditions in the Yangtze and Yellow basins but not in the Indus and Ganges basins, necessitating improved water security through climate change adaptation policies in these regions at higher risk.","[Wang, Tao; Zhao, Yutong; Xu, Chaoyi; Liu, Dan; Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tao; Piao, Shilong; Yao, Tandong] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yutong; Xu, Chaoyi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ciais, Philippe; Yang, Hui] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, CEA, LSCE,IPSL,UVSQ,Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yao, Tandong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS","Wang, T (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, T (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",twang@itpcas.ac.cn,"Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011","Ciais, Philippe/0000-0001-8560-4943; Xu, Chaoyi/0000-0003-1516-5767","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Programme [2019QZKK0208]; NSFC project Basic Science Centre for Tibetan Plateau Earth System [41988101-04]; Key Research and Development Programmes for Global Change and Adaptation [2017YFA0603604]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41922004, 41871104]; Kathmandu Centre for Research and Education, Chinese Academy of Sciences-Tribhuvan University","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Programme; NSFC project Basic Science Centre for Tibetan Plateau Earth System; Key Research and Development Programmes for Global Change and Adaptation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Kathmandu Centre for Research and Education, Chinese Academy of Sciences-Tribhuvan University","This study was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Programme (2019QZKK0208), the NSFC project Basic Science Centre for Tibetan Plateau Earth System (41988101-04), Key Research and Development Programmes for Global Change and Adaptation (2017YFA0603604) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41922004 and 41871104).

As those are often based on Earth system model simulations, we identify recent progress and research needs that can improve the model representation of fire and its impacts. Recent Findings New constraints of fire effects on the carbon cycle and climate are provided by the quantification of the carbon ages and effects of vegetation types and traits. For global scale modelling, the low understanding of the human-fire relationship is limiting. Summary Recent developments allow improvements in Earth system models with respect to the influences of vegetation on climate, peatland burning and the pyrogenic carbon cycle. Better understanding of human influences is required. Given the impacts of fire on carbon storage and climate, thorough understanding of the effects of fire in the Earth system is crucial to support climate change mitigation and adaptation.","[Lasslop, Gitta] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Senckenbeiganlage 25, D-60345 Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany; [Coppola, Alysha, I] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Voulgarakis, Apostolos] Imperial Coll London, Dept Phys, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Yue, Chao] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Veraverbeke, Sander] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); University of Zurich; Imperial College London; Northwest A&F University - China; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Lasslop, G (corresponding author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Senckenbeiganlage 25, D-60345 Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany.",gitta.lasslop@senckenberg.de; alysha.coppola@geo.uzh.ch; a.voulgarakis@imperial.ac.uk; chaoyuejoy@gmail.com; s.s.n.veraverbeke@vu.nl,"Veraverbeke, Sander/H-2301-2012","Veraverbeke, Sander/0000-0003-1362-5125; Coppola, Alysha/0000-0002-9928-2786; Voulgarakis, Apostolos/0000-0002-6656-4437",German Research Foundation; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); University of Zurich; China One Thousand Youth Programme,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); University of Zurich; China One Thousand Youth Programme,Gitta Lasslop is funded by the German Research Foundation.

Following a strong El-Nifio, some regions of Ethiopia experienced major droughts during the 2015/16 agricultural season. Using the propensity scores method on a nationally representative survey in Ethiopia, this study investigates the effect of two widely adopted soil water management practices - terraces and contour bunds - on yields and assesses their potential to mitigate the effects of climate change. It is shown that at the national level, terraced plots have slightly lower yields than non terraced plots. However, data support the hypothesis that terraced plots acted as a buffer against the 2015 Ethiopian drought, while contour bunds did not. This study provides evidence that terraces have the potential to help farmer deal with current climate risks. These results can inform the design of climate change adaptation policies and improve targeting of soil water management practices in Ethiopia.","[Kosmowski, Frederic] CGIAR Standing Panel Impact Assessment, ILRI, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Kosmowski, F (corresponding author), CGIAR Standing Panel Impact Assessment, ILRI, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",f.kosmowski@cgiar.org,,"Frederic, Kosmowski/0000-0002-5946-1800",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through the Strengthening Impact Assessment in the CGIAR (SIAC) program [OPP1009472],Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through the Strengthening Impact Assessment in the CGIAR (SIAC) program,"This study is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Tekalign Mamo, whose expertise and political actions lead to the restauration of millions of hectares of Ethiopian Highland soils.

These disasters include droughts, storms, regular floods, tidal waves, and water pollution. This article investigates how ten small- and medium-sized coastal cities in Indonesia are developing resilience strategies to cope with disaster risks. It approaches their level of exposure, the current impacts of climate change, and the existing, local resilience strategies or response. It identifies key discussion points related to the implementation and the feasibility of these strategies. We argue in this article that the priorities are severalfold, and that local governments are increasingly faced with trade-offs when selecting specific interventions and neighborhoods or districts to prioritize to the detriment of others. The current coping strategies seem insufficient to reduce, respond to, and recover from climate-related impacts as well as address the question of vulnerabilities. The population in the coastal areas and in informal settlements, mainly the poor population, is more directly exposed to these climate-related hazards. The local research highlights the difficulties of multi-stakeholder cooperation, the inevitable trade-offs or difficult choices, and the lack of adequate instruments in climate adaptation.

However, such a local and practical focus may be ill-aligned with the global ambitions of academic participants. The differences between performance criteria of academic and non-academic partners make knowledge co-production unlikely to emerge and survive without protection. This paper aims to understand how different participants in knowledge co-production for climate adaptation can be protected from the norms, values, and performance criteria of their own respective organizations and communities. We found that combinations of shielding (moderating pressures from the selection environment), nurturing (supporting knowledge development), and empowerment (increasing influence over the contexts) activities lead to more successful knowledge co-production. Moreover, our analysis shows that there is no silver bullet for the protection of knowledge co-production. An effective protection strategy should be tailored to the research problem and the social network of a given program.","[Boon, Wouter P.

This study focuses on how local climate adaptations, which have been sustained through long-term interactions with local ecologies, have changed in the face of the challenges caused by climate change and policy interventions. Case studies were conducted in two agro-pastoral counties of northern China, a region that confronts frequent drought and that has experienced extensive institutional changes over recent decades. Based on the exploration of four adaptation strategies, the field results show that both counties have experienced an acceleration of livelihood diversification, an increase in storage and market exchanges, and a dramatic reduction in previously common pooling. The findings reveal that these adaptations are not a direct result of coping with climate risks but rather are indicative of livelihood strategies that result from the combined impacts of institutional, socioeconomic and climatic changes. Current institutional arrangements have negative impacts on local climate adaptations. This is particularly true for those with limited livelihood options, and such arrangements may therefore foster an increase in inequality with regard to household adaptive capacities over the long term. Therefore, this study recommends flexible policies that facilitate local arrangements rather than the current one-for-all policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Some are optimistic about rural landholders' ability to adjust because of their history of coping with climatic extremes. Others see a conservative rural population more skeptical of climate change than the general public and more likely to resist making necessary changes. These contradictory portrayals, largely unresolved in research and policy circles, provided the focus of our research. We examine links between rural landholders' knowledge, beliefs, and risk perceptions and their adaptations to climate change. We found most rural landholders in our case studies were not climate change deniers and were adapting tactically to drier conditions. Low levels of climate change knowledge were an important influence on adaptation, and mistrust in climate change science confirms the need for particular strategies to effectively engage rural landholders in constructive dialogues.","[Mazur, Nicole; Curtis, Allan; Rogers, Maureen] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Mazur, N (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW, Australia.",nickimazur@grapevine.net.au,,,,,,,31,15,15,0,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1920,,,SOC NATUR RESOUR,Soc.

Since then, and despite a number of reports emphasizing the security implications of climate change, there has, at least in diplomatic circles, been a move away from the previous trend towards accepting climate change as a question of international security. This is primarily due to the possibility of the Security Council taking the lead in coordinating global efforts to mitigate, or adapt to, climate change. Developing countries interpret this possibility as a rejection of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as incorporated into the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The increasing urgency of taking decisive action means that it is too early to rule out a role for the Council with its coercive powers. Ultimately, however, the success of any international regulations will depend on their political legitimacy.","Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Scott, SV (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,,,,,,,54,15,15,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0955-7571,1474-449X,,CAMB REV INT AFF,Camb.

Scholars have put efforts on reforming disaster law, yet the impact of politics on disaster management is understated. This article takes Taiwan as a case to study how the disaster management system evolves with the interrelationships between disasters, politics, and law. This article suggests that Confucianism in the past authoritarian times had developed a paternalist disaster politics, which continuingly affects current operation of the disaster management system. Under the influence of paternalist politics, the state takes a primary role in disaster management without a sustainable financial mechanism, which renders citizens passive and indifferent. To better respond to climate change, this article integrates climate change adaptation to disaster management and proposes climate insurance to better distribute disaster risk and enhance the resilience of Taiwan amid a changing climate.","[Lin, Chun-Yuan] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Financial & Econ Law, Taoyuan, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University,"Lin, CY (corresponding author), Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Financial & Econ Law, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,0,NATL TAIWAN UNIV COLL LAW,TAIPEI CITY,"NO 1, SEC 4, ROOSEVELT RD, TAIPEI CITY, 10617, TAIWAN",1812-6324,,,NATL TAIWAN UNIV LAW,Natl.

In this exploratory study, we extend the Index to include future climate change and population projections using RCP 8.5 climate projections of coastal flood, river flood and drought, and SSP3 and SSP5 population projections for the period 2036 to 2065. For the three hazards considered, annually 1.3 billion people (150% increase), 1.8 billion people (249% increase) and 1.5 billion people (197% increase) in the mid-21st century are projected to be exposed under the 2015, SSP3 and SSP5 population estimates, respectively. Drought shows the highest exposure levels followed by river flood and then coastal flood, with some regional differences. The largest exposed population is projected in Asia, while the largest percent changes are projected in Africa and Oceania. Countries with largest current and projected risk including non-climatic factors are generally located in Africa, West and South Asia and Central America. An uncertainty analysis of the extended index shows that it is generally robust and not influenced by the methodological choices. The projected changes in risk and coping capacity (vulnerability) due to climate change are generally greater than those associated with population changes. Countries in Europe, Western and Northern Asia and Africa tend to show higher reduction levels in vulnerability (lack of coping capacity) required to nullify the adverse impacts of the projected amplified hazards and exposure. The required increase in coping capacity (decreased vulnerability) can inform decision-making processes on disaster risk reduction and adaptation options to maintain manageable risk levels at global and national scale. Overall, the extended INFORM Risk Index is a means to integrate Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation policy agendas to create conditions for greater policy impact, more efficient use of resources and more effective action in protecting life, livelihoods and valuable assets.","[Marzi, Sepehr; Mysiak, Jaroslav; Essenfelder, Arthur H.; Pal, Jeremy S.] Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venice Marghera, Italy; [Marzi, Sepehr; Mysiak, Jaroslav; Essenfelder, Arthur H.; Pal, Jeremy S.] Ca Foscari Univ, Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venice Marghera, Italy; [Pal, Jeremy S.] Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Environm Sci, 1 LMU Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA; [Vernaccini, Luca; Alfieri, Lorenzo; Poljansek, Karmen; Marin-Ferrer, Montserrat; Vousdoukas, Michalis] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Mistry, Malcolm N.] Ca Foscari Univ, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873-B, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Mistry, Malcolm N.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med LSHTM, Dept Publ Hlth Environm & Soc PHES, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Alfieri, Lorenzo] CIMA Res Fdn, Univ Campus Savona,Via Armando Magliotto 2, I-17100 Savona, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Loyola Marymount University; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Marzi, S (corresponding author), Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venice Marghera, Italy.;Marzi, S (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ, Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venice Marghera, Italy.",sepehr.marzi@cmcc.it,"; Mysiak, Jaroslav/A-8683-2019","Alfieri, Lorenzo/0000-0002-3616-386X; Pal, Jeremy/0000-0002-5937-0319; Hrast Essenfelder, Arthur/0000-0001-9396-6928; Mysiak, Jaroslav/0000-0001-9341-7048; Mistry, Malcolm/0000-0003-3345-6197; Marzi, Sepehr/0000-0002-8318-3767; VERNACCINI, LUCA/0000-0002-3673-2786","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [820712]; ENERGYA project - European Research Council (ERC), under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [756194]","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme; ENERGYA project - European Research Council (ERC), under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme","This publication is part of the project RECEIPT REmote Climate Effects and their Impact on European sustainability, Policy and Trade that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Grant Agreement No. 820712.

As part of a unique farm adaptation study in Iran, we used structural equation modelling to analyze 400 on-farm survey responses from Khuzestan Province farmers, to understand how their different types of climate change beliefs influenced their mitigation and adaptation behaviour. The structural equation modelling results show that: (1) social trust and responsibility directly influenced adaptation and mitigation; (2) age, education, and family size were not significantly associated with the adaptation and mitigation indexes; and (3) believing in overall climate change was not the actual driver of farmer adaptation (or mitigation) behaviour, and that overall beliefs were mediated through individual farm and local experience. Beliefs in farm and local climate change impacts had the largest, positive, and significant influence on farm adaptation. Once mediated, overall farmer climate change beliefs played a negative role influencing total farm adaptation behaviour, highlighting the need for government and agencies to target communication around the risk impacts of climate change, particularly at the local and regional levels.","[Yazdanpanah, Masoud] Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Mollasani, Ahwaz, Iran; [Yazdanpanah, Masoud] Univ Florida, Dept Family Youth & Community Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Wheeler, Sarah Ann; Zuo, Alec] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ & Publ Policy, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Zobeidi, Tahereh] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Adv Syst Anal Program, Laxenburg, Austria",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Adelaide; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Yazdanpanah, M (corresponding author), Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Mollasani, Ahwaz, Iran.;Yazdanpanah, M (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Family Youth & Community Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",yazdanm@asnrukh.ac.ir,"Yazdanpanah, Masoud/V-5353-2018; Wheeler, Sarah/H-4000-2017","Yazdanpanah, Masoud/0000-0001-8610-0173; Wheeler, Sarah/0000-0002-6073-3172; Zobeidi, Tahereh/0000-0001-6909-4269",Australian Research Council [FT140100773]; Australian Research Council [FT140100773] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Some support funding was provided by Australian Research Council [grant number FT140100773].,,73,2,2,6,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Each year, billions of flying and swimming migrants negotiate the challenging displacement imposed by travelling through a flowing medium. However, little is known about how the ability to cope with drift improves through life and what mechanisms drive its development. We examined 3,140 days of migration by 90 GPS-tagged raptorial black kites (Milvus migrans) aged 1-27 years to show that the ability to compensate for lateral drift develops gradually through many more years than previously appreciated. Drift negotiation was under strong selective pressure, with inferior navigators subject to increased mortality. This progressively selected for adults able to compensate for current cross flows and for previously accumulated drift in a flexible, context-dependent and risk-dependent manner. Displacements accumulated en route carried over to shape the wintering distribution of the population. For many migrants, migratory journeys by younger individuals represent concentrated episodes of trait selection that shape adult populations and mediate their adaptation to climate change.","[Sergio, Fabrizio; Tanferna, Alessandro; Silva, Rafa; Blas, Julio; Hiraldo, Fernando] Estn Biol Donana CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville, Spain; [Barbosa, Jomar M.] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Elche, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Biologica de Donana (EBD); Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche,"Sergio, F (corresponding author), Estn Biol Donana CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville, Spain.",fsergio@ebd.csic.es,"Blas, Julio/A-2487-2012; Sergio, Fabrizio/B-3952-2015; Tanferna, Alessandro/L-6648-2015","Blas, Julio/0000-0003-0589-3322; Sergio, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8024-1773; Tanferna, Alessandro/0000-0003-0799-301X","Natural Research Ltd.; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2008-01781, CGL2011-28103, CGL2012-32544, PGC2018-095860-B-I00]; FEDER funds; Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and the Environment (Autonomous Organism of National Parks) [511/2012]; Consejeria de Medio Ambiente de la Junta de Andalucia [JA-58]; Junta de Andalucia [RNM 1790, RNM 3822, RNM 7307, P18-FR-4239]; Generalitat Valenciana [CIDEGENT/2020/030]","Natural Research Ltd.; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/Economy and Competitiveness; FEDER funds(European Commission); Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and the Environment (Autonomous Organism of National Parks); Consejeria de Medio Ambiente de la Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF))","We thank F.J.

Mongolian pastoral society provides an opportunity to investigate what is possible. Focus groups, interviews with key informants, decision-makers, experts and nomadic herders, and a policy workshop, were used to explore its applicability. These were complemented by a policy document analysis that assessed the level of sensitivity to ecosystem services in current land use planning practice. The study demonstrates that a sensitivity to provisioning ecosystem services is integral to traditional nomadic pastureland management. Consideration of regulating and supporting services is less developed. Exploring options for nomadic herders adapting to climate change brought out some of the challenges and opportunities of bringing traditional culture into dialogue with ecosystem services thinking. Ecosystem services thinking arrives at the local level down a governance hierarchy, and this creates risks of marginalization of local interests and understandings. Finding ways to leverage local knowledge and to use ecosystem services thinking to empower local communities are essential.","[Tugjamba, Navchaa; Walkerden, Greg] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Tugjamba, Navchaa] Mongolian Natl Univ Educ, Dept Geog, Ulan Bator, Mongolia",Macquarie University; Mongolian National University of Education,"Tugjamba, N (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",navchaa.tugjamba@mq.edu.au,,"Walkerden, Greg/0000-0001-5520-7090; Tugjamba, Navchaa/0000-0001-8436-3068",Macquarie University through the International Macquarie Research Excellence Scholarship program (iMQRES),Macquarie University through the International Macquarie Research Excellence Scholarship program (iMQRES),This research study was supported by Macquarie University through the International Macquarie Research Excellence Scholarship program (iMQRES) to the first author.

In this paper the case of Tenerife (in the Canary Islands) is analysed. Tenerife is a small island located northwest of the African continent, in the Atlantic Ocean. Tenerife presents a high vulnerability to heatwaves and Saharan dust events as a consequence of its closeness to the Saharan desert. In fact, increasing frequency of heatwaves and Saharan dust events has been reported and could worsen in the future due to global warming. An exploration of adaptation strategies to an increase of the frequency and intensity of these phenomena is therefore needed. Different social actors have been engaged in a participatory process aiming at exploring pathways for adaptation to extreme weather events. Resilience was argued as the relevant framing to address those hazards. Four focus group sessions were carried out in order to explore key transformative elements necessary to make resilient futures for Tenerife. The results highlight the need for broader climate-based policies across all sectors to assure that the island becomes resilient to climatic and non-climatic shocks.","[Hernandez, Yeray; Barbosa, Paulo] European Commiss, JRC, Directorate Space Secur & Migrat, Ispra, Italy; [Pereira, Angela Guimaraes] European Commiss, JRC, Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Hernandez, Y (corresponding author), European Commiss, JRC, Directorate Space Secur & Migrat, Ispra, Italy.",yeray.hernandez@ec.europa.eu; angela.pereira@ec.europa.eu; paulo.barbosa@ec.europa.eu,,"Guimaraes Pereira, Angela/0000-0002-6196-0799",,,,,60,15,15,0,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

To understand how the reliabilities, sensitivities, and vulnerabilities of reservoir operations vary across hydrogeologic settings, a bottom-up approach was applied to investigate the reliability of two water resources systems in the future. To represent the uncertainty associated with future streamflow, global climate model projections were integrated with a formal Bayesian uncertainty analysis and groundwater-surface water hydrologic modeling. Finally, the effectiveness of variable rule curves for mitigating the effects of climate change was evaluated. Increasing air temperature appeared to reduce the reliability of meeting summer environmental flow targets in the future by 42 and 12% for the groundwater basin and surface water basin, respectively, but had negligible impacts on reservoir refilling and flood regulation. Variable rule curves mitigated the impact of climate change on summer flow target reliability without compromising flood risk reduction. Differences in subbasin sensitivity to changing climate were evident across the two hydrogeologic settings, and uncertainty associated with modeling groundwater resources and decision thresholds were identified, with implications for reliability assessments in other basins.

In addition, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events credited to global climate change has made it increasingly clear that among the challenges faced by society water resource management is extremely necessary. In this context, desalination based on renewable energy resources integrated with production systems that make use of the waste resulting from this process becomes a socio-environmentally indicated alternative to expand existing supply strategies and sustainable water use in isolated locations, and/or areas distant from large urban centers, thus addressing local potential and reducing environmental impacts. This study assesses the use of Photovoltaic Solar Power Plants (PSPPs), as well as of residues generated in a Brackish Water Reverse Osmosis System (BWRO), in productive units linked to fish and family farming. This is as an alternative way to reduce water vulnerability in the Brazilian semi-arid area (BS), adhering to climate change adaptation measures in the light of Brazilian public policies through the Freshwater Program (Programa agua DocePAD), which aims to promote access to good quality water to approximately 500 thousand people in the Brazilian semi-arid region.","[Cavalcante Junior, Roberto Gomes; da Silva, Neilton Fidelis] Inst Educ Sci & Technol IFRN, BR-59015000 Natal, RN, Brazil; [Cavalcante Junior, Roberto Gomes; Vasconcelos Freitas, Marcos Aurelio; da Silva, Neilton Fidelis] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Energy Planning Program PPE, BR-21941914 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; [Vasconcelos Freitas, Marcos Aurelio; da Silva, Neilton Fidelis] Int Virtual Inst Global Changes, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [de Azevedo Filho, Franklin Rocha] Minist Environm Brazil, BR-70000000 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Cavalcante, RG (corresponding author), Inst Educ Sci & Technol IFRN, BR-59015000 Natal, RN, Brazil.;Cavalcante, RG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Energy Planning Program PPE, BR-21941914 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",Roberto.cavalcante@ifrn.edu.br; mfreitas@ppe.ufrj.br; neilton@ivig.coppe.ufrj.br; franklinazfilho@gmail.com,"Freitas, Marcos Aurélio/GYQ-9960-2022","Cavalcante Junior, Roberto Gomes/0000-0003-1130-6622; SILVA, NEILTON FIDELIS DA/0000-0003-2117-3894",,,,,96,9,10,2,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1996-1073,,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAR 1,2019,12,5,,,,,,,904,10.3390/en12050904,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12050904,,,20,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,HQ8AS,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000462646700137,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, a method for estimating future intensity-depth-frequency (IDF) curves in Korea is proposed using a simple scale-invariance assumption associated with trend analysis of future extreme rainfall data. First, the scale characteristics of hourly rainfall data observed at 60 meteorological stations operated by Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) are examined, and scale parameters of IDF curves are estimated from observed scale-invariance characteristics. Second, the future daily annual maximum rainfall data provided by KMA-RCM is bias-corrected. Various methods are used for the correction of biases of rainfall depths. The third is trend analysis, which is used to determine the mean and the coefficient of variance of future daily annual maximum rainfall time series in future years.

We use available geospatial data and techniques to spatially and temporally explore urbanization and land surface temperatures (LSTs) over 20 years. The effect of specific green infrastructure areas in the city on LSTs was also analyzed. Results show increased urbanization rates and increased temperature trends across time and space. But, LST in green infrastructure areas was indeed lower than adjacent impervious, urbanized areas. Seasonal phenological differences due to rainfall patterns, available planting space, and site limitations should be accounted for to maximize temperature reduction benefits.

This results in fluctuations in water availability for food production and other socioeconomic activities. Water harvesting and storage can mitigate the adverse effects of rainfall variability. But past studies have shown that when investments in water storage are not guided by environmental health considerations, the increased availability of open water surface may increase the transmission of water-related diseases. This is demonstrated for schistosomiasis associated with small reservoirs in Burkina Faso, and for malaria in Ethiopia around large dams, small dams, and water harvesting ponds. The concern is that the rush to develop water harvesting and storage for climate change adaptation may increase the risk for already vulnerable people, in some cases more than canceling out the benefits of greater water availability. Taking health issues into account in a participatory approach to planning, design, and management of rainwater harvesting and water storage, as well as considering the full range of water storage options would enable better opportunities for enhancing resilience against climate change in vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa.","[Boelee, Eline] IWMI, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Yohannes, Mekonnen] Mekelle Univ, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Poda, Jean-Noel] CNRST, IRSS, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [McCartney, Matthew; Hagos, Fitsum] IWMI, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Cecchi, Philippe] IRD UMR G EAU, IRD, Montpellier, France; [Kibret, Solomon] Univ Addis Ababa, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Laamrani, Hammou] IDRC, Cairo, Egypt",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); Mekelle University; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Addis Ababa University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Desert Research Center (DRC),"Boelee, E (corresponding author), IWMI, Colombo, Sri Lanka.",e.boelee@waterhealth.nl,"Kibret, Solomon/I-7770-2019; Hagos, Fitsum/HPE-9562-2023","Kibret, Solomon/0000-0003-1793-6908; Boelee, Eline/0000-0001-7660-5602",Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) as part of its research program on Adaptation of African Agriculture to Climate Change; CGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food (CPWF); Canadian International Development Research Centre (IDRC); CGIAR Systemwide Initiative on Malaria and Agriculture (SIMA); Poverty Reduction and Environmental Management (PREM) Programme of the Netherlands government,Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) as part of its research program on Adaptation of African Agriculture to Climate Change; CGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food (CPWF); Canadian International Development Research Centre (IDRC); CGIAR Systemwide Initiative on Malaria and Agriculture (SIMA); Poverty Reduction and Environmental Management (PREM) Programme of the Netherlands government,"This paper was prepared as one of the outputs in a project entitled Rethinking water storage for climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan Africa, funded by the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) as part of its research program on Adaptation of African Agriculture to Climate Change.

South Africa is one of the largest producers of maize crops in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. The majority of crop production is rainfed with precipitation received during the summer growing season. This study evaluated the impact of climate change on maize yields using trend and multiple regression analysis in northern South Africa. Exposure and vulnerability of maize farmers to the impacts of climate change were also evaluated. Rainfall characteristics showed variability of 20.35% with rain days standard deviation of 10.25 days and coefficient of variation of 18.57%. The results revealed a weak relationship between annual rainfall and rainy days, and annual rainfall and maize yields, both showed an r2 andp-values of less than 0.5 and 0.005, respectively. The study found that variations in rainfall did not significantly influence variation in maize yields. Despite a clear fluctuation in yields, the results demonstrate a rising trend that can be attributed to agricultural practices such as the use of fertilisers and planting drought resistant cultivars as opposed to climate variables. The study further found that maize producers were proactively adapting to climate change, thus, reducing their vulnerability to its impacts.","[Matimolane, Selelo] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Commerce Law & Management, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Matimolane, Selelo; Kori, Edmore] Univ Venda, Dept Geog & Geoinformat Sci, Thohoyandou, South Africa; [Chikoore, Hector] Univ Limpopo, Dept Geog Environm Studies, Sovenga, South Africa; [Mathivha, Fhumulani I.] Univ Zululand, Dept Hydrol, Kwa Dlangezwa, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Venda; University of Limpopo; University of Zululand,"Matimolane, S (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Commerce Law & Management, Johannesburg, South Africa.;Matimolane, S (corresponding author), Univ Venda, Dept Geog & Geoinformat Sci, Thohoyandou, South Africa.",selelom@vodamail.co.za,,"CHIKOORE, HECTOR/0000-0002-2625-8881; Mathivha, Fhumulani/0000-0001-7312-6438; Matimolane, Selelo/0000-0001-7225-4622",,,,,66,1,1,3,3,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

Quantifying the contributions of climate change and human activities to lake variation is important for water resource management and adaptation to climate change. In this study, we calculated the water volume change of Lake Qinghai, analyzed the climate and land use changes in Lake Qinghai catchment, and distinguished the contributions of climate change and local human activities to water volume change. The results showed that lake water volume decreased by 9.48 km(3) from 1975 to 2004 and increased by 15.18 km(3) from 2005 to 2020. The climate in Lake Qinghai catchment is becoming warmer and more pluvial, and the changes in land use have been minimal. Based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), land use change, climate change and interaction effect of them contributed to 7.46%, 93.13% and -0.59%, respectively, on the variation in surface runoff into the lake. From the perspective of the water balance, we calculated the proportion of each component flowing into and out of the lake and found that the contribution of climate change to lake water volume change was 97.55%, while the local human activities contribution was only 2.45%. Thus, climate change had the dominant impact on water volume change in Lake Qinghai.","[Yang, Guoqing; Zhang, Miao; Li, Jiyuan] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Northwest Land & Resources Res Ctr, Xian 710119, Peoples R China; [Xie, Zhenghui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Ma, Mingguo; Lai, Peiyu] Southwest Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing Jinfo Mt Field Sci Observat & Res Stn K, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Ma, Mingguo; Lai, Peiyu] Southwest Univ, Chongqing Engn Res Ctr Remote Sensing Big Data Ap, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Wang, Junbang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Shaanxi Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Southwest University - China; Southwest University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Zhang, M (corresponding author), Shaanxi Normal Univ, Northwest Land & Resources Res Ctr, Xian 710119, Peoples R China.",ygq_203199@snnu.edu.cn; zmzpb_198755@snnu.edu.cn; zxie@lasg.iap.ac.cn; vip@snnu.edu.cn; mmg@swu.edu.cn; peiyul@email.swu.edu.cn; jbwang@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"Zhang, Miao/0000-0001-5464-1055; Wang, Junbang/0000-0001-5169-6333",,,,,58,6,6,23,52,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JAN,2022,14,1,,,,,,,99,10.3390/rs14010099,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14010099,,,18,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,YU6FF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000752135700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Considering the deepening global interconnectedness and complex human-environment interactions, it calls for a clarity of the two concepts of risk governance and sustainability and their relationships. In this paper, a comprehensive review was provided based on scientometric analysis. A total number of 1156 published papers were studied and a considerable increase of interest in this line of research was found. The research outputs show the interdisciplinary feature of this field but with a focus on environmental issues. The journal Sustainability  was found to be the most productive journal. Geographic and institutional focus on the line of research were also visualized. Five salient research themes were identified as follows: (1) Resilience and adaptation to climate change; (2) Urban risk governance and sustainability; (3) Environmental governance and transformation; (4) Collaborative governance and policy integration; and (5) Corporate governance and sustainability. This paper provides insights into the heterogeneity of the risk governance and sustainability research. Additionally, the study unveiled the implicit relationship linking risk governance and sustainability: risk governance can be a process of participation and coordination, and a means of coping with the uncertainty and complexity to achieve sustainable outcomes. On the other hand, risk governance is a constant aim to be optimized in the process of sustainable development.","[Li, Huijie] Jilin Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Li, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Sci Lib, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Li, Jie] Liaoning Tech Univ, Coll Safety Sci & Engn, Huludao 125105, Peoples R China; [Li, Jie] Beijing Inst Technol, State Key Lab Explos Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Jilin University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Science Library, CAS; Liaoning Technical University; Beijing Institute of Technology","Li, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Sci Lib, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Li, J (corresponding author), Liaoning Tech Univ, Coll Safety Sci & Engn, Huludao 125105, Peoples R China.;Li, J (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, State Key Lab Explos Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",lihuijie@jlu.edu.cn; lijie_jerry@126.com,"Li, Jie/I-1983-2014","Li, Jie/0000-0002-4096-2795; Li, Huijie/0000-0002-6393-1094","National Social Science Fund for Young Scholars [18CZZ010]; Integrity Research Program at Jilin University [2017LZY016]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51874042, 51904185]",National Social Science Fund for Young Scholars; Integrity Research Program at Jilin University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was supported by the National Social Science Fund for Young Scholars (grant number 18CZZ010); the Integrity Research Program at Jilin University (grant number 2017LZY016); and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 51874042 and 51904185).,,93,1,1,14,48,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2021,13,21,,,,,,,12015,10.3390/su132112015,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132112015,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WX3TJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000718522100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Public adaptation decisions impact the distribution of resources and risk and thus, while not always acknowledged, such decisions are inherently social and political, with implications for equity and justice. We synthesize insights from 128 empirical case studies of processes of public decision-making pertaining to infrastructural flood risk adaptation in urban areas. We focus on urban flood risk adaptation efforts because of the growing threat of flooding in urban areas globally, the technical orientation of such investments and the social equity issues associated with urban flood exposure and response. We explore the assumptions about the decision criteria and decision-support needs presented in this research. And we document the extent to which these studies incorporate sources of knowledge on the social dimensions of flood impacts, consider social and political criteria in evaluating intervention strategies and account for issues of equity and justice in the adaptation process. We conclude with a discussion on the potential obstacles in the research community for deeper engagement with the social and political dimensions of adaptation decision support, and ways to address such obstacles.

This paper presents the results of research on the spatio-temporal patterns of atmospheric droughts as one of the most important factors hindering the formation of crop yields. The influence of several potential predictors characterizing teleconnection in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system and cosmic-geophysical factors affecting their formation is analyzed. The spatial relationships between atmospheric aridity at the individual stations of the investigated area and the wheat yield in Kazakhstan as well as its relationships with potential predictors were determined using econometric methods. High correlation was shown between wheat yield fluctuations and Multivariate El-Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), galactic cosmic radiation, solar activity, and atmospheric drought expressed through the soil moisture index, which in turn depends on precipitation levels and temperatures. The model could be modified further so that the individual components could be forecasted into the future using various time series in an ARIMA model. The resulting integration of these forecasts would allow the prediction of wheat yields in the future. The obtained results can be used in the process of creating effective mechanisms for adaptation to climate change and droughts based on their early diagnosis.","[Shmelev, Stanislav E.] Environm Europe Ltd, Oxford OX2 6JG, England; [Shmelev, Stanislav E.; Salnikov, Vitaliy; Turulina, Galina; Polyakova, Svetlana; Tazhibayeva, Tamara] Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, Fac Geog & Environm Sci, Alma Ata 050040, Kazakhstan; [Schnitzler, Tobias] World Univ Serv WUS, Austrian Comm, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Shmeleva, Irina A.] ITMO Univ, Inst Design & Urban Studies, St Petersburg 197101, Russia",Al-Farabi Kazakh National University; ITMO University,"Shmelev, SE (corresponding author), Environm Europe Ltd, Oxford OX2 6JG, England.;Shmelev, SE (corresponding author), Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, Fac Geog & Environm Sci, Alma Ata 050040, Kazakhstan.",s.shmelev@lse.ac.uk; Vitali.Salnikov@kaznu.kz; Galina.Turulina@kaznu.kz; Svetlana.Polyakova@kaznu.kz; tamara.tazhibayeva@kaznu.kz; tobias.schnitzler@wus-austria.org; irina_shmeleva@hotmail.com,"Shmelev, Stanislav Edward/K-1036-2017","Shmelev, Stanislav Edward/0000-0003-2103-0201",Republic of Kazakhstan [0376/GF],Republic of Kazakhstan,"This research was funded by Republic of Kazakhstan 0376/GF << Develop methods, models and GIS technologies to control, analyze and forecast the dynamics of desertification in the Republic of Kazakhstan >>.",,64,5,5,2,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2021,13,15,,,,,,,8583,10.3390/su13158583,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13158583,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TW1QU,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000682184700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Seasonal importance of soil moisture dynamics and impact of drought events on tree growth development and carbon sequestration potential in tropical moist forests was assessed using the teak tree ring width index and instrumental climate data from Aizawl, Mizoram. Present analysis suggests that soil moisture during months of the early growing season with low precipitation is crucial for determining the growth of teak trees in the Northeast region of India. Results of the present study reflected the impact of remote atmospheric climate regulation modes such as El Nin similar to oSouthern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Sea surface temperature (SST) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) on site climate. Results indicate that the increasing moisture stresses in the region may cause the survival risk for the other forest vegetation having low adaptability to climate change stresses with the inability to make niche shifts. Increasing the number of tree ring studies linked with eco-physiological parameters of tree growth is recommended to better visualize the level of stresses on the trees in the moist tropical forests.

Managing forests on MATL, especially under climate change, involves prioritizing certain ecosystem services. We used an iterative survey of experts' opinions to identify those ecosystem services that 1) have high utility-services that the Tribe uses, or could use, and are obtained directly or indirectly from the MATL; 2) are irreplaceable-services that cannot be provided by any other natural resource; and 3) are under a high level of threat-services at risk of declining or being lost directly or indirectly by climate change and thus are critical for management. Both scientists and practitioners identified water and cultural services as management priorities. Management recommendations to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects include reintroduction of fire in the landscape, assisted migration, creation of age/size mosaics across the landscape, and incorporation of green energy. Incorporating human perspectives into natural resource management is a critical component to maintain and adapt social-ecological systems to climate change, especially for Indigenous communities with inherent rights of sovereignty who are deeply connected to natural resources.

Measured by the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST), the effect is frequently called surface UHI (SUHI). In Estonia, the SUHI has been studied little and the LST method has not being used yet in studies of Estonian cities' microclimate. The analysis clearly reveals that the effect of UHI in Estonian settlements is larger than ever assumed. Satellite images showed that Tallinn suffers from quite strong UHI effect. Landsat-8 thermal infrared sensor image from July 25, 2014 shows that for all settlements of densely populated Harju County, the temperature is higher than that in the surroundings by 3 degrees C-5 degrees C. To evaluate potential impact to the health of vulnerable groups of residents of Tallinn city, we applied an exposure to risk-sensitivity-impact method to evaluate the potential impact of the UHI effect on the health of vulnerable groups of residents of Tallinn city. Our analysis showed that the parts of Tallinn severely affected by heat are mostly the areas of apartment buildings with lower real estate prices. Thus, those areas have also a higher population density and more vulnerable people live there.

Greatly enhanced investment in agriculture by a broad range of stakeholders will be required if this sector is to meet the food security requirements of tomorrow's Africa. However, production uncertainty associated with between and within season rainfall variability remains a fundamental constraint to many investors who often over estimate the negative impacts of climate induced uncertainty. Climate change is likely to make matters worse with increases in rainfall variability being predicted. The ability of agricultural communities and agricultural stakeholders in SSA to cope better with the constraints and opportunities of current climate variability must first be enhanced for them to be able to adapt to climate change and the predicted future increase in climate variability. Tools and approaches are now available that allow for a better understanding, characterization and mapping of the agricultural implications of climate variability and the development of climate risk management strategies specifically tailored to stakeholders needs. Application of these tools allows the development and dissemination of targeted investment innovations that have a high probability of biophysical and economic success in the context of climate variability.

Designing both sustainable and resilient constructions would help to face such effects; however, sustainability and resilience in design have been mostly treated separately so far. Since sustainability has been considered more than resilience, paying deeper attention to the latter is indispensable to reducing building vulnerability. The purpose of this article is to examine the commonalities between the sustainability and resilience of buildings using two different approaches: (i) a systematic literature review, taking into consideration a 10-year period for selecting records, and (ii) an analysis of five green building rating systems and five resilience rating systems and guidelines selected according to their popularity and number of certified buildings. There is an overlap in some indicators between the two domains at the building level, as shown by the results from both paths. These aspects could assist in considering sustainability and resilience from the very beginning of the design process. This will ensure that buildings may be designed more effectively by considering and enhancing the synergies between the two domains. This paper targets potential stakeholders who may be interested in including such an integrated implementation in their designs.","[Felicioni, Licia; Lupisek, Antonin] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Thakurova 2077-7, Prague 16629, Czech Republic; [Felicioni, Licia; Gaspari, Jacopo] Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture, Via Risorgimento 2, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; [Lupisek, Antonin] Czech Tech Univ, Univ Ctr Energy Efficient Bldg, Trinecka 1024, Bustehrad 1024, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague; University of Bologna; Czech Technical University Prague,"Felicioni, L (corresponding author), Czech Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Thakurova 2077-7, Prague 16629, Czech Republic.;Felicioni, L (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture, Via Risorgimento 2, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",licia.felicioni@cvut.cz,"Felicioni, Licia/AAX-1529-2020; Lupisek, Antonin/A-7180-2013","Felicioni, Licia/0000-0003-0133-6887; Lupisek, Antonin/0000-0002-3142-2631","Czech Technical University in Prague [SGS22/084/OHK1/2 T/11]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports [LTT19022]","Czech Technical University in Prague; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","This research has been supported by the Czech Technical University in Prague [grant number SGS22/084/OHK1/2 T/11] and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports within and within project INTER-EXCELLENCE No. LTT19022.",,86,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2023,15,1,,,,,,,884,10.3390/su15010884,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15010884,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7S1IU,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000910515600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, improving structural diversity is an effective climate change adaptation strategy in forest management. The aim of this study was to implement a methodology which allows distinct reforested areas such as a single green infrastructure to be managed according to the surrounding land use and the characteristics of the forest stands. 240 hectares of Mediterranean stone pine forests located along a 16 km strip of the Lazio coast (Central Italy) were mapped. Twelve attributes describing the pine stands and showing possible constraints for future management decisions were associated to each forest patch. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to group the pinewood patches according to their similarity level and five different groups were identified. For each group, different silvicultural methods were proposed to guide the compositional and structural evolution of the stands, in order to make them suitable for providing services required locally and increasing overall diversity at landscape scale. The results of the study highlight how coastal land uses can offer effective inputs to differentiate the management of forest systems and therefore achieve greater variety and resilience in the landscape over time. This approach is particularly useful in the case of very homogeneous stands such as the stone pine reforestations under study.","[Portoghesi, Luigi; Tomao, Antonio; Bollati, Simone; Angelini, Alice; Agrimi, Mariagrazia] Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Agrofood & Forest Syst DIBAF, Viterbo, Italy; [Tomao, Antonio] Res Ctr Forestry & Wood, Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Arezzo, Italy; [Mattioli, Walter] Res Ctr Forestry & Wood, Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Rome, Italy",Tuscia University; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Tomao, A (corresponding author), Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Agrofood & Forest Syst DIBAF, Viterbo, Italy.;Tomao, A (corresponding author), Res Ctr Forestry & Wood, Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Arezzo, Italy.",antonio.tomao@unitus.it,"Tomao, Antonio/ABG-3180-2021","Tomao, Antonio/0000-0001-6656-400X; Mattioli, Walter/0000-0003-2107-1038",project EUFORICC -Establishing Urban Forest based solutions In Changing Cities [PRIN 20173RRN2S],project EUFORICC -Establishing Urban Forest based solutions In Changing Cities,We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for comments and suggestions that improved the manuscript.

Additionally, climate-change adaptation issues have been tackled through Mayors Adapt since 2016. The Covenant of Mayors (CoM), a volunteer movement of local administrators established in 2008, set a target of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020. The CoM has launched a new season on energy planning in Europe based on Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs), defining actions for selected intervention sectors. The aim of the work was to evaluate the state of the Italian CoM signatories, assessing the results achieved in terms of the Municipalities involved (CoM signatories), the SEAPs developed and the Monitoring Reports submitted. Specifically, the analysis of the Monitoring Reports data represents a relevant step needed in order to formulate some critical appraisals concerning the performance level of CoM adoption at a national scale, in terms of the commitment levels, goals achieved and actions completed or in progress. The paper also compares national figures with a regional detailed survey developed for the Basilicata Region. It represents a benchmark useful for interpreting the general results derived from the CoM official data and a marker for pointing out suggestions for improving the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM) adoption procedures.","[Santopietro, Luigi; Scorza, Francesco] Univ Basilicata, Sch Engn, Lab Urban & Reg Syst Engn LISUT, I-85100 Potenza, Italy",University of Basilicata,"Santopietro, L (corresponding author), Univ Basilicata, Sch Engn, Lab Urban & Reg Syst Engn LISUT, I-85100 Potenza, Italy.",lgusnt@gmail.com; francesco.scorza@unibas.it,,"Santopietro, Luigi/0000-0001-9175-0525",,,,,49,19,19,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,3,,,,,,,1289,10.3390/su13031289,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13031289,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QD6XA,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000615657100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Evidence has shown that climate change exacerbates the situation and presents a daunting challenge to predominantly rain-fed agricultural livelihoods. The aim of this study was to analyze the extent and sources of smallholder famers' livelihood vulnerability to climate change/variability in the Upper Blue Nile basin. We conducted a household survey (n = 391) across three distinct agroecological communities and a formative composite index of livelihood vulnerability (LVI) was constructed. The Mann-Kendall test and the standard precipitation index (SPI) were employed to analyze trends of rainfall, temperature, and drought prevalence for the period from 1982 to 2016. The communities across watersheds showed a relative difference in the overall livelihood vulnerability index. Aba Gerima (midland) was found to be more vulnerable, with a score of 0.37, while Guder (highland) had a relatively lower LVI with a 0.34 index score. Given similar exposure to climate variability and drought episodes, communities' livelihood vulnerability was mainly attributed to their low adaptive capacity and higher sensitivity indicators. Adaptive capacity was largely constrained by a lack of participation in community-based organizations and a lack of income diversification. This study will have practical implications for policy development in heterogeneous agroecological regions for sustainable livelihood development and climate change adaptation programs.","[Abeje, Misganaw Teshager; Berihun, Mulatu Liyew] Tottori Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, 4-101 Koyama Minami, Tottori 6808553, Japan; [Abeje, Misganaw Teshager] Bahir Dar Univ, Inst Disaster Risk Management & Food Secur Studie, POB 79, Bahir Dar 6000, Ethiopia; [Tsunekawa, Atsushi; Nigussie, Zerihun; Tsubo, Mitsuru] Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, 1390 Hamasaka, Tottori 6800001, Japan; [Haregeweyn, Nigussie] Tottori Univ, Int Platform Dryland Res & Educ, 1390 Hamasaka, Tottori 6800001, Japan; [Nigussie, Zerihun; Adgo, Enyew; Ayalew, Zemen] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Bahir Dar 5501, Ethiopia; [Elias, Asres] Tottori Univ, Fac Agr, 4-101 Koyama Minami, Tottori 6808550, Japan; [Berihun, Daregot] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, POB 79, Bahir Dar 6000, Ethiopia; [Quandt, Amy] San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Berihun, Mulatu Liyew] Bahir Dar Univ, Bahir Dar Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Water Resource Engn, POB 26, Bahir Dar 6000, Ethiopia; [Masunaga, Tsugiyuki] Shimane Univ, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Matsue, Shimane 6900823, Japan",Tottori University; Bahir Dar University; Tottori University; Tottori University; Bahir Dar University; Tottori University; Bahir Dar University; California State University System; San Diego State University; Bahir Dar University; Shimane University,"Abeje, MT (corresponding author), Tottori Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, 4-101 Koyama Minami, Tottori 6808553, Japan.;Abeje, MT (corresponding author), Bahir Dar Univ, Inst Disaster Risk Management & Food Secur Studie, POB 79, Bahir Dar 6000, Ethiopia.",tmisganaw16@gmail.com; tsunekawa@tottori-u.ac.jp; nigussie_haregeweyn@yahoo.com; zeriye@gmail.com; enyewadgo@gmail.com; zayalew@gmail.com; tsubo@tottori-u.ac.jp; asres97@yahoo.com; daregot21@gmail.com; Amy.Quandt@colorado.edu; mulatuliyew@yahoo.com; masunaga@life.shimane-u.ac.jp,"Nigussie, Zerihun/AAV-9190-2020; Tsubo, Mitsuru/C-4027-2016; Quandt, Amy/AAP-1716-2021; Nigussie, Zerihun/AAA-5865-2021; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/L-8526-2013; Elias, Asres/D-4847-2019; Abeje, Misganaw/AAA-4130-2020; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/J-5616-2015; Berihun, Mulatu Liyew/AAC-9461-2019; Abeje, Misganaw/AAH-7923-2019","Tsubo, Mitsuru/0000-0002-8729-2215; Nigussie, Zerihun/0000-0002-8001-2073; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/0000-0002-7690-0633; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/0000-0003-2920-8094; Berihun, Mulatu Liyew/0000-0003-4101-1518; Abeje, Misganaw/0000-0001-6271-6459; Quandt, Amy/0000-0001-7434-1500","Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS)-Development of a Next-Generation Sustainable Land Management (SLM) Framework to Combat Desertification project, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International [JPMJSA1601]","Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS)-Development of a Next-Generation Sustainable Land Management (SLM) Framework to Combat Desertification project, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International","This research was funded by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS)-Development of a Next-Generation Sustainable Land Management (SLM) Framework to Combat Desertification project, Grant Number JPMJSA1601, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).",,89,15,15,2,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2019,11,22,,,,,,,6302,10.3390/su11226302,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11226302,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JW8DR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000503277900115,View Full Record in Web of Science

Development practitioners invest in scaling these to have a wider impact. We use the example of the Western Highlands in Guatemala to illustrate how a focus on the number of farmers adopting CSA can foster a tendency to homogenize farmers, instead of recognizing differentiation within farming populations. Poverty is endemic in the Western Highlands, and inequitable land distribution means that farmers have, on average, access to 0.06 ha per person. For many farmers, agriculture per se does not represent a pathway out of poverty, and they are increasingly reliant on non-agricultural income sources. Ineffective targeting of CSA, hence, ignores small-scale farming households' different capacities for livelihood transformation, which are linked to the opportunities and constraints afforded by different livelihood pathways, agricultural and non-agricultural. Climate-smart interventions will often require a broader and more radical agenda that includes supporting farm households' ability to build non-agricultural-based livelihoods. Climate risk management options that include livelihood transformation of both agricultural and non-agricultural livelihoods will require concerted cross-disciplinary research and development that encompasses a broader set of disciplines than has tended to be the case to date within the context of CSA.","[Hellin, Jon] IRRI, Sustainable Impact Platform, Manila 1301, Philippines; [Fisher, Eleanor] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England",CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); University of Reading,"Hellin, J (corresponding author), IRRI, Sustainable Impact Platform, Manila 1301, Philippines.",j.hellin@irri.org; e.fisher@reading.ac.uk,,"Hellin, Jon/0000-0002-2686-8065","United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through its Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative; CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Rice Agri-food Systems (RICE, 2017-2022); CRP on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through its Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative; CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Rice Agri-food Systems (RICE, 2017-2022); CRP on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","The research in Guatemala reported here was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through its Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative, 'Feed the Future'.

The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission's observations represent a remarkable tool that can provide insight into the dynamics of terrestrial hydrology in areas where direct in situ observations are limited. In order to evaluate the impact of interannual and multidecadal climate variability on groundwater resources, this study assesses the relationship between synoptic controls on climate and total water storage estimates from (i) GRACE from 2002 to 2013 and (ii) a two-variable climate-driven model that is able to reconstruct past storage changes from 1982 to 2011. The estimates are then compared to time series of groundwater levels to show the extent to which total water storage covaries with groundwater storage. Results indicate that rainfall patterns associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are the main driver of changes in interannual groundwater storage, whereas the Atlantic MultiDecadal Oscillation (AMO) plays a significant role in decadal to multidecadal variability.

Several international studies have reported that individuals from ethnic minorities are at increased risk of heat-related illness, for reasons that are not often discussed. Objective: The aim of this article is to investigate the underpinning reasons as to why ethnicity may be associated with susceptibility to extreme heat, and how this may be relevant to Australia's population. Design: Drawing upon literary sources, the authors provide commentary on this important, yet poorly understood area of heat research. Results: Social and economic disparities, living conditions, language barriers, and occupational exposure are among the many factors contributing to heat-susceptibility among minority ethnic groups in the United States. However, there is a knowledge gap about socio-cultural influences on vulnerability in other countries. Conclusion: More research needs to be undertaken to determine the effects of heat on tourists, migrants, and refugees who are confronted with a different climatic environment. Thorough epidemiological investigations of the association between ethnicity and heat-related health outcomes are required, and this could be assisted with better reporting of nationality data in health statistics. Climate change adaptation strategies in Australia and elsewhere need to be ethnically inclusive and cognisant of an upward trend in the proportion of the population who are migrants and refugees.","[Hansen, Alana; Bi, Linda; Saniotis, Arthur] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Nitschke, Monika] S Australian Dept Hlth & Ageing, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Hansen, A (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Discipline Publ Hlth, Mail Drop DX650 207, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",alana.hansen@adelaide.edu.au,"Saniotis, Arthur/AAM-9367-2021; Nitschke, Monika/GNP-3597-2022; saniotis, arthur/AAW-2594-2021","Saniotis, Arthur/0000-0002-9708-6220; ",Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency); National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency)(Australian Government); National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,"This work was carried out with financial support from the Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) and the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility.

Through a detailed outline of the methodological approach employed in this initiative as well as the findings that it produced, we consider how action research might serve to reveal the power relations, systemic drivers of vulnerability, and opportunities for sustainable action for social change related to climate impacts. As co-facilitators of this process based in a Northern research institution, we reflect upon the challenges, limitations and benefits of the approach used in order to identify potential areas for improvement and to understand how the dynamics of this partnership shaped collaboration. We also discuss how employing a systemic approach to action research helped to provide insights into the interactions between the physical and environmental impacts of climate change and related systems such as land tenure and agricultural production. A systemic approach to PAR, we argue, lends itself especially well to analysis of climate change adaptation and resilience, both of which are embedded within complex systems of institutions, assets, individuals and structures, and therefore not appropriate for narrow or one-dimensional analyses. Finally, we consider the specific contributions and challenges that engaging community radio as a research partner may offer to investigations on climate change.","[Harvey, Blane] IDS Climate Change Team, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Burns, Danny; Oswald, Katy] IDS, Participat Power & Social Change Team, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Burns, Danny] Univ W England, SOLAR Act Res Ctr, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Burns, Danny] Univ Bristol, Sch Policy Studies, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England; [Burns, Danny] Tenant Participat Advisory Serv, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Burns, Danny] Decentralisat Res & Informat Ctr, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Sussex; University of West England; University of Bristol,"Harvey, B (corresponding author), IDS Climate Change Team, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",,,"Harvey, Blane/0000-0002-6626-4290; Burns, Danny/0000-0002-0001-6171",,,,,39,4,4,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0265-5012,,,IDS BULL-I DEV STUD,IDS Bull.-Inst.

However, seemingly similar conversations during a co-creation workshop in Uppsala resulted in both trust and distrust, and thereby influenced consequent possibilities for the co-creation of knowledge. Therefore, this article focuses on how trust influences knowledge sharing and how knowledge sharing influences trust. We use a case study approach to analyze the Uppsala co-creation workshoppart of the Climate Change Adaptation and Water Governance (CADWAGO) projectby comparing 25 conversations, making use of theories on swift trust and trust dynamics. We found four different conversation patterns (1) sending; (2) defending; (3) misunderstanding; and (4) connecting. The first three patterns influenced trust negatively and did not lead to knowledge sharing, whereas pattern four showed trust development and co-creation of knowledge. From our comparative analyses, we conclude that trust starts to emerge when there is mutual openness and empathy visible in turn-taking patterns. More specifically, trust emerges when communication styles allow for recognition and exploring underlying needs and wishes, resulting in a more dynamic dialogue, further trust development, and connection between actors. Our list of conversation patterns is provisional but we argue that understanding how different kinds of interactions can lead to trust or distrust is crucial to understanding why and how learning takes placeinsights that are essential for fostering learning and transformations in water governance.","[de Vries, Jasper R.; van Bommel, Severine] Wageningen Univ, Strateg Commun Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Blackmore, Chris] Open Univ, Sch Engn & Innovat, Appl Syst Thinking Practice Grp, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Asano, Yoshiko] Japan Womens Univ, Fac Human Sci & Design, Dept Housing & Architecture, Bunkyou Ku, 2-8-1 Mejirodai, Tokyo 1128681, Japan",Wageningen University & Research; Open University - UK; Japan Womens University,"de Vries, JR (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Strateg Commun Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",jasper.devries@wur.nl; severine.vanbommel@wur.nl; chris.blackmore@open.ac.uk; asayoshi55@hotmail.com,"van Bommel, Severine/AAA-7002-2020","/0000-0002-4365-8860; van Bommel, Severine/0000-0002-7782-9162",Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Compagnia di San Paolo; VolkswagenStiftung as part of the Europe and Global Challenges Programme [GC12-1545:1],Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Compagnia di San Paolo(Compagnia di San Paolo); VolkswagenStiftung as part of the Europe and Global Challenges Programme,"This article was developed under the CADWAGO project (Climate Adaptation and Water Governance Project; http://www.cadwago.net) and funded by Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, Compagnia di San Paolo, and VolkswagenStiftung as part of the Europe and Global Challenges Programme (grant number GC12-1545:1).

In the age of climate change, there could be cascading failures through a range of infrastructure breakdowns. Direct and indirect damage costs could exceed what had been estimated in traditional risk assessments. This could be exacerbated through abrupt price peaks in international supply chains of minerals, and through events happening in remote parts of the world that affect extraction and vulnerable industries. The core argument made here is one of feedbacks: climate adaptation has significant resource implications, and how resources are being used will have implications on climate strategies. Industrial Ecology has a role to play assessing those interactions and providing a better grasp of the spatial dimension of material flows, partly to track those flows and align them to specific actors, and partly to address interlinkages across different flows and their stocks ('the resource nexus'). Methodological novelties are needed to better understand the resource base and the socio-economic dimension, especially on innovations and transitions that can help to cope with the challenges ahead. Altogether this would enable research to establish an evidence base on sustainable materials to deliver parts of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to reassess infrastructure assets and the mineral resources in the age of climate adaptation and resilience.","[Bleischwitz, Raimund] UCL, Inst Sustainable Resources, BSEER, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Bleischwitz, R (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Inst Sustainable Resources, ISR BSEER, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",r.bleischwitz@ucl.ac.uk,,"Bleischwitz, Raimund/0000-0001-8164-733X",,,,,39,5,5,2,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

The paper presents twelve criteria for the effective transboundary conservation of terrestrial biodiversity. These criteria can assist in the evaluation of existing initiatives and the design of future ones.

Its impacts have already been felt and projected to cause more impacts on sectors essential for economic development including freshwater resources. Although it is becoming clear that transformative adaptation is indispensable as climate change impacts increase, most adaptation strategies have largely been envisioned to be incremental with little attention to transformative adaptation. To fill part of such information gap, this paper assessed if responses of water insecure coastal communities of Tanzania are incremental or transformative. Simple random sampling procedure was used to obtain 97 households, while purposive sampling procedure was used to select key informants. Quantitative data were subjected to descriptive statistics, whereas qualitative data were analysed through content analysis. Results indicated that water security has decreased in the past 30 years. Most response strategies used by people in the area are incremental, weak and undesirable for effective as well as successful adaptation to climate change. This study recommends for development practitioners and other stakeholders to help local people institute transformative adaptation.","[Magesa, Bahati A.] Dar Es Salaam Univ, Coll Educ, Dept Geog & Econ, POB 2329, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Pauline, Noah M.] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Inst Resource Assessment, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",University of Dar es Salaam; University of Dar es Salaam,"Magesa, BA (corresponding author), Dar Es Salaam Univ, Coll Educ, Dept Geog & Econ, POB 2329, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.",bahatially134@gmail.com,"Pauline, Noah Makula/ABD-3692-2020","Pauline, Noah Makula/0000-0001-6560-2932","Norwegian Programme for Capacity Development in Higher Education and Research for Development (NORHED); Center for Climate Change Studies, University of Dar es salaam","Norwegian Programme for Capacity Development in Higher Education and Research for Development (NORHED); Center for Climate Change Studies, University of Dar es salaam","The authors are grateful for research funding from the Norwegian Programme for Capacity Development in Higher Education and Research for Development (NORHED) and Center for Climate Change Studies, University of Dar es salaam.",,53,3,3,4,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Of this energy, 34.8% is used by buildings for space heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. This energy often involves the combustion of fossil fuels, contributing to carbon dioxide emissions and climate change. Even if greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere, extreme climate events and sea level rise will continue for several centuries due to inertia of the atmosphere. Therefore, adaptation will be a necessary compliment to carbon dioxide mitigation efforts. This paper argues that both mitigation of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change should be added to our building codes and stan- dards. Since space heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning utilize a large amount of energy in buildings, we should begin by redefining our thermal comfort standards and add strategies that mitigate carbon dioxide emissions and adapt to predicted climate variability.

To best understand why the EDSS are not being used in the long term, the end users of the EDSS should be consulted-a perspective that is lacking in the literature. The research reported here presents the perspectives of stakeholders involved in a community climate change adaptation project in western Canada. Evidence from the community suggests that this project was successful in instigating change. However, the EDSS was not used after the project's end.

This paper focuses on the utility of socio-economic scenarios for vulnerability, risk and adaptation research. The paper introduces the goals and functions of scenarios in general and reflects on the current global debate around shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). It examines the options and constraints of scenario methods for risk and vulnerability assessments in the context of climate change and natural hazards. Two case studies are used to contrast the opportunities and current constraints in scenario methods at different scales: the global WorldRiskIndex, based on quantitative data and indicators; and a local participatory scenario development process in Jakarta, showing a qualitative approach. The juxtaposition of a quantitative approach with global data and a qualitative-participatory local approach provides new insights on how different methods and scenario techniques can be applied in vulnerability and risk research.","[Birkmann, Joern; Welle, Torsten; Garschagen, Matthias; Setiadi, Neysa] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, Bonn, Germany; [Cutter, Susan L.] Univ S Carolina, Hazards & Vulnerabil Res Inst, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Rothman, Dale S.; Hughes, Barry] Univ Denver, Pardee Ctr Int Futures, Denver, CO USA; [van Ruijven, Bas; O'Neill, Brian] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Preston, Benjamin L.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN USA; [Kienberger, Stefan] Salzburg Univ, Interfac Dept Geoinformat Z GIS, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Cardona, Omar D.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Inst Estudios Ambientales IDEA, Manizales, Colombia; [Siagian, Tiodora] Govt Indonesia, Stat Indonesia BPS, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Hidayati, Deny] Indonesian Inst Sci LIPI, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Binder, Claudia R.] Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany; [Pulwarty, Roger] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of Denver; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Salzburg University; Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Statistics Indonesia; National Research & Innovation Agency of Indonesia (BRIN); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI); University of Munich; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Birkmann, J (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, Bonn, Germany.",birkmann@ehs.unu.edu; stefan.kienberger@sbg.ac.at,"van Ruijven, Bas/G-8106-2011; CARDONA, OMAR DARIO/HOC-8271-2023; Hidayati, Deny/GYD-5749-2022; O'Neill, Brian C./E-6531-2013; Toro, Johan A/P-9939-2016; Cutter, Susan/R-8849-2019; Preston, Benjamin L/B-9001-2012; Rothman, Dale/HLW-8715-2023; Birkmann, Joern jb/J-5736-2015","van Ruijven, Bas/0000-0003-1232-5892; CARDONA, OMAR DARIO/0000-0001-8233-5450; O'Neill, Brian C./0000-0001-7505-8897; Cutter, Susan/0000-0002-7005-8596; Preston, Benjamin L/0000-0002-7966-2386; Kienberger, Stefan/0000-0002-4800-4516",,,,,35,55,57,3,77,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Nature-Based Solutions, Ecosystem-based Adaptation, Green Infrastructure and Natural Water Retention Measures are examples of ecosystem-based initiatives that have been promoted by the European Commission to address a variety of policy goals. In this context, ecosystem-based approaches for Disaster Risk Reduction aim at improving the condition and resilience of ecosystems in urban, rural and wilderness areas and as such, contribute to implementing the new Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, while also contributing to achieving other policy objectives - from biodiversity conservation to climate change adaptation. The European Commission has also been actively engaging the research community to better address disaster risk management knowledge and technology gaps through its Research and Innovation strategy and Framework Programmes, notably Horizon 2020. Research has shown that ecosystem-based approaches are often cost-effective and provide a wide range of co-benefits for local and regional economies, social cohesion and the broader environment.

In this paper, we investigate whether or not insights into premodern strategies for coping with climate change-and especially the deeper histories of traditional ways-of-knowing-can play a useful role in future planning, management and mitigation efforts. We do this in two ways. First, we assess this special issue's 17 archaeological case studies, in order to determine whether they are conducted within a framework that is consistent with approaches to resilience in studies of modern Arctic communities. Second, we focus on three climate-driven challenges faced by Canadian Arctic Inuit: safe travel, food security and food safety. For each, we identify specific ways in which studies of past social-ecological systems intersect with modern climate adaptation. We conclude that since archaeological insights highlight the operation of decision-making processes within long-term culture-adaptive trajectories, they can offer unique insights into the much shorter-term processes currently underway. While we highlight many potential directions for productive collaboration, much more work is required in local and regional settings to demonstrate the full potential of archaeology for future-oriented planning and mitigation efforts.","[Desjardins, Sean P.

However, the annual productivity of apples in the area is relatively low and the interannual yield gap varies drastically. Identifying the apple yield gap and interannual production constraints can potentially promote the sustainable development of apple production. Based on track monitoring data of 45 smallholder farmers from 2016 to 2018, the yield gap and constraint factors were determined by adopting boundary analysis methodology. The results showed that the yield potential of apples during 2016-2018 was 75, 108, and 87 t ha(-1), and actual yields were 36.8, 52.3, and 35.2 t ha(-1), respectively. The explainable yield gaps were 40.5, 56.9, and 55.1 t ha(-1). Soil, management, and climatic factors limit apple yield improvement. Among these, low temperatures during the bud break and flowering periods can induce yield losses. Soil nutrient content and fertilizer management are also important limiting factors that have polynomial relationships with yield. Too much fertilizer and high levels of nutrients in the soil have already caused yield losses in some fields. Sound scientific guidance to help farmers adopt reasonable management techniques adapted to climate change is necessary to close the yield gap.","[Duan, Zhiping; Zheng, Chengjuan; Zhao, Shuaixiang; Feyissa, Tesema; Merga, Tefera; Zhang, Weifeng] China Agr Univ, Natl Acad Agr Green Dev, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Dept Plant Nutr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yuanmao] Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Hort Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Crop Biol, Tai An 271018, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Shandong Agricultural University,"Zhang, WF (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Natl Acad Agr Green Dev, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Dept Plant Nutr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",wfzhang@cau.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Weifeng/0000-0002-6675-2075",,,,,57,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2311-7524,,HORTICULTURAE,Horticulturae,DEC,2022,8,12,,,,,,,1131,10.3390/horticulturae8121131,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae8121131,,,17,Horticulture,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,7E6RP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000901292800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet these benefits are distributed unequally, mirroring the uneven distribution of the urban forest in many cities. Contrasting theories have been proposed to explain these observed patterns that focus either on the economic wherewithal of individuals (the 'luxury effect'), or the outcome of structural factors such as municipal decision-making processes. Here, we explore patterns across 10 municipal authorities in greater Melbourne, Australia to compare the relative importance of these competing mechanisms. We show that both individual and structural processes are both major determinants of the density and diversity of trees in this large Australian city. Interestingly, education level was strongly related to tree density, while household income was negatively related to tree density and diversity in some municipalities. The luxury effect was not able to adequately explain the patterns observed in Melbourne. This finding has important implications for the planning and management of urban forests and the equitable distribution of the benefits they provide, in the context of the rapid expansion of urban populations across the globe. To counteract inequity, local municipalities must acknowledge and deliberately overcome internal biases that favour the provision of street trees to more advantaged sections of the community.","[Threlfall, Caragh G.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Threlfall, Caragh G.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Gunn, Lucy Dubrelle; Davern, Melanie] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kendal, Dave] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog Planning & Spatial Sci, Hlth Landscapes Res Grp, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Melbourne; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Tasmania,"Kendal, D (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog Planning & Spatial Sci, Hlth Landscapes Res Grp, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",dave.kendal@utas.edu.au,"kendal, dave/HJY-3311-2023; Threlfall, Caragh/Y-2292-2018","kendal, dave/0000-0003-2816-1722; Threlfall, Caragh/0000-0002-4197-8588",Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub - Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program; Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Partnership grant [LP160100780]; Centre for Research Excellence in Healthy Liveable Communities grant [1061404]; NHMRC Australian Prevention Partnership Centre grant [9100001]; Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute; City of Ballarat; City of Hume; City of Melbourne; City of Moreland; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [9100001] Funding Source: NHMRC,Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub - Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program; Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Partnership grant(Australian Research Council); Centre for Research Excellence in Healthy Liveable Communities grant; NHMRC Australian Prevention Partnership Centre grant(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute; City of Ballarat; City of Hume; City of Melbourne; City of Moreland; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"This research was supported by the Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub, funded by the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program, the Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Partnership grant #LP160100780, Centre for Research Excellence in Healthy Liveable Communities grant #1061404 and the NHMRC Australian Prevention Partnership Centre grant #9100001, and the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute.

A logistic regression model and a multivariate probit model were applied to a set of primary data collected from a survey of 290 farm households in two mountainous provinces of Northeastern Vietnam. Results show that farm households combined various strategies in response to the impacts of climate hazards. Changes in farm activities and livelihood diversification were the two most widely used adaptation strategies. Farm households' choice of adaptation strategies was influenced by a set of complex factors related to demographic characteristics, economic well-being, access to resources, and perception. Age and farming experience negatively affected farm households' adaptation. Meanwhile, access to resources, savings, extension services, membership of associations, access to information, and perception had a significantly positive effect on the adoption of adaptation strategies. Social-economic barriers restricted female-headed and ethnic minority households from taking up adaptation measures that required new technologies, updated knowledge, or resources. It is essential to issue policies and implement projects to enhance adaptive capacity and facilitating the adaptation process for farm households in mountainous areas, taking into account the barriers and disadvantages of female and ethnic minority farmers.","[Hang Thi Minh Bui; Tai Anh Do] Thai Nguyen Univ Econ & Business Adm, Thai Nguyen City, Thai Nguyen Pro, Vietnam",Thai Nguyen University,"Bui, HTM (corresponding author), Thai Nguyen Univ Econ & Business Adm, Thai Nguyen City, Thai Nguyen Pro, Vietnam.",hangbui.tn@gmail.com,,"Bui, Hang Thi Minh/0000-0002-2684-8793",,,,,43,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0343-2521,1572-9893,,GEOJOURNAL,GeoJournal,DEC,2022,87,6,,,,,4947,4960,,10.1007/s10708-021-10544-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10544-w,,NOV 2021,14,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,5Z2SK,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000717416000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mangroves, particularly mangrove restoration, was the most common ecosystem used, followed by coral reefs. EbA across ecosystems commonly targeted capacity building and livelihood enhancement, and maintenance of wildlife, alongside shoreline protection for mangroves and food security for coral reefs. Integrated EbA and marine spatial planning projects were participatory, implemented at local-regional scales, displayed adaptive management, and community-based or shared governance. Our research helps to build an understanding of EbA in practice and a knowledge base to assist coastal communities in adapting to climate change.","[Giffin, Alyssa L.; Connolly, Rod M.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Giffin, Alyssa L.; Connolly, Rod M.] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Brown, Christopher J.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Brown, Christopher J.] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Nalau, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Adaptat Sci Grp, Cities Res Inst CRI, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Mackey, Brendan G.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program GCCRP, Environm Futures Res Inst, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Giffin, AL (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.;Giffin, AL (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",alyssa.giffin@griffithuni.edu.au,"Brown, Christopher J/G-4287-2011; Nalau, Johanna/V-5692-2018; Mackey, Brendan/ABE-3805-2020; Connolly, Rod/C-4094-2008","Brown, Christopher J/0000-0002-7271-4091; Nalau, Johanna/0000-0001-6581-3967; Connolly, Rod/0000-0001-6223-1291; Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064; Giffin, Alyssa/0000-0002-3317-6729",Global Wetlands Project (GLOW); Australian Government Scholarship; Discovery Early Career Researcher Award from the Australian Research Council [DE160101207]; EcoAdapt,Global Wetlands Project (GLOW); Australian Government Scholarship(Australian Government); Discovery Early Career Researcher Award from the Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); EcoAdapt,"This review was supported by The Global Wetlands Project (GLOW) and EcoAdapt.

Moreover, management decisions are influenced by a combination of local knowledge, expert recommendations and on-farm experimentation. Although many smallholder farmers actively experiment with new crops and technologies, little is known about the prevalence of experimentation or the types of experiments farmers conduct. This study examined the decision-making processes of experimenting farmers to explore the drivers of on-farm experimentation. Using a mixed-methods design that incorporated field observations, survey data and in-depth interviews, we identified numerous examples of experiments with new crops, varieties and techniques that had been executed either independently or through participation in an agricultural development project. Results of quantitative and qualitative analysis reveal that smallholder farmers in Malawi across a range of socioeconomic characteristics are inclined to experiment, and gender roles in agricultural experimentation vary widely. While experimental methods differ between farmers, there are commonalities in the drivers of experimentation, including adapting to climate change, improving soil health, improving nutrition and generating income. Smallholders have a great capacity for experimentation, and their knowledge, experience, preferences and priorities - if properly understood and incorporated - could ultimately benefit both future agricultural development projects and their participants.","[Hockett, Michele; Richardson, Robert B.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, 480 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Richardson, RB (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, 480 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",rbr@msu.edu,,"Richardson, Robert/0000-0001-7113-3896",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation (Africa RISING) program as part of the US Government's Feed the Future Initiative,United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation (Africa RISING) program as part of the US Government's Feed the Future Initiative(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This study benefitted from contributions and insights from Dr Sieglinde Snapp, Dr Regis Chikowo and Mr. Alex Smith.

Contemporary environmental and social problems are complex and accompanied by uncertainty. Decisions must be made in the face of this uncertainty. In this address, geographers are encouraged to embrace, rather than minimize, complexity and uncertainty in their research and in their interactions with decision makers. Adaptation to climate change is used to illustrate the ubiquitous uncertainty surrounding problem solving and how the choice of assessment framework can overemphasize some sources of uncertainty and ignore others. A challenge is to communicate the information about complexity and uncertainty that decision makers need for robust and flexible decision making but at the same time prevent uncertainty from being equated with a lack of consensus and used as a reason for inaction. Geographers need to be open to a plurality of approaches to decision making and acknowledge uncertainty in their own research. Reframing the communication of uncertainty and the development of novel educational tools and learning materials for decision makers will facilitate decision making. Sustained engagement with decision makers, including the coproduction of knowledge, can also lead to greater consideration of complexity and uncertainty and to improved decision making. Rather than keeping it simple, geographers should keep it complex.","[Winkler, Julie A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, Geog, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Winkler, JA (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, Geog, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",winkler@msu.edu,,,"Environmental Protection Agency [R83081401-0]; National Science Foundation [SES 0622954, CNH 0909378]",Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This address was informed by research and outreach partially supported by the Environmental Protection Agency [# R83081401-0] and the National Science Foundation [SES 0622954, CNH 0909378].

These filmic meditations serve as the springboard for considering the limits of adaptation', increasingly mainstreamed in policy discourse and development projects to redress the ravages of global warming and climate change, and that increasingly target the lives of Muslim farmers who live on chars (silt islands) that accrete and erode within the Jamuna River in Bangladesh. The article explores how the focus on adaptation to climate change, while producing preparedness for a looming future, carries within it the destructive potential for the corruption of chaura inter-relations and the further corruption of their memory of co-existence with Hindus/fishermen and the elision of issues of historical injustice. Taking a river's point of view within the milieus of the films and the chars enables a perspective, necessarily fleeting, on how the politics and policies of climate change stand to short-change the present and the past.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Anthropol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Khan, N (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Anthropol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",nkhan5@jhu.edu,,,Wenner-Gren Foundation; American Institute of Bangladesh Studies; Andrew Mellon Foundation,Wenner-Gren Foundation; American Institute of Bangladesh Studies; Andrew Mellon Foundation,"This article is based on research conducted in Bangladesh with the help of funding provided by the Wenner-Gren Foundation and the American Institute of Bangladesh Studies.

We identify the cattle grid as an anticipatory object through which conservation organisations seek to manage the future and adapt to climate change, but which at the same time presences that unthought-of future for others in the landscape. We explore the ways in which the cattle grid acts to presence something that is not only absent climate change but has uncertain imminence. We investigate the ways in which the cattle grid make climate relevant as an embodied and experiential process, a physical and intellectual artefact, and the means to imagine climate and the ways it might change. Drawing upon interpretative approaches informed by theorisations of materiality, presence and absence to understand climate change as a social phenomenon, we go beyond a consideration of this ordinary object defined by its function to consider how the object is experienced, the processes and practices through which people relate to it, and the ways in which social meaning accumulates around it. The empirical basis for this argument is provided by in-depth interviews with local representatives of Natural England, residents and farmers.","[Leyshon (nee Brace), Catherine; Geoghegan, Hilary] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Penryn TR11 9EZ, Cornwall, England",University of Exeter,"Leyshon, C (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Penryn TR11 9EZ, Cornwall, England.",cbrace@exeter.ac.uk,,"Geoghegan, Hilary/0000-0003-1401-8626",,,,,22,14,14,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-0894,,,AREA,Area,JUN,2012,44,2,,,,,237,244,,10.1111/j.1475-4762.2012.01082.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4762.2012.01082.x,,,8,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,940RZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000303912100014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The city of Pori at the delta of the river is the most significant flood risk area in Finland. The preparation of a flood risk management plan (FRMP) for the Kokemaenjoki River Basin as a national pilot began in 2007 and will be finalised during 2011. The main challenges of the FRMP are the reconciliation of flood risks and various interests in different parts of the river basin, and adaptation to climate change. It has been predicted that climate change will alter the flood dynamics of the Kokemaenjoki River: the highest flow peaks will shift from spring to late autumn and winter and the risk of ice jam floods will increase. Development of the existing early warning systems and adaptive lake regulation practices are the two most important non-structural measures for preventing and mitigating flood damage. A new channel in the mid-river reach would help to manage the increasing winter flows. Also robust structural flood protection measures will be needed in the city of Pori. Nevertheless, close collaboration among authorities, municipalities and water body regulators will be critical in successful flood risk management in the Kokemaenjoki River Basin.

Port operators are currently focusing on the sustainable development of ports to measure this environmental impact and determine the emissions inventory. To combat climate change globally, Turkiye envisages reduction of its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rate by 21% until 2030. In line with this target, container ports are also focusing on the sus-tainability of their environmental impact and determining their emissions inventory. This study aims to estimate the total carbon emissions produced by the container handling equipment (CHE) used in the container port operations and to plan the carbon emission reduction strategy as concerns the climate change adaptation policy. The Ambarli container port, which handles approximately 30% of Turkiye's total container volume, has been chosen as the application area of this case study. Carbon emissions from CHE vehicles in the port were estimated using the activity-based method. The carbon emission value per TEU in 2021 is calculated as 0.011335 tCO2e/ TEU. Carbon emission reduction scenarios were created at two-year intervals until 2030. It has been determined that the dominant contribution to carbon emission in the container port is provided by terminal tractors that consume diesel fuel.","[Oksas, Olgay] Istanbul Univ Cerrahpasa, Maritime Transportat Management Engn Fac Engn, TR-34320 I?stanbul, Southern Ethiop",,"Oksas, O (corresponding author), Istanbul Univ Cerrahpasa, Maritime Transportat Management Engn Fac Engn, TR-34320 I?stanbul, Southern Ethiop.",olgay.oksas@iuc.edu.tr,,,,,,,53,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

There have been calls for a more coordinated approach to planning for current and future flood risks, but is planning rising to the challenge? We apply the Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard (PIRS) methodology to spatially evaluate policies that would impact physical vulnerability to flooding in the network of different city plans that shape land use and steer development in Boston, MA and Fort Lauderdale, FL. Unlike previous applications of this approach, we look at how the plan network is changing over time. Between 2015 and 2019, attention on climate change grew in both cities, as did the number of plans and policies across the network with the potential to decrease physical vulnerability. New types of plans, such as climate change adaptation plans, play an important role in reducing flood risks. However, plans perpetuate past disparities in policy attention. As the first study to analyze how city networks of plans and their potential impact on resilience evolve over time, this work has important implications for planning scholarship and practice as well as hazard and climate change governance more broadly.","[Woodruff, Sierra; Matos, Melina; Roy, Malini; Malecha, Matthew; Yu, Siyu] Texas A&M Univ, Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Meerow, Sara; Gilbertson, Philip] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Berke, Phil] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Berke, Phil] Univ N Carolina, Inst Environm, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Hannibal, Bryce] US Census Bur, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Suitland, MD 20746 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Meerow, S (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",swoodruff@tamu.edu; Sara.Meerow@asu.edu; pggilber@asu.edu; bryce.hannibal@census.gov; melina_matos@tamu.edu; mr956@tamu.edu; mmalecha@arch.tamu.edu; yusiyu_1989@tamu.edu; pberke@email.unc.edu,,"Malecha, Matthew/0000-0003-4200-6593; Meerow, Sara/0000-0002-6935-1832","National Science Foundation [1825123, 1825367]; U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate [0031369]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate(United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS)),This work was funded by the National Science Foundation award #1825123 & 1825367.

Recent climate change adaptation policy strives to promote bottom-up, citizen-driven initiatives to improve local resilience. How and under what conditions citizens may engage in collective action remains unclear, however. We employ a mixed-methods approach in Eastern Tyrol, Austria, combining stakeholder workshops with a survey of 216 citizens at risk. Results show that bottom-up citizen initiatives can provide multiple benefits, such as increasing risk awareness and local adaptive capacities. While citizens are open-minded to assuming a broad range of activities and responsibilities, local stakeholders in natural hazard management prefer to limit civic engagement to support roles, mostly during recovery from a natural hazard event. Citizen initiatives tend to emerge in communities with weak institutional capital. This may lead to conflicts with existing institutions over allocation of competences and power. Contrastingly, social and human forms of capital support the formation of initiatives; however, low willingness of citizens to assume leadership positions may be a bottleneck for sustained initiatives. Public administration and emergency organisations should address current institutional barriers.

However, climate warming in the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau has been greater than two times the global average, and regional climate appears to be shifting with potential to trigger large-scale ecosystem regime shifts (landscape traps'). A host of other driversurbanization/infrastructure development, land-use/agricultural practices, upstream/downstream water management and ongoing nation-state security conflictsinteract with climate signals to produce complex changes across ecological and social systems. In response, highlands people are evolving hybrid forms of adaptive capacity where bottom-up' behaviors are mixing with top-down' state and market policies. To increase ecosystem and livelihood resilience to future change, there is a need to link upstream and downstream conservation action with local climate adaptation. While the key problem is that institutional and government capacity for coordination is low, we present four general strategies to move forward: application of cross-sector coordinated planning, strategic integration of science-based conservation with developing local-level hybrid knowledge, recognition of the critical role of governance in support of change, and increased emphasis on environmental security. We discuss these strategies for each driver of change in the region. (C) 2014 The Authors. WIREs Climate Change published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Xu, Jianchu; Grumbine, R.

We analyzed the motivations, actions, and potential barriers to action of forest managers toward climate adaptive forest management practices. Results suggest that managing for natural regeneration is the most common climate adaptive forest management approach considered by forest managers in both regions. Lack of information about the best strategies for reducing climate change risks, lack of education and awareness among the clients, and perceived client costs were forest managers' primary barriers to climate adaptive management.

Understanding the interacting drivers of groundwater change enables better human adaptations to climate change and socioeconomic development. Here we use a structural equation model to quantify the contribution of natural and human-induced processes on the groundwater of China by using terrestrial water storage observed by GRACE in combination with climate and socioecological related data at a provincial scale. The results reveal that the influence of climate on groundwater change through indirect impact on the agriculture water consumption is larger than that through direct replenishment. Socioeconomic development contributes in the same order of magnitude as the direct replenishment by climate variabilities to groundwater. In general, forest plays an important role in reserving groundwater at a provincial scale. Based on future climate projections and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, it is projected that most regions in China will experience a greater groundwater depletion in the future and the variance among regions will become larger.","[Liu, Kai; Zhang, Jianxin; Wang, Ming] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Natl Safety & Emergency Management, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Kai] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Liu, K (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Natl Safety & Emergency Management, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Liu, K (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",liukai@bnu.edu.cn,,"Liu, Kai/0000-0002-7687-7824",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771538]; National Key Research and Development Plan [2017YFC1502901],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Plan,National Natural Science Foundation of China (41771538) and the National Key Research and Development Plan (2017YFC1502901).,,50,0,0,13,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,OCT,2022,14,19,,,,,,,4825,10.3390/rs14194825,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14194825,,,13,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,5G5SF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000867057900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A survey questionnaire was administered to 157 randomly selected farm managers in the Gabes-North area, and descriptive statistics and a multinomial logistic model were used to analyze the data collected from irrigants. The climate variability felt by irrigants is explained by a decrease in precipitation and by an increase in temperature. To address this, two adaptation strategies are distinguished. A first category is called defensive. It aims to adapt production systems to the water available on the farm taking into account existing wells and boreholes. The second category is called offensive. It consists of investing in acquiring the water needed to maintain the farm's production system. The main determinants of adaptation are given by the perception of CC, by the diversification of sources of income, by the farmers' age, by education and by access to extension services.","[Mahdhi, Naceur; Chouikhi, Fareh] Inst Reg Arides, Medenine, Tunisia; [Smida, Zaineb] Inst Super Etud Technol Medenine, Medenine, Tunisia",Institut des Regions Arides,"Mahdhi, N (corresponding author), Inst Reg Arides, Medenine, Tunisia.",naceur.mahdhi@ira.rnrt.tn,,,,,,,57,0,0,2,2,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2022,21,1,,,,,89,108,,10.30682/nm2201f,http://dx.doi.org/10.30682/nm2201f,,,20,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,0O1BK,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000783264300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is particularly the case in Gujarat, India, which is experiencing fluctuating monsoon rains and seasons. Local institutions there are ill-equipped to assist farmers in adapting to these changes. However, farmers are adapting to climate change, largely through livelihood diversification, in the absence of formal state intervention. Using qualitative methods, we conducted adaptive capacity assessments and assessed vulnerability perceptions in 3 villages, involving 120 farmers from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Combining vulnerability perceptions with adaptive capacity assessments, we better observed the mismatch between rural development policy with the potential to aid in adaptation processes that address local needs, identifying why policy fails to increase the adaptive capacity of the agriculturalists most vulnerable to climate impacts. Decentralizing adaptation programmes to community-level institutions can increase the efficacy of climate interventions by emboldening latent institutions, while not widening the socioeconomic gap of a rapidly modernizing India.","[Stock, Ryan; Birkenholtz, Trevor] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Nat Hist Bldg,Second Floor,1301 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Garg, Amit] Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Publ Syst Grp, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,"Stock, R (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Nat Hist Bldg,Second Floor,1301 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",rjstock2@illinois.edu,,,American Institute of Indian Studies; US Fulbright Commission,American Institute of Indian Studies; US Fulbright Commission,This work was supported by American Institute of Indian Studies [Critical Language Enhancement Award]; US Fulbright Commission [Fulbright-Nehru Research Award].,,97,20,21,2,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Existing econometric studies are not able to separately identify the impacts of heat and water stress because higher temperatures cause damages through both mechanisms. To resolve the identification problem, I introduce measures of water deficit and water surplus into a regression analysis that estimates the nonlinear impacts of heat and water stress on nonirrigated rental rates in the central United States. The results indicate rental rate losses of 33% ($9.5 billion annually) by mid-century due to climate change in scenario RCP 4.5. I find that 65% of the projected damages are due to heat stress, 32% due to increasing water deficit, and 3% due to increasing water surplus.

The approaches included reducing anthropogenic stressors, protecting key ecosystem features, maintaining representation, replicating, restoring, identifying refugia and relocating organisms. The results showed that the expert teams had the greatest scientific confidence in adaptation options that reduce anthropogenic stresses.

Building on scholarship from feminist geography, gender and development and feminist political ecology, it charts a new way of theorising disaster risk and resilience from a gendered perspective through the analytic of the everyday, and substantiates this with findings from ethnographic research conducted between 2016 and 2017 in disaster-prone informal settlements in the Philippines. As this case reveals, a focus on the everyday helps to uncover the multiple subjective embodiments of risk and insecurity and the structural systems that underpin related inequalities and exclusions. Crucially, the lens of 'the everyday' also exposes the social reproductive labours and power hierarchies embedded in community-based DRRM and resilience-building programmes; insights which are vital to advancing more inclusive, sustainable and socially just approaches to disaster risk governance and climate change adaptation.","[Ramalho, Jordana] UCL, Bartlett Dev Planning Unit DPU, 34 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9EZ, England",University of London; University College London,"Ramalho, J (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Dev Planning Unit DPU, 34 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9EZ, England.",j.ramalho@ucl.ac.uk,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Ramalho, Jordana/AAP-4315-2021","Ramalho, Jordana/0000-0003-4614-968X",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/J500070/1]; ESRC [ES/T006870/1]; ESRC [ES/T006870/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The research on which this article draws was funded by an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Postgraduate Award offered by the Department of Geography, London School of Economics and Political Science (ES/J500070/1).

Using selected coastal communities in the Keta municipality, this study explores the vulnerabilities of coastal communities in Ghana and the effectiveness of emerging adaptation interventions. Evidence for the study was gathered through a review of relevant secondary documents; a household survey; focus group discussions and institutional consultations. The paper reveals several hydro meteorological risks (e.g., shoreline erosion, storm surges) which threaten the inundation of some communities and the destruction of infrastructure and coastal resources. While there is evidence of adaptive governance in terms of institutional efforts (construction of sea defence wall), there is limited state commitment towards climate change adaptation and poor local community engagement. State interventions require co-ordinated and sustained efforts from national and local level institutions to ensure adaptation and resilience to coastal vulnerability.","[Poku-Boansi, Michael; Amoako, Clifford; Owusu-Ansah, Justice Kufuor] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana; [Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Melbourne,"Poku-Boansi, M (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana.",pokuboansi@gmail.com,,,,,,,52,0,0,1,1,UNIV GHANA,LEGON,"ECOLOGICAL LAB, BOX LG 59, LEGON, 00000, GHANA",0855-4730,,,GHANA SOC SCI J,Ghana Soc.

Four main conceptualizations of vulnerability in the literature include vulnerability as a threshold, as exposure to hazards, as a pre-existing condition, and as an outcome. Three main conceptualizations of resilience are resilience as resistance, as recovery, and as creative transformation. This study investigates how local practitioners in Metro Vancouver municipalities perceive and apply these concepts to reduce risk and adapt to flood hazards. Results from focus groups and surveys of practitioners find that the conceptualizations of vulnerability and resilience perceived as most valuable are often not applied in local risk reduction and adaptation efforts. Participants' interpretations of how vulnerability and resilience concepts are applied to four main adaptation strategiesprotect, accommodate, avoid, and retreatreveal nuanced and complex challenges at the intersection of where theory meets practice.

The EU has become a major player in the political arena and seeks to reach worldwide agreements on 'mitigation' policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Despite speaking with one voice at the global scale, the effects of climate change on European territories vary widely according to local circumstances. The ESPON scenarios explore what those impacts could be, and what effect EU climate change adaptation policies would have. The first scenario envisions an EU policy limited to emergency funds following extreme events like floods and droughts. In the second scenario, the EU takes a much more proactive stance by funding radical and costly adaptation strategies. The exercise demonstrates the difficulty in identifying the cost-effectiveness of each approach. Territorial effects are often indirect and affect a variety of economic, social and ecological systems. Moreover, a great deal of uncertainty exists surrounding their magnitude and timing.

The challenge of polycentric land use governance is alignment of goals across diverse governance mechanisms when agricultural producers, public agencies, and corporations have distinct motivations. This case study of soil carbon governance on California rangelands explores a new payment for ecosystem services (PES) initiative led by the food and agriculture industry, called the Ecosystem Services Market Consortium (ESMC). Applying hybrid governance theory to agricultural lands, we conduct an ex-ante policy evaluation of potential policy impact based on (i) alignment between corporate sustainability goals and ranchers' priorities and (ii) complementarity of the ESMC market with existing public and private policies enabling rangeland conservation. We found corporations developing the PES market to be motivated by carbon insetting, the objectives of which converge with ranchers' goals of preserving soils. Each policy offers distinct benefits and challenges, with synergies around climate change adaptation and soil health. As a new policy tool, carbon markets like the ESMC are positioned to meet demand for soil health financing, support resilience and ranch productivity, and improve ranchers' access to soil health data for adaptive management. Given carbon markets' outcome-based payment structure, we highlight the importance of complementary governance mechanisms that mitigate upfront risk with financial and technical support during the transition period, including Farm Bill cost-share programs and private sector financing tools. This policy evaluation highlights the challenges and opportunities surrounding rangelands soil carbon governance, particularly the trade-offs that ranchers, corporations, and society at large must consider for landscape-scale conservation programs.","[Biggs, Nicole Buckley; Hafner, Jayce; Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mashiri, Fadzayi E.] Univ Calif Cooperat Extens, Berkeley, CA USA; [Huntsinger, Lynn] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lambin, Eric F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Georges Lemaitre Earth & Climate Res Ctr, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain, Belgium",Stanford University; University of California System; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Stanford University; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Biggs, NB (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Huntsinger, Lynn/G-5453-2011","Huntsinger, Lynn/0000-0001-9444-4152; Buckley Biggs, Nicole/0000-0002-2635-7257; Lambin, Eric/0000-0002-0673-5257",Anne and Reid Buckley Fund of Stanford University's Emmet Interdisciplinary Program in Environment & Resources (E-IPER); Emmett Family Collaboration Grant Fund,Anne and Reid Buckley Fund of Stanford University's Emmet Interdisciplinary Program in Environment & Resources (E-IPER); Emmett Family Collaboration Grant Fund,"This work was made possible by generous funding from the Anne and Reid Buckley Fund in Support of Stanford University's Emmet Interdisciplinary Program in Environment & Resources (E-IPER) and the Emmett Family Collaboration Grant Fund.

The study area is located in Alicante San Gabriel neighborhood - at the mouth of Ovejas ravine, which has registered numerous flood episodes, the most serious was occurred in October 1982. As a result of this flood, the final section of this ravine was channeled. To verify the efficiency of the channeling, a flood modeling has been carried out with the same flow rate recorded in said episode (475 m(3)/s). The results show that, despite channeling, the Ovejas ravine would overflow at various points along its course. A new flood risk mapping and a series of proposals to reduce flood risk and adaptation to climate change, which must be addressed by the administrations (local, regional and state) involved, are presented.","[Olcina Cantos, Jorge] Univ Alicante, Dept Anal Geog Reg & Geog Fis, Alicante, Spain; [Oliva Canizares, Antonio] Univ Alicante, Planificac Espacios Regionales, Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant,"Cantos, JO (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Anal Geog Reg & Geog Fis, Alicante, Spain.",jorge.olcina@ua.es; antoniogeografia1@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,2,UNIV GRANADA,GRANADA,"CUESTA DEL HOSPICIO S-N, CAMPUS UNIV, GRANADA, 18071, SPAIN",0210-5462,2340-0129,,CUAD GEOGR,Cuad.

Most advisors interviewed accept that weather events are a risk for US Midwestern agriculture; however, they are more concerned about tangible threats such as crop prices. There is not much concern about climate change among agricultural advisors. Management practices that could help producers adapt to climate change were more likely to be recommended by conservation and Extension advisors, while financial and crop advisors focused more upon season-to-season decision making (e.g., hybrid seeds and crop insurance). We contend that the agricultural community should integrate long-term thinking as part of farm decision making processes and that agricultural advisors are in a prime position to influence producers.

The survey study of 241 fishers is done in one of the largest fish-landing sites in Jamaica. Fishers are asked about levels of knowledge about causes of climate change, concerns and the consequences, and actual adaptation behaviors. Using descriptive and inferential statistical tests, the paper explores the actual levels of knowledge, concerns, and specific strategies used to adapt. However, its goes further by examining the factors that drive the aforementioned variables.

Both the opening of the cave shaft to the surface and its infilling by clastic sediments are attributable to accelerated landscape erosion associated with the 9.3 ka BP climatic deterioration. Evidence that wild boar had died in winter or spring suggests that their deaths relate to the prolonged periods of annual snow cover experienced by the uplands of northwest England during the 9.3 ka BP event. The dominance of wild boar in the pit fall assemblage is explained by the snow pack concealing the open shaft and turning it into a baited trap for wild boar whenever it contained carrion. Wild boar bones splintered and chewed by wild boar demonstrate carrion cannibalism. Human presence is attested by slight butchery to an aurochs (Bos primigenius).

Despite this recognition, the weight of evidence suggests that entrenched gender inequalities continue to create barriers for women's engagement in conservation management and related projects like those for climate change adaptation. Against the dominant narrative that women are always marginal in environmental management in the Pacific, we draw on the small stories provided by women in communities around the Arnavon Islands in the Solomon Islands to show that in fact women are deeply engaged in conservation efforts and environmental care. Building on the concept of emplaced sustainability, we reframe what counts as the work of environmental conservation to include the mundane, small and everyday activities undertaken by women. Rather than marginal, the collective mundane and everyday work of women takes place alongside the 'important' or 'big' work of conservation in the region and we argue that both kinds of labouring matter for sustaining ecological livelihoods.","[Fidali, Kristina L.; Larder, Nicolette] Univ New England, Human Geog, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia",University of New England,"Larder, N (corresponding author), Univ New England, Human Geog, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia.",nlarder@une.edu.au,,"Larder, Nicolette/0000-0001-8119-4879",,,,,56,2,2,1,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1360-7456,1467-8373,,ASIA PAC VIEWP,Asia Pac.

Considering the Atlantic influence, air temperature observations from Lisbon's mesoscale network are used to investigate the interactions between background weather and the urban thermal signal (UTS) in summer. Days are classified according to the prevailing regional wind direction, and hourly UTS is compared between HW and non-HW conditions. Northern-wind days predominate, revealing greater maximum air temperatures (up to 40 degrees C) and greater thermal amplitudes (approximately 10 degrees C), and account for 37 out of 49 HW days; southern-wind days have milder temperatures, and no HWs occur. Results show that the wind direction groups are significantly different. While southern-wind days have minor UTS variations, northern-wind days have a consistent UTS daily cycle: a diurnal urban cooling island (UCI) (often lower than -1.0 degrees C), a late afternoon peak urban heat island (UHI) (occasionally surpassing 4.0 degrees C), and a stable nocturnal UHI (1.5 degrees C median intensity). UHI/UCI intensities are not significantly different between HW and non-HW conditions, although the synoptic influence is noted. Results indicate that, in Lisbon, the UHI intensity does not increase during HW events, although it is significantly affected by wind. As such, local climate change adaptation strategies must be based on scenarios that account for the synergies between potential changes in regional air temperature and wind.","[Oliveira, Ana; Niza, Samuel] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, IN Ctr Innovat Technol & Policy Res, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Lopes, Antonio; Correia, Ezequiel] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Estudos Geog, IGOT Inst Geog & Ordenamento Terr, P-1600276 Lisbon, Portugal; [Soares, Amilcar] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CERENA, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Oliveira, A (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, IN Ctr Innovat Technol & Policy Res, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",anappmoliveira@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; antonio.lopes@campus.ul.pt; ezequielc@campus.ul.pt; samuel.niza@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; asoares@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Correia, Ezequiel LT/D-2959-2017; Correia, Ezequiel/AAI-3573-2021; Oliveira, Ana/AAI-8860-2021; Niza, Samuel/A-6592-2009; Lopes, Antonio/F-3217-2010","Correia, Ezequiel LT/0000-0002-4026-7020; Correia, Ezequiel/0000-0002-4026-7020; Niza, Samuel/0000-0003-0679-4027; Lopes, Antonio/0000-0002-9357-7639; Soares, Amilcar/0000-0001-5232-2376; Oliveira, Ana/0000-0003-1564-2180",,,,,60,13,13,3,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,MAR,2021,12,3,,,,,,,292,10.3390/atmos12030292,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12030292,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,RD2FI,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000633300400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In accordance with this trend, Costa Rica has undergone a process of implementing ecological corridors as to promote ecological connectivity since the 1990s, with the establishment of 44 ecological corridors covering 38% of Costa Rica's territory. Nevertheless, there is no research evaluating these corridors on a national scale that takes into account their functions as conduits, barriers, and habitats. Thus, the objective of this research was to describe the process of biological corridor formation in Costa Rica, and to evaluate the potential effectiveness of corridors by considering aspects of landscape structure and ecological processes related to connectivity and fragmentation. We used the National Program of Ecological Corridors database along with coverage analysis from Landsat images from 2000 and 2015.The composition of the biological corridors was determined at the landscape scale and related to potential to maintain a specific population of wild mammals weighing more than 10 kg. The composition of the ecological corridors was highly variable in terms of total area, proportion of natural habitat, and fragmentation process. Most biological corridors are capable of maintaining viable populations of Pecari tajacu and Tapir bairdii, while none could maintain populations of Panthera onca and Tayassu pecari. Only 50% of the biological corridors had improved in their connectivity. Therefore, public policies, such as master plans focusing on ecosystem restoration must be established. In addition, only two biological corridors incorporate the majority of elevation ranges (Life Zones) present in the country, which reduces the potential of the corridor system as a tool for climate change adaptation.","[Morera Beita, Carlos; Sandoval Murillo, Luis Fernando] Natl Univ, Geog Sch, Apdo 86-3000, Heredia, Costa Rica; [Alfaro Alvarado, Luis Diego] Natl Univ, ICOMVIS, Heredia, Costa Rica",,"Beita, CM (corresponding author), Natl Univ, Geog Sch, Apdo 86-3000, Heredia, Costa Rica.",cmorera@una.cr,,"Morera Beita, Carlos/0000-0002-4014-6122","National University, Costa Rica","National University, Costa Rica","National University, Costa Rica",,70,9,9,27,94,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2578-4854,,CONSERV SCI PRACT,Conserv.

Season-long heat stress can reduce photosynthesis and accelerate senescence; if extreme heat stress is experienced during flowering, both rice and wheat may also experience decreased pollen viability and stigma deposition, leading to increased grain sterility. Where farmers are unable to implement within-season management adaptations, significant deviations from expected climatic conditions would affect crop growth, yield, and therefore have important implications for food security. The influence of climatic conditions on crop growth have been widely studied in growth chamber, greenhouse, and research station trials, although empirical evidence of the link between climatic variability and yield risk in farmers' fields is comparatively scarce. Using data from 240 farm households, this paper responds to this gap and isolates the effects of agronomic management from climatic variability on rice and wheat yield risks in eight of Pakistan's twelve agroecological zones. Using Just and Pope production functions, we tested for the effects of crop management practices and climatic conditions on yield and yield variability for each crop. Our results highlight important risks to farmers' ability to obtain reliable yield levels for both crops. Despite variability in input use and crop management, we found evidence for the negative effect of both season-long and terminal heat stress, measured as the cumulative number of days during which crop growth occurred above critical thresholds, though wheat was considerably more sensitive than rice. Comparing variation in observed climatic parameters in the year of study to medium-term patterns, rice, and wheat yields were both negatively affected, indicative of production risk and of farmers' limited capacity for within-season adaptation. Our findings suggest the importance of reviewing existing climate change adaptation policies that aim to increase cereal farmers' resilience in Pakistan, and more broadly in South Asia. Potential agronomic and extension strategies are proposed for further investigation.","[Arshad, Muhammad; Amjath-Babu, T.

A single high-resolution climate simulation is generally insufficient to quantify the uncertainty of a given scenario projection. For Greenland, this becomes a critical issue because of a lack of high-resolution climate experiments for this region. Therefore, we introduce and test a new method to solve this uncertainty assessment problem. Using the regional climate model (RCM) HIRHAM5 over Greenland in combination with an ensemble of RCM simulations from a different geographical setting, (i.e. EURO-CORDEX), we investigate to what extent the uncertainty of projected climate change at high resolution can be evaluated from corresponding temperature spreads in a wider set of global climate models (GCMs), that is, CMIP5. The study is based on a set of time-slice simulations down-scaled with HIRHAM5 at 5.5 km resolution for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for Greenland with boundary information from the GCM EC-Earth. Our proposed uncertainty assessment method establishes a foundation on which high-resolution and relatively costly regional climate projections can be assessed as well as when using only a single RCM without the presence of analogous down-scaling experiments with other RCMs and GCMs, and instead relying on existing information from CMIP5. Thus, the uncertainty of a wide range of climate indices that scales with temperature can be evaluated and quantified through the inter-model temperature spread within CMIP5.","[Olesen, Martin; Christensen, Jens Hesselbjerg; Boberg, Fredrik] Danish Meteorol Inst, Lyngbyvej 100, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Christensen, Jens Hesselbjerg; Kaas, Eigil] Niels Bohr Inst, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Christensen, Jens Hesselbjerg] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, Jahnebakken 5, N-5007 Bergen, Norway",Danish Meteorological Institute DMI; University of Copenhagen; Niels Bohr Institute; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE),"Olesen, M (corresponding author), Danish Meteorol Inst, Lyngbyvej 100, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",mol@dmi.dk,"Christensen, Jens Hesselbjerg/C-4162-2013; Kaas, Eigil/M-2590-2014","Christensen, Jens Hesselbjerg/0000-0002-9908-8203; Kaas, Eigil/0000-0001-6970-2404",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC [610055]; Danish Cooperation for Environment in the Arctic (DANCEA) under the Danish Energy Agency,European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Danish Cooperation for Environment in the Arctic (DANCEA) under the Danish Energy Agency,"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Regional Climate and the Working Group on Coupled Modelling, former coordinating body of CORDEX and responsible panel for CMIP5.

Yet, a multi-aspect TESE model has never been used in Korea to adapt to climate change through sustainable energy policies. This comprehensive TESE study addresses several sustainability challenges in the Korean energy sector. First, demand electricity is predicted using four deep and stacked neural networks to develop a smart demand-based model. Second, optimal hybrid renewable microgrids (HRMGs) are simulated at 17 sites to evaluate five renewable energy sources in three scenarios. Third, hybrid assessment results are clustered using a K-means algorithm to generate hybrid renewable energy maps for South Korea. Fourth, the TESE model is analyzed with more than 13 variables using a cascading multi-criteria decision-making approach to prorate a budget and develop a prioritized roadmap for a sustainable 2030 in Korea. Fifth, a stochastic linear mathematical model is developed to propose a sustainable energy policy that considers the water-energy-carbon nexus. The results show that a convolutional neural network can efficiently predict sequential demand electricity (R-2 = 98.79%), with respective biogas, solar, hy-drostatic, wind, and hydrokinetic energy fractions of 45.7%, 34.5%, 14%, 5.78%, and 0.01% under optimal conditions in Korea. The present free market-based policies are recommended to be revised in favor of domestic production of renewable energy facilities if new jobs can be created for more than $7500 each, and the carbon penalty cost can be kept below $83/ton CO2-eq in Korea.","[Ifaei, Pouya; Charmchi, Amir Saman Tayerani; Loy-Benitez, Jorge; Yoo, ChangKyoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Engn, Ctr Environm Studies, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Seocheon Dong 1, Yongin 446701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Yang, Rebecca Jing] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Solar Energy Applicat Lab, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Kyung Hee University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Yoo, C (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Engn, Ctr Environm Studies, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Seocheon Dong 1, Yongin 446701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",ckyoo@khu.ac.kr,,"Yoo, ChangKyoo/0000-0002-9406-7649; Ifaei, Pouya/0000-0002-6898-8583; , Amir Saman/0000-0001-5153-3403; Yang, Rebecca/0000-0002-0418-1967",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [2019H1D3A1A02071051]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2021R1A2C2007838]; Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE),"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE)(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by Brain Pool Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (2019H1D3A1A02071051) , a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2021R1A2C2007838) , and Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as Graduate School specialized in Climate Change.",,158,2,2,3,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

What are the factors that make arid successional processes successful, how to expedite, and how to enable their use for the ecological revegetation of densely populated drylands? We review restoration methods that combine the planting of shelterbelt compartments with successional revegetation of the internal area, protected from wind and drought. Various measures of assisted natural succession can be applied to greatly accelerate the revegetation, including soil tillage, amendment with organic matter and the inoculation with cyanobacteria or lichens to form biocrusts. The aim is to initiate the development of native, water-saving savanna with biodiversity, resilience and adaptability to climate change. A narrow twin shelterbelt module could facilitate the use of natural succession within inhabited and peri-urban areas, also serving as protective greenbelt for cities. A pilot is planned in a peri-urban area of Northern Iraq, with a successional area of 125-150 m between shelterbelts. Land-use of agriculture, gardening and recreation can be integrated within the successional area, which also generates engagement of residents in the maintenance work. Planting of shelterbelts is required on 10-25% (not 100%) of the restoration area, therefore the use of assisted succession within protective compartments is expected to have both, ecological and economic advantages over large-scale afforestation.","[Al-Quraishi, Ayad M.

Methods The findings are based on survey data obtained from 350 smallholder farmers in the East Gonja district of Northern Ghana. We adopted the generalized Poisson regression model in identifying factors influencing farmers' participation in the GHG emission practices and inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) to estimate the impact of CSA adoption on GHG emissions. Results Most farming households engaged in at least one emission activity. The findings of the generalized Poisson model found that wealthier households, higher education, and households with access to extension services were less likely to participate in GHG emission activities. There was also evidence that CSA adoption significantly reduces GHG emissions. Conclusion Advocacy in CSA adoption could be a necessary condition for environmental protection through the reduction of GHG emissions.","[Israel, Michael Ayeah; Amikuzuno, Joseph; Danso-Abbeam, Gideon] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tamale, Ghana",University for Development Studies,"Danso-Abbeam, G (corresponding author), Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tamale, Ghana.",danscabbeam@uds.edu.gh,,,,,,,38,10,10,7,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,2192-1709,,ECOL PROCESS,Ecol.

The generalized extreme value (GEV) analysis method is employed to establish the recurrence models for predicting the fire weather index of given return period and the associated fire intensity. To examine the impacts of the climate change, a moving GEV method is utilized to the weather data records over the period of 44 years.

Complex pathways that underlie this association are not fully understood; however, increased ambient temperatures and extremes of rainfall, with their resultant adverse impacts on the environment and risk factors for violence, appear to play key roles. Collective violence due to climate change poses serious threats to health and human rights, including by causing morbidity and mortality directly and also indirectly by damage to the health-supporting infrastructure of society, forcing people to migrate from their homes and communities, damaging the environment, and diverting human and financial resources. This paper also briefly addresses issues for future research on the relationship between climate change and collective violence, the prevention of collective violence due to climate change, and States' obligations to protect human rights, to prevent collective violence, and to promote and support measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change.","[Levy, Barry S.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Sidel, Victor W.] Montefiore Med Ctr, Bronx, NY USA; [Sidel, Victor W.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Bronx, NY USA; [Sidel, Victor W.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, New York, NY USA",Tufts University; Montefiore Medical Center; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine,"Levy, BS (corresponding author), POB 1230, Sherborn, MA 01770 USA.",blevy@igc.org,,,,,,,44,16,16,0,29,HARVARD UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"79 GARDEN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",1079-0969,2150-4113,,HEALTH HUM RIGHTS,Health Hum.

We use cross-sectional data on climate, hydrological, soil and household level data for a sample of 816 households. We estimate a seasonal Ricardian model to assess the impact of climate on net crop revenue per acre. The results show that climate affects crop productivity. There is a non-linear relationship between temperature and revenue on one hand and between precipitation and revenue on the other. Estimated marginal impacts suggest that global warming is harmful for crop productivity. Predictions from global circulation models confirm that global warning will have a substantial impact on net crop revenue in Kenya. The results also show that the temperature component of global warming is much more important than precipitation. Findings call for monitoring of climate change and dissemination of information to farmers to encourage adaptations to climate change. Improved management and conservation of available water resources, water harvesting and recycling of wastewater could generate water for irrigation purposes especially in the arid and semi-arid areas.

Climate affects livestock growth rates, milk and egg production, reproductive performance, morbidity, and mortality, along with feed supply. Simultaneously, livestock is a climate change driver, generating 14.5% of total anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Herein, we review the literature addressing climate change and livestock, covering impacts, emissions, adaptation possibilities, and mitigation strategies. While the existing literature principally focuses on ruminants, we extended the scope to include non-ruminants. We found that livestock are affected by climate change and do enhance climate change through emissions but that there are adaptation and mitigation actions that can limit the effects of climate change. We also suggest some research directions and especially find the need for work in developing country settings. In the context of climate change, adaptation measures are pivotal to sustaining the growing demand for livestock products, but often their relevance depends on local conditions. Furthermore, mitigation is key to limiting the future extent of climate change and there are a number of possible strategies.","[Cheng, Muxi; McCarl, Bruce; Fei, Chengcheng] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77840 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Cheng, MX (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77840 USA.",muxicheng@tamu.edu; mccarl@tamu.edu; chengcheng.fei@agnet.tamu.edu,"McCarl, Bruce A/E-9445-2011",,"USDA AMS, Federal Milk Marketing Order Econometric Pricing Model","USDA AMS, Federal Milk Marketing Order Econometric Pricing Model","This research was funded by USDA AMS, Federal Milk Marketing Order Econometric Pricing Model.",,156,12,12,25,47,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,JAN,2022,13,1,,,,,,,140,10.3390/atmos13010140,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13010140,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,YN1HF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000747015800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The manner in which displacement considerations are integrated, including in particular the extent to which human rights-based international standards and guidelines are incorporated, combined with the level of human and financial resources devoted to this issue, can affect implementation at the sub-national level. Ultimately, however, addressing internal displacement in this context is a matter of sustainable development, with DRRM focusing mostly on symptoms, rather than underlying structural causes. The argument is developed with reference to recently completed collaborative research focusing on law, policy, and practice relating to internal displacement in the context of disasters and climate change in 10 countries across Asia and the Pacific.

In this study, we investigated the severity of the risk of heavy precipitation in South Korea because of climate change. Climate change risk indices were developed and divided into the Hazard, Vulnerability, and Exposure categories and visualized to present heavy precipitation risk that was identified by hot spot analysis with various spatial characteristics. Using a heavy precipitation risk index, we suggested how risk intensity differs between urban and rural areas. We found that spatial characteristics must be considered when assessing heavy precipitation risk and preparing climate change adaptation strategies. This study will be of use to local and national policy-makers and stakeholders associated with climate change in Korea.

These complexities may be further compounded as a result of the presence of interval-format uncertainty associated with energy systems management and climate change adaptation responses. This study is to develop an inexact community scale energy system adaptation model (ICEAM) for supporting adaptation planning of community-scale energy systems under uncertainty. The objective entails the tasks including: (1) investigation of adaptation responses of the energy sector to climate change, (2) uncertainty analysis, and (3) development of ICEAM and apply it to the City of Waterloo, Canada. The results indicate that, to adapt to a changing climate by the City of Waterloo, more electricity and gasoline and less natural gas would be imported.

Current approaches for addressing this challenge, which has the potential to result in catastrophic outcomes for consumptive needs and economic growth, rely on increasing the efficient use of existing resources. However, the availability of freshwater resources is rapidly declining due to over-exploitation and climate change and, therefore, is unlikely to sustainably address future needs, which requires a rethink of our solutions and associated investments. Here we present a bold departure from existing approaches by establishing the viability of significantly increasing freshwater through the capture of humid air over oceans. We show that the atmosphere above the oceans proximal to the land can yield substantial freshwater, sufficient to support large population centers across the globe, using appropriately engineered structures. Due to the practically limitless supply of water vapor from the oceans, this approach is sustainable under climate change and can transform our ability to address present and future water security concerns. This approach is envisioned to be transformative in establishing a mechanism for sustainably providing freshwater security to the present and future generations that is economically viable.","[Rahman, Afeefa; Kumar, Praveen] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Kumar, Praveen; Dominguez, Francina] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Kumar, Praveen] Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Kumar, P (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.;Kumar, P (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.;Kumar, P (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",kumar1@illinois.edu,,,"University of Illinois, Lovell Professorship in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University Scholar Program in the Atmospheric Science Department; NSF [EAR-1331906]","University of Illinois, Lovell Professorship in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University Scholar Program in the Atmospheric Science Department; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported by the University of Illinois, Lovell Professorship in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University Scholar Program in the Atmospheric Science Department, and partially supported by NSF Grant EAR-1331906.

Water trading is an important policy tool to deal with water scarcity issues, demonstrating allocative, dynamic and productive efficiency benefits. At the same time, water markets have been controversial in Australia. Markets have been blamed for a range of issues, including claims of unsustainability, inequity, farm bankruptcy, farmer distress and farm exit. This study reviews the MDB water trade literature and finds little evidence to support such myths. Arguably, the biggest misconception is that critics do not separate water markets from the meta-governance institutional structures that define them. Perceived water market failures are often due to governance issues - not water trade per se. This is not to say that market failure does not exist, it does, and indeed, there are also serious distributional issues that need addressing (e.g., water property entitlements for indigenous stakeholders). As such, water market design and governance need to adapt and evolve as problems arise and the market matures. However, in an era of increasing water scarcity, enabling water trade remains one of the most important instruments available to assist in water sharing, reallocation and farm adaptation to climate change.","[Wheeler, Sarah Ann] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ & Publ Policy, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Wheeler, SA (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ & Publ Policy, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",sarah.wheeler@adelaide.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council Discovery [DP200101191]; Australian Research Council [DP200101191] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council Discovery(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Australian Research Council Discovery, Grant/Award Number: DP200101191",,121,3,3,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Seven main themes emerged: climate change related diseases, nutrition and access to clean water, environmental risk factors, urban planning and public infrastructure, economic risk factors, vulnerable groups, and adaptation strategies. All participants were conscious of a link between climate change and health. This is the first qualitative study on climate change and health in an informal settlement in Africa. The study provides important information on perceived health risks, risk factors and adaptation strategies related to climate change. This can inform policy making, urban planning and health care, and guide future research.

Based on a cross-sectional database of 266 farm operating families, the study adopts a bottom-up approach to investigate farmer's perceptions of changes in climatic variables as well as various farm-level adaptation measures, determinants and barriers at the farm-household level. The results show that the majority of farmers have developed a perception of climate change and have engaged themselves in adaptive behaviour with regard to agricultural land use and planning. A weighted average index used to measure the most relevant adaptation strategies revealed that conversion of agricultural land to horticulture, improving irrigational facilities and water harvesting were the main adaptation methods implemented by farmers in the study area. Utilizing the logit regression model, the study confirmed that household characteristics such as land holding size, age of the farmer, years of schooling, farm experience and labour force highly influence household decisions to adapt to climate change.

Adaptation strategies are needed urgently to deal with the uncertainties originated by climate change on inland or coastal basins. Only a few studies have addressed practical strategies to mitigate global change impacts on lakes and practically none in South America. The purpose of this work was to discuss management options and seek better adaptive alternatives for the nature reserve Lake Chasic, and to propose future management experiments and actions at a regional level. The ecohydrological approach is likely to increase the ecological resilience of the lake, dampen climate-driven hydrological variations and reduce eutrophication problems. Future projects should include wetland creation, fish management, water quality control, engineering work studies and education programs. Ecohydrology as an integrative natural science should be considered as a water management strategy to build ecological resilience into water bodies. The building of social-ecological resilience is also crucial for the stability of coupled human-ecological systems. The integration of natural and social sciences into sustainability approaches represents a robust strategy for adapting to climate change.","[Kopprio, German A.; Lara, Ruben J.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Argentino Oceanog, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Kopprio, German A.] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Dept Vet Sci, Lab Prevent Int Epidem, Izumisano, Osaka 5988531, Japan; [Hugo Freije, R.] Univ Nacl Sur, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Arias-Schreiber, Milena; Lara, Ruben J.] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Osaka Metropolitan University; National University of the South; Leibniz Zentrum fur Marine Tropenforschung (ZMT),"Kopprio, GA (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Argentino Oceanog, Florida 8000,Complejo CCT CONICET,Edificio E1, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",gkopprio@criba.edu.ar,"Kopprio, Germán/AAP-9227-2021; Schreiber, Milena Arias/AAK-4524-2021; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Kopprio, Germán/0000-0002-9438-509X; ",Japan Studies Service Organization (JASSO); German Academic Exchange Service (Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst: DAAD); Ministry of Education of Argentina (Ministerio de Educacion: ME),Japan Studies Service Organization (JASSO); German Academic Exchange Service (Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst: DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Ministry of Education of Argentina (Ministerio de Educacion: ME),"We thank the Japan Studies Service Organization (JASSO), the German Academic Exchange Service (Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst: DAAD) and the Ministry of Education of Argentina (Ministerio de Educacion: ME) for financing this work, and the National Meteorological Service (Servicio Metereologico Nacional: SMN) of Argentina for precipitation data.

Furthermore, current patterns of fossil-fuel use cause substantial ill-health from air pollution and occupational hazards. Impending climate change, mainly driven by energy use, now also threatens health. Policies to promote access to non-polluting and sustainable sources of energy have great potential both to improve public health and to mitigate (prevent) climate disruption. There are several technological options, policy levers, and economic instruments for sectors such as power generation, transport, agriculture, and the built environment. However, barriers to change include vested interests, political inertia, inability to take meaningful action, profound global inequalities, weak technology-transfer mechanisms, and knowledge gaps that must be addressed to transform global markets. The need for policies that prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate while addressing the energy needs of disadvantaged people is a central challenge of the current era. A comprehensive programme for clean energy should optimise mitigation and, simultaneously, adaption to climate change while maximising co-benefits for health-eg, through improved air, water, and food quality.

To what extent proactive shaping of change is enabled by spatial planning practice is less explored. This paper illustrates how the ideals and ambitions of climate adaptation are manifested in waterfront spatial planning via a case study of Norrkoping, Sweden. Based on interviews with spatial planners and politicians responsible for strategic urban development planning, our study identifies a divergence in ambitions, approaches and positions. In local development plans, the position taken has less to do with climate risk severity than with an area's perceived political and economic attractiveness. When perceived attractiveness is low, precautionary climate adaptation serves as a pretext not to develop, whereas high perceived attractiveness leads to negotiated pragmatism allowing continued waterfront exploitation. We also identify a fragmentation in spatial planning, with weak interplay between municipal comprehensive planning and local development plans, resulting in ad hoc, case-by-case planning. Furthermore, different planning actors are organizationally compartmentalized, creating unfortunate intra-sectoral silos. We conclude that the integrative, proactive and reflexive potentials of spatial planning to deliver climate adaptation have yet to be realized.","[Storbjork, Sofie; Hjerpe, Mattias] Linkoping Univ, Dept Water & Environm Studies DWES, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Storbjork, Sofie; Hjerpe, Mattias] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res CSPR, Norrkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Storbjork, S (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Water & Environm Studies DWES, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",sofie.storbjork@liu.se,,"Hjerpe, Mattias/0000-0002-5500-3300",,,,,60,28,28,3,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-4313,1469-5944,,EUR PLAN STUD,Eur.

The growth period, biomass, and yield of two wheat cultivars (early- vs. late-maturing) were simulated by the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) validated with pot experiments under the scenarios of elevated [CO2] and 2 degrees C warming based on the baseline climate for 1961-2016 at Taigu in North China. We also investigated the effects of extreme high temperature on the yield and yield components of these wheat cultivars. We found that APSIM well simulated the changes in the growth period, leaf area index (LAI), biomass, and yield induced by 2 degrees C warming and elevated [CO2]. Long-term simulations showed that 2 degrees C warming decreased the growing period between sowing and jointing for both cultivars. 2 degrees C warming and elevated [CO2] affected the wheat yield mainly by altering the grain numbers. Extreme high temperature decreased the grain numbers and yield of the late-maturing cultivar but not the early-maturing one. The findings suggest that early-maturing cultivar would be better adapted to elevated [CO2] and rising temperature than the late-maturing one in the eastern Loess Plateau.","[Zhang, Yuanling; Li, Ping; Zong, Yuzheng; Zhang, Dongsheng; Shi, Xinrui; Hao, Xingyu] Shanxi Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Taigu 030801, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuanling; Li, Ping; Hao, Xingyu] Shanxi Agr Univ, State Key Lab Sustainable Dryland Agr, Taiyuan 030031, Peoples R China; [Lam, Shu Kee] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Sch Agr & Food, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Wang, Jing] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",Shanxi Agricultural University; Shanxi Agricultural University; University of Melbourne; China Agricultural University,"Hao, XY (corresponding author), Shanxi Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Taigu 030801, Peoples R China.;Hao, XY (corresponding author), Shanxi Agr Univ, State Key Lab Sustainable Dryland Agr, Taiyuan 030031, Peoples R China.;Wang, J (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",haoxingyu1976@126.com; wangj@cau.edu.cn,,,"State Key Laboratory of Sustainable Dryland Agriculture, Shanxi Agricultural University [202105D121008-3-7]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31971773, 31871517]; Fund Program for the Scientific Activities of Selected Returned Overseas Professionals in Shanxi Province [20210041]; Youth Talents Support Program of Shanxi Agricultural University [201701D221190]","State Key Laboratory of Sustainable Dryland Agriculture, Shanxi Agricultural University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fund Program for the Scientific Activities of Selected Returned Overseas Professionals in Shanxi Province; Youth Talents Support Program of Shanxi Agricultural University","This work was supported by State Key Laboratory of Sustainable Dryland Agriculture, Shanxi Agricultural University (No. 202105D121008-3-7) , National Natural Science Foundation of China (31971773, 31871517) , Fund Program for the Scientific Activities of Selected Returned Overseas Professionals in Shanxi Province (20210041) , Youth Talents Support Program of Shanxi Agricultural University (201701D221190) .",,33,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1923,1873-2240,,AGR FOREST METEOROL,Agric.

This paper presents the results of research focusing on the feelings of unsafety associated with the application of NBS elements directly into the urban structure. In two pilot areas (Ostrava (CZ) and the part of Upper Silesian agglomeration (PL)) the feelings of the inhabitants and the possible feeling of fear or danger in the application of NBS were investigated. In Ostrava, a questionnaire survey was conducted in relation to specific elements of the NBS without discussion of specific locations. In the Upper Silesian agglomeration, residents' feelings about specific NBS were surveyed at specific locations using guided interviews. Both approaches resulted in the identification of elements of concern. Respondents who discussed a specific location had a better understanding of the urban context and worried less. The two approaches demonstrated the need to communicate with residents before finalizing the design of a particular public space and the desirability of discussing site-specific issues with citizens.","[Vojvodikova, Barbara] IURS Inst Sustainable Dev Settlements, Ostrava 70800, Czech Republic; [Ticha, Iva] Univ Ostrava, Fac Social Studies, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic; [Starzewska-Sikorska, Anna] Inst Ecol Ind Areas, PL-40844 Katowice, Poland",University of Ostrava; Institute for Ecology of Industrial Areas,"Vojvodikova, B (corresponding author), IURS Inst Sustainable Dev Settlements, Ostrava 70800, Czech Republic.",barbara.vojvodikova@email.cz,"Vojvodikova, Barbara/W-9430-2018","Vojvodikova, Barbara/0000-0002-7940-9241",Interreg CENTRAL EUROPE Programme [CE1472],Interreg CENTRAL EUROPE Programme,"This research was funded by SALUTE4CE-Integrated environmental management of SmALl Green Spots in FUncTional Urban ArEas following the idea of acupuncture, Project index number: CE1472, from Interreg CENTRAL EUROPE Programme.",,86,1,1,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,OCT,2022,11,10,,,,,,,1712,10.3390/land11101712,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11101712,,,21,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5P2MZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000872992400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In terms of climate change, Turkey is a vulnerable country in Mediterranean Europe. As a result, the goal of this study is to apply the Theory of Planned Behavior to simulate Turkish households' climate change-related behavior. Using a random sampling method, an online self-reported questionnaire of 400 Turkish households assessed the impact of practices to adapt and mitigate climate change. Within the context of the Theory of Planned Behavior, Structural Equation Modeling was used to examine household attitudes and behaviors about climate change. The findings imply that household intentions are important predictors of climate change-related behavior in Turkey. In addition, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control influence the goals of Turkish households. As a result, efforts should be undertaken to provide households with the subjective and perceptual abilities and tools they need to manage their climate-related activities.","[Pouya, Ahmad Samim; Niyaz, Ozge Can] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkey",Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University,"Niyaz, OC (corresponding author), Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkey.",ozgecanniyaz@comu.edu.tr,"Niyaz, Özge Can/GXV-8926-2022","Niyaz, Özge Can/0000-0002-4958-9931",,,,,95,0,0,16,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2022,14,18,,,,,,,11290,10.3390/su141811290,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141811290,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4R8QR,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000857021900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of severe weather, it is important to understand how changes in weather affect SSF fishing efforts. Yet, a gap exists in the understanding of how changes in meteorological conditions affect small scale fishers. This study combines fishers' meteorological knowledge of weather conditions that allow for small-scale fishing with long-term remotely sensed meteorological data to quantify how fishing effort, defined as available fishing hours, of SSF in coastal Madagascar has changed between 1979-2020 in response to long-term weather trends. Results show a significant decrease in available fishing hours over the examined time period. Particularly, we found that a decrease in available fishing hours between 1979-2020 with a loss of 21.7 available fishing hours per year. Increased adverse weather conditions, likely associated with climate change, could decrease fishers access to crucial resources needed for the food and livelihood security.

However, there is an emerging discourse that established schemes are becoming vulnerable to increased climate variability and change, particularly increased water stress. This paper reviews the existing knowledge on risks of climate change and variability in water supply in smallholder irrigation farming in Zimbabwe. In addition, this paper highlights adaptation options to climate change in SISs. Data for this review were collected systematically from peer-reviewed and published literature. The literature used for this study showed that SISs in Zimbabwe are beset with water stress, competing water needs and the outbreak of pests and diseases, which have been related with climate change and variability. Climate change is making Zimbabwe more arid through decreasing precipitation and warming. Droughts and floods are increasing in frequency and severity. Damage by floods is increasing exponentially, impacting environments, ecological systems and national economies. Climate change affects SISs' productivity and decimates the livelihoods of scheme farmers. The review suggests that there is a need for increased adsorptive, adoptive and transformational capacity for SISs to obtain a new state of resilience from adverse effects of increased climate variability and change. This review recommends understanding and prioritizing solutions to vulnerability to climate change in SISs.","[Mwadzingeni, Liboster; Mafongoya, Paramu] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Carbis Rd, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Mugandani, Raymond] Midlands State Univ, Fac Nat Resources Management & Agr, Gweru 9055, Zimbabwe",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mwadzingeni, L (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Carbis Rd, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",libomwadzi@gmail.com; mugandanir@gmail.com; mafongoya@ukzn.ac.za,"Mugandani, Raymond/GON-5779-2022; Mwadzingeni, Liboster/GNM-9468-2022","Mwadzingeni, Liboster/0000-0002-8015-7010; Mugandani, Raymond/0000-0002-8280-4170",South Africa's National Research Foundation (NRF) [86893],South Africa's National Research Foundation (NRF)(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"This research was funded by South Africa's National Research Foundation (NRF), grant number 86893 for funding the study.",,98,1,1,7,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2022,14,11,,,,,,,1682,10.3390/w14111682,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14111682,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,1Z8ZA,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000809104000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study is to provide an insight on good practices dealing with cultural heritage when it comes to disaster risk management and climate change adaptation, aiming at increasing cultural heritage resilience of historical areas. To this aim, the paper applies the best practice research methodology for investigating cultural heritage resilience in historical areas through the codification and analysis of good practices collected from EU-funded projects. The results consist of more than 90 good practices reviewed and analyzed according to a set of criteria. The research findings, organized according to three main categories (i.e., institutional, structural/physical, social), contribute to emphasizing the importance of improving knowledge from already available good practices. Two main approaches have been highlighted in the discussion, according to the key role assigned to stakeholders, education, data, and technology. The results allow to take advantage of existing knowledge to support communities to increase resilience of cultural heritage in historical areas.","[Santangelo, Angela; Tondelli, Simona; Ugolini, Andrea] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, CIRI Bldg & Construct, I-40137 Bologna, Italy; [Santangelo, Angela; Melandri, Eleonora; Marzani, Giulia; Tondelli, Simona; Ugolini, Andrea] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture, I-40137 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Santangelo, A (corresponding author), Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, CIRI Bldg & Construct, I-40137 Bologna, Italy.;Santangelo, A (corresponding author), Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture, I-40137 Bologna, Italy.",angela.santangelo@unibo.it; eleonora.melandri3@unibo.it; giulia.marzani3@unibo.it; simona.tondelli@unibo.it; a.ugolini@unibo.it,"Marzani, Giulia/GYV-2099-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Tondelli, Simona/0000-0003-0891-7852; MARZANI, GIULIA/0000-0002-1199-2581",European Union [821282],European Union(European Commission),This research has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 821282.

Attention toward urban climate change adaptation has increased more than ever before, but previous studies have focused on indoor and outdoor temperature patterns separately. The objective of this research is to assess the indoor and outdoor temperature patterns of different urban settlements. Remote sensing data, together with air temperature data collected with temperature data loggers, were used to analyze land surface temperature (outdoor temperature) and air temperature (indoor temperature). A hot and cold spot analysis was performed to identify the statistically significant clusters of high and low temperature data. The results showed a distinct temperature pattern across different residential units. Districts with dense urban settlements show a warmer outdoor temperature than do more sparsely developed districts. Dense urban settlements show cooler indoor temperatures during the day and night, while newly built districts show cooler outdoor temperatures during the warm season. Understanding indoor and outdoor temperature patterns simultaneously could help to better identify districts that are vulnerable to heat stress in each city. Recognizing vulnerable districts could minimize the impact of heat stress on inhabitants.","[Alavipanah, Sadroddin; Haase, Dagmar; Makki, Mohsen; Qureshi, Salman] Humboldt Univ, Inst Geog, Rudower Chaussee 16, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Nizamani, Mir Muhammad] Hainan Univ, Sch Life & Pharmaceut Sci, Hainan Key Lab Sustainable Utilizat Trop Bioresou, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China",Humboldt University of Berlin; Hainan University,"Makki, M (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Inst Geog, Rudower Chaussee 16, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.",s.alavipanah@hu-berlin.de; dagmar.haase@geo.hu-berlin.de; makki@hu-berlin.de; mirmuhammadnizamani@hainanu.edu.cn; salman.qureshi@geo.hu-berlin.de,"Nizamani, Mir Muhammad/AAC-4663-2020","Nizamani, Mir Muhammad/0000-0002-8709-9212; Haase, Dagmar/0000-0003-4065-5194; Qureshi, Salman/0000-0001-7955-7490",,,,,45,2,2,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,FEB,2021,13,4,,,,,,,640,10.3390/rs13040640,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13040640,,,14,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,QQ3JC,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000624419500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

They seek the relocation of communities due to perceptions that they are already exposed to undue levels of risk or will become exposed to high risk in the near future because of climate change. Here, we focus on the economics of managed retreats and specifically focus on the question of who pays or may pay for these relocations. Recent Findings There is a significant body of research in the other social sciences (political science, sociology, anthropology, history) on managed retreats, but almost none in economics. No paper that we are aware has focused primarily on the question of who pays for managed retreats, and the survey here therefore focusses on lessons we can learn from examples, specifically an example from New Zealand and from the little references to these questions in the existing literature. Sources of funding for managed retreats can come from the affected communities, from the public sector (the government or public insurers), and from the private sector (mostly private insurers). It is politically easier to implement managed retreats if it is the latter groups (public and private insurers) that pay, rather than placing the burden on the general taxpayer or on the affected communities themselves.","[Noy, Ilan] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington 6012, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Noy, I (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.",Ilan.noy@vuw.ac.nz,,"Noy, Ilan/0000-0003-3214-6568",Resilience National Science Challenge,Resilience National Science Challenge,The author thanks the Resilience National Science Challenge for financial support.,,33,14,14,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2198-6061,,,CURR CLIM CHANGE REP,Curr.

However, efforts to reduce the WF of crop production may be curtailed by the effects of climate change. This study reviewed the impacts of climate change on the WF of wheat production in Zimbabwe with the aim of identifying research gaps. Results of the review revealed limited local studies on the impacts of climate change on the WF of wheat production within Zimbabwe. Despite this, relevant global and regional studies suggest that climate change will likely result in a higher WF in Zimbabwe as well as at the global and regional level. These impacts will be due to reductions in wheat yields and increases in crop water requirements due to high temperatures, despite the CO2 fertilization effect. The implications of a higher WF of wheat production under future climate change scenarios in Zimbabwe may not be sustainable given the semi-arid status of the country. The study reviewed crop-level climate change adaptation strategies that might be implemented to lower the WF of wheat production in Zimbabwe.","[Govere, Simbarashe; Nyamangara, Justice] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, P Bag 7724, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe; [Nyakatawa, Emerson Z.] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Dept Crop Sci & Technol, P Bag 7724, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe",,"Govere, S (corresponding author), Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, P Bag 7724, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe.",simgovere2000@yahoo.com,"Nyamangara, Justice/HFZ-7630-2022","Nyamangara, Justice/0000-0002-5249-7747",Chinhoyi University of Technology Staff Development Fund,Chinhoyi University of Technology Staff Development Fund,The researchers would like to appreciate Chinhoyi University of Technology Staff Development Fund for funding this research.,,106,4,4,2,22,WATER RESEARCH COMMISSION,PRETORIA,"PO BOX 824, PRETORIA 0001, SOUTH AFRICA",0378-4738,1816-7950,,WATER SA,Water SA,JUL,2019,45,3,,,,,513,526,,10.17159/wsa/2019.v45.i3.6748,http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/wsa/2019.v45.i3.6748,,,14,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Water Resources,IN5OA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000478725200022,View Full Record in Web of Science

We suggest a framework for guiding climate change adaptation action concerning flood risk and manageability in cities. The identified key drivers of changing flood hazard and vulnerability are used to provide an overview of each driver's impact on flood risk and manageability at the city level. We find that identified drivers for urban flood risk can be grouped in three different priority areas with different time horizon. The first group has high impact but is manageable at city level. Typical drivers in this group are related to the physical environment such as decreasing permeability and unresponsive engineering. The second group of drivers is represented by public awareness and individual willingness to participate and urbanization and urban sprawl. These drivers may be important and are manageable for the cities and they involve both short-term and long-term measures. The third group of drivers is related to policy and long-term changes. This group is represented by economic growth and increasing values at risk, climate change, and increasing complexity of society. They have all high impact but low manageability. Managing these drivers needs to be done in a longer time perspective, e.g., by developing long-term policies and exchange of ideas.","[Berndtsson, R.; Larsson, R.; Mobini, S.; Scholz, M.; Sorensen, J.; Tussupova, K.] Lund Univ, Water Resources Engn, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Berndtsson, R.; Pilesjo, P.; Tussupova, K.] Lund Univ, Ctr Middle Eastern Studies, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Becker, P.] Lund Univ, Risk Management & Societal Safety, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Becker, P.] North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Persson, A.; Pilesjo, P.] Lund Univ, GIS Ctr, Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Aspegren, H.; Haghighatafshar, S.; Jonsson, K.; Mottaghi, M.] Lund Univ, Water & Environm Engn, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Aspegren, H.; Mottaghi, M.] VA SYD, SE-22100 Malmo, Sweden; [Mottaghi, M.; Sternudd, C.] Lund Univ, Architecture & Built Environm, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Nilsson, J.] Malmo Univ, Fac Culture & Soc, SE-20506 Malmo, Sweden; [Nordstrom, J.] Lund Univ, AgriFood, Econ Ctr, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Scholz, M.] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Civil Engn Sci, POB 524, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Scholz, M.] Univ Salford, Directorate Civil Engn, Manchester M5 4WT, England; [Tussupova, K.] Karaganda State Med Univ, Ctr Transfer Technol, Karaganda 100004, Kazakhstan",Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; North West University - South Africa; Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; Malmo University; Lund University; University of Johannesburg; University of Salford; Karaganda Medical University,"Berndtsson, R (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Water Resources Engn, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",ronny.berndtsson@tvrl.lth.se,"Sörensen, Johanna Lykke/AAG-3189-2019; Haghighatafshar, Salar/U-9579-2019; Haghighatafshar, Salar/Q-3843-2018; Aspegren, Henrik/Q-1200-2018; Berndtsson, Ronny/C-7449-2015; Nordström, Jonas/AAR-6623-2020","Sörensen, Johanna Lykke/0000-0002-2312-4917; Haghighatafshar, Salar/0000-0002-8640-2769; Haghighatafshar, Salar/0000-0002-8640-2769; Aspegren, Henrik/0000-0001-5805-1589; Berndtsson, Ronny/0000-0003-1473-0138; Nordström, Jonas/0000-0001-8608-7976; Tussupova, Kamshat/0000-0001-8005-0371; Becker, Per/0000-0001-9379-9461; Mottaghi, Misagh/0000-0003-0424-8655; Mobini, Shifteh/0000-0002-3365-7346","Formas (Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences, and Spatial Planning) [942-2015-149]; Sweden Water Research; Hoje a Water Council; Skane Region; Lansforsakringar Skane; City of Malmo; City of Goteborg","Formas (Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences, and Spatial Planning)(Swedish Research Council Formas); Sweden Water Research; Hoje a Water Council; Skane Region; Lansforsakringar Skane; City of Malmo; City of Goteborg","This research was funded by Formas (Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences, and Spatial Planning) under contract 942-2015-149.

This paper examined the changes in rainfall, minimum, and maximum temperature extremes of Jemma Sub-Basin of the Upper Blue Nile Basin for the period of 1981 to 2014. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall, seasonal Mann-Kendall, and Sen's slope estimator were used to estimate annual trends. Ten rainfall and 12 temperature indices were used to study changes in rainfall and temperature extremes. The results showed an increasing trend of annual and summer rainfall in more than 78% of the stations and a decreasing trend of spring rainfall in most of the stations. An increase in rainfall extreme events was detected in the majority of the stations. Several rainfall extreme indices showed wetting trends in the sub-basin, whereas limited indices indicated dryness in most of the stations. Annual maximum and minimum temperature and extreme temperature indices showed warming trend in the sub-basin. Presence of extreme rainfall and a warming trend of extreme temperature indices may suggest signs of climate change in the Jemma Sub-Basin.

Global warming will increase vulnerability to extreme weathers, such as drought. In this paper, we examine the susceptibility of Ethiopian power systems to extreme hydrological conditions using an integrated hydro reservoir and power system dispatch model. The result shows that hydropower could help in achieving the least cost generation of electricity by 2017. However, the cost of electricity was found to significantly vary with various factors. It was found that, excluding cost of unserved energy, the low inflow scenario presents a situation where cost of electricity is approximately 4 times higher than the moderate inflow. Electricity price is currently cheap and stable due to governments pricing strategy. Consequently, the cost borne by the nation's economy could be seen from annual cost of dispatch, which increases from approximately 1 billion USD per year at the reference scenario to about 4 Billion USD for the low inflow scenario. The dispatch cost will be above 8 folds if the cost of unserved energy is included. This shows that the power system is poorly resilient against climate change impact. Thus, we recommend that policymaking and planning focuses on transitioning to climate change adaptive system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Demissie, Ashenafi A.; Solomon, A.

Stemming from social ecological systems theories of climate change adaptation and adaptive capacity, this case study introduces the concept of 'divergent' adaptation. Adaptation is divergent when one user or group's adaptation causes a subsequent reduction in another user or group's adaptive capacity in the same ecosystem. Using the example of pastoral and agricultural groups in northern and southern rainfall zones of Niger, this study illustrates the concept of divergent adaptation by identifying changes to the adaptive capacity of users who are currently engaged in conflicts over access to natural resources. Similar to other studies, we find that expansion of farmland and the consequent loss of pastoral space are restricting pastoral adaptation. Divergent adaptations favoring agricultural livelihoods include cultivating near or around pastoral wells or within pastoral corridors, both of which limit the mobility and entitlements of pastoralists. Institutions rarely secure pastoral routes and access to water points, a problem that is compounded by conflicting modes of governance, low accountability, and corruption. The case study illustrates the need to enhance the adaptive capacity of multiple user groups to reduce conflict, enhance human security, and promote overall resilience. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This area faces rising temperatures, declining rain and snow falls, and shorter skiing seasons. Open-ended interviews examined the perceptions, plans and attitudes of the ski industry and those of conservation managers, local government officials and Australian researchers into tourism and/or climate change effects in the Australian Alps. All interviewees accepted climate change was a reality; several, however, questioned the worst-case scenarios. The major tourism-related adaptation strategies were snowmaking and diversifying to year-round tourism; the success of these strategies will vary according to individual resorts' snowmaking capacity and potential summer tourism revenue. Currently non-snow-based tourism revenue is worth only approximately 30% of winter revenue. Social resistance to increased water and electricity use for snowmaking emerged as an important issue. Competition for water, including the needs of ecosystems, agriculture and fire protection in this summer-fire-prone region, and fire management issues, is a key concern. Current conflicts between the ski industry and other stakeholders over climate change adaptation call for a collaborative adaptation and change policy within the Australian Alps.","[Morrison, Clare] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, ICER, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Pickering, Catherine M.] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Ctr, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Morrison, C (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, ICER, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",c.morrison@griffith.edu.au,,"Pickering, Catherine/0000-0002-3731-5407",,,,,53,77,80,10,117,CHANNEL VIEW PUBLICATIONS,CLEVEDON,"FRANKFURT LODGE, CLEVEDON HALL, VICTORIA ROAD, CLEVEDON, BS21 7HH, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

Nearly thirty years later the numbers likely to migrate as a result of the impacts of climate change are still, at best, guesswork(2). Owing to the high prevalence of rainfed agriculture, many livelihoods in sub-Saharan African drylands are particularly vulnerable to changes in climate. One commonly adopted response strategy used by populations to deal with the resulting livelihood stress is migration. Here, we use an agent-based model developed around the theory of planned behaviour to explore how climate and demographic change, defined by the ENSEMBLES project(3) and the United Nations Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs(4), combine to influence migration within and from Burkina Faso. The emergent migration patterns modelled support framing the nexus of climate change and migration as a complex adaptive system(5). Using this conceptual framework, we show that the extent of climate-change-related migration is likely to be highly nonlinear and the extent of this nonlinearity is dependent on population growth; therefore supporting migration policy interventions based on both demographic and climate change adaptation.","[Kniveton, Dominic R.; Smith, Christopher D.; Black, Richard] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Kniveton, DR (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England.",kafw3@sussex.ac.uk,,"Black, Richard/0000-0003-4276-2057",ESRC/NERC,ESRC/NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),We thank B.

Household and key informant data from two villages in Mozambique are analysed. First, we explore how changes such as increased market integration, altered systems of agricultural support, land tenure change and privatisation of agro-industries may affect factors important for response capacity, including access to local natural resources, employment opportunities, and household labour and capital. Next, we investigate how people related to the market while coping with the 2002-2003 drought, The study reveals that there had been an increase in informal trade and casual employment opportunities; however, market relations were very unfavourable and as the drought intensified, smallholders were locked into activities that barely secured economic survival and which sometimes endangered long-term response capacity. Only a few large-scale farmers had the capital and skills necessary to negotiate a good market position in urban markets, thus securing future incomes. Inequality, social sustainability, vulnerability and natural resource use are all closely linked in the savannas. Hence, both climate change adaptation policies and sustainability measures need to target vulnerability context and the social and environmental stressors shaping it. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Ignoring this uncertainty can cause adaptation plans and strategies to be ineffective and even maladaptive. As such, there is growing awareness that adaptation planning must adopt approaches that enable discovering, assessing, and addressing uncertainty. In this paper, I examine how uncertainty is managed in adaptation planning. Content analysis of 44 local climate adaptation plans in the U.S. indicates that most plans recognize uncertainty, however, very few employ approaches to address uncertainty. To better understand how uncertainty influences the planning process, I conducted informant interviews in three communities: Boulder, CO; Denver, CO and Salem, MA. These communities capture the variation across plans in content analysis scores, climate threats, and plan author. Interview results suggest that adaptation plans do not fully reflect how uncertainty is managed in the planning process. Rather than focusing on climate projections in the vulnerability assessment, which may reinforce planning for one future, communities in which interviews were conducted emphasized sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Interviewees also emphasized the importance of no-regrets strategies and an iterative adaptation process. Institutional barriers were viewed as a major challenge for adopting uncertainty approaches. For approaches, such as robust strategies and flexible strategies, to be more widely used, we must first breakdown the deeply embedded practice of planning for one future.","[Woodruff, Sierra C.] UNC CH CEE, Campus Box 3275, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",,"Woodruff, SC (corresponding author), UNC CH CEE, Campus Box 3275, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",sscheleg@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,36,26,26,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

As in many parts of the world, climate change in northern California is threatening natural resource-dependent communities by exacerbating droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires. This article draws on ethnographic methods, including 108 interviews with crop and livestock farmers and key informants, to query climate change experience, belief, and response in rural northeastern California. I find that farmers recognize and describe climate changes that match the meteorologic evidence of anthropogenic climate change, but attribute these changes to weather cycles and harsh geographies. However, irrespective of their belief in anthropogenic climate change, farmers implement climate adaptations-many of these practices with mitigation co-benefits, bolstering growing evidence that climate change belief and action are not tightly coupled. To accelerate farmer adaptation, this work suggests that policy and programming focus on actions and outcomes, rather than reshaping belief.","[Petersen-Rockney, Margiana] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall 3114, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Petersen-Rockney, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall 3114, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",margiana@berkeley.edu,,"Petersen-Rockney, Margiana/0000-0003-3126-786X",National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship Program,National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship Program.,,79,0,0,19,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Long-term effects of forest density management on total aboveground C are not well understood, especially for precommercial thinning (PCT) implemented very early in stand development. To assess the climate change mitigation potential of PCT, as well as tradeoffs with climate change adaptation, we examined total aboveground C stores in a 54-year-old western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) precommercial thinning experiment to determine how different PCT treatments affect long-term aboveground C storage and distribution among pools. Four aboveground C pools (live over story, live understory/mid-story, woody detritus, and forest floor) were measured and separated into C accumulated prior to initiation of the current stand (legacy C) and C accumulated by the current stand (non-legacy C). PCT had no influence on the total non-legacy aboveground C stores 54 years after treatment. Live tree C was nearly identical across densities due to much larger trees in low density treatments. Low density stands had more understory and mid-story C while unthinned plots had significantly more non-legacy woody detritus C than thinned stands. Legacy pools did not vary significantly with density, but made up a substantial proportion of aboveground C stores. We found that: (1) fifty-four years after PCT total aboveground C is similar across treatments, due primarily to the increase in mean tree C of trees grown at lower stand densities; (2) deadwood legacies from the pre-disturbance forest still play an important role in long-term C storage 62 years after current stand initiation, accounting for approximately 20-25% of aboveground C stores; and (3) given enough time since early thinning, there is no trade-off between managing stands to promote individual tree growth and development of understory vegetation, and maximizing stand level accumulation of aboveground C over the long term. We infer that early PCT can be used to simultaneously achieve climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives, provided treatments are implemented early in stand development before canopy closure and the onset of intense intertree competition.

These ecosystems are under many stresses due to unsustainable management practices, lack of clarity on tenure and access rights, and persistent pressure for land-use change. Climate change is exacerbating the impact of these stresses on both forest ecosystems and forest dependent people. What are the current forest coping strategies of different livelihoods? What is the role of forest ecosystems in increasing the resilience of rural communities? Over a two-year period, an interdisciplinary team of civil society researchers and development practitioners made an attempt to address these questions in a systematic manner through the use of the CRiSTAL tool Community-based Risk Screening Tool for Adaptation and Livelihoods - in different countries. For this publication, case studies conducted in three African countries - Zambia. Mali and Tanzania - are presented. Particular focus is given to the coping strategies used forest, livestock and agriculture based livelihoods. In all cases, forest ecosystems provided key goods and services during extreme events (droughts and floods) and become key assets for reducing vulnerability in the context of climate change However, issues related to unclear land tenure, as well as legislation forbidding forest use, strengthen underlying conflicts over natural resources and therefore increase the high pressure on forest ecosystems and thus the overall vulnerability of poor rural communities. This paper analyzes the corresponding challenges and offers a number of recommendations for decision- and policy-makers, on how to support local adaptation to climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This area is characterized by heterogeneous topographical features and intensive water use in agriculture. The first and most fundamental level of adaptation to climate change in agriculture occurs at the level of the local farmer. Farmers undertake strategies to adapt to the form of climate change that they are able to foresee, through observation of the recent trends in indicators such as average temperatures and average precipitation. However, they can do little to respond to the greater uncertainty inherent in climate change. The role of policy will be to address this residual uncertainty, investing in institutions and infrastructure. Notably, climate variability implies a water storage problem: we discuss the different roles that the private and public sector can play in managing the water stock across space and time to prevent agricultural yield fluctuations causing welfare loss.

We proposed a novel and automatic system for urban flood detection and quantification. Our software takes image/video data of flooding as inputs because the such data source is easy to obtain and widely available compared with conventional water level sensors or flood gauges. First, the kernel of our system is a robust water region segmentation module that detects flooded regions together with surrounding reference objects from the scene. We combine image and video segmentation technologies to make the system reliable under varying weather and illumination conditions. Second, our system uses the detected situated objects to determine the inundation depth. Field experiments demonstrate that our segmentation results are accurate and reliable; and our system can detect flooding and estimate inundation depths from images and time-lapse videos.

In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate change on blue carbon. Despite uncertainties, carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems is enhanced by landward migration of blue carbon habitats, maintenance of sediment supply, restoration, and improved water quality. As an example, landward migration of mangroves could result in carbon sequestration of 1.5 Pg by 2100. Mudflats, seaweed beds, and coastal swamp forests could also contribute to climate change mitigation, although there are large data gaps. Achieving the full potential of blue carbon requires protection and restoration of ecosystems and facilitation of changes in ecosystem distributions with climate change, actions that will also deliver adaptation benefits. Conversely, in the worst-case coastal squeeze scenario, losses of 3.4 Pg of sequestered carbon by 2100 could occur.","[Lovelock, Catherine E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Reef, Ruth] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",University of Queensland; Monash University,"Lovelock, CE (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.lovelock@uq.edu.au,"Lovelock, Catherine E./AAF-7294-2020","Lovelock, Catherine E./0000-0002-2219-6855",Australian Research Council [DP180103444],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),We thank Jen Howard and members of the International Blue Carbon Scientific Working Group of the Blue Carbon Initiative for discussions on the content of this review and two reviewers who provided valuable critical comments.

The key findings of this study indicate that attitudes, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control have positive influence on behavioural intention to adapt/mitigate climate change. The result also found mediating effects of behavioural intention between attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control and pro-environmental behaviour. It is anticipated that the findings of this research should lead to the introduction of widespread awareness programmes that highlight the adverse impacts of climate change, and emphasise the individual initiatives that can be adopted to meet the challenges of climate change.

Few options exist for alternative livelihoods. This article investigates the potential of collecting plant gums and resins for livelihood diversification and for contributing to sustainable adaptation to climate change in Kenya's drylands. Observations were made in various studies over a period of two years on dryland vegetation resources, and interviews undertaken with gum collectors. This research found that many households currently collect and sell plant gums and resins as alternative to livestock production. These include gum arabic from Acacia senegal and Acacia seyal; myrrh from Commiphora myrrha; hagar from Commiphora holtziana; and frankincense from Boswellia neglecta. Collectors include poor people, women and children and some opportunists. Incomes are relatively low, however, and several factors constrain the activity. The case of gums and resins illustrates that key principles of sustainable adaptation are related: supporting local knowledge and adaptation strategies (one key principle of sustainable adaptation) does not contribute to sustainability unless at the same time contextual factors that marginalize livelihoods are addressed (another key principle).","[Gachathi, Francis N.] Kenya Forestry Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Eriksen, Siri] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragr, NO-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Gachathi, FN (corresponding author), Kenya Forestry Res Inst, POB 20412-00200, Nairobi, Kenya.",gachathif@yahoo.com,,,,,,,23,17,17,0,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

A focus on SLM will achieve the multiple goals of the three UN Conventions (UNCCD, UNFCCC and UNCBD) and in particular will address the roots causes of poverty and vulnerability to climate change rather than a current focus on adapting to climate change. The interlinkages between land degradation, climate change and loss of biodiversity are outlined together with a proposed set of interventions to achieve multiple goals. It is argued that improved land productivity is a viable goal to reduce poverty in drylands provided it is linked to payments for environmental services and better crop and weather insurances and coupled with alternative livelihoods that are not primarily dependent on land productivity. Obstacles to the achievement of SLM are discussed and the steps necessary to overcome them are presented. It is suggested that promoting SLM would be a better focus for the UNCCD than combating desertification.","[Thomas, Richard James] ICARDA, Aleppo, Syria",CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA),"Thomas, RJ (corresponding author), Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, 1390 Hamasaka, Tottori 6800001, Japan.",thomas@alrc.tottori-u-ac.jp,,,,,,,68,23,23,0,44,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1464-0325,1464-0333,,J ENVIRON MONITOR,J.

This paper suggests possibilities for widening climate change policy by strengthening inter-linkages between climate policies and various relevant policy areas to mainstream climate change concerns. It argues that, if these inter-linkages can be strengthened and policy coherence is improved, the effectiveness of climate policy can be enhanced while also supporting these other policy areas. The contention in this paper is that improved policy coherence and mainstreaming requires climate policies to go beyond the UNFCCC framework to realise its full potential and to better deal with possible trade-offs. The potential benefits in the policy domains of poverty reduction, rural development and agriculture, disaster management, energy security, air quality and trade, and finance are examined, and the institutional and organisations linkages highlighted. Finally, opportunities for mainstreaming are identified to make better use of possible synergies between climate and related policy areas.

Their role is particularly relevant in a climate sensitive sector like agriculture where they can provide evidence for the adoption of transformative solutions from seasonal to multi-decadal time scales. Adaptation solutions are often expensive and irreversible in the short/medium run. Accordingly, end users should have a reliable reference to make decisions. Here, we propose and apply a methodology, co-developed with service developers and a representative potential user, to assess the value of the IRRICLIME climate service, whose information is used to support decisions on climate smart irrigation invest-ment by water planners in a sub-irrigation district in Italy. We quantify the value of the information provided by the climate service, that we consider the intrinsic value of the service, or the value of adaptation. We demonstrate that under three different climate change scenarios, the maximum potential value of IRRICLIME could range between 2,985 euro/ha and 7,480 euro/ha.","[Delpiazzo, E.; Bosello, F.; Dasgupta, S.] CMCC CaFoscari, Venice, Italy; [Delpiazzo, E.; Bosello, F.; Dasgupta, S.] Univ CaFoscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy; [Delpiazzo, E.; Bagli, S.; Broccoli, D.; Mazzoli, P.; Luzzi, V.] RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm, Venice, Italy; [Bagli, S.; Broccoli, D.; Mazzoli, P.; Luzzi, V.] GECOsistema Srl, R&D Unit, Bolzano, Italy; [Delpiazzo, E.] Univ CaFoscari Venezia, RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm EIEE, Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Edificio Porta Innovaz,Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venezia Marghera, VE, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Delpiazzo, E (corresponding author), Univ CaFoscari Venezia, RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm EIEE, Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Edificio Porta Innovaz,Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venezia Marghera, VE, Italy.",elisa.delpiazzo@cmcc.it,,"Dasgupta, Shouro/0000-0003-4080-8066; DELPIAZZO, Elisa/0000-0002-5936-017X",European Union [730482],European Union(European Commission),The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the European Union?s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme for the CLARA project under grant agreement no. 730482.

In this article, we draw upon the Ecology of Games Theory (EGT) to develop theoretical expectations about how four incentive structures may guide how actors navigate the world of policy forums. We test these expectations using unique data on a three-mode network of actors, forums, and issues related to climate change adaption in the state of Ohio, in the US Midwest. Results of an exponential random graph model suggest that multilevel closure structures, which are a function of transaction costs and direct benefits, guide actors' forum participation in ways that can either reinforce sub-optimal, ineffective governance arrangements, or conversely, encourage opportunities for innovation, increase diversity in representation, and facilitate policy learning. From a methodological standpoint, our research highlights the benefits of examining complex governance systems through the more precise approach allowed by three-mode network analysis, which has not been frequently used in research on polycentric governance systems up to this point.","[Fried, Harrison; Hamilton, Matthew; Berardo, Ramiro] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Hamilton, Matthew] Ohio State Univ, Sustainabil Inst, Columbus, OH 42310 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Fried, H (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",fried.64@buckeyemail.osu.edu,,"Hamilton, Matthew/0000-0003-0509-4467",,,,,101,1,1,7,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1053-1858,1477-9803,,J PUBL ADM RES THEOR,J.

Given the recognition of the need to prepare for anticipated and unanticipated shocks, applications of resilience are increasing as the guiding principle of public policy and programs in areas such as disaster management, urban planning, natural resource management, and climate change adaptation. River science is an area in which the adoption of resilience is increasing, leading to the proposition that resilience may become a guiding principle of river policy and programs. Debate about the role of resilience in rivers is part of the scientific method, but disciplinary disunity about the ways to approach resilience application in policy and programs may leave river science out of the policy process. We propose six elements that need to be considered in the design and implementation of resilience-based river policy and programs: rivers as social-ecological systems; the science-policy interface; principles, capacities, and characteristics of resilience: cogeneration of knowledge: adaptive management: and the state of the science of resilience.

This paper illustrates a straightforward approach for measuring weather risk, which captures both the exposure and the sensitivity of business and economic indicators to weather variability. Using the example of the accommodation industry in Kitzbuehel (Austria), it is demonstrated that the risk measure Weather-VaR can be used to serve both ends. It is found that compared to a normal climatological season, adverse snow conditions (at the level of a 1 in 20-yr event) result in a substantial financial loss of approximately 4 million euros. However, results show that quantification of weather risk is substantially affected by the choice of the weather variable or index, the time period under consideration, the model specification for estimating the sensitivity parameter, and whether time trends are considered when estimating the probability of unfavorable weather conditions.","[Toeglhofer, Christoph; Prettenthaler, Franz] Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria; [Mestel, Roland] Graz Univ, Inst Banking & Finance, Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz,"Toeglhofer, C (corresponding author), Leonhardstr 59, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",christoph.toeglhofer@gmail.com,/AAN-9747-2021,"Mestel, Roland/0000-0002-8292-0382",,,,,30,23,23,2,20,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1948-8327,1948-8335,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

Protection and adaptation may mitigate the adverse consequences. This research reviews and assesses the options of protection by homeowners in the coastal zone in the southwest region of Cameroon. The coastal zone of Cameroon is studied because of the observed deleterious effect of recent extreme climatic events. From a research sample of 400 households, the house types and protection strategies - which are of two main types: reactive measures and preventive measures taken to offset adverse effects on property, are studied. A multinomial logit function reveals that income, education, age and gender are significant factors determining household's probability on the selection of protection measures. The study concludes that there are strong implications for adaptation to future climate change, and the ability of homeowners to extensively respond will have to be reinforced not only by communal and public works projects but also through an active government policy to promote climate change adaptation.","Univ Buea, Dept Econ & Management, Buea, Cameroon",,"Molua, EL (corresponding author), Univ Buea, Dept Econ & Management, Cameroon POB 63 Buea, Buea, Cameroon.",emolua@gmx.net,,"MOLUA, ERNEST/0000-0001-8724-6035",Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) under the initiative and coordination of the Centre for Environmental Economics and Policy in Africa (CEEPA),Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) under the initiative and coordination of the Centre for Environmental Economics and Policy in Africa (CEEPA),The research leading to this article was funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) under the initiative and coordination of the Centre for Environmental Economics and Policy in Africa (CEEPA).

Up to now, only a few suitable tools and methods have existed for farmers and regional stakeholders that support the process of decision-making in this field. The interactive model-based spatial information and decision support system LandCaRe DSS attempts to close the existing methodical gap. This system supports interactive spatial scenario simulations, multi-ensemble and multi-model simulations at the regional scale, as well as the complex impact assessment of potential land use adaptation strategies at the local scale. The system is connected to a local geo-database and via the Internet to a climate data server. LandCaRe DSS uses a multitude of scale-specific ecological impact models, which are linked in various ways. At the local scale (farm scale), biophysical models are directly coupled with a farm economy calculator. New or alternative simulation models can easily be added, thanks to the innovative architecture and design of the DSS. Scenario simulations can be conducted with a reasonable amount of effort. The interactive LandCaRe DSS prototype also offers a variety of data analysis and visualisation tools, a help system for users and a farmer information system for climate adaptation in agriculture. This paper presents the theoretical background, the conceptual framework, and the structure and methodology behind LandCaRe DSS. Scenario studies at the regional and local scale for the two Eastern German regions of Uckermark (dry lowlands, 2600 km(2)) and Weisseritz (humid mountain area, 400 km(2)) were conducted in close cooperation with stakeholders to test the functionality of the DSS prototype. The system is gradually being transformed into a web version (http://www.landcare-dss.de) to ensure the broadest possible distribution of LandCaRe DSS to the public. The system will be continuously developed, updated and used in different research projects and as a learning and knowledge-sharing tool for students. The main objective of LandCaRe DSS is to provide information on the complex long-term impacts of climate change and on potential management options for adaptation by answering what-if type questions.

The main contribution of this article is the systematic analysis and interpretation of the existing large body of resilience literature in economics by using topic modeling, a modern machine-learning research method. The advantage of this method is that it offers a more in-depth understanding of the themes in the resilience literature as opposed to the terminological classifications typically used in bibliometric studies. The results show that the identified topics are spread widely across different subareas of economics and deal with diverse themes, such as adaptation to climate change, stability of the financial system, and various types of shocks in regional economies. The findings reveal that the literature can be divided into two domains: one that deal with incremental changes occurring over a long period of time and the other dealing with unexpected, transient, and sudden changes. Furthermore, according to the results, well-known, highly cited research papers combine knowledge from different fields. Policymakers seeking to support cutting-edge research projects may benefit from this finding, as it emphasizes the need for policy measures to enhance cross-fertilized research.","[Riepponen, Tapio; Simonen, Jaakko] Univ Oulu, Oulu Business Sch, Dept Econ Accounting & Finance, Oulu, Finland; [Moilanen, Mikko] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Sch Business & Econ, Tromso, Norway",University of Oulu; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Simonen, J (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Oulu Business Sch, Dept Econ Accounting & Finance, Oulu, Finland.",jaakko.simonen@oulu.fi,,,Academy of Finland [Profi4 318930]; University of Oulu,Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); University of Oulu,"Academy of Finland, Grant/Award Number:Profi4 318930; University of Oulu",,78,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1757-7802,,,REG SCI POLICY PRACT,Reg.

In this paper we approach the need to better understand the factors that can condition the potential contribution of small farms to regional food and nutrition security in Europe, acknowledging the role that small farms play in Europe at present. The analysis is based on a survey to 94 experts from 17 regions (NUTS3 level) in 11 different European countries, which identified the drivers of change according to the regional experts. These drivers were then categorized and their relative relevance assessed. The results indicate that some relevant drivers in the European context are linked to the capacity to adopt technologies and practices allowing adaptation to climate change, and the capacity to connect to food markets, with emphasis in the need for cooperation and collective action. The weight of other more European-specific drivers such as 'consumer values and habits' reveal that the future role of small farms will be very dependent on a societal change, with equity becoming a relevant component of consumers' choice.","[Arnalte-Mur, L.; Ortiz-Miranda, D.; Cerrada-Serra, P.; Martinez-Gomez, V; Moreno-Perez, O.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Valencia, Spain; [Barbu, R.] Highclere Consulting, Brasov, Romania; [Bjorkhaug, H.] Norwegian Univ Technol & Sci, Norway Univ Sci & Technol & Ruralis, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Inst Rural & Reg Res, Trondheim, Norway; [Czekaj, M.] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Agr & Econ, Krakow, Poland; [Duckett, D.] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Galli, F.; Prosperi, P.] Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Environm, Pisa, Italy; [Goussios, G.] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Athens, Greece; [Grivins, M.; Sumane, S.] Baltic Studies Ctr, Riga, Latvia; [Hernandez, P.

Because climate change perceptions in children seem less susceptible to the influence of worldview or political contexts(3), it may be possible for them to inspire adults towards higher levels of climate concern, and in turn, collective action(4). Child-to-parent intergenerational learning-that is, the transfer of knowledge, attitudes or behaviours from children to parents(5)-may be a promising pathway to over-coming socio-ideological barriers to climate concerns(5). Here we present an experimental evaluation of an educational intervention designed to build climate change concern among parents indirectly through their middle school-aged children in North Carolina, USA. Parents of children in the treatment group expressed higher levels of climate change concern than parents in the control group. The effects were strongest among male parents and conservative parents, who, consistent with previous research(1), displayed the lowest levels of climate concern before the intervention. Daughters appeared to be especially effective in influencing parents. Our results suggest that intergenerational learning may overcome barriers to building climate concern.","[Lawson, Danielle F.; Stevenson, Kathryn T.; Seekamp, Erin] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Peterson, M.

The levels of risk perception among different farmers' wealth groups are also investigated. A total of 100 farmers in the Lawra district of Ghana are randomly selected and interviewed. Data is obtained through the use of semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussions. A climate risk perception index (CRPI) is derived and applied to assess the degree of perceived risk among different wealth groups of farmers. The linear regression model is also used to analyze the data. The results showed that 93% of farmers have perceived climate risk while 7% are not sure if they have perceived it. Results of the CRPI showed that resource-poor farmers are concerned about climate risk on agricultural production, while resource-moderate and resource-rich farmers are concerned about risk impacts on climatic variables, and health and socio-economy, respectively. Results of the regression model showed that education, age, a perceived increase in human disease and mortality, and a decrease in food security and incomes are predictors of risk perception. The policy implication of this study is that predictors of farmers' climate risk perception should be factored into climate change risk communication in order to boost awareness and adaptation to climate change.","[Ndamani, Francis; Watanabe, Tsunemi] Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, 2-22 Eikokuji, Kochi, Kochi 7808515, Japan",Kochi University Technology,"Ndamani, F (corresponding author), Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, 2-22 Eikokuji, Kochi, Kochi 7808515, Japan.",fndamani@gmail.com; watanabe.tsunemi@kochi-texh.ac.jp,,,"Kochi University of Technology, Kochi, Japan","Kochi University of Technology, Kochi, Japan","This study was funded by the Kochi University of Technology, Kochi, Japan.

To date, however, insight into these approaches has often been based on anecdotal case studies of local peoples' use of ecosystems. A systematic map of EbA-relevant peer-reviewed literature, and a sample of grey literature, was undertaken to (1) give a methodical overview of the state of the evidence-base on EbA effectiveness and (2) identify key knowledge gaps. A framework was developed with stakeholders to assess the evidence-base for EbA effectiveness. The literature reviewed showed that much can be learnt about EbA from articles which considered climatic variability and climate extremes. Measures of the effectiveness of EbA-relevant interventions recorded in the articles showed positive results, although discussion of thresholds, limits and timescales related to these interventions was limited. Social, environmental and economic benefits of EbA interventions were in evidence in most articles, and though costs were discussed, this was limited in extent. It is concluded that the literature on EbA-relevant interventions addressing climatic variability, change, and linked extremes and natural hazards, contains some information that will support making the case for EbA, but the evidence-base has a number of gaps that should be addressed.","[Doswald, N.; Castelli, I.] UNEP WCMC, Cambridge CB3 0DL, England; [Munroe, R.] BirdLife Int, Cambridge CB3 0NA, England; [Roe, D.; Giuliani, A.; Reid, H.] Int Inst Environm & Dev IIED, London WC1X 8NH, England; [Moeller, I.; Spencer, T.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge Coastal Res Unit, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Vira, B.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England",United Nations Environment Programme; BirdLife International; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Doswald, N (corresponding author), UNEP WCMC, 219 Huntingdon Rd, Cambridge CB3 0DL, England.",natdoswald@yahoo.co.uk,,"Roe, Dilys/0000-0002-6547-6427; Moller, Iris/0000-0003-1971-2932",,,,,36,101,106,3,100,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The results showed that, as a consequence of less capital accumulation, the herders in this area were vulnerable as a whole, and that gender, grassland area, livestock numbers and net incomes have significant effects on the vulnerability of grazer households. The families with female householders tended to be more vulnerable and they were characterised as owning less grassland, smaller houses, fewer or no vehicles, fewer young livestock and numbers of livestock slaughtered annually, whereas the families with low vulnerability had a higher net income. Geographically, household vulnerability showed a decreasing trend from west to east in Northern China at the county or region scale, which was positively correlated with grassland productivity. Social resources played a less important role than natural resources in decreasing the herders' vulnerability. Educational level of the household members and the household labour capacity played important roles in reducing vulnerability. Increasing the enrolment rate and the education background in grassland regions may decrease the vulnerability of the herders. It is argued that the use of vulnerability indices can be helpful to increase the herders' adaptation to climate change and to improve the sustainability of rural pastoral regions.","[Ding, Wenqiang; Ren, Weibo; Li, Ping; Hou, Xiangyang; Li, Xiliang; Xie, Jihong; Ding, Yong] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Grassland Res, Hohhot 010010, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xiaolong] Inner Mongolia Ecol & Agrometeorol Ctr, Hohhot 010051, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Grassland Research, CAAS","Ren, WB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Grassland Res, Hohhot 010010, Peoples R China.",rppcaucau@163.com; houxy16@126.com; dingyong228@126.com,,,"National Key Basic Research Program of China [2014CB138806]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31201846, 70933004, 71103185, 71311120089]; Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia [2014BS0709]; National project of scientific and technical supporting programs - Ministry of Sciences and Technology of China [2012BAD13B07]; basic scientific research expenses supporting programs for national public scientific research institute [1610332013013, 1610332013020]",National Key Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia; National project of scientific and technical supporting programs - Ministry of Sciences and Technology of China; basic scientific research expenses supporting programs for national public scientific research institute,"This work was funded by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2014CB138806); National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31201846; No. 70933004; No. 71103185; No. 71311120089); Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia (2014BS0709); National project of scientific and technical supporting programs funded by Ministry of Sciences and Technology of China (No. 2012BAD13B07); basic scientific research expenses supporting programs for national public scientific research institute (No. 1610332013013, No. 1610332013020).

A large proportion of the world's agriculture depends on groundwater, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. In several regions, aquifer resources face depletion. Groundwater recharge has been viewed as a by-product of irrigation return flow, and with climate change, aquifer storage of such flow will be vital. A general review, for a broad-based audience, is given of work on global warming and groundwater resources, summarizing the methods used to analyze the climate change scenarios and the influence of these predicted changes on groundwater resources around the world (especially the impact on regional groundwater resources and irrigation requirements). Future challenges of adapting to climate change are also discussed. Such challenges include water-resources depletion, increasing irrigation demand, reduced crop yield, and groundwater salinization. The adaptation to and mitigation of these effects is also reported, including useful information for water-resources managers and the development of sustainable groundwater irrigation methods. Rescheduling irrigation according to the season, coordinating the groundwater resources and irrigation demand, developing more accurate and complete modeling prediction methods, and managing the irrigation facilities in different ways would all be considered, based on the particular cases.","[Zhou, Yu; Zwahlen, Francois] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Geol & Hydrogeol, Ctr Hydrogeol & Geothermie CHYN, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Zhou, Yu; Wang, Yanxin; Li, Yilian] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yu; Wang, Yanxin; Li, Yilian] China Univ Geosci, MOE Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",University of Neuchatel; China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences,"Zhou, Y (corresponding author), Univ Neuchatel, Inst Geol & Hydrogeol, Ctr Hydrogeol & Geothermie CHYN, Rue Emile Argand 11,Case Postal 158, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",yu.zhou@unine.ch,,,,,,,81,39,43,9,76,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1431-2174,1435-0157,,HYDROGEOL J,Hydrogeol.

However, a precise understanding of the capacity for the symbiosis to adapt to climate change is currently restricted by the lack of coherent explanation for the set of cellular events leading to its warm-water breakdown (=coral bleaching). Here, a new coral bleaching model is proposed in which the triggering event is a disruption to the 'dark' photosynthetic reactions of the algae endosymbionts, primarily due to a limited availability of CO2 substrate around the Rubisco enzyme (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase). Paradoxically, this CO2-limiting condition may be enhanced by the modern increase in atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)). Importantly, the model delivers a new standpoint from which to explain: (i) upper thermal bleaching thresholds; and (ii) the mechanism underpinning endosymbiont shuffling. Overall, the model leaves little doubt as to the diminished stability and functioning (i.e. resilience) of the coral-algae endosymbiosis due to the rising pCO(2) and warming trend in the upper ocean surface layer. It is concluded that whole-colony bleaching is the destructive endpoint to a suite of cellular processes that operate near continuously in modern symbiotic corals.","Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",Australian Institute of Marine Science,"Wooldridge, SA (corresponding author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia.",,,,Australian Government's Marine and Tropical Science Research Facility (MTSRF),Australian Government's Marine and Tropical Science Research Facility (MTSRF)(Australian Government),This work was supported by the Australian Government's Marine and Tropical Science Research Facility (MTSRF).

This paper investigates multiple channels of wealth effects on household solar-panel uptake. There is evidence of impacts of both financial and non-financial assets on solar-panel uptake, but the evidence for financial assets is much more robust. Compared to the highest-asset quartile, proportional solar-panel uptake is three percentage points lower for the second-highest quartile of households based on financial assets, all else equal. This gap grows to six percentage points for households in the lowest quartile for financial assets. The results are robust across many models using probit, logit and linear probability formats. Knowledge of the relative magnitudes of impacts of wealth channels is important for policymakers who are considering supporting solar-panel uptake, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, when efficiency of public spending will be crucial. Our results reveal that means testing for solar policy support should be based on financial-asset thresholds, rather than non-financial assets or income. These are globally important policy lessons in creating a viable climate change adaptation strategy through solar electrification. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This research investigated the agricultural production of BMPs in response to climate change for a Hydrologic Unit Code12 sub-watershed of Choctawhatchee Watershed in Alabama, USA. The dominating soil type of this region was sandy loam and loamy sand soil. Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator and Cropping Systems Simulation Model were used to estimate the agricultural production. Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 that projected a temperature increase of 2.3celcius and 4.7celcius were used as climate scenarios. The research demonstrated that crop rotation had positive response to climate change. With peanuts in the rotation, a production increase of 105% was observed for cotton. There was no consistent impact on crop yields by early planting. With selected peanut-cotton rotations, 50% reduced nitrogen fertilizer use was observed to achieve comparable crop yields. In response to climate change, crop rotation with legume incorporation is thus suggested, which increased crop production and reduced fertilizer use.","[Afroz, Mahnaz Dil; Li, Runwei; Muhammed, Khaleel; Chen, Gang] Florida State Univ, FAMU FSU Coll Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2525 Pottsdamer St, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA; [Anandhi, Aavudai] Florida A&M Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Syst Engn, Tallahassee, FL USA",State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University,"Chen, G (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, FAMU FSU Coll Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2525 Pottsdamer St, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA.",gchen@eng.fsu.edu,"Li, Runwei/ABG-5068-2021","Li, Runwei/0000-0003-2087-4605; Muhammed, Khaleel/0000-0003-2971-9812",National Institute of Food and Agriculture of USDA [2018-68002-27920]; National Science Foundation [1735235],National Institute of Food and Agriculture of USDA; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The work was supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture of USDA through Grant No. 2018-68002-27920 to Florida A& M University and the National Science Foundation through Grant No. 1735235 to Florida A& M University as part of the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship.",,64,2,2,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1178-6221,,,AIR SOIL WATER RES,Air Soil Water Res.,FEB,2021,14,,,,,,,,1178622121991789,10.1177/1178622121991789,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1178622121991789,,,12,Environmental Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QK4ZJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000620394800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We argue in this article that Cape Town's crisis of water scarcity was a product of the convergence of ongoing contradictions in South African water governance as they came into contact with shifting infrastructural priorities associated with climate change. In its response to the possibility of a financial crisis brought on by reduced water consumption, the city withdrew the universal provision of free basic water (FBW) and reconfigured existing tariff structures. Both changes meant that the city moved further into commercialization and valuation practices in the context of restricted monetary flows. Based on an understanding of contemporary governance in South Africa as reflective of an often contradictory need to balance municipal budgets while also correcting for apartheid inequities, we argue that ongoing experiences of climate change are stretching existing municipal budgets in ways that threaten to deepen existing inequalities.

The vulnerability of this area to climate change and natural hazards necessitates that appropriate adaptation policies be put in place to protect heritage sites. This study aims to develop a cultural and natural heritage conservation framework for Central Italy that enhances the capacity of climate change adaptation for heritage resources. For this purpose, a comparison was made between the UNESCO (United National Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) Convention of 1972 and the European Landscape Convention of the Council of Europe to achieve a coherent vision for the protection of heritage resources in Europe. After describing the impacts of climate change on heritage resources in Central Italy, we analyze and suggest improvements to the conservation framework for wisely protecting heritage resources in a changing climate. The findings reveal that conservation sectors require assessments of the value of heritage resources at the territorial scale to effectively define conservation priorities, assess the vulnerabilities, and more precisely direct funding. In this respect, the integration of the European Landscape Convention with territorial planning may boost the unity of a conservation framework in terms of climate change while providing new opportunities for conservation authorities to develop adaptation policies.","[Dastgerdi, Ahmadreza Shirvani; Sargolini, Massimo] Univ Camerino, Sch Architecture & Design, I-63100 Ascoli Piceno, Italy; [Broussard Allred, Shorna] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ctr Conservat Social Sci, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Broussard Allred, Shorna] Cornell Univ, Southeast Asia Program, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Chatrchyan, Allison] Cornell Univ, Dept Dev Sociol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [De Luca, Giuseppe] Univ Florence, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, I-50121 Florence, Italy",University of Camerino; Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University; University of Florence,"Dastgerdi, AS (corresponding author), Univ Camerino, Sch Architecture & Design, I-63100 Ascoli Piceno, Italy.",ahmadreza.shirvani@unicam.it; massimo.sargolini@unicam.it; srb237@cornell.edu; amc256@cornell.edu; giuseppe.deluca@unifi.it,"De Luca, Giuseppe/ABG-3319-2020; Dastgerdi, Ahmadreza Shirvani/O-9539-2018","Dastgerdi, Ahmadreza Shirvani/0000-0002-5681-2222; DE LUCA, GIUSEPPE/0000-0001-7994-2217; sargolini, massimo/0000-0002-4870-5638; Allred, Shorna/0000-0001-6237-0638",Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Italy (MAECI) [PGR06129],Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Italy (MAECI)(Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Italy)),"This paper was developed in the frame of Italy-USA Resilient Landscapes (RELAND), funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Italy (MAECI), grant number of PGR06129.",,50,27,27,5,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,FEB,2020,8,2,,,,,,,26,10.3390/cli8020026,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli8020026,,,14,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,KT6HG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000519114500019,View Full Record in Web of Science

A better understanding of the factors affecting farmers' energy-efficient appliance use behavior can help policymakers design more effective policies. This paper explores the effect of farmers' risk preferences and loss aversion on their energy-efficient appliance use behavior in rural China. Using unique data from a survey and a paired lottery experiment completed by 235 rural household heads in the Dazu District of China, this study finds that the farmers' risk preferences and loss aversion have significant effects on their energy-efficient appliance use behavior. The more risk-averse farmers are less likely to buy or use energy-efficient appliances. The farmers who are more loss averse are more willing to purchase and more likely to use durable energy-efficient appliances. In addition, the farmers' demographic factors (age, gender, education, and family location), their perceptions of climate change adaptation and their trust attitudes have significant effects on their energy-efficient appliance use behavior. This paper contributes to the emerging literature that relates risk preferences and loss aversion in experiments to farmers' energy-efficient appliance use behavior. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The research presents how Green Building Rating Systems (GBRSs) are environmental-oriented tools and should not be confused with Sustainability Assessment Systems; the latter is defined by the sustainability three pillars; environmental, social and economic. Achieving a green building certification does not necessarily mean that the building succeeded in achieving its environmental targets. The financial-driven and prescriptive implementation of GBRS are reasons behind a masked sustainability outcome. This paper presents an objective analysis between two internationally applied GBRSs; LEED and BREEAM, and two particularly developed for the gulf region; Estidama and GSAS. Those four systems are analyzed with respects to them addressing and prioritizing the sustainability pillars. The study also quantitatively discusses the credit weighting given by these systems, focusing on energy and water criteria. Limitations: of GBRSs' application and possible areas of improvement have been highlighted, such as climate change adaptability and the importance of sustainable communities and cities trend. The aim is to help designers and construction stakeholders in defining the development sustainability targets and objectives, without compromising on the local context and regional agenda.","[Awadh, Omair] Cayan Business Ctr, Off 604, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",,"Awadh, O (corresponding author), Cayan Business Ctr, Off 604, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",omairawadh@gmail.com,,"Awadh, Omair/0000-0003-3529-7265",AESG Green Building Consultant,AESG Green Building Consultant,This research was supported by AESG Green Building Consultant.,,23,132,133,12,118,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-7102,,,J BUILD ENG,J.

Results are presented of a baseline study that explores the awareness, attitudes, and behaviours of Taiwanese tourist hotels with respect to climate change and its potential impacts as well as their overall environmental practices. Tourist hotels are defined by the Taiwanese government as hotel establishments of over 80 rooms in rural areas and 50 rooms in city areas. Although the 104 tourist hotels represent only 3.7% of the total number of hotels in Taiwan, they account for over half of international guest nights and had a combined revenue of over TWD$43 billion in 2010. Questionnaires were distributed via email to all tourist hotels in Taiwan and 45 valid returns were received, representing an effective response rate of 43.3%. The results of research illustrate the level of understanding of climate change within Taiwanese tourist hotels and identify the specific climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies that tourist hotels have initiated. Access to such baseline data provides a potentially significant contribution to evaluating the response of the Taiwanese accommodation sector to environment change as well as providing a basis for further comparative studies and benchmarking.","[Su, Yi-Ping; Hall, C.

Extensive effort has been spent in the past trying to improve responses to periods of extensive drought. There have also been renewed calls for improvements to climate change adaptation by adopting more proactive governance and disaster risk reduction approaches. Few efforts, however, have been made to assess how to learn more from past drought efforts so as to enhance overall resilience to future drought risks. Few have examined the role and contributions of institutions and drought governance, either across spatial scales [from regional (i.e., Southern African Development Community) to national scales (e. g., South Africa) to the very local scale (e. g., Limpopo Province, South Africa)] or across temporal scales (over at least 100 yr). Despite calls for better risk management approaches at all levels, this paper illustrates two points. First, a failure to fully understand, integrate, and learn from past efforts may undermine current and future drought response. Second, state-led drought risk reduction, which remains focused on a financial bail-out mentality, with little follow-through on proactive rather than reactive drought responses, is also seriously contributing to the vulnerability of the region to future drought impacts.","[Vogel, Coleen; Koch, Ingrid; Van Zyl, Koos] Univ Witwatersrand, ReVAMP Res Grp, GAES, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Vogel, C (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, ReVAMP Res Grp, GAES, P Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",coleen.vogel@wits.ac.za,,,"National Research Foundation, South Africa","National Research Foundation, South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa)","Research in this paper was supported through a grant by the South African Cooperation Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Development of the National Research Foundation, South Africa.

Field experiments were conducted in the winter wheat season of 2015-2016 and 2019-2020 at the Rasheed County, south of Baghdad, Iraq. The effect of increasing air temperature on the water use efficiency, nitrogen use efficiency, and grain yield of wheat was assessed under different irrigation deficits and nitrogen application rates. Three levels of water depletion: 30, 50, and 70 of available water and four N application rates (0, 140, 200, and 260 kg N ha(-1)) were applied for winter wheat. Two temperature scenarios in the RZWQM2 were created for the study purpose. The first scenario was to add 2C(o) to the normal temperature, and the second scenario was to add 4C(o) to the normal temperature. Results showed that high irrigation levels presented better results than the low levels under projected temperature scenarios. However, all applied nitrogen rates presented similar results under projected temperature (2C(o) and 4C(o) scenarios). Therefore, modifying irrigation requirements is a workable adaption strategy to the increased temperature.","[Masood, T.

However, minimal critical review or evaluation has been done on the process and outcomes of adaptation strategies. This work presents a comparative analysis of progress towards adaptation strategies in nine coastal areas in NW Europe (from Belgium, France, Ireland and UK) where the INTERREG IVb IMCORE project was implemented. Adaptation progress was evaluated using a suite of indicators in six categories: Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Results & Impact, Sustainability and Management. Data were obtained through a combination of questionnaires and interviews. Although a similar IMCORE adaptation process was implemented there were notable differences between areas. Two alternate modes of implementation were identified: one focused more on impact and results and one on institutionalisation and future security of the adaptation process. The length of history of collaborative working was positively associated with progress in adaptation planning. The results thus recommend creation of a base for collaborative working prior to undertaking an adaptation initiative. However, this contrasts with the EU approach for developing adaptation strategies in which seeking agreement with stakeholders responsible for implementation is the penultimate stage.

It is important to evaluate the vulnerability of agricultural production to climate change. The previous methods for evaluating vulnerability are inconsiderate and unrealistic. This paper proposes an improved vulnerability assessment method, introduces the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM)-wheat model to evaluate vulnerability, and uses spring wheat, in Inner Mongolia, China, as an example for evaluating the vulnerability of spring wheat under climate change. The results show that, from 1996 to 2015, the adaptability to climate change of spring wheat production, in Inner Mongolia, increased, and its sensitivity to climate change decreased. That is to say, that climatic conditions have a negative impact on spring wheat, and adaptation measures have a positive impact on spring wheat. From 1996 to 2009, the vulnerability of spring wheat production in Inner Mongolia showed a very significant increasing trend, while showing a significant downward trend during 2009-2015, which is consistent with the actual situation. The improved vulnerability assessment method can reflect the actual impact of climatic conditions on agricultural production. We expect that the new vulnerability assessment method can provide a theoretical basis for studying the impact of climate change on agricultural production.","[Fan, Dongliang; Yang, Feiyun] China Meteorol Adm, Training Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Pan, Zhihua; Pan, Yuying; Han, Guolin; Wang, Jialin; Dong, Zhiqiang] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Su, Xiaoyun] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wu, Dong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Appl Meterol, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration; China Agricultural University; Huazhong Agricultural University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Pan, ZH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",f1042254811@foxmail.com; yangfy@cma.gov.cn; panzhihua@cau.edu.cn; suxiaoyun1995@163.com; caupyy@gmail.com; hanguolin@cau.edu.cn; wangjial@cau.edu.cn; wudonggm@163.com; zhiqiangdong@cau.edu.cn,,,national key R&D program of China [2018YFA0606303]; Public Welfare Industry (Meteorological) Research Project [GYHY201506001]; Non-profit Research Foundation for Meteorology of China [GYHY201506016],national key R&D program of China; Public Welfare Industry (Meteorological) Research Project; Non-profit Research Foundation for Meteorology of China,"This paper is supported by the national key R&D program of China (No. 2018YFA0606303), the Public Welfare Industry (Meteorological) Research Project (No. GYHY201506001) and the Non-profit Research Foundation for Meteorology of China (No. GYHY201506016).",,41,1,2,4,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2018,10,12,,,,,,,4581,10.3390/su10124581,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10124581,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HG9OL,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000455338100247,View Full Record in Web of Science

In recent years, legumes have become one of the major choices of plant research. The legume proteomics is currently represented by more than 100 reference maps and an equal number of stress-responsive proteomes. Among the 48 legumes in the protein databases, most proteomic studies have been accomplished in two model legumes, soybean, and barrel medic. This review highlights recent contributions in the field of legume proteomics to comprehend the defence and regulatory mechanisms during development and adaptation to climatic changes. Here, we attempted to provide a concise overview of the progress in legume proteomics and discuss future developments in three broad perspectives: (i) proteome of organs/tissues; (ii) subcellular compartments; and (iii) spatiotemporal changes in response to stress. Such data mining may aid in discovering potential biomarkers for plant growth, in general, apart from essential components involved in stress tolerance. The prospect of integrating proteome data with genome information from legumes will provide exciting opportunities for plant biologists to achieve long-term goals of crop improvement and sustainable agriculture.","[Rathi, Divya; Gayen, Dipak; Gayali, Saurabh; Chakraborty, Subhra; Chakraborty, Niranjan] Natl Inst Plant Genome Res, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi 110067, India",Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR),"Chakraborty, S; Chakraborty, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Plant Genome Res, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi 110067, India.",subhrac@hotmail.com; nchakraborty@nipgr.ac.in,"Gayen, Dipak/AAD-4830-2020; Gayen, Dipak/N-8906-2017; Gayali, Saurabh/I-2819-2019","Gayen, Dipak/0000-0002-4563-0992; Gayali, Saurabh/0000-0002-1216-6804; Chakraborty, Niranjan/0000-0002-6564-4734","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Govt. of India [38(1385/14/EMR-II)]; CSIR; Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Govt. of India","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Govt. of India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); CSIR(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Govt. of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India)","This work was supported by grants (38(1385/14/EMR-II)) from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Govt. of India.

Recently these systems have been referred to as adaptations to climate change, while traditional ricefish systems have often been abandoned. In 2006, we carried out surveys among 94 farmers either practising rice monoculture or having an improved ricefish system. We analysed data among others with binary logistic regression and simulated adoption by using fuzzy logic. Per capita and per hectare incomes of households practising ricefish systems were nearly double, while their farm size was 1.3 times larger than that of the rice monoculture farms. Households with larger homesteads, i.e. neighbouring irrigated fields and ponds, better access to financial capital and more know-how of rice and fish culture and their integration, were more likely to adopt ricefish systems. Previously identified drivers and factors for adoption, such as an appropriate agro-ecological context and the farmers education and training level, were confirmed. Promoting ricefish systems needs participatory extension and research approaches for sustainable agriculture strategies such as integrated pest management (IPM) in which farmers, trainers and researchers optimize technologies in constantly changing contexts.","[Bosma, Roel H.; Udo, Henk M.

Recent studies have focussed mainly on analysing the consequences of climate change. The present article seeks to examine and qualify the impact of climate change in the mountain areas of the Alps. A first line of enquiry concerns the changing level of danger in the mountain environment. Are mountain areas becoming more dangerous and, if so, in terms of what types of risks and to what degree? However, adopting an approach based on an analysis of natural hazards and their dynamics in response to climate change cannot ignore the economic activities and types of development that already exist in these areas. In this respect, the tourism economy is predominant in mountain regions. Its durability and vitality undoubtedly constitute a priority for local actors. It is not surprising therefore that the latter have set up strategies for adapting to climate change. For planners and decision-makers to ensure integrated approaches in dealing with climate change, it is important that the complex links between natural risks and the types of development in mountain areas are better understood, which calls for a more detailed analysis of the environment in terms of territorial vulnerability.","[Richard, Didier] Cemagref Grenoble, Unite Eros Torrentielle Neige & Avalanches, Grenoble, France; [George-Marcelpoil, Emmanuelle] Cemagref Grenoble, Unite Dev Terr Montagnards, Grenoble, France",INRAE; INRAE,"Richard, D (corresponding author), Cemagref Grenoble, Unite Eros Torrentielle Neige & Avalanches, Grenoble, France.",didier.richard@cemagref.fr; emmanuelle.george-marcelpoil@cemagref.fr,,,,,,,28,0,0,1,14,IGA-ASSOC DIFFUSION RECHERCHE ALPINE,GRENOBLE,"14 BIS AVENUE MARIE REYNOARD, GRENOBLE, 38100, FRANCE",0035-1121,1760-7426,,REV GEOGR ALP,Rev.

Findings from 41 studies selected following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, mostly from Africa and Asia, suggest that climate change perceptions and adaptation are highly contextual and considerably varied by gender and different intersections. Existing gender role, farmers' age, education, knowledge, marital status, intra-household power structure, religion, social status and ethnicity were intersecting with gender and climate change perception and adaptation. Apart from gender and intersectionality, access to resources, social network and local institutions are found to be important correlates of adaptation strategies by farmers. While agriculture being feminized, mere technological changes are not conclusive to climate change adaptation rather socio-cultural, structural and political changes in inevitable. Female farmers were tend to be more concerned and fatalistic about climate change which reminds us the urgency of culturally appropriate climate change communication to obtain informed decision regarding climate change. Future climate change research could be more gender transformative by exploring the existing inequalities lying in different intersections of gender rather than highlighting binary gender differences only.","[Haque, A.

Ports are developing the capacity to integrate climate change adaptation with strategic planning and making capital investments in infrastructure. Geospatial risk assessments have demonstrated utility for planning marine port terminal facilities. Such assessments have tended to be coarse and comprehensive (whole port cities) or narrow, site-specific and single-hazard approaches (single terminal or site scale). This study develops a methodology for major container port terminals on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States to advance a screening approach to sea level rise, identify exposure to terminals and associated surface transportation, and enable comparative assessment. The study leverages geospatial data, elevation, imagery, transportation databases, tide gauges, and sea level rise projections. The approach extends prior methods to quantify exposure across multiple ports and terminals. Hypsographs and modelled future tidal flooding are derived for each port. Results highlight the need for port planning to develop GIS, monitor sea level rise trends, engage in integrative assessments, and optimize mitigation and adaptation actions. Results show similarities across yet also differentially increasing threats of relative sea level rise and tidal flooding at individual terminals.","[Allen, Thomas R.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Geog, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Allen, Thomas R.] Old Dominion Univ, ICAR, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [McLeod, George; Hutt, Sheila] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean & Earth Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Old Dominion University; Old Dominion University; Old Dominion University,"Allen, TR (corresponding author), Old Dominion Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Geog, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.;Allen, TR (corresponding author), Old Dominion Univ, ICAR, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",tallen@odu.edu,,"Allen, Thomas/0000-0003-4462-7182",Commonwealth Center for Recurrent Flooding Resiliency; Commonwealth Center for Recurrent Flooding Resiliency (Virginia),Commonwealth Center for Recurrent Flooding Resiliency; Commonwealth Center for Recurrent Flooding Resiliency (Virginia),This work was supported by the Commonwealth Center for Recurrent Flooding Resiliency;Commonwealth Center for Recurrent Flooding Resiliency (Virginia).,,54,2,2,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-8839,1464-5254,,MARIT POLICY MANAG,Marit.

Beaver dams are well known for increasing water storage and slowing flow through stream networks. For these reasons beavers are increasingly being included in climate change adaptation strategies. But, little work focuses on how environmental changes will affect dam building capacity along stream networks. Here we estimate the capacity of the stream network in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada to support beaver dams under changing environmental conditions using a modelling approach. We show that at capacity, the park's stream network can support 24,690 beaver dams and hold between 8.2 and 12.8 million m(3) of water in beaver ponds. Between 1991 and 2016 the park's vegetation composition shifted to less preferred beaver forage, which led to a 13% decrease in maximum dam capacity. We also found that dam capacity is sensitive to the size of regularly-occurring floods-doubling the 2-year flood reduces the park's dam capacity by 21%. The results show that the potential for beaver to offset some expected climatic-induced changes to the boreal water cycle is more complex than previously thought, as there is a feedback wherein dam capacity can be reduced by changing environmental conditions.","[Stoll, Nichole-Lynn; Westbrook, Cherie J.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Geog & Planning, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Westbrook, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Geog & Planning, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada.",cherie.westbrook@usask.ca,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN-2017-05873, 463960-2015]",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"We thank Cody Misfeldt and Kirby England for field assistance, Thuan Ha for assistance with the vegetation cover change analysis, and the natural resource management staff at Riding Mountain National Park for logistical support.

We used hydrologically modeled data as input for 2D hydraulic modeling. Our results show that, even though the MHQ will increase in the future (2050-2079), the erosional power of the flow will decrease on the study area. This can be attributed to the change of timing in floods from spring to autumn and winter, when the sea levels during flood peaks is higher, causing backwater effect. Even though the mean depth will not increase notably (from 1.14 m to 1.25 m) during MHQ, compared to the control period (1985-2014), the inundated area will expand by 15% due to the flat terrain. The increase in flooding may be restrained by adaptive regulations: strategies favoring ecologically sustainable and recreationally desirable lake water levels were modeled. The demands of environment, society, and hydropower are not necessarily contradictory in terms of climate change adaptation, and regulation could provide an adaptive practice in the areas of increased flooding.","[Kasvi, Elina; Lotsari, Eliisa] Univ Turku, Dept Geog & Geol, Turun 20014, Finland; [Lotsari, Eliisa] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Geog & Hist Studies, Yliopistokatu 2, Joensuu 80101, Finland; [Kumpumaki, Miia; Dubrovin, Tanja; Veijalainen, Noora] Finnish Environm Inst, Latokartanonkaari 11, Helsinki 00790, Finland",University of Turku; University of Eastern Finland; Finnish Environment Institute,"Kasvi, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Geog & Geol, Turun 20014, Finland.",elina.kasvi@utu.fi,"Veijalainen, Noora/AAN-4826-2020","Veijalainen, Noora/0000-0003-4665-933X","Academy of Finland [296090, 293389, 307362, 292735]; Emil Aaltonen foundation; Department of Geographical and Historical Studies of the University of Eastern Finland; Finnish Environment Institute; ELY Centres of Finland; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Finland; Academy of Finland (AKA) [292735, 307362, 296090] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Emil Aaltonen foundation; Department of Geographical and Historical Studies of the University of Eastern Finland; Finnish Environment Institute; ELY Centres of Finland; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Finland; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),"This study was funded by the Academy of Finland (InfraRiver project, grant number 296090; COMBAT project, grant number 293389; and Centre of Excellence in Laser Scanning Research, grant numbers 307362 and 292735), Emil Aaltonen foundation, the Department of Geographical and Historical Studies of the University of Eastern Finland, Finnish Environment Institute, ELY Centres of Finland and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Finland.",,90,4,4,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2019,11,9,,,,,,,1827,10.3390/w11091827,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11091827,,,25,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,JB8PJ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000488834400090,View Full Record in Web of Science

Projections of future climate at local spatial scales and fine temporal resolutions are subject to the same uncertainties as those at the global scale but the partition among uncertainty sources (emission scenarios, climate models, and internal climate variability) remains largely unquantified. At the local scale, the uncertainty of the mean and extremes of precipitation is shown to be irreducible for mid and end-of-century projections because it is almost entirely caused by internal climate variability (stochasticity). Conversely, projected changes in mean air temperature and other meteorological variables can be largely constrained, even at local scales, if more accurate emission scenarios can be developed. The results were obtained by applying a comprehensive stochastic downscaling technique to climate model outputs for three exemplary locations. In contrast with earlier studies, the three sources of uncertainty are considered as dependent and, therefore, non-additive. The evidence of the predominant role of internal climate variability leaves little room for uncertainty reduction in precipitation projections; however, the inference is not necessarily negative, because the uncertainty of historic observations is almost as large as that for future projections with direct implications for climate change adaptation measures.","[Fatichi, Simone; Peleg, Nadav; Molnar, Peter; Rimkus, Stefan; Burlando, Paolo] ETH, Inst Environm Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ivanov, Valeriy Y.; Kim, Jongho] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Paschalis, Athanasios] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Southampton, Hants, England; [Paschalis, Athanasios] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Rimkus, Stefan] SCOR Global P&C, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kim, Jongho] Sejong Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Caporali, Enrica] Univ Florence, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Florence, Italy",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Southampton; Duke University; Sejong University; University of Florence,"Fatichi, S (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Environm Engn, Zurich, Switzerland.",simone.fatichi@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,"Rimkus, Stefan/C-9853-2013; Molnar, Peter/F-3066-2013; Peleg, Nadav/Q-9719-2016","Rimkus, Stefan/0000-0002-1636-4226; Molnar, Peter/0000-0001-6437-4931; Peleg, Nadav/0000-0001-6863-2934; CAPORALI, ENRICA/0000-0001-6389-3801; Fatichi, Simone/0000-0003-1361-6659",SNSF [P2EZP2-52244]; Stavros Niarchos Foundation; NSF [EAR 1151443]; Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1151443] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,SNSF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Stavros Niarchos Foundation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments that contributed to improve the quality of the manuscript.

The results were compared to an earlier study on 12-year-olds, and the same coping strategies, problem-focused coping, de-emphasizing the seriousness of the threat, and meaning-focused coping, were identified. As in the study on children, problem-focused and meaning-focused coping were positively related to felt efficacy and environmental behavior, while de-emphasizing the threat was negatively related to these measures. As expected, the more problem-focused coping the adolescents used, the more likely it was that they experienced negative affect in everyday life. This association was explained by the tendency for highly problem-focused adolescents to worry more about climate change. In contrast, meaning-focused coping was positively related to both well-being and optimism. When controlling for well-known predictors such as values and gender, meaning-focused and problem-focused coping were independent positive predictors of environmental efficacy and pro-environmental behavior, while de-emphasizing the threat was a negative predictor of pro-environmental behavior. The results are discussed in relation to coping theories and earlier studies on coping with climate change.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Educ, S-75002 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Ojala, M (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Educ, Box 2136, S-75002 Uppsala, Sweden.",maria.ojala@edu.uu.se,,"Ojala, Maria/0000-0002-6613-5974",Swedish Research Council Formas,Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),This study was supported by research grants to the author from the Swedish Research Council Formas.,,73,76,77,5,70,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2013,5,5,,,,,2191,2209,,10.3390/su5052191,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su5052191,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,213IG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000324048800023,View Full Record in Web of Science

While the polarization of climate change attitudes in American politics represents a barrier to climate adaptation efforts, it is not well-understood how political ideology mediates how individuals connect the abstract concept of climate change to concrete experiences with environmental risks. Understanding this link in the context of adaptation decision-making is important, as the effects of many, household-level adaptation efforts compound over space and time, affecting community flood risk and vulnerability. This paper asks, how do political ideologies interact with threat perception to affect coastal climate adaptation decisions? We frame this analysis using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). Using responses from a survey of residents (n = 164) in North Carolina's (USA) Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula, we examine how measures of residents' subjective norms, threat-appraisals, and self-efficacy influence their intent to retreat or topographically adapt. We find that, despite political polarization around climate change, generally, when given concrete examples of risk, respondents' political beliefs appear unrelated to their plans to protect their property and livelihoods.","[Schwaller, Nora Louise; Kelmenson, Sophie; BenDor, Todd K.; Spurlock, Danielle] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, New East Bldg,Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Schwaller, NL (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, New East Bldg,Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",nschwall@live.unc.edu; soph@live.unc.edu; bendor@unc.edu; dspurloc@live.unc.edu,"Schwaller, Nora/GSN-9220-2022","Schwaller, Nora/0000-0002-2244-5735",U.S. National Science Foundation under Coastal SEES [1427188]; U.S. National Science Foundation Geography and Spatial Sciences [1660450],U.S. National Science Foundation under Coastal SEES; U.S. National Science Foundation Geography and Spatial Sciences,"This paper is based upon work graciously supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Coastal SEES Grant No. 1427188 and U.S. National Science Foundation Geography and Spatial Sciences Grant No. 1660450.

We test two contrasting hypotheses: the presence of other adaptation donors in a recipient country may increase or reduce the likelihood of donor i to provide adaptation aid to that recipient. In the former case, donors support adaptation in the same recipient countries; in the latter, they provide their adaptation aid to different recipient countries. We model adaptation aid allocations as a network, and apply an innovative method, bipartite temporal exponential random graph models, to bilateral adaptation aid flows between 2010 and 2016. Our empirical analysis finds strong evidence for donor interactions. The results suggest a positive effect of other donors: donors tend to support adaptation in similar sets of recipient countries. These results provide further evidence that adaptation aid largely follow the structures and processes of traditional development aid, which poses questions for the additionality of finance for adaptation to climate change.

Building upon ecological economic research which indicates that there is little difference between the economic assumptions which are related to the onset of human-induced climate change and those underlying the proposed solution, these Inuit voices critique the separation of their knowledge-Inuit Qaujimaningit-into the research categories of ecological knowledge and traditional understandings as a means for economically adapting to climate change. It is suggested that Inuit knowledge of climate change offers a challenge to economic rationalization if researchers move beyond a mere documentation of ecological knowledge and engage the interconnected cultural understandings. The conclusion proposes that the relation between culture and ecology should be of significant interest to ecological economic thinking that aims to consider economic rationality, the global economy, and its climatic impacts in the context of bioregional adaptations.

We then analyzed the thermal comfort and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of each city during a typical heat wave. Finally, the driving forces of the potential socioeconomic, natural, and landscape factors influencing thermal comfort were analyzed using geographic detectors. The results show that the thermal comfort index had similar spatial patterns and differentiation characteristics in different years, and the interannual variation was not obvious. Cities in the typical heat wave period were mainly distributed in East and Northwest China. The driving factor in the contribution rate of the same index in different years was basically the same and was not affected by the change in years, and the highest contribution rate was the natural factor.","[Wu, Jiansheng; Li, Xuechen; Li, Si; Liu, Chang; Yi, Tengyun; Zhao, Yuhao] Peking Univ, Sch Urban Planning & Design, Key Lab Urban Habitat Environm Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jiansheng; Zhao, Yuhao] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Minist Educ, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"Wu, JS (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Urban Planning & Design, Key Lab Urban Habitat Environm Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.;Wu, JS (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Minist Educ, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",wujs@pkusz.edu.cn; 2001212695@stu.pku.edu.cn; 1801213212@pku.edu.cn; clara-liu@pku.edu.cn; tengyun_yi@stu.pku.edu.cn; zhaoyh2017@pku.edu.cn,"chang, Liu/GXN-3986-2022; Zhao, Yuhao/ABC-7605-2021","Zhao, Yuhao/0000-0002-9014-5259",National Natural Science Foundation of China [42130505],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42130505).,,78,1,1,11,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

By accounting for evaporative demand a posteriori at 80 island groups distributed among Earth's major ocean basins, we reveal a robust yet spatially variable tendency towards increasing aridity at over 73% of island groups (16 million people) by mid-century. Although about half of the island groups are projected to experience increased rainfall predominantly in the deep tropics projected changes in evaporation are more uniform, shifting the global distribution of changes in island freshwater balance towards greater aridity. In many cases, the magnitude of projected drying is comparable to the amplitude of the estimated observed interannual variability, with important consequences for extreme events as well as mean climate. Future freshwater stress, including geographic and seasonal variability, has important implications for climate change adaptation scenarios for vulnerable human populations living on islands across the world ocean.","[Karnauskas, Kristopher B.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, 216 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Karnauskas, Kristopher B.] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 311 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Donnelly, Jeffrey P.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Anchukaitis, Kevin J.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, POB 210137, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Arizona,"Karnauskas, KB (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, 216 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Karnauskas, KB (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 311 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",kristopher.karnauskas@colorado.edu,,,"Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP); Alfred P.

It implies that the long-term climate change mitigation challenge should be reframed as a stock problem, while the overwhelming majority of climate policies continue to focus on the flow of CO2 into the atmosphere in 2030 or 2050. An obstacle, however, to the use of a cumulative carbon budget in policy is uncertainty in the size of this budget consistent with any specific temperature-based goal such as limiting warming to 2A degrees C. This arises from uncertainty in the climate response to CO2 emissions, which is relatively tractable, and uncertainty in future warming due to non-CO2 drivers, which is less so. We argue these uncertainties are best addressed through policies that recognize the need to reduce net global CO2 emissions to zero to stabilize global temperatures but adapt automatically to evolving climate change.

Much of the climate impact is concentrated in urban and coastal areas, as urban development spreads into areas that are hazard-prone. Often this development is dominated by poor quality homes in informal settlements or slums on informal or illegally occupied or subdivided land. Urban development needs to be more climate-resilient to meet the post millennium development goals (MDGs) agenda. One of the elements in achieving climate-resilient urban development is the degree to which climate change adaptation and risk management are mainstreamed into two major elements of land governance, viz, securing and safeguarding of land rights, and planning and control of land-use.

Here we propose that greater insight and understanding of the health-related impacts of climate change can be gained by integrating the positivist approaches used in public health and epidemiology, with holistic social science perspectives on health in which the concept of 'wellbeing' is more explicitly recognised. Such an approach enables us to acknowledge and explore a wide range of more subtle, yet important health-related outcomes of climate change. At the same time, incorporating notions of wellbeing enables recognition of both the health co-benefits and dis-benefits of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies across different population groups and geographical contexts. The paper recommends that future adaptation and mitigation policies seek to ensure that benefits are available for all since current evidence suggests that they are spatially and socially differentiated, and their accessibility is dependent on a range of contextually specific socio-cultural factors.

Recent studies have reported that more than three-quarters of the people in India are exposed to pollution levels higher than the limits recommended by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards in India and significantly higher than those recommended by theWorld Health Organization. Despite the poor air quality, the monitoring of air pollution levels is limited even in large urban areas in India and virtually absent in small towns and rural areas. The lack of data results in a minimal understanding of spatial patterns of air pollutants at local and regional levels. This paper presents particulate air pollution trends monitored over one year in three small cities in India. The findings are important for framing state and regional level policies for addressing air pollution problems in cities, and achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) linked to public health, reduction in the adverse environmental impact of cities, and adaptation to climate change, as indicated by SDGs 3.9, 11.6 and 11.b.

Results show that farming systems in Tunisian semi-arid areas remain threatened against negative impact of climate change since 80% of farms in the sample have shown low resilience levels. The most important determinants of agricultural systems' resilience are farmers' income and access to food, adaptive capacity, and access to productive and non-productive assets. Results indicate also that integrated systems, income diversification, along with cooperation and collective action are the key options to enhance resilience of rural households and farming systems.

However, among scientists, opinions about how to implement it in spatial-planning practices are varied. Science-based environmental factors, human wellbeing, and sustainable development can be strengthened by developing spatial-planning-based ecosystem adaptations (SPBEAs). Therefore, this article aims to assess how the SPBEA model can be developed within an area prone to shoreline retreat. A coastal area of the Sayung subdistrict in Central Java, Indonesia, was selected as a study area because it has experienced a massive shoreline retreat. A multicriteria analysis (MCA) method was employed for developing the model by using the geographic information system (GIS) technique of analysis, divided into three steps: the fishpond zone determination, which involved the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method in the process of model development; the fishpond site determination; SPBEA fishpond site development. The results show that the SPBEA model is the best practice solution for combatting shoreline retreat because of tidal waves and/or sea-level rise. The spatial site management should empower the coastal protection zone and the sustainable fishpond zone by implementing a silvofishery approach.","[Sutrisno, Dewayany; Darmawan, Mulyanto; Rahadiati, Ati] Geospatial Informat Agcy BIG, Ctr Res Promot & Cooperat, Cibinong 16911, Indonesia; [Helmi, Muhammad] Diponegoro Univ, Fac Fisheries & Marine Sci, Oceanog Dept, Semarang 50275, Indonesia; [Yusmur, Armaiki] SEAMEO BIOTROP, Reg Res Ctr Trop Biol, Bogor 16134, Indonesia; [Hashim, Mazlan] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Geosci & Digital Earth Ctr, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Shih, Peter Tian-Yuan] Natl Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan; [Qin, Rongjun] Ohio State Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geodet Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Qin, Rongjun] Ohio State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Qin, Rongjun] Ohio State Univ, Translat Data Analyt Inst, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Zhang, Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",Diponegoro University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Sutrisno, D (corresponding author), Geospatial Informat Agcy BIG, Ctr Res Promot & Cooperat, Cibinong 16911, Indonesia.",dewayany@big.go.id; drmoel2011@gmail.com; ati.rahadiati@big.go.id; muhammadhelmi69@gmail.com; micky@biotrop.org; mazlanhashim@utm.my; tyshih@mail.nctu.edu.tw; qin.324@osu.edu; zhangli@radi.ac.cn,"Hashim, Mazlan/J-7291-2012; Shih, Peter Tian-Yuan/AAD-9022-2022","Hashim, Mazlan/0000-0001-8284-3332; Shih, Peter Tian-Yuan/0000-0001-7452-2491; sutrisno, dewayany/0000-0002-9334-3840; Yusmur, Armaiki/0000-0002-0840-710X; Qin, Rongjun/0000-0002-5896-1379; Rahadiati, Ati/0000-0001-6254-0123; Darmawan, Mulyanto/0000-0001-5828-5887",Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) [CBA2019-11SY],Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN),"This research was funded by the Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN), grant number CBA2019-11SY-Sutrisno, supported in-kind by Geospatial Center for Excellent, Geospatial Information Agency/Badan informasi Geospasial (BIG), the Indonesian Society for Remote Sensing (MAPIN/ISRS), University technology Malaysia, Seameo Biotrop, China Academy of Sciences, Ohio state university, and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.",,63,4,4,1,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

Current building codes and standards focus on minimum performance criteria for individual buildings exposed to severe hazard events to ensure occupant safety. However, they do not consider the resilience of buildings and building portfolios, which are key factors in determining whether a community can respond to and recover from a severe natural hazard event. Light-frame wood residential buildings dominate the residential market in the US, represent a significant percentage of the investment in the built environment, and are especially vulnerable to hurricane winds and storm surge in coastal areas. Our study of the impact of various hurricane and climate change scenarios on the performance of coastal residential communities reveals that decision-making at the community level is needed to develop rational engineering and urban planning policies, to mitigate the impact of hurricane wind and storm surge, and to adapt to climate change.

This opens up an integrated view, which takes into account both societal and individual aspects of the perception and evaluation of environmental justice. In this sense, notions of environmental justice(s) are seen as the result of discursive processes, historical contexts and a social localization and standardization that is shaped by both cognitive evaluation processes and emotions. Additionally, environmental justice in participation processes is considered in the context of environmental and sustainability policy and its implementation, first summarising the points of criticism of participation processes and then discussing environmental justice as an aspect of participation practice. From this, some key points for a more justice-sensitive design of participation processes in the context of environmental and sustainability policies and programmes (e.g. adaptation to climate change, urban planning, energy system transformation) are derived. This interdisciplinary analysis shows that there is not 'one' environmental justice, but a multitude of ideas and evaluations based on different concepts and perceptions.","[Baasch, Stefanie] Univ Bremen, Sustainabil Res Ctr Artec, Enrique Schmidt Str 7, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Baasch, S (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Sustainabil Res Ctr Artec, Enrique Schmidt Str 7, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",stefanie.baasch@uni-bremen.de,,"Baasch, Stefanie/0000-0002-1092-080X",,,,,70,7,7,8,19,GESELLSCHAFT ERDKUNDE BERLIN,BERLIN,"ARNO-HOLZ-STR 14, BERLIN, 12165, GERMANY",0013-9998,,,ERDE,ERDE,,2020,151,2-3,,,,,77,89,,10.12854/erde-2020-516,http://dx.doi.org/10.12854/erde-2020-516,,,13,"Geography; Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Physical Geography; Geology,NH1TZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000564460800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

A vulnerability framework is applied in the community of Mimkyemfre to identify and explain the multiple underlying political, socioeconomic and environmental forces that influence the ways in which people are exposed and sensitive to climate, and their capacities to adapt to changing conditions. The results of the study indicate that the community experiences a range of biophysical and socioeconomic conditions that contribute to its vulnerability. Vulnerability was found to change over time and in some cases was cyclical, in that certain actions taken for the purposes of adaptation were found to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Processes of vulnerability were also found to occur at several scales and were experienced unevenly at the community level. The findings of this assessment have important implications for the design and implementation of successful adaptation initiatives, both in Africa and elsewhere. In particular, they demonstrate the need to understand the social, economic and institutional challenges to development as a basis for any contemplation of adaptation to climate change.","[Westerhoff, Lisa; Smit, Barry] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Westerhoff, L (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",lisa.westerhoff@gmail.com; bsmit@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,69,78,78,1,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

This research aims to provide an overview of tools that intend to facilitate the uptake of NBS for urban climate adaptation supporting cities in overcoming their challenges. To do so, this paper (i) presents the results of interviews and workshops with municipal officers and decision-makers from different European cities that identified the challenges they experience with NBS uptake; (ii) selects and reviews NBS tools and (iii) analyzes them on their capacity to address these implementation challenges. Our research revealed four key challenges that municipal officers experience: resources availability; level of expertise, know-how or competence; the institutional setting, and collaborative governance and planning. The results from the tools' review show that existing tools can support overcoming a lack of expertise (31), but, to a smaller extent, can also be of use when experiencing the institutional setting (13), availability of resources (11), and collaborative governance and planning (10) as a challenge.

In comparison with a baseline scenario, the results show reductions in the output of most agricultural crops will cause increased consumer prices for these agri-cultural commodities, with a consequential decline in overall household consumption within next few decades. The projected decline in crop production and increases in food prices will enhance the potential for food insecurity. Thus, climate change will negatively impact the overall GDP and most of the macro and microeconomic variables of the Sri Lankan economy.

Data were collected from 1538 rice farmers in the province of Hubei, China. We empirically examine the determinants of rice growers' intentions towards mitigation and adaption and their actual behaviors via partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our results indicate that for TPB, behavioral intentions and perceived behavioral control account for 42.1% of farmers' adaptation behaviors, but only 25.6% for mitigation behaviors. In contrast, for the VBN theory, proenvironmental personal norms explain 54.2% of growers' mitigation behaviors, but only 28.4% of adaptation behaviors. Thus, TPB appears to be more successful at predicting self-interest-oriented behaviors, such as climate change adaptation. On the other hand, our findings provide evidence that the VBN theory performs better when explaining altruistic behaviors like mitigation behaviors. These conclusions have important implications for the formulation of future policies that aim to promote effective and sustainable proenvironmental behavioral changes in agriculture, while ensuring global food security.","[Zhang, Lu; Liang, Zhihui] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, M517,Humanities & Social Sci Bldg 1,Shizishan St, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lu; Luo, Biliang] South China Agr Univ, Natl Sch Agr Inst & Dev, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lu; Ruiz-Menjivar, Jorge] Univ Florida, Dept Family Youth & Community Sci, POB 110310,32607, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Zhang, Lu; Ruiz-Menjivar, Jorge; Swisher, Mickie E.] Univ Florida, Global Lab Econ & Behav Res, 32607,POB 110310, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Ruiz-Menjivar, Jorge; Swisher, Mickie E.] Univ Florida, Ctr Sustainable & Organ Food Syst, POB 110310,32611-0310, Gainesville, FL 32607 USA; [Ruiz-Menjivar, Jorge; Swisher, Mickie E.] Social Dimens Food & Agr Lab, POB 110310,32611-0310, Gainesville, FL 32607 USA",Huazhong Agricultural University; South China Agricultural University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Liang, ZH (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, M517,Humanities & Social Sci Bldg 1,Shizishan St, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;Luo, BL (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Natl Sch Agr Inst & Dev, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China.",luzhang@mail.hzau.edu.cn; jorgerm@ufl.edu; luobl@scau.edu.cn; zhihuiliang@webmail.hzau.edu.cn,,"Ruiz-Menjivar, Jorge/0000-0003-1167-4839","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019T120736, 2018M640790]; Natural Sciences Foundation of China [41501213, 71333004, 71742003]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662017PY045]; University of Florida International Center's Global Fellowship Award; UFIC Collaborative Faculty Team Project",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); University of Florida International Center's Global Fellowship Award; UFIC Collaborative Faculty Team Project,"This work was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019T120736, 2018M640790); the Natural Sciences Foundation of China (41501213; 71333004; 71742003); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2662017PY045); the University of Florida International Center's Global Fellowship Award; and the UFIC Collaborative Faculty Team Project.

Method: Guided by the PRISMA Statement review checklist, a systematic review of the Scopus and Web of Science database has identified 10 related studies. The articles were assessed and analyzed after evaluated using The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools (JBI). Thematic analysis was obtained after using Nvivo software as a tool for data analysis by author. Result: Further review of these articles resulted in three main themes-maternal changes during expressing breast milk, pumping challenges and impact of motivation factors to initiating lactation. Conclusion: Expressing breast milk should be recognized as an important way to restructure motherhood with a preterm infant in NICU. However, maintaining expressed breast milk during preterm infants' treatment period in NICU may increase stress and difficulties for some mothers. Some recommendations are emphasized in relation to the need for more qualitative studies in this issue, which is to have a specific and standard systematic review method for guide research synthesis in context of climate change adaptation.

To develop long-term policies that address these challenges, strategies are needed to identify high-yield low-emission pathways for particular agricultural production systems. In this paper, we used bio-physical and socio-economic models to analyze the impact of different management practices on crop yield and emissions in two contrasting agricultural production systems of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) of India. The result revealed the importance of considering both management and socio-economic factors in the development of high-yield low-emission pathways for cereal production systems. Nitrogen use rate and frequency of application, tillage and residue management and manure application significantly affected GHG emissions from the cereal systems. In addition, various socio-economic factors such as gender, level of education, training on climate change adaptation and mitigation and access to information significantly influenced the adoption of technologies contributing to high-yield low-emission pathways. We discussed the policy implications of these findings in the context of food security and climate change.","[Sapkota, Tek B.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, NASC Complex, New Delhi 110012, India; [Aryal, Jeetendra P.; Stirling, Clare M.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Texcoco, Mexico; [Khatri-Chhetri, Arun; Shirsath, Paresh B.; Arumugam, Ponraj] CIMMYT, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, BISA, NASC Complex, New Delhi 110012, India",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR,"Sapkota, TB (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, NASC Complex, New Delhi 110012, India.",t.sapkota@cgiar.org,"Sapkota, Tek Bahadur/AAC-3155-2020; Arumugam, Ponraj/GVT-8235-2022; Arumugam, Ponraj/AAB-9352-2022","Sapkota, Tek Bahadur/0000-0001-5311-0586; Arumugam, Ponraj/0000-0003-2111-1482; ","International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)(CGIAR); CGIAR research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR)","This work was carried out as part of International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the CGIAR research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), with the support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

Understanding pastoralists' perception of and response to climatic change is necessary for sustainable adaptation strategies. Systematic and purposive sampling techniques were used to select 302 households in Turkana County of northwestern Kenya. Descriptive statistics and Heckman probit model were used to analyse the data obtained from the household's interviews. The results show that majority of households' perceive rise in temperatures and rainfall variability over the past three decades. Pastoralists' perception of climate change was significantly (p<.05) associated with gender of the household head, livestock ownership, herd size and access to extension services. Heckman's sample selectivity probit model revealed that factors influencing pastoralist's choices of climate change adaptation include gender and education level of the household head, household size, wealth in terms of livestock ownership, distance to markets, access to credit and extension services. We conclude that as a prerequisite for long-term commitment to household's climate resilience, policies and programmes should aim at improving these factors.","[Opiyo, Francis; Wasonga, Oliver V.; Nyangito, Moses M.; Mureithi, Stephen M.] Univ Nairobi, Dept Land Resources Management & Agr Technol LARM, Nairobi, Kenya; [Opiyo, Francis] United Nations Dev Programme, Dryland Dev Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya; [Wasonga, Oliver V.] German Inst Trop & Subtrop Agr DITSL, Witzenhausen, Germany; [Obando, Joy] Kenyatta Univ, Dept Geog, Nairobi, Kenya; [Munang, Richard] United Nations Environm Programme, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi; Kenyatta University,"Opiyo, F (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Dept Land Resources Management & Agr Technol LARM, Nairobi, Kenya.;Opiyo, F (corresponding author), United Nations Dev Programme, Dryland Dev Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya.",francis.opiyo@undp.org,"Mureithi, Stephen M./H-3609-2019","Mureithi, Stephen M./0000-0002-2616-6995; Wasonga, Prof. Oliver/0000-0002-5929-6091","African Climate Change Fellowship Program (ACCFP)/START, though the University of Dare salaam, Tanzania; Kenyatta University; Department of Land Resources Management and Agricultural Technology (LARMAT), University of Nairobi, Kenya; Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre/START and UNISDR under Climate and Development Knowledge Network; TWAS small grant","African Climate Change Fellowship Program (ACCFP)/START, though the University of Dare salaam, Tanzania; Kenyatta University; Department of Land Resources Management and Agricultural Technology (LARMAT), University of Nairobi, Kenya; Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre/START and UNISDR under Climate and Development Knowledge Network; TWAS small grant","This study was supported by African Climate Change Fellowship Program (ACCFP)/START, though the University of Dare salaam, Tanzania, in collaboration with Kenyatta University and Department of Land Resources Management and Agricultural Technology (LARMAT), University of Nairobi, Kenya.

The objectives of the paper are to: (i) explain the concept of diversification to reduce risk, as formulated in MPT; (ii) discuss the conditions for applying MPT to IWRM, and provide examples of these; and (iii) analyze the opportunities and limitations of applying MPT to the design of IWRM and adaptation policies. It is shown that MPT can be applied when a case meets four conditions: (1) there is more than one possible investment at a given time; (2) these investments are subject to risk; (3) there is information about the historical and/or expected return of these investments; and (4) the same conditions do not affect all investments equally, meaning that their returns are imperfectly correlated. Analysis of a case study Noorderkwartier in the Netherlands concludes that MPT can contribute to designing portfolios of combinations of investments in flood risk management-technical measures, spatial planning and insurance-which are robust to uncertainty in long-term projections such as present in climate change scenarios.","[Aerts, Jeroen C.

Critical considerations for success include the need for genuine participation by communities, inclusive project governance, integration of local work into national policies and practices, sustaining livelihoods and income (for example through the voluntary carbon market and/or national Payment for Ecosystem Services and other types of financial compensation schemes) and simplification of carbon accounting and verification methodologies to lower barriers to entry.","[Dencer-Brown, Amrit Melissa] Edinburgh Napier Univ, 9 Sighthill Court, Edinburgh EH11 4BN, Scotland; [Shilland, Robyn; Huxham, Mark] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Edinburgh EH11 4BN, Scotland; [Friess, Daniel] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore, Singapore; [Friess, Daniel] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Ctr Nat, Based Climate Solut, Singapore, Singapore; [Herr, Dorothee] IUCN, Global Marine & Polar Program, Gland, Switzerland; [Benson, Lisa] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci Cefas, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Berry, Nicholas J.] Landscapes & Livelihoods Grp LLP, Edinburgh, Scotland; [Cifuentes-Jara, Miguel] CATIE Ctr Agron Trop Invest & Ensenanza, Turrialba 30501, Costa Rica; [Colas, Patrick] Conservat Finance Afr Field Div, Conservat Int, Ndege Rd, Nairobi, Kenya; [Damayanti, Ellyn] IPB Univ, Fac Forestry & Environm, Bogor 16680, Indonesia; [Garcia, Elisa Lopez; Andrade-Medina, Rosalia; Rosette, Minerva] CINVESTAV, Lab Prod Primaria Recursos Mar, Ctr Invest Estudios Avanzados, Inst Politecn Nacl Unidad Merida, Carretera Antigua Progreso Km 6, Merida 97310, Yucatan, Mexico; [Garcia, Elisa Lopez; Andrade-Medina, Rosalia; Rosette, Minerva] Resiliencia Azul, NPO, Mogi Das Cruzes, Mexico; [Gavaldao, Marina] Uba Sustainabil Inst, Blue Carbon Hub, Marseille, France; [Grimsditch, Gabriel; Mohamed, Ahmed] United Nat Environm Programme, UN Ave,POB 67578, Nairobi, Kenya; [Hejnowicz, Adam P.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Hejnowicz, Adam P.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Howard, Jennifer] Blue Carbon Program, Conservat Int, 2011 Crystal Dr, Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Islam, Sheikh Tawhidul] Jahangirnagar Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Dhaka 1342, Bangladesh; [Kennedy, Hilary] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Wales LL59 5AB, England; [Kivugo, Rahma Rashid] Mikoko Pamoja Community Base Org, POB 178-80404, Msambweni, Kenya; [Lang'at, Joseph K.

Yet little is known about what happens when such projects are implemented on the ground. This paper presents the results of a research project that sought to understand local perceptions and responses to planned CBA interventions in rural coastal communities in Bangladesh. Based on a qualitative approach, this paper presents the dominant narratives within local communities about the NGO-initiated CBA project. Findings highlight there is a deep disconnection between the objectives of CBA interventions and the perceptions of local communities about the project. Such a difference in perceptions meant that project participants prioritized personal gains over the creation of collective capacities to adapt to climate change. The paper concludes that in order to resolve such tensions, the gap between 'community-based' adaptation theory and practice needs to be addressed.","[Masud-All-Kamal, Md] Univ Chittagong, Dept Sociol, Chattogram, Bangladesh; [Nursey-Bray, Melissa] Univ Adelaide, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Chittagong; University of Adelaide,"Nursey-Bray, M (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",melissa.nursey-bray@adelaide.edu.au,,"Masud-All-Kamal, Md./0000-0003-2412-668X",,,,,58,3,3,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Each level and type of entity has some capacity to influence climate change action and policy, but as a multi-level collective action problem, it is not surprising that there is underprovision of climate change action; this challenge highlights the need to better understand decision-making processes. We propose an integrated research frontier that examines inter-level feedback processes, the role of individuals and organizations in promoting trust within and across levels, the importance of establishing and communicating norms, and inclusion of worldviews to situate decision makers within narratives of climate change. The failure to mitigate and adapt to climate change is a social science problem, perhaps the biggest social problem our society faces. To solve it requires that we advance a new frontier on decision making across a complex set of multi-level collective action relationships.","[York, Abigail M.; Otten, Caitlin Drummond; BurnSilver, Shauna; Anderies, John M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, POB 872402, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Otten, Caitlin Drummond] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Erb Inst, 700 East Univ,Kresge Hall,3rd Floor West, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Neuberg, Steven L.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Psychol, POB 871104, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Anderies, John M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"York, AM (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, POB 872402, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",abigail.york@asu.edu,,,National Science Foundation [NNA-1928235],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number NNA-1928235.,,86,9,9,3,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

A question of major concern is whether coral reefs can adapt to and survive the predicted increases in global temperatures over the remainder of this century. A simple model of a coral reef ecosystem is developed to include adaptation of key growth and mortality parameters for a coral polyp population and its symbiotic algae population. Interacting populations of pelagic phytoplankton and zooplankton are also simulated. The model simulates a stable coral reef ecosystem in the absence of climate change, but predicts the extinction of the coral population under global warming if the populations do not adapt. However, when the coral and symbiont populations adapt to climate change, a stable coral reef ecosystem is predicted. The model allows identification of processes and parameters to inform attempts to measure the key attributes of adapting coral reef ecosystems.","[Cropp, Roger] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Cropp, Roger] Univ Queensland, Ctr Applicat Nat Resource Math, Sch Math & Phys, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Norbury, John] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Andrew Wiles Bldg,Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6GG, England",Griffith University; University of Queensland; University of Oxford,"Cropp, R (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.;Cropp, R (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Applicat Nat Resource Math, Sch Math & Phys, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",r.cropp@griffith.edu.au,"Cropp, Roger/C-1019-2008","Cropp, Roger/0000-0001-9582-857X",,,,,28,4,4,7,63,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Uncertainty associated with emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), General Circulation Models (GCMs) (CanESM2, CNMR-CM5 and HadGEM2-AO), statistical downscaling methods (delta change method, quantile mapping and SDSM), and hydrological models (ANN, HEC-HMS and SWAT) is examined. The results showed the largest uncertainty source of the streamflow projection is the GCM simulations, followed by the statistical downscaling methods, hydrological models and emission scenarios. In addition, the use of hydrological models has a considerable impact on uncertainty in the simulations of dry seasonal streamflow.

The usefulness of private insurance as an adaptation instrument to increased flood risks is examined, which is currently unavailable in the Netherlands. It is questioned whether the currently dominant role of the Dutch government in providing damage relief is justified from an economic efficiency perspective. Characteristics of flood insurance arrangements in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France are compared in order to identify possible future directions for arrangements in the Netherlands. It is argued that social welfare improves when insurance companies take responsibility for part of the risks associated with climate change.","[Botzen, W. J. W.; van den Bergh, J. C. J.

We draw evidence from life histories with 35 pastoralists across three rural, peri-urban and urban communities.

As this often involves splitting households across multiple locations, we look at how these reconfigured households support pastoralists' wellbeing.","[Camfield, Laura; Leavy, Jen] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Endale, Senait] Addis Ababa Univ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Tefera, Tilahun] Haramaya Univ, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia",University of East Anglia; Addis Ababa University; Haramaya University,"Camfield, L (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",l.camfield@uea.ac.uk; j.leavy@uea.ac.uk; senaiten@ymail.com; tilahun_tefera@yahoo.com,,"Camfield, Laura/0000-0002-0165-9857",,,,,22,2,2,1,8,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",0957-8811,1743-9728,,EUR J DEV RES,Eur.

However, urban dynamics are increasingly putting communities in a vulnerable/riskier situation, calling for a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach. Urban Political Ecology (UPE) was utilized as a framework to reflect upon the empirical findings and literature review with two urban villages (kelurahan) in Bandar Lampung, Indonesia-Kangkung and Kota Karang-as case studies. We argue that the existing VRA is not adequate to address fundamental issues of environmental hazards and climate change. Different aspects, such as the city's metabolism of human-nature interaction, contribute to producing vulnerability and need to be taken into account. This research also recommends that future urban disaster governance should incorporate the production and alteration of (social) vulnerability by considering spatial and temporal dimensions in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.","[Rahman, M.

J,"Gibbs, MT",,,,"Gibbs, Mark T.",,,Asset anchoring as a constraint to sea level rise adaptation,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CLIMATE-CHANGE,"It can be argued that there is presently a disparity between the theory of coastal climate change adaptation and the large-scale or mass implementation with respect to adaptation to sea level rise. From a theoretical perspective, rising sea levels will effectively move the coastline landward and hence the most seaward parts of the built environment, which often feature the highest physical asset value and intensity-and hence economic density, will become inundated more often and therefore perhaps need to be relocated landward under the guidance of planned retreat policies. By contrast, evidence of active large-scale planned retreat policies being developed and implemented is sparse, and often being rejected in favour of coastal protection strategies. It is argued here that this lack of uptake of coastal retreat strategies is partially a result of a phenomena coined here as 'asset anchoring' where major community infrastructure acts to anchor seaside communities in place and inhibit the implementation of coastal retreat strategies.

The Composite Indicator Framework Method and Entropy Weighting Method were applied to calculate each herder's Adaptive Capacity Index (ACI) based on 16 indicators from seven determinants of adaptive willingness and adaptive capital. Results show that herders have an average ACI value of 0.40. Classifying herders into three groups of relatively high, medium, and low ACI values, we find that financial capital and social capital are the most significant determinants of herder adaptive capacity. Improving financial services and building herder social capital would be the most effective ways of enhancing adaptive capacity for coping with climate change. The methods and indicators developed can be generalized to other similar areas to facilitate better policy interventions for reducing poverty and improving rangeland management.","[Tan, Shuhao; Li, Tingyu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Zhongguancun St 59, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Huntsinger, Lynn] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Renmin University of China; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Tan, SH (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Zhongguancun St 59, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",shuhaotan@ruc.edu.cn,"Huntsinger, Lynn/G-5453-2011","Huntsinger, Lynn/0000-0001-9444-4152",Research Funds of Renmin University of China [16XNI004],Research Funds of Renmin University of China,This research was supported by the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (16XNI004).

The core innovation of the present study is the asymmetric impacts of the airline, railway, waterway, and road on environmental pollution in China. This research analyzed and highlighted the most susceptible transportation system in China, using the newly developed Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model from 1985 to 2018. The results of the NARDL are positive shock and negative shock between CO2 emission and four mode-specific transportation development that led to an increase in environmental cost in the short run. The study findings divulged that airline, road, and waterway operational mileage per capita of both positive and negative transportation shocks had worsened the environmental pollution in China. On the other hand, the railway is successfully improving environmental quality in China. In order to enforce policies, local authorities should be supportive of urban public services (e.g., buses and metro) and improve public transportation services. Simultaneously, policymakers may also introduce new creative ideas for a sharing economy, such as shared bicycles and automobiles to reduce the use of private vehicles. These insights of the study could assist policymakers to improve policies for the four specific modes of transportation to better adapt to climate change and associated environmental stressors in China.","[Hassan, Syed Tauseef; Zhu, Bangzhu] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Lee, Chien-Chiang] Nanchang Univ, Res Ctr Cent China Econ & Social Dev, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Lee, Chien-Chiang] Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Ahmad, Paiman] Univ Raparin, Coll Humanity Sci, Dept Law, Sulaymaniyah, Iraq; [Ahmad, Paiman] Tishk Int, Fac Adm Sci & Econ, Int Relat & Diplomacy Dept, Erbil, Iraq; [Sadiq, Muhammad] Cent South Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanchang University; Nanchang University; Central South University,"Lee, CC (corresponding author), Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",sthassan_bit@yahoo.com; wpzbz@126.com; cclee6101@gmail.com; Paiman@uor.edu.krd,"ahmad, paiman/AAE-9880-2019; Sadiq, Muhammad/ABH-2276-2021","ahmad, paiman/0000-0002-5887-3782; Sadiq, Muhammad/0000-0001-6100-9058",Jiangxi Humanities and Social Sciences Project of University [JJ20125]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China [20202BAB201006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72074120],Jiangxi Humanities and Social Sciences Project of University; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We acknowledge the financial support from the Jiangxi Humanities and Social Sciences Project of University (NO.

The paper succinctly summarizes the impacts of climate change on the countries of the region and the responses of individual countries to the eminent environmental threats. Using country specific data, the paper identifies the mitigation and adaptation measures that individual governments communicated in their initial Nationally Determined Contributions to combat climate change and support concomitantly the realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals pertinent to climate impacts. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the overall environmental commitment and performance of the Arab countries and compares them to the average global performance. The findings indicate that most of the Arab countries are heading toward severe water shortages due to deteriorating water supply and growing water demand. The paper concludes that the Arab countries, individually and collectively embrace the Paris Agreement and engage in necessary measures to combat and/or adapt to climate change. Furthermore, the paper presents supporting evidence to show that the Arab countries are at par with the rest of the world when dealing with climate change issues.","[Djoundourian, Salpie S.] Lebanese Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Adnan Kassar Sch Business, Beirut, Lebanon",Lebanese American University,"Djoundourian, SS (corresponding author), Lebanese Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Adnan Kassar Sch Business, Beirut, Lebanon.",sdjndran@lau.edu.lb,,,,,,,26,9,9,2,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

There has been a dearth of research on community resilience to urban floods, especially among transient communities, and therefore there is a need to conduct further empirical studies to improve our understanding, and to identify appropriate interventions. Thus, this work combines two existing resilience assessment frameworks to address these issues in three different types of transient community, namely an urban village, commercial housing, and apartments, all located in Wuhan, China. An analytic hierarchy process-back propagation neural network (AHP-BP) model was developed to estimate the community resilience within these three transient communities. The effects of changes in the prioritization of key resilience indicators under different environmental, economic, and social factors was analyzed across the three communities. The results demonstrate that the ranking of the indicators reflects the connection between disaster resilience and the evaluation units of diverse transient communities. These aspects show the differences in the disaster resilience of different types of transient communities. The proposed method can help decision makers in identifying the areas that are lagging behind, and those that need to be prioritized when allocating limited and/or stretched resources.","[Xu, Wenping; Xiang, Lingli] Wuhan Univ Sci & Technol, Evergrande Sch Management, Wuhan 430065, Peoples R China; [Proverbs, David] Birmingham City Univ, Fac Comp Engn & Built Environm, Birmingham B4 7BD, W Midlands, England",Wuhan University of Science & Technology; Birmingham City University,"Xu, WP (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Sci & Technol, Evergrande Sch Management, Wuhan 430065, Peoples R China.",xuwenping@wust.edu.cn; xianglingli1017@163.com; David.Proverbs@bcu.ac.uk,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","xu, wenping/0000-0003-4474-1583; Proverbs, David/0000-0002-3297-2205",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503194]; Youth Foundation of Education Department of Hubei Province [17Q043]; Centre for Service Science and Engineering Foundation of WUST [CSSE2017GA02],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Foundation of Education Department of Hubei Province; Centre for Service Science and Engineering Foundation of WUST,"The research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number, 71503194]; the Youth Foundation of Education Department of Hubei Province [grant number, 17Q043]; and the Centre for Service Science and Engineering Foundation of WUST [grant number, CSSE2017GA02].",,62,9,9,18,46,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2020,12,10,,,,,,,2784,10.3390/w12102784,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12102784,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,ON8YV,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000586979800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ecological restoration is an effective measure for adapting to climate change and controlling desertification. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between plant growth and the soil properties of valley-slope sand dunes during ecological restoration. We conducted a case study to investigate the changes in the soil properties at various elevations during two stages of ecological restoration. Our results indicated improvements in the plant growth and soil quality during the ecological restoration from 2011 to 2017. The soil particle size changed from predominantly medium-fine sand at stage 1 (2011) to very fine sand at stage 2 (2017). The soil organic matter and total N content ranged from 1.04-1.10 g center dot kg(-1) and 0.06-0.07 g center dot kg(-1) at different elevations in stage 1 and increased to 12.30-14.75 g center dot kg(-1) and 2.82-3.08 g center dot kg(-1), respectively, in stage 2. Higher plants were distributed mainly in the midslope area at stage 2. A significant positive correlation was observed between pH and plant height at stage 2. These findings improve our understanding of the changes in soils and plants on sandy land and their relationships during ecological restoration of alpine valleys.","[Liao, Chengrui; Lv, Guoping; Tian, Jiarong; Xu, Yannan] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Liao, Chengrui; Li, Haidong; Tian, Meirong; You, Guangyong] Minist Ecol & Environm, Nanjing Inst Environm Sci, Res Ctr Ecol Protect & Climate Change Response, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Liao, Chengrui; Lv, Guoping; Tian, Jiarong; Xu, Yannan] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Ctr Coinnovat Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Liao, Chengrui] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Liu, Bo] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Remote Sensing & Geomat Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nanjing Forestry University; Nanjing Forestry University; Yale University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Xu, YN (corresponding author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Xu, YN (corresponding author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Ctr Coinnovat Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",nfuxyn@njfu.edu.cn,"You, Guangyong/HLX-9099-2023",,"Basic Special Business Fund for Research and Development for the Central Level Scientific Research Institutes, Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment [GYZX190101, GYZX170201]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Doctorate Fellowship Foundation of Nanjing Forestry University; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41301611]","Basic Special Business Fund for Research and Development for the Central Level Scientific Research Institutes, Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Doctorate Fellowship Foundation of Nanjing Forestry University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The research was funded by a Basic Special Business Fund for Research and Development for the Central Level Scientific Research Institutes, Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment (GYZX190101 and GYZX170201), a project funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), supported by the Doctorate Fellowship Foundation of Nanjing Forestry University, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41301611).",,37,8,9,6,48,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-3646,1930-0557,,PHYS GEOGR,Phys.

As part of the regulatory process, companies are required periodically to review their investment needs to maintain safe and secure supplies, and this involves an assessment of the future balance between water supply and demand. The water industry and regulators have developed an agreed set of procedures for this assessment. Climate change has been incorporated into these procedures since the late 1990s, although has been included increasingly seriously over time and it has been an effective legal requirement to consider climate change since the 2003 Water Act. In the most recent assessment in 2009, companies were required explicitly to plan for a defined amount of climate change, taking into account climate change uncertainty. A medium climate change scenario was defined, together with wet and dry extremes, based on scenarios developed from a number of climate models. The water industry and its regulators are now gearing up to exploit the new UKCP09 probabilistic climate change projections - but these pose significant practical and conceptual challenges. This paper outlines how the procedures for incorporating climate change information into water resources planning have evolved, and explores the issues currently facing the industry in adapting to climate change.","Univ Reading, Walker Inst Climate Syst Res, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Arnell, NW (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Walker Inst Climate Syst Res, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",n.w.arnell@reading.ac.uk,"Arnell, Nigel/AAC-7331-2020",,,,,,34,31,31,2,38,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1093-474X,,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

Yet, existing monitoring systems are often not designed to consider Inuit-identified conceptualizations of wellbeing that can help identify, monitor, and respond to the more intangible losses and damages from climate change. This study-conducted in partnership with the Inuit community of Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Canada-aimed to characterize what Inuit value and want monitored to develop a conceptual framework for an Inuit-led integrated monitoring system. Using community-led research approaches, data were drawn from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 31 individuals including community members (n = 13), government representatives (n = 14), and healthcare professionals (n = 4) in Nunatsiavut between 2015 and 2016. Thematic analysis of these data was guided by a constant-comparative process. Interviewees described how monitoring climatic and environmental conditions was grounded in land-attachment, reciprocity, knowledge sharing, and self-determination. Findings enhance understandings of how Inuit-led monitoring in the North can guide climate change adaptation that considers intangible losses and damages to wellbeing and ways of living. Further, these findings illustrate how localized perspectives on climate change can contribute to place-based public health research and policy that reflect what matters most to communities.","[Sawatzky, Alexandra; Jones-Bitton, Andria; Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Sawatzky, Alexandra; Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada; [Cunsolo, Ashlee] Mem Univ, Labrador Inst, 219 Hamilton River Rd,POB 490,Stn B, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF A0P 1E0, Canada; [Gillis, Dan; Flowers, Charlie] Univ Guelph, Sch Comp Sci, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Wood, Michele] Nunatsiavut Govt, Dept Hlth & Social Dev, 218 Kelland Dr,POB 496,Stn C, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF A0P 1CO, Canada; [Shiwak, Inez] Rigolet Inuit Community Govt, My Word Storytelling & Digital Media Lab, POB 69, Rigolet, NF A0P 1P0, Canada; [Shiwak, Inez; Rigolet Inuit Community Govt] Rigolet Inuit Community Govt, POB 69, Rigolet, NF A0P 1P0, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Alberta; Memorial University Newfoundland; University of Guelph,"Sawatzky, A; Harper, SL (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.;Sawatzky, A; Harper, SL (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.;Cunsolo, A (corresponding author), Mem Univ, Labrador Inst, 219 Hamilton River Rd,POB 490,Stn B, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF A0P 1E0, Canada.",alex.sawatzky@ualberta.ca; ashlee.cunsolo@mun.ca; sherilee.haiper@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,76,11,11,2,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The aim of this paper is planning a GI linking biophysical, social, and legal contents in a specific Africa country with an approach that combines different scales and different levels of data and information. The paper proposes a framework beginning at the macro scale to integrate and operationalise the definition of GI in an African context, namely for the Luanda metropolitan area. The approach to nature and ecological structure (GI) has four phases: analysis, integration, diagnosis and proposal. All steps are developed in a GIS environment and consider variations in the biophysical, social, cultural, and legal dimensions. The research discusses the problems in collecting existing information and leads with missing data within the context of urbanisation growth and climate change adaptation. The proposed green infrastructure includes protected areas (existing and proposed), natural values, risk areas, rivers, and agricultural areas, to increase resilience and flexibility in an adaptation context. The results allow to include in the GI the mangrove areas, native flora, vegetated slopes, and riverbanks, providing a buffering function for natural hazards, crucial for these regions, with the aim to achieve the needs of creating a strategic GI to be implemented into the Luanda General Master Plan.","[Amado, Miguel; Rodrigues, Evelina; Pinheiro, Manuel Duarte] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CERIS Civil Engn Res & Innovat Sustainabil, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Poggi, Francesca] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias Sociais & Humanas, CISC NOVA Ctr Interdisciplinar Ciencias Sociais, P-1069061 Lisbon, Portugal; [Amado, Antonio Ribeiro] Univ Lisbon, Fac Arquitectura, CIAUD Ctr Invest Arquitectura Urbanismo & Design, P-1349063 Lisbon, Portugal; [Jose, Helder] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, GEOTPU LAB Lab Planning Urbanism Architecture & E, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Amado, M (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CERIS Civil Engn Res & Innovat Sustainabil, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",miguelpamado@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; ebm@fct.unl.pt; f.poggi@fcsh.unl.pt; manuel.pinheiro@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; ar.amado@campus.fct.unl.pt; Helderjose1965@gmail.com,"Rodrigues, Evelina B./HCG-8407-2022; Pinheiro, Manuel Duarte/E-1860-2013; Amado, Miguel/A-9721-2013; Poggi, Francesca/S-7620-2017","Pinheiro, Manuel Duarte/0000-0001-5963-8947; Amado, Miguel/0000-0002-9152-4226; Poggi, Francesca/0000-0002-3087-7810",GEOTPU.LAB,GEOTPU.LAB,This research was funded by GEOTPU.LAB.,,95,4,4,4,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,8,,,,,,,3162,10.3390/su12083162,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12083162,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LR3MY,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000535598700095,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, there is need for agricultural producers in Africa to employ robust adaptive measures that withstand the risks of climate change. However, the success of adaptation measures to climate change primarily depends on the communities' knowledge or awareness of climate change and its risks. Nonetheless, existing empirical research is still limited to illuminate farmers' awareness of the climate change problem. This study employs a Bayesian hierarchical logistic model, estimated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) methods, to empirically determine drivers of smallholder farmers' awareness of climate change and its risks to agriculture in Zambia. The results suggest that on average, 77% of farmers in Zambia are aware of climate change and its risks to agriculture. We find socio-demographics, climate change information sources, climate change adaptive factors, and climate change impact-related shocks as predictors of the expression of climate change awareness. We suggest that farmers should be given all the necessary information about climate change and its risks to agriculture. Most importantly, the drivers identified can assist policymakers to provide the effective extension and advisory services that would enhance the understanding of climate change among farmers in synergy with appropriate farm-level climate-smart agricultural practices.","[Ng'ombe, John N.] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36830 USA; [Ng'ombe, John N.] Univ Zambia, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Lusaka 10101, Zambia; [Tembo, Moses C.] Indaba Agr & Policy Res Inst, Lusaka 10101, Zambia; [Masasi, Blessing] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Biosyst & Agr Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of Zambia; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Ng'ombe, JN (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36830 USA.;Ng'ombe, JN (corresponding author), Univ Zambia, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Lusaka 10101, Zambia.",ngombe@okstate.edu; chifwambe@yahoo.com; blessing.masasi@okstate.edu,"Nedson, John/GXA-1230-2022; Masasi, Blessing/AAH-2720-2020","Masasi, Blessing/0000-0001-8630-7940; Ng'ombe, John/0000-0002-1410-1350",,,,,90,9,9,15,36,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,MAR,2020,10,3,,,,,,,376,10.3390/agronomy10030376,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10030376,,,22,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,LI3ID,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000529377300062,View Full Record in Web of Science

Calculating social vulnerability usually involves the construction of a composite index, for which several construction methods have been suggested. However, thorough investigation of results across methods or applied weighting of vulnerability factors is largely missing. This study investigates the outcome of the variable addition-both with and without weighting of single vulnerability factors-and the variable reduction approach/model on social vulnerability indices calculated for New York City. Weighting is based on scientific assessment reports on climate change impacts in New York City. Additionally, the study calculates the outcome on social vulnerability when using either area-based (person/km(2)) or population-based (%) input data. The study reveals remarkable differences between indices particularly when using different methods but also when using different metrics as input data. The variable addition model has deductive advantages, whereas the variable reduction model is useful when the strength of factors of social vulnerability is unknown. The use of area-based data seems preferable to population-based data when differences are taken as a measure of credibility and quality. Results are important for all forms of vulnerability mapping using index construction techniques.","[Reckien, Diana] Univ Twente, Dept Urban & Reg Planning & Geoinformat Managemen, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Hengelosestr 99,POB 217, Enschede, Netherlands; [Reckien, Diana] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Ctr Res Environm Decis, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Twente; Columbia University,"Reckien, D (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Urban & Reg Planning & Geoinformat Managemen, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Hengelosestr 99,POB 217, Enschede, Netherlands.;Reckien, D (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Ctr Res Environm Decis, New York, NY 10027 USA.",d.reckien@utwente.nl,"Reckien, Diana/P-7348-2015","Reckien, Diana/0000-0002-1145-9509","German Research Foundation [RE 2927/2-1]; Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED), Columbia University in the City of New York","German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED), Columbia University in the City of New York","The research reported in this article was made possible through and funded by a grant from the German Research Foundation (RE 2927/2-1).

Business decision-making models are essential in providing rational support for choices made by managers and industry practitioners under crisis conditions that may result from climatic disruptions. To date, most of the techniques proposed in the literature focus on the disruptions of physical resources that propagate through supply chain linkages; nonetheless, a significant research gap remains on mitigating impacts caused by disruptions in workforce availability. In this work, a fuzzy input-output optimization model is developed for allocating scarce labor resources within a business enterprise or organization. This model uses the input-output framework to take into account organizational interdependencies that exist among workers or departmental units, to ensure minimal loss of vital services delivered to external clients. The model is demonstrated using two illustrative case studies. The first case study involves medical staff deployment in a hospital during a pandemic event; while the second case study involves allocation of personnel in a business process outsourcing firm during an adverse weather event. The examples illustrate how the proposed fuzzy input-output optimization model can provide decision support for practitioners in industry, in order to mitigate the impacts of human resource shortage on business continuity during a crisis.

Gridded projections' of temperature changes for three time periods (2020-49, 2045-74, 2070-99) available from twenty climate-model chains for the A2 emissions scenario (i.e. the business as usual scenario) were used. It was found that with climate warming, the suitable production area increases at higher altitudes but decreases at lower altitudes in the longer term. In a second part of the study, we investigated the influence of individual climatic factors on climate suitability using combined temperature and precipitation scenarios from ten model chains for the Zurich-Reckenholz and Changins sites. Results suggest that heat stress and accelerated plant development are increasingly limiting climate suitability at both sites, whilst water shortage during maturation is only increasing significantly at the Changins site in western Switzerland. The shortening of growth phases also plays a role here, since the temporal shift in crop development can reduce the risk of drought stress if drought sensitive phenological periods are shifted away from periods of most intense stress. Despite uncertainties with regard to long-term climate change, the results of this study can provide advice for the planning of possible climate change adaptation measures (i.e. future cultivar choice, shifts in production areas).","[Holzkaemper, Annelie; Fuhrer, Juerg] Inst Nachhaltigkeitswissensch INH, Agroscope, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope,"Holzkamper, A (corresponding author), Inst Nachhaltigkeitswissensch INH, Agroscope, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",annelie.holzkaemper@agroscope.admin.ch,,,,,,,16,4,4,1,9,AGRARFORSCHUNG,POSIEUX,"AGROSCOPE LIEBEFELD-POSIEUX, POSIEUX, CH-1725, SWITZERLAND",1663-7852,1663-7909,,AGRARFORSCH SCHWEIZ+,Agrarforschung Schweiz,OCT,2015,6,10,,,,,440,447,,,,,,8,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,V7V4A,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000421325900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to climate change and socio-economic developments, a further increase in climate-related risks is expected. Numerous countries have a long and successful history in disaster risk management (DRM) to avoid, minimize and manage damage caused by extreme weather events. In addition, climate change adaptation (CCA) focuses on managing the risks resulting from climate change today and in the future. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of managing climate-related risks, these two independent approaches need to be linked closer in a more holistic approach - a concept that has been termed climate risk management (CRM). In order to build stronger ties in practice, it is crucial to first understand current governance structures in specific countries or regions. This paper focuses on Austria, a country with experience in both DRM and CCA. In this paper, we present a comprehensive picture of the stakeholder landscape and governance structures in the context of managing climate-related risks. We focus on flooding and agricultural drought, two key risks in Austria. Building on a literature review and a two-stage stakeholder process, consisting of stakeholder interviews and stakeholder workshops, relevant institutions and actors were identified and assigned to a 4-phase CRM cycle. Moreover, specific activities of the identified actors and interactions between them were determined. Based on these insights, we conclude that a comprehensive CRM, which aligns DRM and CCA practice, does not yet exist in Austria. We propose to establish the missing CRM decision-making structures by e.g. instituting a legally-anchored national climate risk council, which can act as an interface between CRM practice and political decision-making.","[Leitner, Markus; Glas, Natalie] Environm Agcy Austria, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Babcicky, Philipp] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Zentrum Klima & Globalen Wandel, Graz, Austria; [Schinko, Thomas] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria",University of Graz; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Leitner, M (corresponding author), Environm Agcy Austria, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",markus.leitner@umweltbundesamt.at,,,"Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP)) [B670307, KR16AC0K13230]",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP)),"This work was funded by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP), project RESPECT (B670307, Klimafonds-Nr: KR16AC0K13230).

We apply a novel framework that integrates social justice theory and the advocacy coalition framework to incrementally assess just climate adaptation in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States. Boston made an ambitious commitment to address equity as part of its climate planning and implementation efforts. In this paper, we evaluate the first implementation stage over the period 2016-2019 during which Boston developed coastal resilience plans for three neighborhoods. Despite Boston's commitment to equity, we find injustice was nevertheless reproduced through representation and coalition dynamics, the framing of problems and solutions, and a failure to recognize the priorities and lived experiences of city residents. The assessment framework presented can be adapted to evaluate how other climate adaptation initiatives advance social justice and highlights the need for incremental evaluation over short time periods to inform ongoing implementation efforts.","[Malloy, Jeffrey T.

Findings show that households in coastal plains are more vulnerable in terms of socio-demographic profile, food security, social networks, access to water and climate variability. This territory is much more exposed to climate change, despite being slightly less sensitive. On the other hand, households in mountainous territory are more vulnerable in terms of livelihood strategies, land tenure and health, despite their adaptation capacity, which reduces their vulnerability to climate change.

This study was undertaken to understand the dryland farmers' perceptions about climate change, its impacts and indigenous adaptation measures they pursue. From the analysis of data collected from 200 dryland farmers of Villupuram and Virudhunagar districts in Tamil Nadu, it was found that 81 % of farmers experienced climate change in terms of decreasing and unpredictable rainfall, increasing temperature and delayed onset of monsoon. Analysis of climate trend validated their perceptions. Farmers are convinced that climate change has affected their farming through frequent crop failures, declining crop and livestock yield, reduced water level in tanks and wells and new pest and diseases. Amidst various constraints, farmers strive to adapt to climate change by manipulating sowing date, reducing fertilizer application, selecting alternate crops and drought tolerant varieties, etc. Elderly farmers adapt more to climate change while access to irrigation gives leverage to try alternate farming practices.","[Varadan, R.

We consider optimal mitigation policy when climate damages follow a geometric Brownian motion process with positive drift and mitigation is lumpy. Climate damages can be affected by adaptation in two main ways: 1) reduced proportionately for given climate impact; or 2) their growth path down-shifted. In either case expectation and variance of the climate damage are both reduced by adaptation. In case 1, the variance effect (which leads to more rapid mitigation as the option value of waiting is reduced) may dominate over the expectation effect (which reduces mitigation), thus on balance increasing mitigation when damages are reduced. Mitigation and adaptation are then complements. A family of functions relating climate damage to adaptation cost in this way includes the Cobb-Douglas specification.

In presenting a multiscale assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerability in Norway, we show that the concept of vulnerability depends on the scale of analysis. Both exposure and the distribution of climate sensitive sectors vary greatly across scale. So do the underlying social and economic conditions that influence adaptive capacity. These findings question the common notion that climate change may be beneficial for Norway, and that the country can readily adapt to climate change. As scale differences are brought into consideration, vulnerability emerges within some regions, localities, and social groups. To cope with actual and potential changes in climate and climate variability, it will be necessary to acknowledge climate vulnerabilities at the regional and local levels, and to address them accordingly.

The article draws on a unique longitudinal dataset in Zambia, which collected information from farm households before and after a significant drought caused by the 2015/2016 El-Nino Southern Oscillation. It finds that farmers residing in areas forecasted to be drought-affected and receiving seasonal forecast information are significantly more likely to integrate drought tolerant crops into their cropping systems compared to similar households not receiving this information. Moreover, the probability that a farmer implements these adaptive farm management strategies in response to seasonal forecast information is found to increase substantially as the number of private grain buyers in the farmers' village increases. This suggests that climate change adaptation and resilience strategies that integrate the generation and dissemination of weather information with agricultural market development can achieve greater impact on farmers' adaptive responses than approaches that treat these activities in isolation.","[Maggio, Giuseppe; Sitko, Nicholas] UN, Food & Agr Org, Agr Dev Econ Div ESA, Viale Terme di Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Sitko, N (corresponding author), UN, Food & Agr Org, Agr Dev Econ Div ESA, Viale Terme di Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",nicholas.sitko@fao.org,"Maggio, Giuseppe/HGB-8937-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Maggio, Giuseppe/0000-0002-8768-1317",Government of Flanders,Government of Flanders,"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Government of Flanders for this research, provided through the project entitled Strengthening integrated adaptation planning and implementation in southern Africa smallholder agricultural systems to support food security.",,81,9,9,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,DEC,2019,89,,,,,,,,101781,10.1016/j.foodpol.2019.101781,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2019.101781,,,24,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,JU4KT,,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000501647200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper we explore whether this effect depends on participants deliberately comparing the two environments, and whether different reasons behind the certification influence the magnitude of the effect. In Experiment 1, participants in a between-subjects design assigned higher comfort ratings to an indoor environment that had been labeled environmentally certified in comparison with the exact same indoor environment that was unlabeled, suggesting that the effect arises even when participants do not compare the two environments when making their estimates. The results from Experiment 2 indicate that climate change mitigation (as the reason for the certification) is a slightly better trigger of the effect compared to climate change adaptation. The results suggest that studies on psychological effects of green buildings should experimentally control for the influence from participants' judgmental biases.","[Holmgren, Mattias; Soerqvist, Patrik] Univ Gavle, Dept Bldg Energy & Environm Engn, SE-80176 Gavle, Sweden",University of Gavle,"Holmgren, M (corresponding author), Univ Gavle, Dept Bldg Energy & Environm Engn, SE-80176 Gavle, Sweden.",mattias.holmgren@hig.se; patrik.sorqvist@hig.se,,,,,,,60,4,4,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,FEB,2018,8,2,,,,,,,20,10.3390/buildings8020020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings8020020,,,10,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,FZ3SL,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000427510600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Application in Jucar River Basin District (Spain),SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Coastal wetlands; Climate change impacts; Sea level rise; Climate change adaptation; Risk assessment,SEA-LEVEL RISE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WATER-RESOURCES; VARIABILITY; FRAMEWORK,"Sea level rise (SLR) produced by climate change affects severely coastal ecosystems which are currently being impacted by sea level rise in many parts of the world. In relation with coastal wetlands, the most relevant induced effect will occur on water and soil s salt content, especially in areas below sea level. This could lead into a reduction of habitat for the wetlands biota. In this context, this research assesses the SLR related risk in the J & uacute;car River Basin District (JRBD). Hazard, exposure, impact, vulnerability, and risk maps have been elaborated. The design and application of measures is prioritized in those areas classified as Very High risk with the aim of improving coastal ecosystems climate change adaptation. In Western Mediterranean coast, average sea level (ASL) will rise 0.16 m (2026 & ndash;2045) and 0.79 m (2081 & ndash;2100) referred to the reference period (1986 & ndash;2005). High-end scenarios indicate that ASL will rise 1.35 m & ndash;1.92 m (2081 & ndash;2100). The risk analysis results show that 90% of JRBD area affected by SLR, corresponds to coastal wetlands. Half of the affected area belongs to LAlbufera de Valencia wetland with 32.44 km(2) below sea level, which represents a water volume of 42.64 hm(3) (2026 & ndash;2045) and a surface between 72.53 and 138.96 km(2) representing from 118.36 to 289.70 hm(3) (2081 & ndash;2100). In the case of LAlbufera de Valencia the impact will be throughout the 21st century, the average rate of SLR will leap from 4 to 11 cm per decade, therefore MSL will reach the current wetland levels by 2040 & ndash;2045. This makes necessary to modify the lakes management rules, which will lead to an increase of 40 hm(3) in water storage and a reduction in waters renewal time compared to current rates (from 15 to 5 times a year).

However, there is little evidence regarding how the approach is applied at the local level. It also remains unclear to what extent the approach is integrated into local development planning and what opportunities exist for further integration in rural areas. Therefore, our study examined opportunities for mainstreaming Eco-DRR into local development planning in South Africa. Fourteen integrated development plans from 'mostly rural' local municipalities in Limpopo Province were systematically assessed to understand the process of mainstreaming Eco-DRR into their current development plans under the following aspects: localized climate trends, hydroclimatic risks considered, risk and vulnerability assessments, disaster risk reduction (DRR) actions, early-warning systems, financing mechanisms, integration of traditional and technical knowledge, stakeholder engagement, and alignment with district, provincial, and national priorities. Although all plans address DRR, none explicitly addresses Eco-DRR, despite a few similar actions. DRR actions are not aligned to any hydroclimatic risks, and most plans lack localized climate trends and/or vulnerability assessments to indicate the severity of hazards and/or identify populations and areas at risk. Several measures in the plans address disaster preparedness, but none includes early-warning systems. Public participation features prominently in all plans, but the process is marred by challenges and lacks genuineness, e.g., prioritized actions are not reflective of community needs. Based on the findings, we discuss measures to enhance the mainstreaming of ecosystem-based approaches into DRR. We conclude that a huge opportunity exists to institutionalize and mainstream Eco-DRR into local development planning in South Africa's rural areas. If carefully seized, such an opportunity can also help attract external finance to complement the currently constrained budgets related to addressing hydroclimatic risks.","[Mugari, Ephias; Nethengwe, Nthaduleni Samuel] Univ Venda, Fac Sci Engn & Agr, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, South Africa",University of Venda,"Mugari, E (corresponding author), Univ Venda, Fac Sci Engn & Agr, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, South Africa.",mugarie@gmail.com,,"Nethengwe, Nthaduleni/0000-0003-0797-9162; Mugari, Ephias/0000-0002-9205-9653","SAF-ADAPT project at the University of Venda, South Africa [E584]; University of Venda","SAF-ADAPT project at the University of Venda, South Africa; University of Venda","This research was funded by the SAF-ADAPT project at the University of Venda (Cost Centre No. E584), South Africa.

Higher education institutions (HEIs) play an important role as property owners, employers, education and research hubs as well as leaders of societal transformations. The purpose of this paper was therefore to benchmark how universities globally are addressing climate risks. Design/methodology/approach An international survey was conducted to benchmark the sector's organisational planning for climate change and to better understand how the higher education sector contributes to local-level climate adaptation planning processes. The international survey focused especially on the assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation plans. Findings Based on the responses of 45 HEIs located in six different countries on three continents, the study found that there are still very few tertiary institutions that plan for climate-related risks in a systematic way. Originality/value The paper sheds light on the barriers HEIs face in engaging in climate adaptation planning and action. Some of the actions to overcome such hindering factors include integrating climate adaptation in existing risk management and sustainability planning processes, using the internal academic expertise and curriculum to assist the mapping of climate change impacts and collaborating with external actors to guarantee the necessary resources. The higher education sector can act as a leader in building institutional resilience at the local scale.","[Kautto, Niina; Trundle, Alexei; McEvoy, Darryn] RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"McEvoy, D (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",darryn.mcevoy@rmit.edu.au,"Trundle, Alexei/D-5762-2018","Trundle, Alexei/0000-0002-7076-4626; Kautto, Niina/0000-0003-4895-1094",,,,,48,5,5,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1467-6370,1758-6739,,INT J SUST HIGHER ED,Int.

Such efforts are often in response to grassroots mobilizations, yet it is not clear to what extent they translate into urban coalitions, policy designs, and implementation efforts within city governments. In this paper, we respond to this knowledge gap by assessing how equity-thinking is translated into cities' adaptation decision-making and governance arrangements, especially in ways that can lead to more inclusive and just climate adaptation outcomes for historically marginalized communities. We analyze adaptation plans for the 25 largest US cities using deductive and inductive coding strategies to uncover the ideas, rhetoric, and processes that guide equitable plans. We then map these outcomes of equity-thinking across procedural, distributive, and recognitional categories. Our analysis lends support to the operation of two social constructivist mechanisms of equity-thinking in adaptation planning-namely ideology and recognition. In an ideology-driven pathway, where beliefs are shared, adaptation efforts are mobilized through local actors and within public agencies who decide on the appropriateness of social equity definitions. Recognition-driven pathways occur when climate equity rhetoric is reflected and normalized through adaptation planning procedures, where cities strive to be early adopters of equitable climate strategies. This result therefore highlights the multiple ways urban leaders, decision-makers, and planners can have in steering policies and designing different planning and implementation processes.","[Cannon, Clare; Chu, Eric; Natekal, Asiya; Waaland, Gemma] Univ Calif Davis, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Cannon, C (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",cebcannon@ucdavis.edu; ekch@ucdavis.edu; annatekal@ucdavis.edu; grwaaland@ucdavis.edu,"Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615; Cannon, Clare E.

As climate, socio-economic, and physical compositions of cities are constantly changing, these need to be considered in their urban climate adaptation. To identify these changes, urban systems can be characterized by physical, functional, and social indicators. Multi-dimensional approaches are needed to capture changes of city form and function, including patterns of mobility, land use, land cover, economic activities, and human behaviour. In this article, we examine how urban structure types provide one way to differentiate cities in general and to what extent socio-economic criteria have been considered regarding the characterization of urban typologies. In addition, we analyse how urban structure types are used in local adaptation strategies and plans to derive recommendations and concrete targets for climate adaptation. To do this, we examine indicators, background data used, and cartographic information developed for and within such urban adaptation plans, focusing in particular on the German cities of Karlsruhe and Berlin. The comparative analysis provides new insights into how present adaptation plans consider physical and social structures, including issues of human vulnerability within cities. Based on the analysis we make recommendations on how to improve the consideration of both physical and socio-economic aspects of a city to support pathways for adaptation.","[Wendnagel-Beck, Angela; Ravan, Marvin; Iqbal, Nimra; Birkmann, Joern] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning, Stuttgart, Germany; [Somarakis, Giorgos; Chrysoulakis, Nektarios] Fdn Res & Technol, Remote Sensing Lab, Hellas Inst Appl & Computat Math, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Hertwig, Denise; Grimmond, Sue] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England",University of Stuttgart; University of Reading,"Wendnagel-Beck, A (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning, Stuttgart, Germany.",angela.wendnagel-beck@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; marvin.ravan@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; ninnra.iqbal@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; joern.birkmann@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; somarage@iacm.forth.gr; d.hertwig@reading.ac.uk; zedd2@iacm.forth.gr; c.s.grimmond@reading.ac.uk,,"Hertwig, Denise/0000-0002-2483-2675",European Research Council (ERC-SyG) [855005],European Research Council (ERC-SyG),"This work is part of the urbisphere project (www.urbisphere.eu), a synergy project funded by the European Research Council (ERC-SyG) within the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 855005.

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), a land-owning wildlife conservation charity in the UK, achieves this on its nature reserves through its system of management planning. This involves setting network-wide objectives which inform the 25-year vision and 5-year conservation objectives for each site. Progress toward achieving each site's conservation objectives is reviewed annually, to identify any adjustments which might be needed to the site's management. The conservation objectives and 25-year vision of each site are reviewed every 5 years. Significant long-term impacts of climate change most frequently identified at RSPB reserves are: loss of intertidal habitat through coastal squeeze, loss of low-lying islands due to higher sea levels and coastal erosion, loss of coastal freshwater and brackish wetlands due to increased coastal flooding, and changes in the hydrology of wetlands. The main types of adaptation measures in place on RSPB reserves to address climate change-related impacts are: re-creation of intertidal habitat, re-creation and restoration of freshwater wetlands away from vulnerable coastal areas, blocking artificial drainage on peatlands, and addressing pressures on freshwater supply for lowland wet grasslands in eastern and southeastern England.

Coping with climate change requires a better awareness of the possible impacts to inform climate adaptation strategies. In this study, we investigated the climate projections from two contrasting GCMs (wet scenario from MIROC5 and dry scenario from CSIRO) and quantified the possible outcomes in terms of hydrological components of the Upper Blue Nile Basin (UBNB). These two climate projection scenarios show that the overall precipitation change in the early (2011-2040), mid (2041-2070), and late century (2071-2100) over the UBNB may vary from -18.3 % to + 13.6 % of the baseline annual precipitation of 1350 mm. The hydrological simulations over the basin from our study showed that evapotranspiration may vary between -13.7 % and + 12.1 % of the average annual total actual ET of 710 mm, and the flow at the basin outlet may range between -40.7 % and + 30.8 % of the mean annual total flow volume of 45 billion cubic meters. As a result, the wet projection exhibited more frequent floods while the dry projection showed severe droughts, specifically in the late century. We also examined the role of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), designed for hydropower generation, in moderating these potential future climate hydrological extremes. Our findings indicate that GERD operations can help reduce downstream flood and drought severity by managing flow releases. Thus, this study illustrates the most possible extreme hydrological events in the UBNB due to climate change and demonstrates the degree to which GERD operations can help reduce the impact of these extremes downstream. The findings and data generated in this study will aid understanding the importance of sustainable water management and reservoir operation that caters to both hydropower generation, and recurring floods and droughts.","[Lazin, Rehenuma; Moges, Semu; Anagnostou, Emmanouil] Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Shen, Xinyi] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Sch Freshwater Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53204 USA",University of Connecticut; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Anagnostou, E (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",rehenuma.lazin@uconn.edu; xinys@uwm.edu; semu.moges@uconn.edu; emmanouil.anagnostou@uconn.edu,,"Lazin, Rehenuma/0000-0002-9838-2160","National Science Foundation [1545874]; Abay Basin Authority (ABA); Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and Energy-Ethiopia","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Abay Basin Authority (ABA); Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and Energy-Ethiopia","This research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1545874.

The paper results are based on an analysis of climate adaptation strategies, investment plans and adaptation projects and interviews with policymakers, across seven Dutch municipalities. Results indicate that while local adaptation strategies are largely forward looking, adaptation projects tend to focus on solving present-day issues. We found that the Delta Programme enabled local governments to make forward-looking decisions and policies, by: (1) providing knowledge about climate vulnerabilities, (2) creating a broader framing of the issue of climate change, and (3) providing guidance for developing local climate adaptation policies.","[Pot, Wieke D.; de Vaan, Kasper; Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Pot, WD (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",wieke.pot@wur.nl,,"Pot, Wieke/0000-0001-8925-7539","4TU.HTSF DeSIRE programme of the four universities of technology in The Netherlands; NWO, the Dutch Organization for Scientific Research [869.15.012]","4TU.HTSF DeSIRE programme of the four universities of technology in The Netherlands(Netherlands Government); NWO, the Dutch Organization for Scientific Research","This research was supported by the funding from the 4TU.HTSF DeSIRE programme of the four universities of technology in The Netherlands and NWO, the Dutch Organization for Scientific Research, under grant no. 869.15.012.",,43,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Studies have documented examples of adaptation responses in the Arctic, but assessments evaluating if and how progress is being made over time remain scarce. We identify and examine adaptation progress in the Arctic using a systematic tracking methodology to compare adaptations documented during 2014-19 to those documented for the period 2004-2013 in a benchmark study by Fordet al(2014). Utilising the peer reviewed literature as out data source, we find no noticeable increase in reported adaptations across the two time periods, with the profile of adaptations undertaken remaining largely the same. The majority of documented adaptations continue to be reported in North America, are being undertaken most often in the subsistence-based hunting and fishing sector, are primarily developed in response to a combination of climatic and non-climatic stimuli, are reactive and behavioural in nature, and are mainly carried out at the individual/community scale. Climate change is observed, however, to have a more prominent role in motivating adaptation between 2014-19, consistent with intensifying climate-related exposures in the Arctic. There is limited evidence in the reported adaptations analysed that potential opportunities and benefits from the impacts of climate change are being targeted. The paper provides a general characterisation of adaptation across the Arctic and how it is evolving, and needs to be complimented in follow-up work by studies using alternative data sources on adaptation and research at national to regional scales.","[Canosa, I., V; Ford, J.

While considerable research on vulnerability to climate change exists, research about Indian smallholder farming systems as a whole, encompassing farming strategies and development pathways in this context, is limited. Hence, the current study examines the vulnerability of three smallholder farming systems, namely, (i) crop without livestock (CWL), (ii) crop with small ruminants (CSR), and (iii) crop with dairy (CD), in the context of climate change in Telangana, India. A mixed methods approach was used to conduct the research with a sample size of ten households per farming system. We found that households of different farming systems faced differential vulnerability due to variation in perceptions of climate change exposures, access to livelihood capitals, and the farming strategies they chose. The CWL households were highly vulnerable to increased maximum temperature and erratic rainfall, while households that farmed both crop and livestock were more vulnerable to overall reduction in precipitation. Decision-making related to farming strategies was a complex process involving several factors, of which the availability of livelihood capitals, provided by government programs, was the foremost. Due to this, households of the different farming systems pursued divergent farming strategies, leading to varying types of adaptation and climate change resilience. Among the three farming systems, the households in the CWL system had the least access to all livelihood capitals and showed the highest vulnerability as their farm strategies only helped to cope with immediate needs. The households in the CD system had access to all critical livelihood capitals, which facilitated opting for sustainable farming strategies. However, as these households were highly dependent on scarce ground water resources for production, their strategies helped only short-term adaption. The households in the CSR system, despite having access to limited capitals, adopted long-term adaptation strategies which is attributed to them being a pastoral ethnic group. Lastly, despite the existence of an integrated climate change policy, state-level development programs continue to focus more on agricultural intensification than on climate change adaptation. This stimulates farming strategies that are lucrative in the short term but endanger farming system resilience to climate change in the long term. We therefore recommend policy makers to give high priority to climate smart development in state development programs, and science-based evaluations of these programs to enable proper climate change adaptation in dryland regions that is inclusive of perspectives of different populations.","[Kuchimanchi, Bhavana Rao; Oosting, Simon J.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Anim Prod Syst Grp, POB 338, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Paassen, Annemarie] Wageningen Univ & Res, Knowledge Technol & Innovat Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kuchimanchi, Bhavana Rao] Fdn Ecol Secur, Jahagir Pura Rd, Anand 388110, Gujarat, India",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Oosting, SJ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Anim Prod Syst Grp, POB 338, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands.",simon.oosting@wur.nl,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Oosting, Simon/0000-0003-2080-1879",,,,,49,7,7,1,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Integrating TEK with scientific knowledge has become particularly important in sectors such as agriculture, which both contributes to and is affected by climate change. While there is a general recognition that integrating TEK will contribute to climate change adaptation, agricultural interventions have made little progress in achieving this due to the assumption of a clear divide between TEK and scientific knowledge. This paper considers that knowledge integration is already occurring, but in contexts of economic, sociocultural, and political inequalities. We elaborate on the case of traditional weather forecasting methods used by Mayan indigenous farmers in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to propose a social justice perspective for knowledge integration in climate change interventions. Using information from three studies conducted between 2016 and 2019, we first explain the importance of weather and traditional weather forecast methods for indigenous Mayan farmers. Later we describe in detail both these methods and their links with Mayan cosmology. Findings show how weather phenomena such as drought and hurricanes are main concerns for milpa farming. They illustrate the diversity of traditional short, medium, and long-term weather forecast methods based on observations from nature and the sky. Farmers also perform rituals that are related to their Mayan gods and goddess. As TEK not only defines agricultural calendars but also reproduces Mayan culture, we discuss what is needed for its integration into actions combating climate change. We use a rights-based approach that considers the economic, cultural, and political scales of justice to equally allocate resources and benefits for traditional knowledge systems, recognize indigenous values and worldviews avoiding cultural harms, and accomplish indigenous self-determination through equal representation. As a result, we hope to incentivize development actors engaged in agricultural interventions on climate change to critically reflect and examine power dynamics and relations when working with indigenous communities.","[Camacho-Villa, Tania Carolina; Ramirez-Lopez, Alejandro; Hoil-Tzuc, Matias] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Socioecon Program, Texcoco, Mexico; [Martinez-Cruz, Tania Eulalia] Univ Greenwich, Livelihoods & Inst Dept, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham, Kent, England; [Teran-Contreras, Silvia] Secretaria Cultura & Las Artes, Patrimonio Cultural, Merida, Mexico; [Camacho-Villa, Tania Carolina] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Inst Agrifood Technol, Lincoln, England",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); University of Greenwich; University of Lincoln,"Camacho-Villa, TC (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Socioecon Program, Texcoco, Mexico.;Camacho-Villa, TC (corresponding author), Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Inst Agrifood Technol, Lincoln, England.",CCamachoVilla@lincoln.ac.uk,,"Martinez Cruz, Tania Eulalia/0000-0002-0893-2182","Fundacion Haciendas del Mundo Maya, A.

Canada has made efforts to reduce direct CO2 emissions in the national economy, intensify forestry, and increase greenhouse gas sequestration by forests. Russia focuses on the verification and recalculation of the carbon sequestration capacity of its forests. Analysis of the Russian and Canadian stationary models used to assess the carbon sequestration capacity of forests (ROBUL and CBM-CFS, respectively) shows that both the Canadian model and the Russian one derived from it reflect the stationary dynamics of forest stands, which inevitably results in a downward CO2 absorption trend. Even if the forest inventory is updated on a regular basis, the predictive components of such models are unable to take into account the variability of forest ecosystems and their adaptation to climate change. Models that describe global carbon fluxes (e.g., ones using FLUXNET and remote sensing data) provide significantly higher net carbon sequestration values and indicate a nondecreasing net carbon accumulation trend in forests. It is concluded that stationary and remote sensing models should be used together to assess net carbon sequestration and formulate key principles of national climate policies in countries rich in forests.","[Krenke, A.

Inner-city parks and green spaces were heavily used for recreational purposes and were thus periodically overcrowded. These observations highlight the need for green open spaces in urban areas, especially in exceptional situations regarding pandemics and climate-related heat periods. Green open spaces and greened buildings help cities and the population cope with the consequences of climate change and have a decisive positive effect on human health and well-being. This paper aims to outline which social issues are related to the availability of green infrastructure close to home and which health consequences need to be considered. The COVID-19 challenges could offer a chance and an opportunity to increase the resilience of cities and their inhabitants in various terms.

Fishers continuously adapt their practices to climate variability and recurring extreme weather events, such as hurricanes. However, it remains unclear how their everyday responses contribute to building their adaptive capacity for future changes and unpredictable extreme climate events. This paper identifies and analyzes strategies used by fishers in the Dominican Republic and Belize to deal with extreme weather events and climate variability. We draw on two separate case studies to identify their current autonomous adaptive strategies and explore how these align with broader dimensions of adaptive capacity. We find that fishers in both countries respond to changes and climate variability by relying on three strategies: (1) storing, saving and borrowing resources, (2) using experiential knowledge, flexibility and mobility, and (3) diversifying livelihoods and intensifying fishing. We show that fishers build their adaptive capacity on flexibility to sustain their livelihoods and on local knowledge to mitigate risk and damage from extreme weather events. The paper argues that the adaptive responses used by fishers in the Dominican Republic and in Belize can sustain their livelihoods but cannot enable a long term and transformative adaptation to ongoing and cumulative climate changes.","[Karlsson, Marianne] Norwegian Inst Water Res, Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res, Oslo, Norway; [Mclean, Elizabeth L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Nat Resources Sci Dept, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA); University of Rhode Island,"Karlsson, M (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Water Res, Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res, Oslo, Norway.",marianne.karlsson@niva.no,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Mclean, Elizabeth/HNB-9042-2023",,"Research Council of Norway [199380/H30]; Coastal Institute Fellowship; University of Rhode Island, Kingston RI; Puerto Rico Sea Grant program; Centro para la Conservacion y EcoDesarrollo de la Bahia de Samana y su Entorno (CEBSE) in Samana","Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Coastal Institute Fellowship; University of Rhode Island, Kingston RI; Puerto Rico Sea Grant program; Centro para la Conservacion y EcoDesarrollo de la Bahia de Samana y su Entorno (CEBSE) in Samana","We extend our deepest thanks to the fishers for participating and contributing to this research.

These configurations should be understood as new solutions to protect water resources, ecosystem services and provide win-win solutions. To achieve this environmental modelling of the Reda catchment, Poland, is used as a pilot study for the project. Mathematical models which specified the detailed processes associated with water cycles, including determining interconnections and quantifying variables characteristic to the assessment of the water resource quantity and quality, were found to be useful. Due to the complexity of some models, launching, entering the appropriate data in the correct formats and calibrating the models proved to be challenging. Future developments in the water management sector should concentrate on specific local catchment areas where the application of integrated water resource management principles and the adaptation to climate change are more easily merged with local spatial planning. However, a larger number and higher frequency of measurements would be required.","[Walczykiewicz, Tomasz; Jakusik, Ewa; Skonieczna, Magdalena; Wozniak, Lukasz] Natl Res Inst, Inst Meteorol & Water Management, Podlesna 61, PL-01673 Warsaw, Poland",Institute of Meteorology & Water Management,"Walczykiewicz, T (corresponding author), Natl Res Inst, Inst Meteorol & Water Management, Podlesna 61, PL-01673 Warsaw, Poland.",tomasz.walczykiewicz@imgw.pl,"Walczykiewicz, Tomasz/A-7292-2015","Walczykiewicz, Tomasz/0000-0001-5326-9132; Jakusik, Ewa/0000-0002-6732-2704; Skonieczna, Magdalena/0000-0002-1398-3531",,,,,12,0,0,0,1,INST METEOROLOGY & WATER MANAGEMENT,WARSAW,"PODLESNA 61, WARSAW, 01673, POLAND",2299-3835,2353-5652,,METEOROL HYDROL WATE,Meteorol.

Farmer-led irrigation is currently not well recognised or accounted for, and the current focus on state or public-private irrigation schemes means this activity is largely occurring outside of formal governance mechanisms or is deemed illegal. How do current institutional and regulatory frameworks relate to the apparent boom in farmer-led irrigation, and how do these shape current patterns of response, support, and regulation? To answer this question, we build a conceptual understanding of water governance which draws on critiques of current institutional frameworks for water and irrigation management, specifically using the conceptual ideas of isomorphic mimicry and capability traps, and elements of a problem-driven iterative adaptation (PDIA) approach. We then use three case studies from Tanzania and Malawi to illuminate three critical problems that state institutions encounter in approaching the recognition and regulation of farmer-led irrigation. In our conclusion we argue that current irrigation governance is creating capability traps for existing institutions. Where incremental and context-driven adaptation of governance is practised this can be avoided, creating better chances of effective support and regulation of farmer-led irrigation development.","[Mdee, Anna] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Harrison, Elizabeth] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Leeds; University of Sussex,"Mdee, A (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",a.l.mdee@leeds.ac.uk; e.a.harrison@sussex.ac.uk,,"Mdee, Anna/0000-0002-8260-1840",DFID-ESRC Growth Research Programme (DEGRP) [ES/J009415/1]; DFID-ESRC Growth Research Programme [ES/L01239/1],DFID-ESRC Growth Research Programme (DEGRP); DFID-ESRC Growth Research Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The Choma and Chitsukwa studies were part of a research project funded by the DFID-ESRC Growth Research Programme (DEGRP), grant no.

Low soil fertility combined with low and variable rainfall restrict the livelihoods of smallholder farmers who often struggle to produce enough food. Although historically, communities have adopted a number of coping mechanisms, climate change threatens to further reduce agricultural production. There are many additional options available to smallholder farmers to adapt to climate change, but they are not necessarily adopting these measures despite having noticed increasing temperatures and declining rainfall. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in three villages in Onesi constituency to examine what agricultural practices smallholder crop farmers use, perception of changes in their yields, their perspective on future yields and whether they are planning on changing their agricultural practices. The results suggest that to sustain the livelihoods of rural communities in north-central Namibia, support is needed from local and regional authorities, as well as traditional and religious leaders to assist with enhancing access to information, enabling information sharing on adaptation options, and increasing awareness on climate change, its impacts and what can be done about it. In addition to this, implementation of the adaptation action also requires demonstration sites and building capacity to enable the development of self-help groups.","[Spear, Dian; Chappel, Angela] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, 6th Floor Geol Sci Bldg,Univ Ave South, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Spear, D (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, 6th Floor Geol Sci Bldg,Univ Ave South, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa.",dian.spear@uct.ac.za; chappelangela@gmail.com,"Spear, Dian/B-2469-2009","Spear, Dian/0000-0002-2417-3980","International Development Research Centre [107640-001]; Department of Science and Technology, Republic of South Africa [0123/2014]","International Development Research Centre; Department of Science and Technology, Republic of South Africa(Department of Science & Technology (India))","This research was funded by International Development Research Centre grant number 107640-001 and Department of Science and Technology, Republic of South Africa grant number 0123/2014.",,62,10,10,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,SEP,2018,7,3,,,,,,,79,10.3390/land7030079,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land7030079,,,11,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX7FK,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000447930100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to the lack of undisturbed profiles with high sedimentation rates, the relationship between the environment and agricultural activities has not been properly investigated in Korea using a paleoenvironmental approach. This study shows possible climate-induced changes in chestnut production, which was contemporaneously recognized by the Chinese as an important and unique local food source in southwestern Korea. Our results also show that human adaptation to climate change may have resulted in both the degradation and recovery of the local forest ecosystem in the study area. The data from the Seonam-dong archeological site provided evidence supporting the following hypotheses. 1) Chestnut cultivation declined from 400 BC to AD 200 (2350-1750 cal BP), as herbaceous crop production may have sufficiently expanded to sustain the population, possibly due to agricultural improvements and/or climatic amelioration. 2) Chestnut cultivation was enhanced from AD 200 to AD 800 (1750-1150 cal BP), probably to compensate for decreased herbaceous crop yields due to climatic deterioration. 3) The increase in chestnut cultivation led to forest disturbance and increased flooding, with intermittent forest recovery during periods of decreased cultivation.

While many of these studies documented a long-term trend of declining rainfall, analyses conducted in the last few years suggest that a `recovery' is underway. Drawing on ethnographic interviews, focus groups, and participant observation in two Provinces of the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso, we elicited local perspectives on these rainfall trends from the people who are most directly affected, namely local farmers. Fieldwork revealed that farmers in the research sites perceive that both overall seasonal rainfall and the number of `big rains' during the rainy season have decreased over the last 30 years. We then tested these perceptions against rainfall records from nearby meteorological stations and found them to be corroborated. This paper illustrates how farmers of the Central Plateau now view drought as `normal', having incorporated drought-mitigation adaptations into their agricultural systems. Our case study highlights the need for ground truthing scientific analyses and assessing livelihood implications at the local level. It also advocates for sustained institutional support for rural communities, to increase their ability to adapt to climate change. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[West, C.

This calls for comprehensive adaptation to climate change. Within the climate change regime, adaptation is as central as mitigation but needs to be much more explicitly addressed at local, national and global levels. There is also a need for policy renewal in other international regimes that are central to adaptation, such as environment, human rights, development and trade. Accordingly, this article addresses poverty-relevant adaptation through the medium of three discourses: development, resilience, and transition theory. Development, as a post-war project of theories, strategies and policies, spells out the links between rich and poor countries and offers modernization trajectories but few solutions for adaptation and sustainability transitions. Resilience, as an analytical framework emerging in ecology in the 1970s in reaction to ideas of equilibrium, depicts incremental changes and capacity to preserve systems within given frames but does not recognize that social change mainly implies transitions to renewed forms of production, consumption and distribution with new combinations of organization, institutions and technology. Transition theory focuses on profound multilevel changes in complex (sub)systems, thereby offering a powerful framework for theorizing empirical findings and promoting adaptation as a transition to sustainability.","[Olsson, Lennart] Lund Univ, Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Jerneck, Anne] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Olsson, L (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Lennart.Olsson@lucsus.lu.se,,"Olsson, Lennart/0000-0001-8353-1074; jerneck, anne/0000-0002-1429-8739",,,,,65,84,85,2,59,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

There is minimal documentation of adaptation strategies to mitigate the risk of extreme weather in cities of Sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, this study addresses this need by examining the factors influencing individual and household adaptation strategies to climate risk in Port Harcourt Metropolis, Nigeria. Data was collected from 384 randomly selected household heads in different residential densities of the city. Household socioeconomic and demographic attributes, awareness of climate change and factors influencing their adaptation strategies to climate risk were assessed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The study showed that adaptation strategies adopted were reactive rather than anticipatory and varied in magnitude according to the different residential densities.

Yet, widespread development of irrigation may strengthen water scarcity and further increase farmers? vulnerability to water stress. In this context, understanding the conditions of the adoption of irrigation is of outmost importance to characterize the process, the risks and the policy implications of climate change adaptation. This paper presents an empirical approach for understanding the factors driving current and envisioned irrigation at farm level, by combining Internet-survey data and terroir data (precipitation, temperature, and soil water holding capacity) characterizing wine growers and farms in southeastern France (LanguedocRoussillon). Survey data include current and future practices, the perceptions of past changes, and wine growers? main objectives. The sample gathers 28% of growers that are already irrigating their vines, 39% that are considering this option for the future. Results of different econometric models show that both terroir and socioeconomic factors such as perceptions and objectives play significant roles in the adoption of irrigation.

This research aimed to assess the impact of global warming on rainfall in Madagascar, using the Mann-Kendall test, continuous wavelet transform, and polynomial regression. The result showed that the annual, seasonal maximum, and minimum temperature increased, while elevation amplified the increase of maximum temperature. Different trends in rainfall were found in the 22 regions of Madagascar but in general, the increasing trend in rainfall was prominent at a higher elevation than lower elevation. The annual rainfall decreased up to -5 mm per year for the regions located below 450 m of altitude while increased up to +5 mm per year above 500 m. We found that the wet becomes wetter with an important increase in rainfall in summer and the increase in temperature influenced the rainfall. The annual rainfall increased with temperature and elevation. However, if the increase in temperature was more than 0.03 degrees C per year, the annual rainfall increased regardless of elevation. The knowledge of the elevation dependence of the impact of warming on rainfall is important for water resources management and climate change adaptation strategies, especially for island nations and African countries.","[Tanteliniaina, Mirindra Finaritra Rabezanahary; Zhai, Jun] Chongqing Univ, MOE Key Lab Three Gorges Reservoir Reg Ecoenviron, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jia] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, MOE Engn Res Ctr Waste Oil Recovery Technol & Equ, Chongqing 400067, Peoples R China; [Adyel, Tanveer M.] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 23 Coll Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Chongqing University; Chongqing Technology & Business University; Monash University,"Zhai, J (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, MOE Key Lab Three Gorges Reservoir Reg Ecoenviron, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China.",mirindra@cqu.edu.cn; jiachen77@ctbu.edu.cn; tanveer.adyel@monash.edu; zhaijun@cqu.edu.cn,"Adyel, Tanveer/AAQ-6463-2020","Adyel, Tanveer/0000-0001-5940-5406; Rabezanahary Tanteliniaina, Mirindra Finaritra/0000-0002-0753-8757; Zhai, Jun/0000-0002-4378-0604","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51878093]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB2101001-03]; Chongqing Technology Innovation and Application Demonstration Special Project-Key Research [cstc2018jscx-mszdX0087, cstc2018jszx-336 zdyfxmX0009]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Chongqing Technology Innovation and Application Demonstration Special Project-Key Research,"This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51878093), National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFB2101001-03), and Chongqing Technology Innovation and Application Demonstration Special Project-Key Research And Development Projects Related to People's Livelihood (cstc2018jscx-mszdX0087, cstc2018jszx-336 zdyfxmX0009).",,67,3,3,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,DEC,2020,12,12,,,,,,,3582,10.3390/w12123582,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12123582,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,PL1YJ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000602925800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such project is being implemented in Indigenous territories in the Datem del Maranon region. At the time of approval by the GCF Board, the proposed project raised protests from Indigenous communities as they claimed they were not properly consulted before the disbursement of funding. This episode evidenced how the GCF needed to adopt an ad hoc policy to engage with Indigenous peoples respecting the FPIC requirement as prescribed by international law. The present paper demonstrates that the Indigenous Peoples Policy, adopted in February 2018 by the GCF, is an example of harmonization with international law requirements for FPIC such as those prescribed by the United Nations Declaration on Indigenous Peoples Rights. Finally, the paper aims at evidencing the challenge represented by the excessive state-centred structure of the GCF, which needs to be overcome to facilitate a true participatory dialogue with Indigenous peoples.","[Giacomini, Giada] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Polit Sci, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Giacomini, G (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Polit Sci, Rome, Italy.",giada.giacomini@uniroma1.it,,"GIACOMINI, GIADA/0000-0002-3618-4011",,,,,41,0,0,2,4,UNIV CATOLICA TEMUCO,TEMUCO,"MANUEL MONTT 056, TEMUCO, 00000, CHILE",0716-1557,0719-2789,,CUHSO-CULT-HOMBRE-SO,CUHSO-Cult.-Hombre-Soc.,JUL,2020,30,1,,,,,102,125,,10.7770/2452-610X.2020.CUHSO.01.A07,http://dx.doi.org/10.7770/2452-610X.2020.CUHSO.01.A07,,,24,Social Issues,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Social Issues,MQ9WM,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000553245200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents the results of climate change impact assessment on a typical mid-rise residential building in four representative cities with different climatic characteristics in Turkey. Three different scenarios that characterize different solutions towards space cooling are developed, from naturally ventilated to fully air-conditioned. The energy requirements and corresponding CO2 emissions due to space conditioning as well as occupant thermal comfort are the investigated building performance metrics. The preliminary results based on energy simulations indicate that pronounced overheating will be experienced in the future, which will have a strong effect on cooling energy use and/or occupant comfort. The projected energy demand also points to the future need to explore measures for climate change adaptation of buildings and the importance of the decarbonization of the electricity industry for climate change mitigation. The analysis results presented in this paper provide a basis for future studies on building retrofit for climate change. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed the contribution of commercial sugarcane cultivation to household-level food security among smallholder farmers in Busoga sub-region, eastern Uganda. Land use changes are motivated by quick commercial gains rather than sustained food production; a situation that influences food security. The majority of households cultivate few crop varieties, lack adequate and nutritious foods, and have inadequate income to purchase food to meet their needs. Inadequacy of food within some commercial sugarcane-cultivating households suggests that generating income does not necessarily increase food security. To cope with food insecurity, households offer labour in exchange for food, borrow food, ration food, and at times steal. This is exacerbated by increasing food crop failures, large family sizes, trade in food items, and declining availability of food and land for food production. Commercial sugarcane cultivation is the main driver of food insecurity but given its perceived economic benefits, future sugarcane plantations expansion in the region is probably inevitable. Therefore, future policy should be designed to provide triple-win strategies (i.e., food security, poverty alleviation, and climate change adaptation) that provide sustainable livelihoods.","[Mwavu, Edward N.; Byakagaba, Patrick; Waiswa, Daniel; Enuru, Thomas; Mbogga, Michael S.] Makerere Univ, Sch Forestry Environm & Geog Sci, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda; [Kalema, Vettes K.] Kachwekano Zonal Agr Res & Dev Inst, POB 421, Kabale, Uganda; [Bateganya, Fred] Makerere Univ, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda",Makerere University; Makerere University,"Mwavu, EN (corresponding author), Makerere Univ, Sch Forestry Environm & Geog Sci, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda.",emwavu@caes.mak.ac.ug; vetteskalema@gmail.com; frebat2011@gmail.com; Byakagaba@caes.mak.ac.ug; daniel.waiswa@gmail.com; tenuru@caes.mak.ac.ug; mbogga@caes.mak.ac.ug,,,"Carnegie Corporation of New York; Makerere University, through the Next Generation of African Academics Project","Carnegie Corporation of New York; Makerere University, through the Next Generation of African Academics Project","This study was funded in part by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Makerere University, through the Next Generation of African Academics Project.",,53,13,13,1,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,JUN,2018,7,2,,,,,,,73,10.3390/land7020073,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land7020073,,,15,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GK9IB,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000436556500034,View Full Record in Web of Science

Development and disaster risk are closely linked as the people and assets exposed to risk, as well as their vulnerability and capacity, are largely determined by development processes. Transformation is key to moving from current development patterns that increase, create or unfairly distribute risks, to forms of development that are equitable, resilient and sustainable. Based on a review of existing literature, we present three opportunities that have the potential to lead to transformation in the development-disaster risk relationship: (i) exposing development-disaster risk trade-offs in development policy and decision-making; (ii) prioritizing equity and social justice in approaches to secure resilience; and (iii) enabling transformation through adaptive governance. This research aims to contribute to breaking down existing barriers in research, policy and practice between the disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and development communities by providing cross-sectoral opportunities to operationalize theoretical knowledge on transformation. It also helps to clarify the connections between different global agendas by positioning transformation as a potential bridging concept to link disconnected policy processes. This paper argues for empirical research to test the opportunities presented here and further define transformative pathways at multiple scales.","[Thomalla, Frank; Boyland, Michael; Johnson, Karlee] Stockholm Environm Inst, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Thomalla, Frank] Climate & Disaster Risk Res & Consulting CDRC, Sydney, NSW 2176, Australia; [Thomalla, Frank; Boyland, Michael; Johnson, Karlee; Ensor, Jonathan; Tuhkanen, Heidi; Han, Guoyi] Stockholm Environm Inst, Int Ctr Excellence Transforming Dev & Disaster Ri, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Thomalla, Frank; Boyland, Michael; Johnson, Karlee; Ensor, Jonathan; Tuhkanen, Heidi; Han, Guoyi] Integrated Res Disaster Risk IRDR Programme, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Ensor, Jonathan; Forrester, John] Univ York, Stockholm Environm Inst, Environm Dept, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England; [Tuhkanen, Heidi] Stockholm Environm Inst, EE-10416 Tallinn, Estonia; [Swartling, Asa Gerger; Han, Guoyi] Stockholm Environm Inst, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wahl, Darin] Portland State Univ, Coll Urban & Publ Affairs Nohad A Toulon Sch Urba, Portland, OR 97201 USA",University of York - UK; Stockholm Environment Institute; Portland State University,"Thomalla, F (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;Thomalla, F (corresponding author), Climate & Disaster Risk Res & Consulting CDRC, Sydney, NSW 2176, Australia.;Thomalla, F (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Int Ctr Excellence Transforming Dev & Disaster Ri, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;Thomalla, F (corresponding author), Integrated Res Disaster Risk IRDR Programme, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",frank.thomalla@cdrc.net.au; michael.boyland@sei.org; karlee.johnson@sei.org; jon.ensor@york.ac.uk; heidi.tuhkanen@sei.org; asa.swartling@sei.org; guoyi.han@sei.org; john.forrester@york.ac.uk; darinwahl@gmail.com,"Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/J-1420-2018; Wahl, Darin/AAL-5986-2020; Ensor, Jonathan/M-3313-2014","Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/0000-0003-3616-7323; Wahl, Darin/0000-0003-0396-8423; Ensor, Jonathan/0000-0003-2402-5491; Tuhkanen, Heidi/0000-0003-0025-6922",,,,,66,40,40,3,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2018,10,5,,,,,,,1458,10.3390/su10051458,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10051458,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ7RP,,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000435587100154,View Full Record in Web of Science

Water governance, like many other global issues, is becoming increasingly intractable (wicked) with climate change and is, by the international community, being linked to instances of threats to human security, the war in the Sudanese Darfur and more recently the acts of terrorism perpetuated by ISIS. In this paper, we ask the question: how can situations characterized by water controversy (exacerbated by the uncertainties posed by climate change) be reconciled? The main argument is based on a critique of the way the water security discourse appropriates expert (normal) claims about human-biophysical relationships. When water challenges become increasingly securitized by the climate change discourse it becomes permissible to enact processes that legitimately transgress normative positions through post-normal actions. In contrast, the water equity discourse offers an alternative reading of wicked and post-normal water governance situations. We contend that by infusing norm critical considerations into the process of securitization, new sub-national constellations of agents will be empowered to enact changes; thereby bypassing vicious cycles of power brokering that characterize contemporary processes intended to address controversies.","[Powell, Neil; Elrick-Barr, Carmen] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4558, Australia; [Powell, Neil] Uppsala Univ, Swedish Ctr Educ Sustainable Dev, S-75237 Uppsala, Sweden; [Larsen, Rasmus Klocker] SEI, S-11523 Stockholm, Sweden; [de Bruin, Annemarieke] Univ York, Stockholm Environm Inst, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England; [Powell, Stina] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",University of the Sunshine Coast; Uppsala University; Stockholm Environment Institute; University of York - UK; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Powell, N (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4558, Australia.;Powell, N (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Swedish Ctr Educ Sustainable Dev, S-75237 Uppsala, Sweden.",npowell@usc.edu.au; rasmus.klocker.larsen@sei-international.org; annemarieke.debruin@york.ac.uk; stina.powell@slu.se; celrick@usc.edu.au,"Elrick-Barr, Carmen/Q-9861-2019; Powell, Neil/AAN-1961-2021","Elrick-Barr, Carmen/0000-0001-6868-1373; Powell, Neil/0000-0002-8665-2370",,,,,57,6,6,2,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,DEC,2017,9,12,,,,,,,934,10.3390/w9120934,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9120934,,,13,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,FR7DB,,"gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000419225500029,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, to date little evidence has been provided of the relationship between resettlement and climate change, including the degree to which resettlement may shape the vulnerability of households or communities. In this article we ask: is there any evidence that resettlement may be a driver of vulnerability and if so, what factors make resettled households more vulnerable when compared to non-resettled households? These questions are considered with reference to new evidence drawn from a livelihoods-based vulnerability analysis in a drought-prone, poverty county in China's Shanxi Province, which encompassed households involved in local poverty resettlement programs. Evidence of the characteristics of resettled households compared to non-resettled households shows that resettlement adversely impacts on the household asset base, particularly in terms of financial and natural capital. It may therefore be a driver of vulnerability. At a time when the Chinese government is repackaging resettlement as a climate change adaptation measure, this article provides evidence that resettlement as it is currently practiced has the potential to amplify rather than alleviate household vulnerability to climate change.

Ecosystem-based adaptation highlights the interdependence of human and natural systems, and the potential to buffer the impacts of climate change by maintaining functioning ecosystems that continue to provide multiple societal benefits. Natural flood management (NFM), emphasising the restoration of innate hydrological pathways, provides important regulating services in relation to both runoff rates and water quality and is heralded as a potentially important climate change adaptation strategy. This paper draws together 25 NFM schemes, providing a meta-analysis of hydrological performance along with a wider consideration of their net (dis) benefits. Increasing woodland coverage, whilst positively linked to peak flow reduction (more pronounced for low magnitude events), biodiversity and carbon storage, can adversely impact other provisioning service-especially food production. Similarly, reversing historical land drainage operations appears to have mixed impacts on flood alleviation, carbon sequestration and water quality depending on landscape setting and local catchment characteristics.

I illustrate this by bringing together insights from Coase on tradability of property rights, Ostrom on institutional design principles for long lived commons and Williamson on transaction cost and governance mechanisms. I call this the COW model on the analytics of climate adaptation, which I illustrate using grounded theory in the case of the 400-year old zangjera irrigation societies in Northern Philippines. The zangjeras are highly vulnerable to climatic risks but has successfully managed to adapt steadily overtime. I argue that their ability to adapt is a function of transaction cost which is associated with some ingenious principles of institutional design such as: (1) clear allocation and tradability of rights and obligations; (2) fairness in the allocation of risks, costs and benefits; (3) reliance on prices and incentives as adaptation mechanisms; (4) adaptive efficiency, i.e. maximization of welfare at least adaptation cost; (5) reliable enforcement mechanisms; and (6) a polycentric structure of governance. I conclude that the COW model can provide a useful foundation for the analytics of climate adaptation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, there was no indication of actual behavior by these firms to enact carbon management, and a striking gap existed between awareness and behavior.

Climate change is anticipated to increase the duration and the magnitude of drought events, augmenting also their adverse effects. Recent studies, as well as policy initiatives, emphasise the need of proper farm-level management, for efficient mitigation of drought effects and adaptation to climate change. Towards this objective, robust, practical and comprehensible tools should be employed to support decision making process. In this paper, the Crop Reconnaissance Drought Index (CRDI) is introduced, aiming at assisting in agricultural drought analyses, focusing on specific crops. The proposed CRDI is an adjustment of the widely used Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), in which the utilised parameter of reference evapotranspiration is replaced by crop evapotranspiration. Along with this amendment, other issues regarding the calculation of CRDI are discussed, such as the selection of appropriate reference periods and methods of crop evapotranspiration assessment. The significance and the advantages of CRDI are illustrated through an application, considering different crops under Mediterranean conditions, in three regions of Greece.","[Tigkas, Dimitris; Vangelis, Harris; Tsakiris, George] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Ctr Assessment Nat Hazards & Proact Planning, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Athens, Greece; [Tigkas, Dimitris; Vangelis, Harris; Tsakiris, George] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Lab Reclamat Works & Water Resources Management, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens; National Technical University of Athens,"Tigkas, D (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Ctr Assessment Nat Hazards & Proact Planning, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Athens, Greece.;Tigkas, D (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Lab Reclamat Works & Water Resources Management, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Athens, Greece.",ditigas@mail.ntua.gr,"Tigkas, Dimitris/AAE-9790-2019; Vangelis, Harris/AAL-3265-2021","Tigkas, Dimitris/0000-0002-2001-259X; Vangelis, Harris/0000-0002-1558-6927",,,,,45,26,26,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

CCU technology regards CO2 as a raw material and reduces CO2 emissions. However, purity and pressurization requirements in most CCU technologies are high. Flue gas that is emitted from industries and transportation requires advanced purification and pressurization, which limits the development and decreases the feasibility of CCU application. Hence, a new approach to CCU technology without CO2 purification and pressurization is desirable. This study reviews differences between the CO2 purity and pressure of waste CO2 and feedstock CO2 reviews difficulties of CO2 purification and pressurization in recent developments of CCU, and provides several promising examples of CCU technologies without CO2 pressurization and/or purification. Various promising CCU technologies and their future research prospects are discussed. Mineral carbonation and biological conversion appear to be possible solutions as CCU technologies without CO2 purification and pressurization. For all other CCU approaches, research trials to decrease the required CO2 purity and pressure of the feedstock CO2 will be required.","[Ho, Hsing-Jung] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Dept Environm Studies Adv Soc, Aoba Ku, Aoba 468-1 Aramaki, Sendai, Miyagi 9800845, Japan; [Iizuka, Atsushi; Shibata, Etsuro] Tohoku Univ, Inst Multidisciplinary Res Adv Mat, Ctr Mineral Proc & Met, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan",Tohoku University; Tohoku University,"Ho, HJ (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Dept Environm Studies Adv Soc, Aoba Ku, Aoba 468-1 Aramaki, Sendai, Miyagi 9800845, Japan.;Iizuka, A (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Inst Multidisciplinary Res Adv Mat, Ctr Mineral Proc & Met, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.",ho.hsing.jung.p4@dc.tohoku.ac.jp; atsushi.iizuka.e4@tohoku.ac.jp,"Ho, HsingJung/R-6579-2019","Ho, HsingJung/0000-0002-6256-1589; Iizuka, Atsushi/0000-0001-8186-9303",,,,,171,63,68,24,125,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0888-5885,,,IND ENG CHEM RES,Ind.

A database of 178 monetary estimates is constructed to conduct a meta-analysis that, for the first time, digs into what factors drive water related ecosystem service values in Africa. We find that the service type, biome and other socioeconomic variables are significant in explaining benefits from water related services. In order to understand the importance that benefits from water related ecosystem services have for climate change, we explore the relationship between these benefits and the countries' vulnerability and readiness to adapt to climate change. We find that countries face synergies and trade-offs in terms of how valuable their water related ecosystem services are and their potential vulnerability and adaptation capacity. While more vulnerable countries are associated with lower benefits from ecosystem services, countries with a higher readiness to adapt are also associated with lower ecosystem service values.

A quantitative model, based on canonical correlation analysis applied in Fuerteventura Island (Canary Archipelago), detected indicators of human-landscape relationships and predicted potential shifts based on simulated environmental changes. In the last few decades, the landscape of Fuerteventura Island has changed: natural components and cultural agrarian uses have decreased, while the population has increased due to immigration, mainly from mainland Spain and other European countries. The island shows a transition from a coupled local socio-ecosystem to one based on the interaction between environment and coastal tourism that decouples native inhabitants from the landscape and traditional land-use practices. As vulnerability and adaptation to climate change represent critical sets of potential interactions in Canary Islands, a model and a map of the socio-ecological system under four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios show rural decoupling through 'deagrarianization' and 'deruralization', as well as stronger links to the tourism system.","[Schmitz, Maria F.; Herrero-Jauregui, Cristina; Matos, Daniela G.

Global time flexibility is justifiable to some extent as found in previous studies by Wigley et al. Nevertheless, it does not necessarily serve as a rationale to delay emission reduction commitment and efforts of developed countries as they suggested. The time flexibility can be saved for developing countries, and it must be so in equity consideration; early reduction by developed countries eases burden of developing countries in both time and emission quantity dimensions. This equity-oriented argument is robust against time and spatial efficiency consideration, since the apparent benefits that might accrue to developed countries from delaying reductions will by no means be transferred to far distant future developing countries for mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.

Although synergy exists between selected strategies, competition also exist between rice- and non-rice based strategies. The likelihood of undertaking climate change adaptation strategies are significantly and positively influenced by education, subsistence pressure, income from livestock and poultry, extension services, involvement in organizations and the use of ICT in farming. Adaptation probability inversely related with increasing women participation in agricultural labour force.

Participatory assessments that recognise the social roots of vulnerability, however, are critical in helping individuals and institutions rethink their understanding of and responses to climate change impacts. This paper interrogates the contribution of Oxfam's Vulnerability and Risk Assessment methodology to enabling transformation at both personal and institutional levels. Three Vulnerability and Risk Assessment exercises were conducted in Malawi, Botswana and Namibia by one or more of the authors in 2015 and 2016. Reflecting on these workshops, we explore the contribution that a process like the Vulnerability and Risk Assessment may bring to transformation. We conclude that these types of inclusive and representative participatory approaches can shift narratives and power dynamics, allow marginal voices to be heard, build cross-scalar relationships and enable the co-creation of solutions. Such approaches can play a key role in moving towards transformational thinking and action, especially in relation to climate change adaptation.","[Morchain, Daniel] Oxfam GB, Programme Strategy & Impact Team PSIT, Oxford, England; [Spear, Dian; Davies, Julia; Hegga, Salma] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, 6th Floor,Geol Sci Bldg,Univ Ave South, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa; [Ziervogel, Gina] Univ Cape Town, Environm & Geograph Sci Bldg,South Lane, Cape Town, South Africa; [Masundire, Hillary; Molefe, Chandapiwa] Univ Botswana, Dept Biol Sci, Gaborone, Botswana; [Angula, Margaret N.] Univ Namibia, Dept Geog Hist & Environm Studies, Windhoek, Namibia",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; University of Botswana; University of Namibia,"Spear, D (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, 6th Floor,Geol Sci Bldg,Univ Ave South, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa.",dian.spear@gmail.com,"Spear, Dian/B-2469-2009; Ziervogel, Gina/AAG-2945-2019","Spear, Dian/0000-0002-2417-3980; Ziervogel, Gina/0000-0003-4219-6809; Angula, Margaret Ndapewa/0000-0002-3973-0225","Adaptation at Scale in Semi-Arid Regions project (ASSAR); Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada; South African Department of Science and Technology","Adaptation at Scale in Semi-Arid Regions project (ASSAR); Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada; South African Department of Science and Technology","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Some of this work was carried out under the Adaptation at Scale in Semi-Arid Regions project (ASSAR).

As the usual approach-relying on detailed health data in form of hospital records-is not feasible for many countries, a different methodology is needed. This work presents such an approach. Based on singular spectrum analysis and using monthly mortality rates-partly ranging back to 1960-it derives excess mortality estimates for 27 European countries. Excess mortality is then regressed against a heat wave measure in order to assess the health impacts of extreme heat. The analysis demonstrates that many European countries are severely affected by heat waves: On average, 0.61%-and up to 1.14% in case of Portugal-of all deaths are caused by extreme heat events. This finding confirms the understanding that climate change is a major environmental risk to public health: In the 27 examined European countries, over 28,000 people die every year due to exposure to extreme heat.","[Merte, Steffen] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Merte, S (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",steffen.merte@columbia.edu,,"Bixby, Steffen/0000-0003-0436-1594",,,,,29,25,25,2,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In the study region, dry land farming has increasingly experienced climate-induced changes to farm productivity and natural resources. The experience of vulnerability to decreased livelihood options and natural resource hazards due to a changing climate varied according to household wealth and well-being status, with very poor and poor households more vulnerable than medium and well-off households.

A hedonic valuation model is applied to capture the local economic gains or losses from more water bodies in green areas. The framework was applied to the northern part of the city of Aarhus, Denmark. We investigated four adaptation strategies that encompassed laissez-faire, larger sewer pipes, local infiltration units, and open drainage system in the urban green structure. We found that when taking into account environmental amenity effects, an integration of open drainage basins in urban recreational areas is likely the best adaptation strategy, followed by pipe enlargement and local infiltration strategies.

To help make land-use and climate change adaptation policies more effective at a local scale, this study used a combination of participatory approaches and computer simulation modeling. This methodology (called the Participatory Watershed Land-use Management (PWLM) approach) consist of four major steps: (a) Scenario analysis, (b) impact assessment, (c) developing adaptation and mitigation measures and its integration in local government policies, and (d) improvement of land use plan. As a test case, we conducted PWLM in the Santa Rosa Sub-watershed of the Philippines, a rapidly urbanizing area outside Metro Manila. The scenario analysis step involved a participatory land-use mapping activity (to understand future likely land-use changes), as well as GCM precipitation and temperature data downscaling (to understand the local climate scenarios). For impact assessment, the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool was used to simulate future river water quality (BOD and E. coli) under a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario and several alternative future scenarios considering different drivers and pressures (to 2030). Water samples from the Santa Rosa River in 2015 showed that BOD values ranged from 13 to 52 mg/L; indicating that the river is already moderately to extremely polluted compared to desirable water quality (class B). In the future scenarios, we found that water quality will deteriorate further by 2030 under all scenarios. Population growth was found to have the highest impact on future water quality deterioration, while climate change had the lowest (although not negligible). After the impact assessment, different mitigation measures were suggested in a stakeholder consultation workshop, and of them (enhanced capacity of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and increased sewerage connection rate) were adopted to generate a final scenario including countermeasures. The main benefit of the PWLM approach are its high level of stakeholder involvement (through co-generation of the research) and use of free (for developing countries) software and models, both of which contribute to an enhanced science-policy interface.","[Kumar, Pankaj; Johnson, Brian Alan; Dasgupta, Rajarshi; Kawai, Masayuki] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Nat Resources & Ecosyst Serv, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan; [Avtar, Ram] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Chakraborty, Shamik] Hosei Univ, Fac Sustainabil Studies, Tokyo 1028160, Japan; [Magcale-Macandog, Damasa B.] Univ Philippines, Inst Biol Sci, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines",Hokkaido University; Hosei University; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of the Philippines Open University,"Kumar, P (corresponding author), Inst Global Environm Strategies, Nat Resources & Ecosyst Serv, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan.",kumar@iges.or.jp; johnson@iges.or.jp; dasgupta@iges.or.jp; ram@ees.hokudai.ac.jp; shamik.chakraborty.76@hosei.ac.jp; kawai@iges.or.jp; dmmacandog@up.edu.ph,"kumar, Pankaj/HPF-8395-2023; DasGupta, Rajarshi/AAX-2695-2021; Dasgupta, Rajarshi/AAF-7822-2021; Avtar, Ram/C-7394-2012","DasGupta, Rajarshi/0000-0003-0051-5090; Chakraborty, Shamik/0000-0002-8281-8089; Avtar, Ram/0000-0003-3653-5771; Kumar, Pankaj/0000-0001-7099-7297; Johnson, Brian/0000-0003-1911-3585","LLDA; Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Philippines, Los Banos","LLDA; Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Philippines, Los Banos","This paper is generally based upon outputs produced under the Adaptation Initiative project for the fiscal year 2019, commissioned work of the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.

In the context of uneven impacts of climate change across regions interconnected through trade, climate change impact and adaptation policies in one region need to be assessed in a global framework. Focusing on four Eastern Asian countries and using a global integrated modeling framework we show that i) once imports are considered, the overall climate change impact on the amount of food available could be of opposite sign to the direct domestic impacts and ii) production and trade adjustments following price signals could reduce the spread of climate change impacts on food availability. We then investigated how pressure on the food system in Eastern Asia could bc mitigated by a consumer support policy. We found that the costs of adaptation policies to 2050 varied greatly across climate projections. The costs of consumer support policies would also be lower if only implemented in one region but market price leakage could exacerbate pressure on food systems in other regions.

The ratification of the Paris Agreement by Ukraine envisages an increase in the ability to adapt to the negative effects of climate change, as well as promoting low carbon development so as not to endanger food production. At the same time, water resources, on the one hand, are one of the most vulnerable to climate change components of the environment from the state of which the food security of the country depends directly, and on the other hand, the activity of the water management complex causes the emergence of both direct and indirect carbon footprint. Therefore, an indispensable prerequisite for sustainable low carbon development is the assessment of the carbon footprint of the main sectors of Ukraine's water management complex and the identification of priority measures for their decarbonisation and adaptation to expected climate change. Methods. The methodological basis for the assessment of the carbon footprint of the main sectors of the water management complex was the life cycle method (LCA), by which, based on the open data of the National Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions from Sources and Absorption by Greenhouse Gas Absorbers in Ukraine and the statistical analysis of the results of previous studies. By means of systematic analysis of the main factors of greenhouse gas emission in the water management complex of Ukraine, the priority directions of its decarbonisation and adaptation to climate change were determined. Results. The estimated carbon footprint of Ukraine's water complex in 2017 was estimated to be 5.15 million tons of CO2-equiv, which was 1.6% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Ukraine in 2017, and taking into account the potential carbon footprint end-use processes can be increased by up to 3%. Due to the deterioration of the water supply networks, an average of 35% of the supplied water is lost in Ukraine. Reducing network leakage by at least 10% will reduce carbon footprint by 30,000 tons of CO2-equiv annually. The priority areas for decarbonisation of the water management complex should be modernization of water supply and water treatment infrastructure, improvement of energy efficiency of pumping equipment and introduction of drip irrigation, and its adaptation to climate change development of the network of green infrastructure. Conclusions. The low-carbon development of the water management system should include the introduction and coordination of such measures, which, on the one hand, minimize the adverse effects of climate change on water resources and contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of water management activities, and on the other hand, guarantee the achievement of sustainable development goals, in particular for ensuring water and society proper sanitary conditions.","[Levkovska, Lyudmila] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Publ Inst Inst Environm Econ & Sustainable Dev, Kiev, Ukraine; [Irtyshcheva, Inna; Dubynska, Iryna] Admiral Makarov Natl Univ Shipbldg, Mykolaiv, Ukraine",National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Admiral Makarov National University of Shipbuilding,"Levkovska, L (corresponding author), Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Publ Inst Inst Environm Econ & Sustainable Dev, Kiev, Ukraine.",levlv@ukr.net; innauamd@gmail.com; management@nuos.edu.ua,"Levkovska, Ludmila/AAE-7058-2022; Irtyshcheva, Inna O./AAG-6968-2020","Levkovska, Ludmila/0000-0002-7823-7062; Irtyshcheva, Inna O./0000-0002-7025-9857",,,,,11,2,2,1,4,BALTIC JOURNAL ECONOMIC STUDIES,RIGA,"VALDEKU IELA 62-156, RIGA, LV-1058, LATVIA",2256-0742,2256-0963,,BALT J ECON STUD,Balt.

Regarding to the vegetation burned, 43.6% of emissions come from forest (17.7% conifers, 4.8% hardwoods and 21.1% Eucalyptus), 53.7% from scrublands and 2.7% from grasslands. The loss of sequestration is 6.6% in the fire year and by 93.4% in previous years. Scrubland burning produces a greater amount of emissions than forests, but forest regeneration is slower, with greater influence on the loss of sequestration.

This paper examines the extent to which climate factors have shifted regional crop mixes in China and forecasts how future crop mixes might change under selected climate scenarios. Using a data set that provides planted area shares for each crop in each mainland Chinese province from 2001 to 2013, we employ a fractional multinomial logit (FMLOGIT) model to examine the influence of climate on regional crop mixes under historical as well as future climate conditions. Results show that temperature increases are projected to raise the incidence of wheat and tubers while reducing that for rice and maize, which is conventional food security crops. Moreover, cash crops such as vegetables and orchards and fiber-producing crops will increase, whereas oil-bearing crops and specialty crops will decrease. This paper is the first of its kind to examine climate impacts on the regional portfolio of crop mixes across Mainland China. The findings have important implications for foreseeing needed efforts to maintain food production in the face of future climate change and pointing out cases where adaptation efforts may be desirable.","[Zhang, Yuquan W.; Zhou, Yuanfei; Cao, Zhengwei; Li, Qiang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Inst New Rural Dev, Sch Agr & Biol, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Mu, Jianhong E.; McCarl, Bruce A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Musumba, Mark] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Gu, Xiaokun] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Inst Urban Governance, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Mu, JHE (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",yqwzhang@sjtu.edu.cn; musumba2020@gmail.com; musumba2020@gmail.com; mccarl@tamu.edu; guxk1980@163.com; zhouyf@sjtu.edu.cn; zhengweiskylark@sjtu.edu.cn; qiangli1@sina.com,"Zhang, Yuquan/L-7663-2019; Zhang, Yuquan/AAV-6206-2020; McCarl, Bruce A/E-9445-2011","Zhang, Yuquan/0000-0001-7636-9451; Musumba, Mark/0000-0003-3845-4086",New Faculty Start-up Grant under the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [16X100040010]; Agri-X Project at Shanghai Jiao Tong University [2016004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673184]; New Faculty Start-up Grant under the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities at Shanghai Jiao Tong University [16X100040010],New Faculty Start-up Grant under the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Agri-X Project at Shanghai Jiao Tong University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); New Faculty Start-up Grant under the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities at Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"This research was funded by the New Faculty Start-up Grant under the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 16X100040010) and Agri-X Project (No. 2016004) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71673184).

Direct effects vary widely across the continent, with some areas (e.g. eastern Africa) predicted to get wetter, but much of southern Africa getting drier and hotter. Crop yields will be adversely affected and the frequency of extreme weather events will increase. Adaptation to climate change is primarily a private-sector response and should involve relocation of people, changes in the sectoral structure of production, and changes in crop patterns. The role of government is primarily to provide the information, incentives, and economic environment to facilitate such changes. Adaptation will be impeded by Africa's fragmentation into small countries and ethnic groups, and by poor business environments. On the mitigation side, there is a need to design emissions-trading frameworks that support greater African participation than at present, and that include land-use change. Mitigation undertaken elsewhere will have a major impact on Africa, both positive (e.g. new technologies) and negative (e.g. commodity price changes arising from biofuel policies).","[Collier, Paul] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Conway, Gordon] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of Oxford; Imperial College London,"Collier, P (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",paul.collier@economics.oxford.ac.uk; g-conway@dfid.gov.uk; tony.venables@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,205,212,7,70,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Adaptation to climate change is dependent on current adaptive capacity and the development models that are being pursued by developing countries. Various frameworks are available for vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) assessments, and they have both advantages and limitations. Investments in developing countries are more focused on recovery from a disaster than on the creation of adaptive capacity. Extreme climatic events create a spiral of debt burden on developing countries. Increased capacity to manage extreme weather events can reduce the magnitude of economic, social and human damage and eventually, investments, in terms of borrowing money from the lending agencies. Vulnerability to extreme weather events, disaster management and adaptation must be part of long-term sustainable development planning in developing countries. Lending agencies and donors need to reform their investment policies in developing countries to focus more on capacity building instead of just investing in recovery operations and infrastructure development.

Risk control methods have been widely used to mitigate the impact of climate change on past flood losses, but past risk control strategies on climate change have not focused on the exploration of the relationship between environment, society, and humans. Based on the theoretical model of pro-environmental behavior, this study compares and analyzes four theoretical models and proposes a modified competitiveness model to effectively predict the pro-environmental behavior of college students with partial least squares (PLS) manner. Social norm could play a dominant role of mediator between risk perception, place attachment, and pro-environmental behavior. Although risk perception and local attachment are positively related to risk financial strategy, the promotion of social norms will increase the intention of risk financial strategy.

Maladaptation used in this context has remained elusively defined and sparingly used, and therefore difficult to apply. Based on a literature review, we discuss the conceptual boundaries of maladaptation and how it can be used to analyse negative outcomes of adaptation and propose a refined definition. We present a typology of maladaptation that distinguishes between three types of maladaptive outcomes - rebounding vulnerability, shifting vulnerability and eroding sustainable development, and argue that maladaptation can be defined as a result of an intentional adaptation policy or measure directly increasing vulnerability for the targeted and/or external actor(s), and/or eroding preconditions for sustainable development by indirectly increasing society's vulnerability. We note that the recognition of adaptation as an intentional action and the importance of setting clear spatial and temporal boundaries, as well as thresholds, are key to analysing negative outcomes.

Drawing on empirical material from Malawi and Kenya, the paper finds more conflicts than synergies between the pursuit of higher productivity through the promotion of hybrid maize adoption and crop diversification as a strategy for climate change adaptation. This is despite an oft-assumed causal link between escape from the 'low maize productivity trap' and progression towards crop diversification as an adaptive strategy. In both countries, a convergence of interests between governments, donors and seed companies, combined with a historical preference for, and dependence on maize as the primary staple, has led to a narrowing of options for smallholder farmers, undermining the development of adaptive capacities in the longer term. This dynamic is linked to the conflation of market-based variety of agricultural technologies, as viewed 'from the top down', with diversity-in-context, as represented by site-specific and locally derived and adapted technologies and institutions that can only be developed 'from the bottom up'.","Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Brooks, S (corresponding author), Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",sally.brooks@york.ac.uk,,"Brooks, Sally/0000-0002-1005-1245",,,,,43,14,15,2,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

We suggest that a process of describing and sharing mental models-the cognitive frameworks that people use to interpret and understand the world-provides promising and as yet underutilized techniques for conservation planners to improve implementation success. The processes and techniques associated with the mental models concept have been applied in a variety of fields including business and organization science, risk analysis, education, natural resource management, and climate change adaptation. Our review of mental models illustrates that their application can strengthen the success of conservation planning by: (1) contributing to clear and open communication between stakeholders; (2) aiding in overcoming obstacles to incorporating multiple sources of knowledge; (3) enabling shared ownership of a conservation plan; and (4) improving social assessments. Techniques to explicitly communicate mental models can contribute to each phase of a conservation planning process-assessment, planning, management, and review. Conservation planners have much to gain by eliciting and sharing mental models in conservation planning processes.","[Biggs, Duan; Leitch, Anne; Ban, Natalie C.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Australian Res Council, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Abel, Nick; Langston, Art] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Gungahlin Homestead, Crace, ACT 2911, Australia; [Knight, Andrew T.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, ZA-7602 Matieland, Western Cape, South Africa; [Leitch, Anne] Queensland Biosci Precinct St Lucia, CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",James Cook University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Stellenbosch University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Biggs, D (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Australian Res Council, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",ancientantwren@gmail.com,"Langston, Arthur/G-3959-2011; Ban, Natalie/C-6938-2009; Biggs, Duan/F-9445-2011; Leitch, Anne/D-3033-2011; Knight, Andrew Thomas/C-8394-2009","Leitch, Anne/0000-0002-7597-0007; Knight, Andrew Thomas/0000-0002-6563-0500; Biggs, Duan/0000-0003-3177-4677; Ban, Natalie/0000-0002-4682-2144",,,,,86,158,159,4,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1755-263X,,,CONSERV LETT,Conserv.

Proponents of these programs cite biodiversity conservation as a critical cobenefit, however to date, limited studies examine the outcomes of ecosystem-based adaptation interventions, particularly in terms of implications for wildlife. This case study applies the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services framework to examine an ecosystem-based adaptation program in the Mt. Elgon region of Uganda. Participant interviews within communities previously enrolled in an ecosystem-based adaptation project are used to explore how these programs change local community members' perceived relationships with nature, in the context of environmental change, and the potential implications for wildlife both within and outside of nearby Mt. Elgon National Park. Results indicate that ecosystem-based adaptation programs positively influenced participants' reported conservation values, perceptions, and behaviors; however, wildlife disservices emerged as a significant factor influencing adaptation outcomes and biodiversity conservation co-benefits. This study underscores the importance of incorporating disservices into ecosystem-based adaptation to address factors that may undermine climate resilience gains, particularly as these and other nature-based climate solutions are implemented globally.","[Christianson, Anne B.; Montgomery, Rebecca; Fleischman, Forrest; Nelson, Kristen C.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Montgomery, Rebecca] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Nelson, Kristen C.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Christianson, AB (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,"Fleischman, Forrest/I-8703-2016","Fleischman, Forrest/0000-0001-6060-4031",,,,,90,0,0,3,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0416,,,ECOSYST SERV,Ecosyst.

Significant global and national reports on integrated coastal management and climate change set the stage for a 21st Century wave of coastal reform in Australia. Given the absence of Australian national coastal legislation or coastal policy the reforms were initiated by a number of state governments such as in New South Wales and Victoria where new pieces of state-based coastal legislation came into law in 2018. This paper examines new coastal legislation, policies, manuals, and government documents and the rationale and triggers behind these reforms. These are discussed in the context of Australian governance structures and the international coastal management literature. The paper concludes that the latest wave of coastal reform in Australia represents a non-uniform stateled push for a more integrated approach to coastal management including, adaptation to climate change, sustainable development, a systems-based approach to coastal processes and inclusion of both marine and terrestrial environments.","[Harvey, Nick] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Harvey, Nick; Clarke, Beverley] Flinders Univ South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide; Flinders University South Australia,"Harvey, N (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",nick.harvey@adelaide.edu.au,"Clarke, Beverley/E-8999-2015","Clarke, Beverley/0000-0001-5904-6845",,,,,26,25,25,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

A negative relationship between phenotypic traits could limit individual performance and even the capacity of populations to adapt to climate change. Here, we examined the relationship between behavioural and physiological performance of a juvenile reef fish under elevated CO2 and temperature in a full factorial design. Behaviourally, the response to an alarm odour was negatively affected by elevated CO2, but not elevated temperature. Physiologically, aerobic scope was significantly diminished under elevated temperature, but not under elevated CO2. At the individual level, there was no relationship between behavioural and physiological traits in the control and sing le-stressor treatments. However, a statistically significant negative relationship was detected between the traits in the combined elevated CO(2 )and temperature treatment. Our results demonstrate that trade-offs in performance between behavioural and physiological traits may only be evident when multiple climate change stressors are considered, and suggest that this negative relationship could limit adaptive potential to climate change.","[Laubenstein, Taryn D.; Rummer, Jodie L.; McCormick, Mark, I; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [McCormick, Mark, I] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University,"Laubenstein, TD (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",taryn.laubenstein@my.jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014; Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645; Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498",Australian Research Council (ARC); ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies,Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies(Australian Research Council),"We thank S.

In order to know the farmers' perceptions about climate change and the adaptation strategies the present study collected the primary data from 200 farmers from different agro-climatic zones of Punjab. Multinomial logit model was used to identify the factors affecting the adaptation of climate resilient technologies. The findings revealed that most of the farmers (77%) perceived decrease in seasonal rainfall while 53% of them perceived decrease in rainfall in rabi season. Majority of the farmers (83.5% in kharif and 93% in rabi) perceived that temperature is higher than before. The adaptation choices mostly practiced by sample farmers were laser levelling of the field and improvement in irrigation structures, which was adopted by 30 and 27% of total adoption respectively. The regression model discerned determinants affecting adaptation choices were, viz. age, education, farm size, perception on temperature and extension lectures. Adaptation to climate change is constrained by several factors such as lack of knowledge about technology, lack of finance and credit availability and inadequate trainings and demonstrations about the climate resilient technologies.","[Kumar, Sunny; Sidana, Baljinder Kaur] Punjab Agr Univ, Dept Econ & Sociol, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India",Punjab Agricultural University,"Kumar, S (corresponding author), Punjab Agr Univ, Dept Econ & Sociol, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India.",sunnykumar@pau.edu; baljindersidana@gmail.com,"Kumar, Sunny/GWQ-7812-2022",,,,,,42,6,8,1,14,INDIAN COUNC AGRICULTURAL RES,NEW DELHI,"KAB-1, NEW DELHI 110012, INDIA",0019-5022,2394-3319,,INDIAN J AGR SCI,Indian J.

Results show that the recorded runoff series at ten key hydrometric stations on the major rivers in China are characterized by a general decreasing trend. A significant decrease has occurred at six stations: Yichang, Huayuankou, Guantai, Shixiali, Tieling and Haerbin stations, which are located on the northern major rivers. Abrupt changes in runoff series are detectable for the Yellow River (1986), the Hai River (1965 at Guantai station, 1970 at Shixiali station) and the Liao River (1965). The relationship between runoff and precipitation at these stations is different before and after the abrupt change. Intensive human activities, such as land use change, water conservation projects, water diversion projects and rapid increases in agricultural irrigation, are likely to be among the main causes of the abrupt changes in runoff. Effective strategies for water conservation and adaptation to climate change will be needed to ensure sustainable use of water resources and safeguard economic growth under China's 12th 5-year plan.","[Wang, G.

This paper evaluates the potential for storing water in the Bananal sedimentary basin and proposes the construction of canals to reduce sediment obstructions in the river flow and harmful flood events. This would allow for better control of the water level. The water stored in the sedimentary basin can be used as a climate change adaptation measure to ensure that the level of the flood plain is maintained high during a drought or low during an intense flood event. Additionally, the flood plain will function as a water reservoir, regulate the river flow downstream from the flood plain, and enhance hydropower generation. A significantly smaller reservoir area is expected to store water, as the water will be stored as groundwater in the sedimentary basin. Results show that the Bananal basin has the potential to store up to 49 km(3) of water, which can add up to 11.7 TWh of energy storage to the Brazilian energy matrix for a CAPEX energy storage cost of 0.095 USD/kWh.

In contrast, post-industrial countries in Europe and North America have introduced a number of good practices for GI-led brownfield regeneration. Using GI to revitalise post-industrial areas offers multiple benefits, ranging from ecosystem restoration and increased property values, to improvements in personal well-being, and can serve as an effective climate change adaptation solution. In Japan, nature has traditionally been used to protect the built environment from disaster; for example, preserving forests to prevent landslides, or sand or wind erosion on the coast. Although the application of GI is not a new idea in Japan, its role in revitalising brownfields and building communities has not been widely discussed. This paper explores the potential role of GI-led brownfield regeneration in Japan. Key barriers and drivers in revitalising post-industrial sites through the use of GI are identified using three case studies from the Osaka Bay Area, home to some of Japan's largest brownfield sites. The paper concludes with highlighting opportunities and challenges for disseminating the concept of GI-led regeneration in the Japanese context.","[Otsuka, Noriko] ILS Res Inst Reg & Urban Dev, Dortmund, Germany; [Otsuka, Noriko; Abe, Hirokazu; Isehara, Yuto] Osaka Univ, Cybermedia Ctr, Grad Sch Engn, Osaka, Japan; [Miyagawa, Tomoko] Wakayama Univ, Fac Syst Engn, Wakayama, Japan",Osaka University; Wakayama University,"Otsuka, N (corresponding author), ILS Res Inst Reg & Urban Dev gGmbH, Res Grp Mobil & Space, Bruderweg 22-24, D-44135 Dortmund, Germany.",noriko.otsuka@ils-forschung.de,,"Otsuka, Noriko/0000-0001-5171-5434",JSPS KAKENHI [JP6H04474],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP6H04474.,,62,2,2,4,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,NOV 2,2021,26,11,,,,,1346,1363,,10.1080/13549839.2021.1983791,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2021.1983791,,OCT 2021,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,WN3PQ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000704549700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study used 129 gridded monthly rainfall and temperature data of 32 years (1983-2014). The gridded rainfall and temperature records were encoded into GIS software and evaluated through different statistical and geospatial techniques. Mann-Kendal rank test and F distribution tests were used to test temporal and spatial statistical significance, respectively, of the data. The analysis revealed that Belg and Kiremt are the main rainfall seasons, constituting 81% of the annual rainfall. Although annual, Kiremt, and Belg rainfall amounts appear to have decreased over time, the decreasing trend is statistically significant only for Belg rainfall records. On the other hand, rainfall standard anomaly results indicated seven droughts of different magnitudes: one extreme, two severe, and four moderate. The study also revealed increasing temperature trends over the years under consideration that are statistically significant. The findings of this study on rainfall contradict other findings obtained around the study area. Thus, climate change adaptations need to focus on location-specific climate data analysis so that the intended adaptive interventions can be successful.","[Matewos, Tafesse] Hawassa Univ Ethiopia, IPDR, Awasa, Ethiopia; [Matewos, Tafesse] NMBU, As, Norway; [Tefera, Tewodros] Hawassa Univ, SEGDS, Hawassa, Ethiopia",Hawassa University; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Hawassa University,"Matewos, T (corresponding author), Hawassa Univ Ethiopia, IPDR, Awasa, Ethiopia.;Matewos, T (corresponding author), NMBU, As, Norway.",tafessemk@gmail.com,"Amede, Tewodros Tefera/AAT-2689-2021",,NORHED DEG project of NORAD,NORHED DEG project of NORAD,This work was supported by the NORHED DEG project of NORAD [1].,,36,10,10,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-3646,1930-0557,,PHYS GEOGR,Phys.

This paper describes some of the mitigation and adaptation entry points and challenges for city-relevant planning and policy-making posed by the processes defining urban greenhouse gas emissions, vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities. It finds that although many cities are already responding to the climate challenge, existing initiatives are fragmented and a piecemeal rather than a strategic approach is very common. Frequently mitigation and adaptation responses do not address many of the key drivers and determinants involved (e. g. consumption patterns and equity issues determining differentiated access to the determinants of adaptive capacity), nor do they fit with the issues they are intended to address. This is so because climate responses and the issues they are intended to address are multi-scale in nature because most of the processes involved operate at multiple sectoral, temporal and spatial levels. In the face of the complexity of the interconnected processes involved in the relationships between cities and climate change, it is not surprising that local authorities tend to move towards rhetoric rather than meaningful responses.","Resilient & Sustainable Cities Project Natl Ctr A, Boulder, CO USA",,"Romero-Lankao, P (corresponding author), Resilient & Sustainable Cities Project Natl Ctr A, Boulder, CO USA.",prlankao@ucar.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [0937777] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1134890] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,68,65,66,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-4313,1469-5944,,EUR PLAN STUD,Eur.

For this reason, a wide range of institutions, governments, and financial bodies are currently promoting the use of green infrastructure (GI) as an alternative or a complement to traditional grey infrastructure. A considerable amount of research already certifies the benefits and multi-functionality of GI: natural water retention measures (NWRMs), as GIs related specifically to the water sector are also known, are, for instance, a key instrument for the prevention and mitigation of extreme phenomena, such as floods and droughts. However, there are persisting difficulties in locating and identifying GI and one of the most promising solutions to this issue, the use of satellite-based data products, is hampered by a lack of well-grounded knowledge, experiences, and tools. To bridge this gap, we performed a review of the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) products, which consist of freely-available bio-geophysical indices covering the globe at mid-to-low spatial resolutions. Specifically, we focused on vegetation and energy indices, examining previous research works that made use of them and evaluating their current quality, aiming to define their potential for studying GI and especially NWRMs related to agriculture, forest, and hydro-morphology. NWRM benefits are also considered in the analysis, namely: (i) NWRM biophysical impacts (BPs), (ii) ecosystem services delivered by NWRMs (ESs), and (iii) policy objectives (POs) expressed by European Directives that NWRMs can help to achieve. The results of this study are meant to assist GI users in employing CGLS products and ease their decision-making process. Based on previous research experiences and the quality of the currently available versions, this analysis provides useful tools to identify which indices can be used to study several types of NWRMs, assess their benefits, and prioritize the most suitable ones.","[Taramelli, Andrea; Lissoni, Michele; Schiavon, Emma] IUSS, Palazzo Broletto,Piazza Vittoria 15, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Taramelli, Andrea; Valentini, Emiliana; Xuan, Alessandra Nguyen] Inst Environm Protect & Res ISPRA, Via Vitaliano Brancati 48, I-00144 Rome, Italy; [Piedelobo, Laura; Gonzalez-Aguilera, Diego] Univ Salamanca, Dept Cartog & Land Engn, Hornos Caleros 50, Avila 05003, Spain",IUSS PAVIA; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA); University of Salamanca,"Piedelobo, L (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Dept Cartog & Land Engn, Hornos Caleros 50, Avila 05003, Spain.",lau_pm@usal.es,,"TARAMELLI, Andrea/0000-0003-0865-4124; Schiavon, Emma/0000-0001-9573-4303; Piedelobo, Laura/0000-0002-6810-9438; Valentini, Emiliana/0000-0002-4257-7858; Gonzalez-Aguilera, Diego/0000-0002-8949-4216","European Commission, Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG-ECHO) [G.A.

One potential solution to improve forest resilience to drought may involve tree removal to reduce competition. To quantify potential benefits of partial cutting systems under drought, we use tree-ring data from a long-term partial cutting experiment in a dry ecosystem in western Canada, composed primarily of mature interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca). We ask: (1) How does tree removal change growth responses to drought and (2) how persistent are effects across multiple drought events? We compare growth responses in 83 trees up to 400 years in age from eight treatment units in a randomized experimental design representing a logging treatment with 25% basal area retention and a control (100% basal area retention). Retention harvesting was conducted in winter of 2002/2003 after a moderate drought in the summer of 2002. The site experienced a more severe drought in 2009 and a drought-heat event in 2015. In 2020, we obtained tree height and diameter data as well as tree increment cores from canopy dominant Douglas-fir, which were used to derive basal area increments. Based on these growth increments, we calculated four indices of resilience to drought. Growth increments of remaining individuals substantially increased after tree removal. Relative to the control, the low retention treatment expressed significantly higher post-drought growth increments compared to growth increments after the drought years of 2002 and 2009, i.e., higher drought recovery. Growth increments in the low retention treatment also had a significantly higher ability to regain pre-drought growth levels after the 2002 and 2009 droughts, i.e., higher drought resilience. However, the treatment did not show higher resilience under a heat-drought event in 2015. Although the treatment effects on drought response indices diminished over time, the absolute growth increments of residual trees remained higher than the control 17 years after harvest, despite repeated droughts. These results suggest that partial cutting on moisture-limited sites provides immediate and medium term benefits for remaining trees in terms of drought resilience, which may help forests adapt to climate change.","[Montwe, David; Standish, Audrey] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Forest Sci Ctr, Dept Forest Resources Management, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Isaac-Renton, Miriam] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Wood Fibre Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Axelson, Jodi] British Columbia Minist Forests, Forest Sci Planning & Pract Branch, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service,"Montwe, D (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Forest Sci Ctr, Dept Forest Resources Management, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",david.montwe@ubc.ca,,,,,,,79,0,0,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-893X,,FRONT FOR GLOB CHANG,Front.

However, knowledge about how climate change and variability affect mangrove ecosystem services (MES) and their role in supporting coastal communities to adaption is limited in Tanzania. We used participatory rural appraisal methods and field observations to explore local communities' perceptions of climate change and variability, and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) strategies in the mangroves of the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania. Decrease in rainfall, increased temperatures, coastal flooding, and the incidence of sea level rise were identified as key variables associated with a changing climate in the delta. Perceived climatic stresses included damaged fish breeding sites, altered climate regulation and a decrease in coastal protection and flood control. Decline in crop, fish and honey production were perceived as the main impacts on community livelihoods, although there were significant differences across occupational groups. Dependence on MES in times of shocks, such as when agriculture production fails, switching of occupation, crop diversification, fishing in deep waters and migration to other areas provided potential adaptation options. Although the reported perceptions related to climate change or variability are not explicit, they both have negative consequences to mangrove dependent communities' livelihoods.","[Nyangoko, Baraka P.; Berg, Hakan] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Stockholm, Sweden; [Nyangoko, Baraka P.; Mangora, Mwita M.; Shalli, Mwanahija S.] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Inst Marine Sci, Zanzibar, Tanzania; [Gullstrom, Martin] Sodertorn Univ, Sch Nat Sci Technol & Environm Studies, Huddinge, Sweden",Stockholm University; University of Dar es Salaam; Sodertorn University,"Nyangoko, BP (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Stockholm, Sweden.;Nyangoko, BP (corresponding author), Univ Dar Es Salaam, Inst Marine Sci, Zanzibar, Tanzania.",baraka.nyangoko@natgeo.su.se,"Nyangoko, Baraka/AGN-3006-2022","Nyangoko, Baraka/0000-0003-3341-638X; Berg, Hakan/0000-0003-3260-9710; Mangora, Mwita/0000-0002-9504-2718",Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) through the Bilateral Marine Science Program between Sweden,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) through the Bilateral Marine Science Program between Sweden,This research is drawn from a PhD study funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) through the Bilateral Marine Science Program between Sweden and Tanzania.,,70,4,4,7,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Results from a survey with 496 farmers show that nearly all farmers attributed changes in crop varieties and cropping patterns mainly to technological and market-related factors and not to climate change. A comparison between perceptions and meteorological data shows that while perceptions of changes in maximum temperatures did match observed trends, perceptions of changes in minimum temperature and rainfall did not. The results indicate that the climate change message in the past 30 years has not been definite enough to have a consistent impact on either farmers' perceptions or their farming practices. This may impede farmers' adaptive capacity in dealing with increasingly severe future climate change impacts. Because of large variations in the micro-climate of the study locations and the locations of the weather stations from which we obtained the meteorological data, the results need to be treated with caution. However, we suggest that for farmers to effectively adapt to climate change, it may be necessary for responsible state and non-state actors to improve their communication on expected climate change impacts.","[Budhathoki, Nanda Kaji; Zander, Kerstin K.] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT, Australia",Charles Darwin University,"Budhathoki, NK (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT, Australia.",nandakaji.budhathoki@cdu.edu.au,"Budhathoki, Nanda Kaji/GOV-6213-2022; Zander, Kerstin/M-2888-2013","Zander, Kerstin/0000-0002-2237-1801; Budhathoki, Nanda Kaji/0000-0002-4304-6696",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE) [SANDEE/2014-06],"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE)",We would like to acknowledge the 'Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship' for providing funding for this PhD.

Cl-36 was measured in 131 surface and groundwater samples in the Chari-Logone sub-catchment of the emblematic Lake Chad Basin, located in central Sahel. It was found that only 12 +/- 8% of the catchment is connected to the main rivers. Groundwater supporting rivers in the upper humid part of the catchment has a mean transit time of 9.5 +/- 1 years and a recharge rate of 240 +/- 170 mm yr(-1). In the lower Sahelian part of the catchment, stream-focused recharge yields recharge rates up to 78 +/- 7 mm yr(-1) in riparian groundwater against 16 +/- 27 mm yr(-1) elsewhere.

The concept emerged in 2010 at FAO and has now become popular. Different CSA practices can be found today and integrate its objectives differently. Agroecological practices aiming for a permanent soil cover, either with trees or crops, are among the most common CSA practices. CSA is also a wider approach allowing taking into account the challenge of climate change with innovative public policies and financing. Because it is defined by its objectives and not by the means to reach those objectives, the concept of CSA has also been questioned, especially regarding the possibility to reach its three objectives simultaneously and because of the risks to promote disguised productivism that would not respect the environment or the farmers. The 4% initiative << Soils for Food Security and Climate >> takes up the objectives of CSA and emphasizes the mitigation of climate change by increasing the carbon content of the soil. While the CSA concept has yet to prove itself, it is an innovative, climate-friendly approach to agriculture that is compatible with the challenges of climate change.","[Torquebiau, Emmanuel] CIRAD, UPR AIDA, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Torquebiau, Emmanuel] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, AIDA, Montpellier, France",CIRAD; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier,"Torquebiau, E (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR AIDA, F-34398 Montpellier, France.;Torquebiau, E (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, AIDA, Montpellier, France.",emmanuel.torquebiau@cirad.fr,,,,,,,30,2,2,7,40,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1777-5949,,,CAH AGRIC,Cah.

Given the vulnerabilities that affect agriculture and its role in national economies, GI can play an important role in managing trade-offs between conflicting ecosystem services. However, their use is still lagging behind, and socio-economic dynamics in their uptake in the agricultural sector are partially disregarded. The uncertainty involved in the modelling of ecological processes can be reduced through the use of participatory processes and the involvement of relevant stakeholders to sustain decision-making processes. This article intends to assess stakeholders' perceptions on the implementation of Green Infrastructures in agriculture by capturing critical barriers and facilitators. The implementation of such Green Infrastructures policies is associated to different climate change trends in order to understand the effect of different scenarios on rural development. The study uses fuzzy logic to elicit the stakeholders' needs. The key results show that when there is uncertainty in the state of climate change trends, it is always more efficient to adopt progressive policies investing in the development and diffusion of Green Infrastructures.","[Schiavon, Emma; Taramelli, Andrea] Ist Univ Studi Super Pavia IUSS, Piazza Vittoria 15, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Taramelli, Andrea; Tornato, Antonella] Inst Environm Protect & Res ISPRA, Via Vitaliano Brancati 48, I-00144 Rome, Italy",IUSS PAVIA; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA),"Schiavon, E (corresponding author), Via Luigi Porta 10, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",emma.schiavon@iusspavia.it; andrea.taramelli@iusspavia.it; antonella.tornato@isprambiente.it,,"Schiavon, Emma/0000-0001-9573-4303; Tornato, Antonella/0000-0003-2450-6375","EU DG ECHO project GREEN (Green infrastructures for disaster risk reduction protection: evidence, policy instruments and marketability) [ECHO/SUB/2016/740,172/PREV18]","EU DG ECHO project GREEN (Green infrastructures for disaster risk reduction protection: evidence, policy instruments and marketability)","This study has been partially funded by the EU DG ECHO project GREEN (Green infrastructures for disaster risk reduction protection: evidence, policy instruments and marketability; G.A.

It has a history of monarchical political systems built on undemocratic constitutional rules that have evolved over eight centuries (1153-1953) of recorded history. It established its first-ever democratic constitution in 2008. For politicians and environmentalists around the world, the Maldives is perhaps better known as islands drowning with the rising sea levels as a result of global warming. Since climate change is a cross-cutting development issue and affects every aspect of the Maldivian way of life and livelihoods, the Maldivian government attempted to address vulnerable sectors and defined several strategies that could prevent the country from the negative effects of climate change and sea level rise. In order to reach the mentioned goal, considering stakeholders' interaction is a key strategy in research and policy-making on climate change adaptation. Stakeholders are variously characterized as authorities, evaluators, watchdogs, local communities, etc. The government as a stakeholder and especially the president of the republic as the head of state who has a major role in decision-making on climate change will be considered in this article.","[Abolhasani, Afshin] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Environm & Earth Sci, I-20126 Milan, Lombardy, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Abolhasani, A (corresponding author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Environm & Earth Sci, I-20126 Milan, Lombardy, Italy.",A.abolhasani@campus.unimib.it,,,,,,,22,0,0,5,5,"REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOC, AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND SECTION",WOLLONGONG,"UNIV WOLLONGONG, PO BOX U236, WOLLONGONG, NSW 2500, AUSTRALIA",1030-7923,,,AUSTRALAS J REG STUD,Australas.

The results indicated that agricultural activities in rice and corn production in the Philippines remain male-dominated despite having a more visible women's participation in grain production, especially in rice, but quite limited in corn production. While women's participation are also seen in decision-making on livelihood activities and operationalization of the use of weather and climate information, tactical and strategic farm decisions, such decisions are still male-dominated. In female-headed households, female farmers take the lead in decision-making processes in the household related to unpaid activities and income-generating activities. Both female and male farmers share their knowledge and strategies towards climate change adaptation, although there are areas in which women tend to have lesser decision-making participation and responsibilities. However, as women acquire more knowledge about climate change.

This study investigates the impacts of rising sea levels on salinity intrusion in salt-wedge estuaries. The sea-level rise impacts are assessed in idealized estuaries using simple expressions derived from a two-layer hydraulic theory, and in the Neretva River Estuary in Croatia using a two-layer time-dependent model. The assessment is based on three indicators - the salt-wedge intrusion length, the seawater volume, and the river inflows needed to restore the baseline intrusion. The potential SLR was found to increase all three considered indicators. Theoretical analysis in idealized estuaries suggests that shallower estuaries are more sensitive to SLR. Numerical results for the Neretva River Estuary showed that SLR may increase salt-wedge intrusion length, volume, and corrective river inflow. However, the results are highly non-linear because of the channel geometry, especially for lower river inflows. A theoretical assessment of channel bed slope impacts on limiting a potential intrusion is therefore additionally discussed. This findings emphasize the need to use several different indicators when assessing SLR impacts.","[Krvavica, Nino; Ruzic, Igor] Univ Rijeka, Fac Civil Engn, Radmile Matejc 3, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Krvavica, N (corresponding author), Univ Rijeka, Fac Civil Engn, Radmile Matejc 3, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",nino.krvavica@uniri.hr,"Krvavica, Nino/N-7912-2018","Krvavica, Nino/0000-0001-5014-5476","University of Rijeka, Croatia [17.06.2.1.02, UNIRI-TECHNIC-18-54]","University of Rijeka, Croatia","This research was supported by the University of Rijeka, Croatia, grant number 17.06.2.1.02 Sea and river interaction in the context of climate change and UNIRI-TECHNIC-18-54 Hydrology of Water Resources and Identification of Risks from Floods and Mud Flows in Karst.",,54,24,25,2,17,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0272-7714,1096-0015,,ESTUAR COAST SHELF S,Estuar.

In this article I discuss the limitations of using the 'network' metaphor in transdisciplinary research practice and propose the use of a different metaphor to make transdisciplinary research encounters more attuned to difference. This research is informed by Tim Ingold's use of 'meshwork' as a metaphor for how life is lived along lines of becoming: emergent, indeterminate, contingent, historical, narrative. In this paper, my objective is to explain and illustrate by way of an example of a transdisciplinary climate change adaptation project the need for a new metaphor to convey the open-endedness of transdisciplinary research where subject positions are not conceived in advance of a research encounter, such as in the 'network' metaphor, but erupt in the interstices of research methods, objectives and desired outcomes. The meshwork metaphor implies that transdisciplinarity should be reframed as a practice of attunement to difference, becoming skilled in paying attention, witnessing, and responding to differences.","[Klenk, Nicole] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Scarborough, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough,"Klenk, N (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Scarborough, ON, Canada.",Nicole.klenk@utoronto.ca,"Klenk, Nicole/ABF-8239-2020","Klenk, Nicole Lisa/0000-0001-8224-6992",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This research was funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Partnership Development Grant: Living with Climate Change (2013-2015) and by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Insight Development Grant: Transdisciplinary Science-Policy Interfaces in Climate Change Adaptation Decision-Making (2017-2019).

The paper firstly establishes four fundamental social and environmental sustainability principles that have influenced ADB's new energy policy. These are (1) improving energy efficiency; (2) promoting renewable energy; (3) reducing energy poverty; and (4) enhancing climate change adaptation. These inform the policy's new four-fold implementation strategy of scaling up renewable energy, advocating efficiency, enhancing energy access to benefit livelihoods and improving energy sector governance. The study then investigates the historical genesis, drivers, and advantages and challenges facing three recent ADB energy projects: a $76.75 million biomass power plant in Thailand, a $32.6 million energy efficiency initiative in the Philippines, and a $153.5 million program for off-grid renewables in Vietnam. The final part of the study evaluates each of these cases based on how they embody each of the four sustainability principles that uphold the new energy policy. The paper concludes by distilling lessons and presenting general recommendations for planners at the ADB and in Asia more generally. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Rainfed vines (R0) were compared to three deficit irrigation regimes as a function of estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc): R25 (25% ETc), R50 (50% ETc), and R75 (75% ETc). Water was applied on a weekly basis whenever predawn water potential showed moderate water stress until 15 days prior to harvest. The results suggest that rainfed plants under these circumstances suffered, in general, a negative impact on vine performance, while moderate water stress had more favorable effects on fruit composition, as well as in yield.

Soil amendments with biochar have shown to be promising in achieving this goal; however, the evaluation of its long-term effects on forest soils has largely been neglected. To assess the advantages and drawbacks of biochar in forest soils, data from relict charcoal hearths (RCH) can be a potent tool as they show changes in soil properties after up to several hundred years. RCHs can be found in places of former metallurgical hot spots and their presence leaves characteristic formations identifiable on a large scale using laser detection technologies. Forest soils with biochar amendment show an increase in base cations, shift towards more alkaline pH, smaller bulk density and seem to be especially beneficial to hostile environments. Sites with favourable conditions may show little to no improvement or may even be adversely affected. Still, with proper investigation, areas with affordable feedstock materials and poor forest soils-such as spruce monocultures of Central Europe-may benefit from biochar amendments and continue to do so in the long term.","[Johanis, Hana; Tejnecky, Vaclav] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Food & Nat Resources, Fac Agrobiol, Dept Soil Sci & Soil Protect, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic; [Lehejcek, Jiri] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Logist & Crisis Management, Dept Environm Secur, Studentske Nam 1532, Uherske Hradiste 686 01, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Johanis, H (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Food & Nat Resources, Fac Agrobiol, Dept Soil Sci & Soil Protect, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic.",hurychova@af.czu.cz,"Lehejček, Jiří/AAR-9130-2021","Johanis, Hana/0000-0003-0269-714X",Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [TL02000160],Technology Agency of the Czech Republic,The research was supported by the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (project no.

With its promise to expand the scope of transformative human response within the adaptive dynamics of the social-ecological system, this approach is built upon the integration of the social and ecological, reflecting the 'pragmatic holism' at the heart of the concept of the ecological system. This vision is undercut, however, by an ambivalence about the agency of humans to effect adaptive change. I argue that this threatens to recoup the environmental determinism that characterised mid-20th-century theories of adaptation in geography and cognate disciplines - albeit in a new form defined by an understanding of agency as distributed and emergent that is associated with developments in cybernetics and complexity science. This article charts how the currently dominant discourse centred on adaptive capacity has come about and explores what it might mean for the politics of climate change adaptation, as the scope of human action is circumscribed by the adaptive dynamics of the social-ecological system.","[Adams, Sophie] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Adams, S (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Humanities & Languages, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",s.m.adams@unsw.edu.au,,"Adams, Sophie/0000-0002-6660-2640",,,,,142,3,3,4,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-1325,1477-0288,,PROG HUM GEOG,Prog.

Restrictions to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic produced a severe supply-side shock in rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, including through frictions in agricultural markets. We use a large-scale field experiment to examine the effects of improved on farm storage on household food security during COVID-19 restrictions. Based on text message survey data we find that the prevalence of food insecurity increased in control group households during COVID-19 restrictions (coinciding with the agricultural lean season). In treatment households, equipped with an improved on-farm storage technology and training in its use, food insecurity was lower during COVID-19 restrictions.

The findings are consistent with those of the literature on compliance and enforcement that any compliance and enforcement system must not only use deterrence, but also be perceived by fishers as being legitimate, fair, accountable and equitable and the need for developing a personal morality and a social environment that supports compliance. There is an opportunity to strategically build on shared value and cultural norms that can promote collaborative fisheries management as a mechanism to increase compliance through non-coercive efforts.

In this paper, we evaluate the evidence for this assertion by synthesizing the results of 34 published meta-analyses of the effects of such practices on soil physical and hydraulic properties relevant for climate change adaptation in European agriculture. We also review an additional 127 meta-analyses that investigated synergies and trade-offs or help to explain the effects of soil and crop management in terms of the underlying processes and mechanisms. Finally, we identify how responses to alternative soil-crop management systems vary under contrasting agro-environmental conditions across Europe. This information may help practitioners and policymakers to draw context-specific conclusions concerning the efficacy of management practices as climate adaptation tools. Our synthesis demonstrates that organic soil amendments and the adoption of practices that maintain continuous living cover result in significant benefits for the water regulation function of soils, mostly arising from the additional carbon inputs to soil and the stimulation of biological processes. These effects are clearly related to improved soil aggregation and enhanced bio-porosity, both of which reduce surface runoff and increase infiltration. One potentially negative consequence of these systems is a reduction in soil water storage and groundwater recharge, which may be problematic in dry climates. Some important synergies are reductions in nitrate leaching to groundwater and greenhouse gas emissions for nonleguminous cover crop systems. The benefits of reducing tillage intensity appear much less clear-cut. Increases in soil bulk density due to traffic compaction are commonly reported. However, biological activity is enhanced under reduced tillage intensity, which should improve soil structure and infiltration capacity and reduce surface runoff and the losses of agro-chemicals to surface water. However, the evidence for these beneficial effects is inconclusive, while significant trade-offs include yield penalties and increases in greenhouse gas emissions and the risks of leaching of pesticides and nitrate. Our synthesis also highlights important knowledge gaps on the effects of management practices on root growth and transpiration. Thus, conclusions related to the impacts of management on the crop water supply and other water regulation functions are necessarily based on inferences derived from proxy variables. Based on these knowledge gaps, we outlined several key avenues for future research on this topic.","[Blanchy, Guillaume; Garre, Sarah] Flanders Res Inst Agr Fisheries & Food ILVO, Burgemeester van Gansberghelaan 92-1, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium; [Bragato, Gilberto] Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Viticulture & Enol CREA VE, Via Trieste 23, I-34170 Gorizia, Italy; [Di Bene, Claudia] Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Agr & Environm CREA AA, Via Navicella 2-4, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Jarvis, Nicholas; Larsbo, Mats; Meurer, Katharina] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Environm, POB 7014, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Institute For Agricultural & Fisheries Research; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Garre, S (corresponding author), Flanders Res Inst Agr Fisheries & Food ILVO, Burgemeester van Gansberghelaan 92-1, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium.",sarah.garre@ilvo.vlaanderen.be,,"Jarvis, Nicholas/0000-0001-6725-6762",EU EJP SOIL project CLIMASOMA (Climate change adaptation through soil and crop management: synthesis and ways forward) with H2020 [862695],EU EJP SOIL project CLIMASOMA (Climate change adaptation through soil and crop management: synthesis and ways forward) with H2020,This research has been supported by the EU EJP SOIL project CLIMASOMA (Climate change adaptation through soil and crop management: synthesis and ways forward) with H2020 (grant no. 862695).,,115,0,0,26,26,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2199-3971,2199-398X,,SOIL-GERMANY,Soil,JAN 4,2023,9,1,,,,,,,,10.5194/soil-9-1-2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/soil-9-1-2023,,,20,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,7N4BD,,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000907285500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In an attempt to integrate environmental protections into the capability approach, Breena Holland developed the meta-capability Sustainable Ecological Capacity to establish substantive ecological limits. This article, however, empirically demonstrates that defining ecosystem thresholds in co-evolving systems is subject to conflict and continuous negotiation. Taking the Haringvliet dam in the Dutch South-West Delta as an illustrative case, this paper shows how people uphold different views about the Haringvliet's most desirable ecosystem state. Future shifts in the socio-ecological system, such as decreased fresh water availability and sea-level rise, are expected to uproot today's compromise about chloride levels in the Haringvliet. This suggests that anticipatory water management should not only address climate impacts, but also prepare for re-negotiations of established ecological thresholds. The associated politics of climate adaptation deals with questions about which functions to protect, at what costs and for whom. Hence, it is critical to integrate procedural justice and attention to political inequalities in capabilities-based adaptation justice frameworks.","[Brackel, Lieke] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Dept Values Technol & Innovat, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Brackel, L (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Dept Values Technol & Innovat, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",a.k.c.brackel@tudelft.nl,,"Brackel, Lieke/0000-0002-0353-1291",,,,,103,1,1,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2021,13,23,,,,,,,13072,10.3390/su132313072,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132313072,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XU9VA,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000734601900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The findings reveal a region with an intricate yet progressive trend toward adaptation policies, with each country showing different speeds and qualities of adoption. An increasing learning curve has allowed for the emergence of two generations of adaptation policies with several improved features, including horizontal and vertical coordination, monitoring systems, and the inclusion of heterogeneous instruments to implement these systems. Yet, institutional challenges outside the adaptation realm could hinder the progress attained, due to factors such as political and economic crisis and institutional fragility. Further research into the broader political and governance landscape is needed, focusing on if and how climate policies should address political instability and institutional fragility as vulnerability stressors.","[Segura, Luis D.; Van Zeijl-Rozema, Annemarie; Martens, Pim] Maastricht Univ, Int Ctr Integrated Assessment & Sustainable Dev, Kapoenstr 2, NL-6211 Maastricht, Limburg, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Segura, LD (corresponding author), Maastricht Univ, Int Ctr Integrated Assessment & Sustainable Dev, Kapoenstr 2, NL-6211 Maastricht, Limburg, Netherlands.",l.seguraramirez@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Martens, Pim/0000-0002-7489-0048",Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica [UNA-JCB-C1154-2017],Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica,"Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica, Grant/Award Number: UNA-JCB-C1154-2017",,88,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-7365,2041-7373,,LAT AM POLICY,Lat.

Pakistan is no exception to this effect and is ranked among the top 10 countries, which are most vulnerable to climate change. A huge upcoming challenge is to sustain an equilibrium among production and environmental protection. In this context, adaptation to climate change is considered as a win-win strategy for agriculture sectors in developing countries. However, numerous studies have focused on current farm-level adaptation while a scant interest has been shown on the role of physiological factors in the process of shaping small livestock herders' intentions towards environmental enrichment measures. A possible explanation of their lagging intentions is particular significance as they may comply with requisite climate adaptation measures or not. For deeper understanding, the current study investigates different psychological factors that affect the small livestock herder's intentions on adopting climate smart practices by using theory of planned behavior (TPB) with additional constructs (moral norms, risk perception, and social attributes). To this end, 405 small livestock herders from Punjab, Pakistan, were selected on the basis of multistage random sampling. The results of structural equation model showed that all constructs accounted for 57% of the variances in small livestock herders' adoption intentions. The outcome of this research offers a new indication regarding the interrelationship of numerous variables which are crucial to understand behavioral changes and psychological interventions. Overall attitude was the most prominent construct in the extended TPB model, which is mainly influenced by risk perception awareness. The results suggest that veterinary experts and extension agents should focus on psychological factors to explore different prospects to increase the involvement of livestock herders in environmental enrichment measures with little effort rather than tackling with traditional practices because it will be more likely to affect people's consideration of the external obstructions to act. Findings also offer public and private intervention for enabling technical and policy environment and strengthen social networks to keep livestock herders on track of updates of running government policies to ensure them to adopt climate change measures for their prosperous future.","[Faisal, Muhammad; Xia Chunping; Raza, Muhammad Haseeb] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Akhtar, Shoaib] Barani Agr Res Inst BARI, Ctr Excellence Olive Res & Training CEFORT, Chakwal, Punjab, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Tariq Iqbal] Govt Postgrad Coll, Dept Econ, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Ajmal, Muhammad Arslan] Govt Coll Univ, Dept Econ, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan",Huazhong Agricultural University; Government College University Faisalabad,"Xia, CP (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",faisalgurmani@gmail.com; xcp@mail.hzau.edu.cn; shoaibakhtar1799@gmail.com; tariqiqbal88@yahoo.com; arslan.gogo7@gmail.com,"Akhtar, Shoaib/AAC-9327-2022; Akhtar, Shoaib/AAZ-8279-2021; Raza, Muhammad Haseeb/AEP-9693-2022","Raza, Muhammad Haseeb/0000-0002-3555-1377",National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science of China [17BJY136],National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science of China,"This study is part of a Ph.D. research at Huazhong Agricultural University.

(2) Methodology: Separation distances are calculated for two Central European sites with considerable livestock activity influenced by different orographic and climatic conditions. Furthermore, two climate scenarios are considered, namely, the time period 1981-2010 (present climate) and the period 2036-2065 (future climate). Based on the provided climatic parameters, stability classes are derived as input for local-scale air pollution modelling. The separation distances are determined using the Lagrangian particle diffusion model LASAT. (3) Results: Main findings comprise the changes of stability classes between the present and the future climate and the resulting changes in the modelled odour impact. Model results based on different schemes for stability classification are compared. With respect to the selected climate scenarios and the variety of the stability schemes, a bandwidth of affected separation distances results.

While gradual climate change impacts have been the main focus of much recent research, much less is known about how SES are impacted by climate extremes and how they adapt. Here, based on an advanced conceptualization of social-ecological resilience, performed by an interdisciplinary group of scientists, we outline three major challenges for operationalizing the resilience concept with particular focus on climate extremes. First, we discuss the necessary steps required to identify and measure relevant variables for capturing the full response spectrum of the coupled social and ecological components of SES. Second, we examine how climate extreme impacts on coupling flows in SES can be quantified by learning from past societal transitions or adaptations to climate extremes and resulting changes in ecosystem service supply. Last, we explore how to identify management options for maintaining and enhancing social-ecological resilience under a changing regime of climate extremes. We conclude that multiple pathways within adaptation and mitigation strategies which enhance the adaptive capacity of SES to absorb climate extremes will open the way toward a sustainable future.","[Thonicke, Kirsten; Rammig, Anja] Leibniz Assoc, Res Dept 1 Earth Syst Anal, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Bahn, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Ecol, Innsbruck, Austria; [Lavorel, Sandra] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Lab Ecol Alpine, UMR 5553, CNRS,Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France; [Bardgett, Richard D.] Univ Manchester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Erb, Karlheinz] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Social Ecol, Vienna, Austria; [Giamberini, Mariasilvia] CNR, Inst Geosci & Earth Resources, Pisa, Italy; [Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Vollan, Bjoern] Philipps Univ Marburg, Sch Business & Econ, Marburg, Germany; [Rammig, Anja] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Innsbruck; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; University of Manchester; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse (IGG-CNR); Max Planck Society; Philipps University Marburg; Technical University of Munich","Thonicke, K (corresponding author), Leibniz Assoc, Res Dept 1 Earth Syst Anal, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany.",kirsten.thonicke@pik-potsdam.de,"Bahn, Michael/I-3536-2013; Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Vollan, Björn/AAN-9265-2020","Bahn, Michael/0000-0001-7482-9776; Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; Vollan, Björn/0000-0002-5592-4185",Austrian Academy of Sciences; BACI [H2020-EO-2014-640176]; Robert Bosch Stiftung [32.5.F082.0001.0/MA01]; BMBF [FKZ 01LP1610A]; Belmont Forum [FKZ 01LP1610A]; Bavarian Ministry of Science and the Arts; ERANet Sumforest project; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P28572] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),Austrian Academy of Sciences; BACI; Robert Bosch Stiftung; BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Belmont Forum; Bavarian Ministry of Science and the Arts; ERANet Sumforest project; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"The paper was kicked off at the Future Earth workshop Cross community workshop on Extreme Events and Environments from Climate to Society (E3S) in Berlin, 14-16 February 2016.

Low levels of natural resources and a high occurrence of natural disasters further add to the challenges faced by the country. The impacts of climate change are anticipated to exacerbate these existing stresses and constitute a serious impediment to poverty reduction and economic development. Ecosystems and biodiversity are important key sectors of the economy and natural resources of the country are selected as the most vulnerable to climate change. It is for these reasons that Bangladesh should prepare to conserve its natural resources under changed climatic conditions. Unfortunately, the development of specific strategies and policies to address the effects of climate change on the ecosystem and on biodiversity has not commenced in Bangladesh. Here, I present a detailed review of animal resources of Bangladesh, an outline of the major areas in zoological research to be integrated to adapt to climate change, and identified few components for each of the aforesaid areas in relation to the natural resource conservation and management in the country.","Rajshahi Univ, Dept Zool, Rajshahi 6205, Bangladesh",University of Rajshahi,"Das, BC (corresponding author), Rajshahi Univ, Dept Zool, Rajshahi 6205, Bangladesh.",bcdzool@yahoo.com,,,"Ministry of Science and Information & Communication Technology, Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh; University Grants Commission of Bangladesh","Ministry of Science and Information & Communication Technology, Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh; University Grants Commission of Bangladesh(University Grants Commission, India)","Thanks are due to the Chairman, Department of Zoology, Rajshahi University, for providing various facilities; to the Ministry of Science and Information & Communication Technology, Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh; and the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh for financial support.

Practical methods for narrowing the projection uncertainty remain elusive. Here, using large model ensembles, we show that the uncertainty in projections of future extratropical extreme precipitation is significantly correlated with the model representations of present-day precipitation variability. Models with weaker present-day precipitation variability tend to project larger increases in extreme precipitation occurrences under a given global warming increment. This relationship can be explained statistically using idealized distributions for precipitation. This emergent relationship provides a powerful constraint on future projections of extreme precipitation from observed present-day precipitation variability, which reduces projection uncertainty by 20-40% over extratropical regions. Because of the widespread impacts of extreme precipitation, this has not only provided useful insights into understanding uncertainties in current model projections, but is also expected to bring potential socio-economic benefits in climate change adaptation planning. This study finds that projections of future extreme precipitation can be made more reliable using a constraint from observed present-day precipitation variability, which reduces projection uncertainty by 20-40% over the extra-tropics.","[Zhang, Wenxia; Zhou, Tianjun; Chen, Xiaolong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Furtado, Kalli; Wu, Peili] Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Zhou, Tianjun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Met Office - UK; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhoutj@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"Chen, Xiaolong/AAO-7147-2020; Zhang, Wenxia/L-8394-2015; ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012","Chen, Xiaolong/0000-0003-4098-9952; Zhang, Wenxia/0000-0001-8614-8070; ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFA0608904]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41988101, 41905064]; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [134111KYSB20160031]; UK-China Research Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences; UK-China Research Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund,"The study is jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFA0608904), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41988101, 41905064), the International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (134111KYSB20160031), and the UK-China Research Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund.",,42,0,0,34,34,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",,2041-1723,,NAT COMMUN,Nat.

Frequent shifts in the atmospheric circulation patterns affect large parts of the globe, predominantly the arid and semi-arid regions facing severe to moderate droughts. Therefore, precursors of drought events and their associated mechanisms are important to understand. This study explores the possible cycles and precursor conditions that might be employed for predicting upcoming droughts in Pakistan. Standardize precipitation index and the single Z-index are used to detect and rank the drought years. Moreover, composite analysis is carried out to explore the large-scale circulation anomalies related to extreme drought events. Results demonstrate that extreme drought events are highly correlated with wind patterns and intrinsic weather system in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This study analyzed air temperature, sea level pressure and geopotential height in the average time-period of January to March, sea surface temperature from October to December, and wind vectors in March to May as precursors that could be employed to predict the occurrence of droughts in Pakistan.

As a case study, the degree of agreement (DOA) statistics for potential evapotranspiration (PET) was determined to compare the ordinary arithmetic mean ensemble (OAME) method and the surrogate weighted mean ensemble (SWME) method for three domains. Solar radiation was used as the surrogate variable to determine the weight values for the ensemble members. Singular vector decomposition with truncation values was used to select five ensemble members for the SWME method. The SWME method tended to have greater DOA statistics for PET than the OAME method with all available models. The distribution of PET values for the SWME method also had greater DOA statistics than that for the OAME method over relatively large spatial extent by month. These results suggest that the SWME method based on the weight value derived from the surrogate variable is suitable for exploiting both diversity and elitism to minimize the uncertainty of PET ensemble data. These findings could contribute to a better design of climate change adaptation options by improving confidence of PET projection data for the assessment of climate change impact on natural and agricultural ecosystems using the SWME method.","[Yoo, Byoung Hyun; Lee, Byun-Woo; Kim, Kwang Soo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kim, Junhwan] Rural Dev Adm, Crop Prod & Physiol Div, Natl Inst Crop Sci, Wonju 55365, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea; [Hoogenboom, Gerrit] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Hoogenboom, Gerrit] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Kim, Kwang Soo] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea","Seoul National University (SNU); Rural Development Administration (RDA), Republic of Korea; National Institute of Crop Science; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Seoul National University (SNU)","Kim, KS (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Kim, KS (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",luxwkang@snu.ac.kr,"Hoogenboom, Gerrit/F-3946-2010","Hoogenboom, Gerrit/0000-0002-1555-0537; Kim, Kwang Soo/0000-0003-2284-4389","Korea Ministry of Environment and Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea [2014001310008, PJ013452042019]","Korea Ministry of Environment and Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea","This study was supported by the Korea Ministry of Environment and Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea, under Climate Change Correspondence Program (2014001310008) and Cooperative Research for Agriculture Science & Technology Development (PJ013452042019) programs, respectively.

In this paper, we take a different perspective by turning our eyes upon Finland, a Nordic welfare state and a low vulnerability and exposure society. We analyse and discuss how well the existing DRR and CCA approaches reflect the perspective of the least vulnerable countries and whether the current ways of determining vulnerability and exposure neglect some risks or hinder the seizing opportunities brought by climate change. This paper is based on data gathered in a survey, interviews and workshops in two research projects which analysed weather and climate related risks in Finland. We conclude that disaster risk assessments need to be contingent and account for social and economic contexts. In an institutionally well-functioning welfare society, vulnerability assessments should emphasize relative changes in perceived social trends and social cohesion. Exposure should not be limited to direct geographical or physical exposure to local natural hazards. Successful opportunity identification can help improve DRR at home and abroad. In general, the role of political systems and culture as enabling factors for DRR and CCA need further study.","[Pilli-Sihvola, Karoliina; Harjanne, Atte; Haavisto, Riina] Finnish Meteorol Inst, POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Pilli-Sihvola, Karoliina] Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Helsinki, Finland; [Harjanne, Atte] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, POB 21210, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland",Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Helsinki; Aalto University,"Pilli-Sihvola, K (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland.",karoliina.pilli-sihvola@fmi.fi,,"Haavisto, Riina/0000-0002-1052-783X",,,,,89,9,9,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

In this paper, we discuss three cases from the South Pacific to explain the ways anticipated climate futures are changing mobility in the present. First, we examine village relocation in response to coastal erosion and inundation in Fiji, drawing on our study of the unfolding experience of Narikoso village in Kadavu Province. In contrast to this spatially constrained process of permanent relocation, we examine the spatially extended yet temporally constrained seasonal migrant worker programme that aims to support economic development in the Pacific Islands by providing temporary work visas in Australia and New Zealand. Finally, we examine the likely effects of proposed open labour markets as a means to promote climate change adaptation, through a study of the analogous example of Niuean migration to New Zealand which has resulted in both permanent migration and a slow circulation of people between both countries. Across these examples, we highlight emerging and potentially constructive ways in which climate change is altering the spatio-temporal patterns and rhythms of mobility.","[Barnett, Jon; McMichael, Celia] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, 221 Bouverie St, Melbourne, Vic 3053, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Barnett, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, 221 Bouverie St, Melbourne, Vic 3053, Australia.",jbarn@unimelb.edu.au; celia.mcmichael@unimelb.edu.au,"Barnett, Jon/AAQ-9002-2021; mcmichael, celia/ABD-3118-2020","Barnett, Jon/0000-0002-0862-0808; mcmichael, celia/0000-0002-4572-602X",,,,,98,37,38,1,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0199-0039,1573-7810,,POPUL ENVIRON,Popul.

This study evaluates the various ecosystem services provided by terraced landscape under olive production in northern Istria. Terraced landscapes are multifunctional; they work against land degradation and preserve soil water for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Furthermore, terraced landscapes, particularly in distant areas, are disconnected from the more populated areas directly connected to the coast, and they face land abandonment, poor maintenance, and overgrowing issues. However, positive change is increasing in terraced areas used for olive orchards. This is in part due to the demand for Slovenian olive oil. Furthermore, the value of terraced landscapes with olive orchards and their part in the preservation of biodiversity is recognized in other sectors. As a cultivated cultural landscape element, olive orchards on terraces play important roles in tourism and provide much needed added value for tourist farms.","[Zupanc, Vesna; Pintar, Marina; Podgornik, Maja] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Jamnikarjeva 101, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Zupanc, V (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Jamnikarjeva 101, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",vesna.zupanc@bf.uni-lj.si,"Zupanc, Vesna/AAD-6146-2019","Zupanc, Vesna/0000-0002-1057-8442",ARRS research program [P4-0085],ARRS research program(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),This research has been supported by ARRS research program P4-0085 Agroecosystems.

Adaptive reuse is an efficient way to reuse existing buildings that have become obsolete by 'recycling' them in-situ through giving them a new functional purpose. In this paper, using Hong Kong as a case study of dense urban development with immense redevelopment pressure, adaptive reuse potential (ARP) modelling is deployed to test the processes underway in Hong Kong for the adaptive reuse of 14 existing publicly owned historic buildings with various degrees of heritage protection, and rank these buildings to determine the most effective time to undertake adaptive reuse intervention. The best and worst projects are then investigated in further detail to provide insight into the validity of the modelling process. This research illustrates that the ARP model works well for the two in-depth studies, and recommends further use of this technique by government authorities to help manage the daunting task of where best to prioritize its resources for heritage protection.

Since the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka is one of the most vulnerable to climate change, a thorough understanding of climate transition is critical for formulating effective adaptation strategies. This article provides an overview of the status of climate change and adaptation in the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka. The review clearly indicates that climate change is taking place in Sri Lanka in terms of rainfall variability and an increase in climate extremes and warming. A number of planned and reactive adaptation responses stemming from policy and farm-level decisions are reported. These adaptation efforts were fragmented and lacked a coherent connection to the national development policies and strategies. Research efforts are needed to develop and identify adaptation approaches and practices that are feasible for smallholder farmers, particularly in the dry zone where paddy and other food crops are predominately cultivated. To achieve the envisaged growth in the agricultural sector, rigorous efforts are necessary to mainstream climate change adaptation into national development policies and ensure that they are implemented at national, regional and local levels.","[Esham, Mohamed] Sabaragamuwa Univ Sri Lanka, Dept Agribusiness Management, Belihuloya 70140, Sri Lanka; [Garforth, Chris] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka; University of Reading,"Esham, M (corresponding author), Sabaragamuwa Univ Sri Lanka, Dept Agribusiness Management, POB 02, Belihuloya 70140, Sri Lanka.",esham@susl.lk,"Esham, Mohamed/D-1171-2012; Esham, Mohamed/M-7169-2019","Esham, Mohamed/0000-0002-4498-9274; Esham, Mohamed/0000-0002-4498-9274",,,,,98,23,24,4,70,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Public open space in urban areas, although having a vital role to play under conditions of climate change, is already a contested policy area. Using the field of outdoor thermal comfort as an example of current adaptive behaviour, the paper reports on a study that examined the perceptions of thermal comfort of different users of public spaces in Manchester. It considers the implications of climate change scenarios for the ability to maintain thermal comfort in open spaces and examines the scope for physical intervention, such as through urban and built form design, to build adaptive capacity. However, it also explores possible scenarios of urban life under conditions of climate change and concludes that socio-economic determinants of access to and management of open space are likely to be of critical significance in delivering adaptation options, which are accessible to all and meet objectives of social justice.","[Wilson, Elizabeth; Nicol, Fergus; Nanayakkara, Leyon] Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Built Environm, Oxford OX3 0BP, England",Oxford Brookes University,"Wilson, E (corresponding author), Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Built Environm, Gipsy Lane, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.",ebwilson@brookes.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,25,26,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1523-908X,,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

This paper examines the factors that lead U.S. state governments to develop comprehensive adaptation plans. Using an event history analysis, we find that a state is more likely to engage in adaptation planning we find that a state is more likely to engage in adaptation planning when it experienced more extreme weather events recently, has more economic activities in coastal regions, or when it has high levels of incomes and civic engagement. We also show that political ideology plays a critical role in subnational adaptation decision making. A state is less likely to pursue adaptation planning when it has a Republican governor or has a lack of preference for environmental legislations. In addition to the internal characteristics, our study further provides evidence of the external influence from other nearby adapting states through spatial policy diffusion.

We combine a traditional literature review with data mining procedures applied to bibliographic databases to reconstruct the history of the concept within various research topics, showing its evolution and convergences over time. To do that, we integrate different methods combining machine learning algorithms with network and cluster analyses to examine a set of 3757 articles, analysing their distinctive features and similarities on the basis of their contents as well as co-authorships. Bibliometric analyses enable the identification of different communities of articles, pinpointing key papers and authors, while literature review makes it possible to assess the concept of vulnerability evolved within and beyond research communities and scientific networks. Moreover, this work examines the role played by documents published by UN institutions (UNDRO, UNISDR, IPCC) in contributing to the evolution of vulnerability and related concepts. Results show that signs of convergence are evident between the two research streams, and that the IPCC reports have played a major role in proposing solutions for unifying definitions of vulnerability. We observe that the phases of preparation of the IPCC reports are very rich in methodological and terminological developments, while after publication, the literature shows evident signs of propagation of the proposed concepts. The DRR research stream developed before the research stream on CCA, but the latter flourished rapidly and became much larger in terms of number of publications. Nevertheless, in terms of contents, adaptation studies and the IPCC have shown increasing adoption of the concepts developed within the disaster research stream, in particular with regard to the interpretation of vulnerability as one of the dimensions of risk.","[Giupponi, Carlo] Ca Foscari Univ, Venice Ctr Climate Studies, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy; [Biscaro, Claudio] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Org & Global Management Studies, A-4040 Linz, Austria",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Giupponi, C (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ, Venice Ctr Climate Studies, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy.",cgiupponi@unive.it; Claudio.Biscaro@jku.at,"Giupponi, Carlo/E-5895-2012; Biscaro, Claudio/W-4501-2017","Giupponi, Carlo/0000-0001-5358-9208; Biscaro, Claudio/0000-0003-2928-1945","European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, KULTURisk Project [FP7-ENV.2010.1.3.2-1-265280]","European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, KULTURisk Project","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, KULTURisk Project (FP7-ENV.2010.1.3.2-1-265280).

Are adaptation strategies based upon island-centric principles more successful than those originating from a more continental point of view? This research examined the principles of island-centric thinking using an island-centric lens by which to determine 'successful' climate adaptation planning. The findings illustrate a statistically significant relationship between PSIS that have higher nissological (island-centric) levels displayed within their climate change action plans (CCAPs) and CCAPs that were found to be more successful. In other words, highly nissological states are forecasted to be more successful in planning for the current and future impacts of climate change than those with lower nissological scores. In total, nissology explains approximately 28.37% of a PSIS's success. The policy relevance is rooted in the unique cultural, geographical, and social aspects of islands. Findings are applicable to other islands as well countries that share islander-based qualities.

However, seasonal forecasts from global climate models are found to poorly reproduce temperature trends in observations. Furthermore, this problem is not addressed by existing forecast postprocessing methods that are needed to remedy biases and uncertainties in model forecasts. The inability of the forecasts to reproduce the trends severely undermines user confidence in the forecasts. In our previous work, we proposed a new statistical postprocessing model that counteracted departures in trends of model forecasts from observations. Here, we further extend this trend-aware forecast postprocessing methodology to carefully treat the trend uncertainty associated with the sampling variability due to limited data records. This new methodology is validated on forecasting seasonal averages of daily maximum and minimum temperatures for Australia based on the SEAS5 climate model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The resulting postprocessed forecasts are shown to have proper trends embedded, leading to greater accuracy in regions with significant trends. The application of this new forecast postprocessing is expected to boost user confidence in seasonal climate forecasts.","[Shao, Yawen; Wang, Quan J.; Ryu, Dongryeol] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Schepen, Andrew] CSIRO Land & Water, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Melbourne; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Shao, YW (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",yawens@student.unimelb.edu.au,,"Shao, Yawen/0000-0002-9938-669X",Australian Research Council [LP170100922]; Australian Research Council [LP170100922] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),We thank the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for supplying the SEAS5 forecast data.

However, as this paper argues, technocratic and de-politicised discourses of climate change have often been invoked to conceal underlying political agendas in which environmental concerns are drawn upon to justify unfavourable government policies of mobility and resettlement. This paper examines the politics of climate change discourse through an analysis of resettlement policies in the Maldives where the government is proposing the consolidation of a population dispersed over 200 islands onto 10-15 islands. However, this initiative is not new. The government has long thought it economically, rather than environmentally, unsustainable to provide services and resources to a dispersed population, and has for many years muted policies to move people in order to reduce the costs on government. Today, the same initiatives are gaining renewed leverage by being couched in environmental terms.

Climate change is expected to disproportionately affect smallholder farmers and make their livelihoods even more precarious; however, there is limited information on their overall vulnerability and adaptation needs. We conducted surveys of 600 households in Madagascar to characterize the vulnerability of smallholder farmers, identify how farmers cope with risks and explore what strategies are needed to help them adapt to climate change. Malagasy farmers are particularly vulnerable to any shocks to their agricultural system owing to their high dependence on agriculture for their livelihoods, chronic food insecurity, physical isolation and lack of access to formal safety nets. Farmers are frequently exposed to pest and disease outbreaks and extreme weather events (particularly cyclones), which cause significant crop and income losses and exacerbate food insecurity. Although farmers use a variety of risk-coping strategies, these are insufficient to prevent them from remaining food insecure. Few farmers have adjusted their farming strategies in response to climate change, owing to limited resources and capacity. Urgent technical, financial and institutional support is needed to improve the agricultural production and food security of Malagasy farmers and make their livelihoods resilient to climate change.","[Harvey, Celia A.; Rao, Nalini S.; Dave, Radhika] Conservat Int, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Rakotobe, Zo Lalaina; Rajaofara, Haingo; MacKinnon, James L.] Conservat Int Madagascar, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar; [Razafimahatratra, Hery] Univ Antananarivo, High Sch Agr Sci, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Rabarijohn, Rivo Hasinandrianina] IDACC Assoc, Bis Ankatso Nord Antanan 101, Madagascar",Conservation International; University Antananarivo,"Harvey, CA (corresponding author), Conservat Int, 2011 Crystal Dr Suite 500, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",charvey@conservation.org,,"Harvey, Celia A./0000-0001-8015-703X",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council [1138326] Funding Source: researchfish,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This paper is based on research funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

A case study was prepared using data from the Sao Francisco Hydroelectric Company (CHESF), the largest hydroelectric power generator in Brazil's Northeast region. It is essential to understand how the leading energy company in the region is preparing to address these problems involving economic impacts resulting from the environmental effects of climate change. Two prospective methodologies were used to select the variables and construct a SWOT matrix, and their respective scenarios: A Panel of Experts and the Delphi Method. The methodologies used allow for four (4) distinct scenarios to be inferred for CHESF up until 2050: Development, Growth, Survival and Decline. The analyses of these scenarios concluded that CHESF's main risk from climate change is the possible reduction of water flow and reservoir levels, which could threaten energy security throughout the country if certain preventative adaptations to climate change are not implemented.

Climate change may affect health through a range of pathways, for example as a result of increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, reduction in cold related deaths, increased floods and droughts, changes in the distribution of vector-borne diseases and effects on the risk of disasters and malnutrition. The overall balance of effects on health is likely to be negative and populations in low-income countries are likely to be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects. The experience of the 2003 heat wave in Europe shows that high-income countries may also be adversely affected. Adaptation to climate change requires public health strategies and improved surveillance. Mitigation of climate change by reducing the use of fossil fuels and increasing a number of uses of the renewable energy technologies should improve health in the near-term by reducing exposure to air pollution.

This study examines the effects of, and farmer's perceptions of, climate change on farming practices for cassava and maize in Lagos, Nigeria. Analysis of weather data from 1998 to 2018 (the most recent available) reveals little impact on cassava yield but a significant impact on maize yield. Furthermore, survey results indicate that farmers in this area are currently implementing techniques to adapt to changes in climate based on the type of crop grown. Agriculture in Lagos, Nigeria, is largely rain-fed and climate change negatively impacts crop productivity by decreasing crop yield and soil fertility, limiting the availability of soil water, increasing soil erosion, and contributing to the spread of pests. A decline in crop production due to climate change may be further exasperated by a lack of access to farming technology that reduces over-reliance on the rain-fed farming system and subsistence agriculture. This study indicates that there is a need for initiatives to motivate young and older farmers through access to credits, irrigation facilities, and innovative climate change adaptive strategies.","[Tajudeen, Tawakalitu Titilayo; Rathbun, Leah.

Retailers and consumers are more aware of the environmental impact and provenance of food and are demanding to their suppliers to implement sustainable agricultural practices. Seven horticultural farmers and farm managers across the UK were interviewed to investigate the implementation of sustainable practices, and the motivations and enablers for adoption, as well as perceptions on sustainability and climate change. Factors influencing adoption mainly were efficiency and cost reduction, regulations, and market demand, even though, environmental, and social consciousness also played a role in adoption. There was little evidence that participation in knowledge networks or the perception of climate change and impacts, and of carbon footprint assessments influenced the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, but this finding deserves further investigation. Farmers' awareness of the importance of soil was clear and governments should encourage farmers' involvement in the monitoring of soil health, as a mean of engaging them in the wider discussion about the implementation of sustainable land management, including climate change adaptation and mitigation.","[Feliciano, Diana] Teesside Univ, Int Business Sch, Middlesbrough, England; [Feliciano, Diana] Teesside Univ, Int Business Sch, Middlesbrough TS1 3BX, England",University of Teesside; University of Teesside,"Feliciano, D (corresponding author), Teesside Univ, Int Business Sch, Middlesbrough TS1 3BX, England.",d.feliciano@tees.ac.uk,"Feliciano, Diana/HPD-8866-2023",,UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC);  [NE/N005619/1],UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); ,The UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) has funded this research Project NE/N005619/1,,80,1,1,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1470-2541,1751-665X,,SCOT GEOGR J,Scott.

This paper uses a series of indicators reflecting national capability and national necessity for NBS as a means to support DRR activities. Using both Principal Components Analysis and Cluster Analysis results show that of a total of 178 countries, two groups emerge; with countries in one group showing high levels of both national capability and necessity for NBS. Such countries are also found to be around 23 % more likely to be currently implementing disaster risk reduction actions than countries with lower capability and necessity scores, showing that NBS are actively supporting DRR activities around the world. Such countries are a mixture of Global South and North countries while showing no statistical significant differences with respect to socio-economic characteristics, indicating that NBS can be equitable means of achieving potential synergies between DRR-reducing NBS and grey infrastructure projects for climate change adaptation measures.","[Tyllianakis, Emmanouil; Martin-Ortega, Julia] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9TJ, England; [Banwart, Steven A.] Univ Leeds, Global Food & Environm Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Tyllianakis, E (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9TJ, England.",E.tyllianakis@leeds.ac.uk,,"Tyllianakis, Emmanouil/0000-0002-8604-4770",European Union [730338],European Union(European Commission),"This paper has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, Call H2020-SC5-2016-2017 Greening the economy, under grant agreement No 730338.",,82,3,3,11,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

The results identified overgrazing, soil erosion, land degradation, surface and groundwater supply, and land use management as the main ecological vulnerability variables. The results showed that climate is not necessarily linked to ecological vulnerability. High rain fall districts in this study showed higher ecological vulnerability to drought because of poor planning and management of water supply, poor grazing practices and land management that leads to serious land degradation. The identification and analysis of ecological vulnerability indicators to drought would aid in reconsidering priorities for the government to implement appropriate policy measures in response to drought and suggest strategies to reduce drought vulnerability.

However, since the 1980s, Northeast China has experienced significant warming with annual mean temperature rising by 1.0-2.5 degrees C. The increase of accumulated temperature, the extension of the growth period and the recession of summer cool disasters all contributed to improved conditions for crop growth and led to a northward movement of the agricultural climate zone. In addition, the adaptation to warming including the adjustment of crop composition and structure as well as the adoption of advanced technologies greatly facilitated agricultural development.

We surveyed five hundred farm households from both flood-affected and unaffected villages to investigate the factors driving the uptake of the following autonomous flood adaptations: plinth elevation, grain storage, participation in communal flood preparations and the creation of edge-of-field tree lined shelterbelts. We used both binary and multivariate probit regressions to investigate the correlation across adaptation options. Empirical results suggest that access to agricultural extension services, off-farm work opportunities, past duration of standing floodwaters, farm to river distance, receiving post-flooding support and tribal diversity are the main drivers of flood adaptations. Moreover, we report the complementary uptake of adaptations in pairs. Given the prediction of climate change-driven flooding in the Hindu Kush, we recommend cost-effective policies that increase the resilience of vulnerable agricultural-dependent rural communities.

It draws on a broad literature to address two interrelated goals-first, to align regenerative development and design with the necessary bottom-up adaptation strategies and human agency, and second, to identify new, broader possible roles of buildings and responsibilities of design professionals. This required a comparison of current green building and emerging regenerative approaches and identifying the relevant characteristics of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. The paper accepts that adaptation to climate change will, to a large extent, depend on people's day-to-day actions in the places they live, and argues that the built environment will have to be infused with the capability to enable inhabitants' greater agency.

This paper presents a new spatial-temporal rainstorm generator for generating simultaneous rainfall processes at numerous locations considering the spatial correlation among these locations and interpolating the point processes into an areal rain field. The generator is able to include the effect of climate change by adjusting the parameters of the marginal distributions of variables constituting rainfall events. A case study on the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA), one of the regions that are most prone to storm-related disasters in the world, is presented. The performance of the proposed generator is excellent in reproducing the historical statistical characteristics of regional rainfall. The model is adapted to climate change through extrapolation of the variation trend of the model parameters in the observation period to explore possible future scenarios of regional rainfall in GBA. The simulation results indicate a significant increase in rainfall extremes, especially for short-duration rainfall, at the end of 21st century in GBA.","[Qiang, Yejia; Zhang, Limin; Xiao, Te] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Qiang, Yejia; Zhang, Limin; Xiao, Te] HKUST Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yqiang@connect.ust.hk; cezhangl@ust.hk; xiaote@ust.hk,"Zhang, Li-Min/G-9891-2011; Xiao, Te/F-5958-2014","Zhang, Li-Min/0000-0001-7208-5515; Xiao, Te/0000-0003-4935-892X","Science and Technology Plan of Shenzhen, China [JCYJ20180507183854827]; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR Government [16206217]","Science and Technology Plan of Shenzhen, China; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR Government(Hong Kong Research Grants Council)","This work was supported by the Science and Technology Plan of Shenzhen, China (Project No. JCYJ20180507183854827) and the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR Government (Project Nos.

Several methods can estimate the amount of snow throughout a mountain range: (1) Spatial interpolation from surface sensors constrained by remotely sensed snow extent provides a consistent answer, with uncertainty related to extrapolation to unrepresented locations. (2) The remotely sensed date of disappearance of snow is combined with a melt calculation to reconstruct the SWE back to the last significant snowfall. (3) Passive microwave sensors offer real-time global SWE estimates but suffer from several problems like subpixel variability in the mountains. (4) A numerical model combined with assimilated surface observations produces SWE at 1-km resolution at continental scales, but depends heavily on a surface network. (5) New methods continue to be explored, for example, airborne LiDAR altimetry provides direct measurements of snow depth, which are combined with modelled snow density to estimate SWE. While the problem is aggressively addressed, the right answer remains elusive. Good characterization of the snow is necessary to make informed choices about water resources and adaptation to climate change and variability.

Currently, many SIDS are engaged in large-scale vulnerability assessments that aim to identify, analyse, and inform solutions to mitigate climate change-related impacts. Many of these assessments, while useful, place little emphasis on the local stakeholders' perceptions of climate change. One such Caribbean community impacted by climate-related change is Providence Island in Colombia. Using a vulnerability assessment framework (Marshall, P.A. et al. 2010. A framework for social adaptation to climate change: sustaining tropical coastal communities and industries. Gland: IUCN Publication Services), researchers interviewed island residents (N = 23) about their perceptions of climate change, impacts on the local environment, and how the island community may adapt. All interviews were transcribed and analysed using a priori and open coding to identify patterns of and relationships between stakeholders' responses. Results indicate that local perceptions of climate change are linked to (1) environmental knowledge, (2) environmental awareness, attitudes, and beliefs, and (3) perceptions of risk.

This study aims to (1) investigate walnut ecophysiology by comparing its attributes to associated deciduous angiosperms, (2) address potential acclimation of walnut to climate change, and (3) identify areas for prioritization in future research. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the magnitude of potential effects of climate change on walnut. Some studies tend to indicate walnut could be negatively impacted by climate change, while others do not. Walnut may be at a disadvantage due to its susceptibility to drought and frost injury in current growing regions given the projected increases in temperature and extreme climatic events. Other regions that are currently considered cold for walnut growth may see increased establishment and growth depending upon the rate of temperature increase and the frequency and severity of extreme climatic events. Research investigating a combination of environmental factors, such as temperature, carbon dioxide, ozone, water, and nitrogen is needed to (1) better project climate change effects on walnut and (2) develop management strategies for walnut acclimation and adaptation to climate change.","[Gauthier, Martin-Michel; Jacobs, Douglass F.] Purdue Univ, Hardwood Tree Improvement & Regenerat Ctr, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Jacobs, DF (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Hardwood Tree Improvement & Regenerat Ctr, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 715 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",djacobs@purdue.edu,"Gauthier, Martin-Michel/I-1833-2019; Gauthier, Martin-Michel/A-9787-2014","Gauthier, Martin-Michel/0000-0002-4757-5288; Gauthier, Martin-Michel/0000-0002-4757-5288; Jacobs, Douglass/0000-0002-5580-2516",Frederick M. van Eck Foundation of the Hardwood Tree Improvement and Regeneration Center; Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue University,Frederick M. van Eck Foundation of the Hardwood Tree Improvement and Regeneration Center; Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue University,The Frederick M. van Eck Foundation of the Hardwood Tree Improvement and Regeneration Center and the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue University provided financial support.,,127,33,34,5,87,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Mainstreaming climate adaptation into policy landscape is a must for achieving the pathway to sustainable development. The approach envisages grass-root and climate perspectives to bring about developmental interventions for rural poor and small farm holders. Even though macro-level planning is necessary and useful, the coping mechanisms across different socio-economic and agro-climatic settings should be recommended at micro-level especially in developing nations. Responses of resource poor farmers to weather abnormalities are often rendered ineffective on account of several barriers to adaptation. Keeping this in view, we attempted to review the potential strategies adopted by the farmers, with a greater focus on constraints to adaptation in order to feed into the policy options of the Government. The authors articulate that the micro-level inferences from natural resource management, agriculture research and development, infrastructure and human capital across the space should be integral part of the climate adaptation planning. Moreover, the paper demonstrates how the developmental interventions spread across different verticals of the government can mutually address both the rural development and climate adaptation considerations. It is also construed that strengthening the role and capacity of local institutions in assembling grass-root information and in implementation of programmes is crucial for effectively addressing vulnerability to both the climatic and non-climatic factors. In nutshell, the paper aims at assisting development practitioners and policymakers in devising an effective approach towards mainstreaming climate adaptation in the existing rural developmental architecture.","[Singh, Naveen P.; Anand, Bhawna; Singh, Surendra; Khan, Arshad] ICAR Natl Inst Agr Econ & Policy Res NIAP, New Delhi 110012, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Institute of Agricultural Economics & Policy Research,"Singh, NP (corresponding author), ICAR Natl Inst Agr Econ & Policy Res NIAP, New Delhi 110012, India.",naveenpsingh@gmail.com,"Khan, Mohd Arshad/AAO-5674-2021; NIAP, LIBRARY ICAR/ABB-6258-2020; SINGH, SURENDRA/AAO-8466-2020","Khan, Mohd Arshad/0000-0002-7952-4565; SINGH, SURENDRA/0000-0002-3199-156X; , Bhawna/0000-0001-9615-1433",,,,,112,13,14,1,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

The widespread rise in warm nights (TN90p; 0.31-1.67 days year(-1)), reduced daily rainfall intensity (SDII), and changes in other weather extremes, viz. temperature and precipitation extremes, signified clear signals on regional atmospheric warming across eastern India. The agro-ecological regions under extended Bramhaputra valley and coastal belts of south Bengal experienced the most persistent shifts in temperature extremes, while the upper Himalayan range extended from North Bengal to Arunachal Pradesh experienced the steepest decline in average daily rainfall intensity and other absolute quantitative estimates of precipitation extremes over past five decades. Together with El Nino and La Nina events, large-scale global atmospheric circulations particularly expansion of warmer Pacific Warm Pool (PWP) and changes in Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) contributed to the periodic dynamics in weather extreme occurrences from monthly to annual time scale over eastern India.

Furthermore, value of disparate coastal ocean observations can be unlocked with multi-dimensional integration on fitness-for-the-purpose, parameter and instrumental. Integration of operational monitoring with offline monitoring programs, such as those for research, ecosystem-based management and commercial purposes, is necessary to fill the gaps. Such integration should lead to a system of networks which can deliver data for all kinds of purposes.

Particularly in industrialized countries pollinator diversity is in decline. The bulk of research is on entomological or plant-pollinator network related topics, but the broad range of impacts of pollinator loss on coupled human and natural systems is not yet studied. As 87% of all flowering plants depend on pollinators, they are basic for all ecosystem services to some extent. Therefore, pollinator loss might cause simultaneous degradation of ecosystem services inducing counterproductive human responses and interlinked poverty spirals. The interaction of climate change, a main risk factor for pollinators, and unadvised human responses to pollinator decline are rarely studied.

Local institutions play an important role in fostering community resilience in the context of change. The resilience of a community is influenced by social learning that can happen as people meet together and share their diverse experiences and knowledge. Surveys of 232 people from 13 villages, in three regions of Cameroon, provided insight about the role that internal village institutions can play in fostering community resilience. Almost all villagers, both men and women, are members of at least one group and the membership of these groups is very diverse in terms of family relations, gender, occupation, age, and level of education. While the groups were not currently working together to respond to climate change, the diverse social networks that villagers have in these groups have already fostered exchange of knowledge. Their existence in villages provides opportunities for developing and sharing of knowledge that can be important for climate change adaptation in the future. Community resilience could be better fostered through a deliberate action-reflection process that includes both men and women, and builds on the social capital present in communities.","[Brown, H.

It also remains crucial in building sustainable adaptive capacities, particularly in cities of the global north. It however remains largely unknown in urban Africa about planning agencies' perspectives on climate change adaptation-urban planning conundrum, and corresponding policy responses. This paper thus examines urban planners' perspectives and planning responses on managing climate change impacts and building adaptive capacities in Accra, Ghana. Using a review of four relevant urban planning and climate change policies, and interviews with five urban planning agencies in Accra, findings indicate that urban planning regimes are less efficient, more reactionary, and unsustainable in building resilience and adaptive capacities to climate change impacts. The findings show evidence of weak institutional and stakeholder coordination, inadequate funds and institutional logistics and human capacity, which have contributed to the inability to manage 'normal' climate change impacts such as floods and build resilience to them. The paper concludes with suggestions for building resilience to climate change impacts and incorporating adaptation concerns into urban planning efforts in Ghana.","[Asibey, Michael Osei; Adutwum, Isaac Osei; Tagnan, Jacob Nchagmado] KNUST, Coll Art & Built Environm, Fac Built Environm, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana; [Mintah, Frank] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Wireko-Gyebi, Rejoice Selorm] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Planning & Sustainabil, Sunyani, Ghana; [Yevugah, Lily Lisa] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Geosci, Sunyani, Ghana; [Agyeman, Kwasi Osei] Christian Serv Univ Coll, Dept Planning & Dev, Kumasi, Ghana; [Abdul-Salam, Abdulai Jahanfo] Ohio Univ, Dept Geog, Athens, OH USA",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Bern; University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Asibey, MO (corresponding author), KNUST, Coll Art & Built Environm, Fac Built Environm, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana.",asibeymichael@yahoo.com; lily.yevugah@uenr.edu.gh; koseiagyeman@csuc.edu.gh; aa512821@ohio.edu,"Asibey, Michael Osei/P-2396-2016","Asibey, Michael Osei/0000-0002-5534-2695",,,,,60,1,1,11,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,DEC,2022,131,,,,,,,,103950,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103950,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2022.103950,,AUG 2022,12,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,4U2NR,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000858637500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Producers have technology options for mitigating this risk with one such technology termed drainage water recycling (DWR). DWR involves diverting subsurface drainage water to ponds where it is stored for later irrigation. Crop insurance may interfere with DWR adoption by providing producers with another avenue to manage climate change risk. It is hypothesized that government-subsidized crop insurance reduces climate change technology adoption. Based on real options, this analysis considers two policy regimes: when crop insurance is in effect and not. In a Poisson jump process, it further considers the insurance effect of producers' returns jumping when facing a crop disaster. Results indicate crop insurance has a minimal effect on DWR adoption, and in most scenarios, the DWR adoption thresholds are too large for a producer to invest for climate change adaptation without additional financial incentives. The baseline DWR adoption scenario, with no crop insurance impact, requires revenue of $1,114/acre, or 1.57 times current conventional revenue.","[Sellars, Sarah C.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Thompson, Nathanael M.; Wetzstein, Michael E.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Bowling, Laura] Purdue Univ, Dept Agron, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Cherkauer, Keith; Frankenberger, Jane; Reinhart, Ben] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Lee, Charlotte] Purdue Univ, Dept Agronomt, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Thompson, NM (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",thomp530@purdue.edu,"Cherkauer, Keith/D-6510-2014; Bowling, Laura/B-6963-2013","Cherkauer, Keith/0000-0002-6938-5303; Bowling, Laura/0000-0002-1439-3154",,,,,43,0,0,12,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Usefulness and reliability of forecast information explained most of the variations of its use, suggesting an increased likelihood in forecast use by 14% and 19%, respectively. Farmers' sex, farm parcel size, and risk attitude are also positively associated with forecast information use, whereas age and reliability of traditional forecasts negatively influenced its use. Effective policies for sustainable agricultural production should consider the need to improve the access and use of weather and seasonal climate information by delivering timely and accurate information that is tailor-fitted to the needs of the farmers.

Except for its great implications for environmental protection and climate change adaption, the spatio-temporal changes of rice cultivation in NEC are not clear. In this study, we conducted spatio-temporal analyses of NEC's major rice production region, Heilongjiang Province, by using satellite-derived rice cultivation maps. We found that the total cultivated area of rice in Heilongjiang Province increased largely from 1993 to 2011 and it expanded spatially to the northern and eastern part of the Sanjiang Plain. The results also showed that rice cultivation areas experienced a larger increase in the region managed by the Reclamation Management Bureau (RMB) than that managed by the local provincial government. Rice cultivation changes were closely related with those geographic factors over the investigated periods, represented by the geomorphic (slope), climatic (accumulated temperature), and hydrological (watershed) variables. These findings provide clear evidence that crop cultivation in NEC has been modified to better cope with the global change.","[Lu Zhong-jun; Liu Ke-bao; Liu Yan-xia; Xin Rui; Zhang Deng-mei] Heilongjiang Acad Agr Sci, Remote Sensing Technol Ctr, Harbin 150086, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Song Qian; Wu Wen-bin] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Minist Agr, Key Lab Agr Remote Sensing, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs","Song, Q; Wu, WB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Minist Agr, Key Lab Agr Remote Sensing, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",lszyj@126.com; songqian01@caas.cn; wuwenbin@caas.cn,"song, qian/HDL-9868-2022",,"Opening Foundation of the Key Laboratory of Agricultural Information Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, China [2016009]; National Natural Science Foundation of-China [41501111, 41271112]","Opening Foundation of the Key Laboratory of Agricultural Information Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, China; National Natural Science Foundation of-China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This research was financially supported by the Opening Foundation of the Key Laboratory of Agricultural Information Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, China (2016009) and the National Natural Science Foundation of-China (41501111 and 41271112).

This type of saltwater intrusion places communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure at substantial risk. Risk perceptions of local residents are an indicator to gauge public support for climate change adaptation planning. Here, we document residential perspectives on the present and future threats posed by saltwater intrusion in a rural, low-lying region in coastal North Carolina, and we compare the spatial distribution of survey responses to physical landscape variables such as distance to coastline, artificial drainage density, elevation, saltwater intrusion vulnerability, and actual salinity measured during a synoptic field survey. We evaluate and discuss the degree of alignment or misalignment between risk perceptions and metrics of exposure to saltwater intrusion. Risk perceptions align well with the physical landscape characteristics, as residents with greater exposure to saltwater intrusion, including those living on low-lying land with high concentrations of artificial drainages, perceive greater risk than people living in low-exposure areas. Uncertainty about threats of saltwater intrusion is greatest among those living at higher elevations, whose properties and communities are less likely to be exposed to high salinity. As rising sea levels, drought, and coastal storms increase the likelihood of saltwater intrusion in coastal regions, integrated assessments of risk perceptions and physical exposure are critical for developing outreach activities and planning adaptation measures.","[Bhattachanu, Abinash; Taillie, Paul J.; Smart, Lindsey S.; Emanuel, Ryan E.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Bhattachanu, Abinash; Smart, Lindsey S.; Emanuel, Ryan E.] North Carolina State Univ, Ctr Geospatial Analyt, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Jurjonas, Matthew D.; Seekamp, Erin L.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Raleigh, NC USA; [Morris, Priscilla R.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forest Biomat, Raleigh, NC USA",North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University,"Bhattachanu, A (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.;Bhattachanu, A (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Ctr Geospatial Analyt, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",abhatta9@ncsu.edu,"Emanuel, Ryan E/C-3796-2012","Emanuel, Ryan E/0000-0002-2166-1698; Seekamp, Erin/0000-0001-5082-1921; Smart, Lindsey/0000-0002-1366-6528","College of Natural Resources at North Carolina State University (Building Interdisciplinary Strengths); National Science Foundation [EF-1427188, EAR-1462169]",College of Natural Resources at North Carolina State University (Building Interdisciplinary Strengths); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The College of Natural Resources at North Carolina State University (Building Interdisciplinary Strengths) and National Science Foundation (EF-1427188 and EAR-1462169) provided funding for this study.

However, climate services are not well taken up by the policy-making and planning community. Climate services focus on primary impacts of climate change, e.g., the disclosure of precipitation and temperature data, and this seems insufficient in meeting their needs. In this paper, we argue that, in order to reach the spatial planning community, climate services should take on a wider perspective by translating climate data to policy-relevant indicators and by offering support in the design of adaptation strategies. We argue there should be more focus on translating consequences of climate change to land-use claims and subsequently discuss the validity, consequences and implications of these claims with stakeholders, so they can play a role in spatial planning processes where much of the climate adaptation takes place. The term Climate Adaptation Services is introduced as being a stepwise approach supporting the assessment of vulnerability in a wider perspective and include the design and appraisal of adaptation strategies in a multi-stakeholder setting. We developed the Climate Adaptation Atlas and the Climate Ateliers as tools within the Climate Adaptation Services approach to support decision-making and planning processes. In this paper, we describe the different steps of our approach and report how some of the challenges were addressed.","[Goosen, H.; de Groot-Reichwein, M. A.

In the absence of adequate public financial resources, private funds are often expected to fill the gap. But market-driven, nature-based solutions can contribute to an inequitable distribution of urban ecosystem services by focusing on net benefits provided by nature. To help foster sustainable development and ensure that nature-based solutions reach diverse and historically marginalized populations and communities, this scoping review explores the ecosystem services provided by nature-based solutions and the payment mechanisms that produce and maintain them, focusing on literature on the United States. Findings suggest that the net benefits provided by nature-based solutions and the available payment mechanisms vary based on the solution utilized (e.g., urban trees, parks, community gardens). Further, the distribution of benefits from nature-based solutions is influenced by local historical, cultural, political, economic, and environmental contexts, the voices included in decision-making, and the payment mechanisms used. Inspired by social equity principles, we present a framework for ecosystem service provision that is sensitive to market-driven funding, financing, and partnerships. Practitioners can use this framework to assess whether payment schemes work in tandem with place (the local context) and process (governance and planning approaches) to ameliorate or exacerbate disparities in nature-based solutions and the benefits they provide to people.","[Thompson, Austin; Bunds, Kyle; Larson, Lincoln; Cutts, Bethany; Hipp, J.

While TA is appealing as a concept that involves the implementation of adaptation actions in different ways through small adjustments from current technological and economic approaches, it also raises questions about the complexity of transforming agricultural systems. Although current scientific evidence finds some patterns of climate change impacts on agriculture in the future that can inform the analysis of where and when transformation is required, this evidence is not enough to fully inform practical decision-making at different scales. Part of the problem may be that there has been not enough empirical research focusing on transformational agriculture. For example, from 93 articles in the literature, 39% focus on understanding the concept of TA, 32% focus on analytical and applied aspects of TA, including studies applying global climate models to analyze TA at regional and global scales and to identify broad patterns of TA in agriculture, and only 16% have tried to understand TA from an empirical perspective. While the number of empirical studies of TA is still increasing, there are other issues of TA that have received limited attention, including uncertainty of climate change impacts, policy implications, the transition process, the role of technological innovations, and barriers to TA.

Adaptation to climate change requires innovative measures to be shared and adopted. This paper analyses willingness to pay (WTP) for rainfall-based index insurance by farmers in Ethiopia to shield against the adverse consequences of climate change. Rainfall data for the study area were used to compute Standardized Precipitation Indices to serve as drought monitoring tool and trigger response actions. A bivariate probit model was estimated to scrutinize factors associated with WTP. The results indicate that smallholder farmers associate positive value to indexed insurance. Those farmers in agro-ecology with moisture stress, who are better educated, worried about risk associated with weather and those who have better access to credit are more likely to pay for weather-indexed insurance. However, households that have better non-farm income and remittance are less likely to pay for the indexed insurance. The mean WTP was found to be Birr 119.90 per year for a hectare of maize-cultivated land. However, a number of challenges remain to be addressed for effective index-based insurance, which includes reliable weather data, strong marketing channel and intermediary for the insurance products. Therefore, any intervention which aims at transferring weather-based risks through rainfall index-based insurance need to consider the above features to identify the early adopters of the product.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, African Ctr Food Secur, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Bogale, A (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, African Ctr Food Secur, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",bogalea@ukzn.ac.za,,"Bogale, Ayalneh/0000-0001-9112-1454",SIDA; IDRC,SIDA; IDRC,This research project has benefitted from resources made available by CEEPA through funding from SIDA and IDRC.

In this paper, the extent to which the natural variability of the climate affects one's ability to project the anthropogenically forced component of change in daily precipitation extremes across Europe is examined. A three-member ensemble of the Hadley Centre Regional Climate Model (HadRM3H) is used and a statistical framework is applied to estimate the uncertainty due to the full spectrum of climate variability. In particular, the results and understanding presented here suggest that annual to multidecadal natural variability may contribute significant uncertainty. For this ensemble projection, extreme precipitation changes at the grid-box level are found to be discernible above climate noise over much of northern and central Europe in winter, and parts of northern and southern Europe in summer. The ability to quantify the change to a reasonable level of accuracy is largely limited to regions in northern Europe. In general, where climate noise has a significant component varying on decadal time scales, single 30-yr climate change projections are insufficient to infer changes in the extreme tail of the underlying precipitation distribution. In this context, the need for ensembles of integrations is demonstrated and the relative effectiveness of spatial pooling and averaging for generating robust signals of extreme precipitation change is also explored. The key conclusions are expected to apply more generally to other models and forcing scenarios.","[Kendon, Elizabeth J.; Rowell, David P.; Buonomo, Erasmo] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Jones, Richard G.] Univ Reading, Met Off Hadley Ctr, Reading Unit, Reading, Berks, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Reading,"Kendon, EJ (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",elizabeth.kendon@metoffice.gov.uk,"Rowell, David P/AAF-3674-2019","Rowell, David P/0000-0002-6727-1732; Jones, Richard/0000-0002-0904-3141",,,,,35,109,113,1,27,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

As such, electric vehicles have the potential to mitigate the excessive heat in urban areas-a problem which has been exacerbated due to urbanisation and climate change. Still, the heat mitigation potential of electric vehicles has not been fully understood. Here, we combine high-resolution traffic heat emission inventories with an urban climate model to simulate the impact of the fleet electrification to the near-surface air temperature in the tropical city of Singapore. We show that a full replacement of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles reduces the near-surface air temperature by up to 0.6 degrees C. The heat mitigation potential is highest during the morning traffic peak and over areas with the largest traffic density. Interestingly, the reduction in exhaust heat emissions due to the fleet electrification during the evening traffic peak hardly leads to a reduction of near-surface air-temperatures, which is attributed to the different atmospheric conditions during morning and evening. This study presents a new quantification of the city-wide impact of electric vehicles on the air temperature in a tropical urban area. The results may support policy-makers toward designing holistic solutions to address the challenge of climate change adaptation and mitigation in cities.","[Mussetti, Gianluca; Davin, Edouard L.; Schwaab, Jonas; Seneviratne, Sonia I.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Davin, Edouard L.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Wyss Acad Nat Climate & Environm Phys, Bern, Switzerland; [Acero, Juan A.; Singh, Vivek Kumar] Singapore MIT Alliance Res & Technol SMART, CENSAM, Singapore, Singapore; [Ivanchev, Jordan] TUMCREATES, Singapore, Singapore; [Jin, Luxi] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Bern; Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research & Technology Centre (SMART); Humboldt University of Berlin,"Mussetti, G (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",mussetti.gianluca@gmail.com,"Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; Davin, Edouard L./L-7033-2016; Singh, Vivek/EWC-0831-2022","Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Davin, Edouard L./0000-0003-3322-9330; Singh, Vivek/0000-0002-7671-5913; Acero, Juan Angel/0000-0001-6214-0605",Singapore's National Research Foundation (NRF),"Singapore's National Research Foundation (NRF)(National Research Foundation, Singapore)",The research was funded by the Singapore's National Research Foundation (NRF).,,47,3,3,6,12,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

However, drought occurrence varies across space and time. We examined drought dynamics and impacts on vegetation and ES in the semi-arid Limpopo Basin of Botswana. Weather station precipitation, remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and participatory mapping exercises provided data for the analyses. Results show that between 1980 and 2015, rainfall anomaly indices of potential drought years ranged between -4.38 and -0.12. The longest spell of below-average rainfall occurred between 1992 and 1996. On average, drought events lasted for 1.9 years and recurred every 2.3 years. Although the overall drought frequency was 3.7 times in every 5 years, drought prevalence increased to 50%, 60% and 70% between 1981-1990, 1991-2000, and 2001-2010, respectively. The wet season average vegetation condition index between 2000 and 2015 revealed the occurrence of severe-to-extreme droughts in 2002-2003, 2005, 2008-2009 and 2012-2013 and light-to-moderate droughts in 2004, 2006-2007 and 2011, giving a drought prevalence of 73.3%. The increased frequency and severity of droughts is diminishing natural vegetation, crop productivity and several provisioning ES through moisture stress and drought-induced agricultural expansions.

Currently, the available information on rainfall trends in southern Africa is scanty with most studies focusing either on the spatial or the temporal dimension at localised levels. The novelty of this study is its regional aspect (i.e. all of southern African arid and semi-arid biomes) and the simultaneous integration of space and time in rainfall trend analysis through the use of space time rainfall cube. In this study, we simultaneously examined spatial and temporal rainfall trends based on the space-time rainfall cube derived from 1981 to 2016 CHIRPS satellite rainfall data. The space time rainfall trend analysis revealed a significant (P < 0.05) decrease of rainfall across most biomes particularly in the northern parts of the savanna biome and southwestern biomes (i.e. karoo, desert and fynbos). Statistically significant (P < 0.05) rainfall increase was observed in the central parts of the region mostly within the savanna biome. In terms of the magnitude of rainfall change, some of the areas experienced as much as 12 mm rainfall decrease in the mean annual rainfall while others recorded an increase of 14 mm.

Despite this, it is clear that there exist many less material but no less important values at risk from sea-level rise. This paper re-theorises these multifarious social values at risk from sea-level rise, by explaining their diverse nature, and grounding them in the everyday practices of people living in coastal places. It is informed by a review and analysis of research on social values from within the fields of social impact assessment, human geography, psychology, decision analysis, and climate change adaptation. From this we propose that it is the 'lived values' of coastal places that are most at risk from sea-level rise. We then offer a framework that groups these lived values into five types: those that are physiological in nature, and those that relate to issues of security, belonging, esteem, and self-actualisation. This framework of lived values at risk from sea-level rise can guide empirical research investigating the social impacts of sea-level rise, as well as the impacts of actions to adapt to sea-level rise. It also offers a basis for identifying the distribution of related social outcomes across populations exposed to sea-level rise or sea-level rise policies. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To ensure that outdoor recreation remains sustainable in the face of these challenges, natural resource managers may need to adapt their recreation management. One of the major challenges of adapting recreation to climate change is translating broad concepts into specific, tangible actions. Using a combination of in-depth interviews of recreational managers and a review of peer-reviewed literature and government reports, we developed a synthesis of impacts, strategies, and approaches, and a tiered structure that organizes this information. Six broad climate adaptation strategies and 25 more specific approaches were identified and organized into a recreation menu. The recreation menu was tested with two national forests in the US in multi-day workshops designed to integrate these concepts into real-world projects that were at the beginning stages of the planning process. We found that the recreation menu was broad yet specific enough to be applied to recreation-focused projects with different objectives and climate change impacts. These strategies and approaches serve as stepping stones to enable natural resource and recreation managers to translate broad concepts into targeted and prescriptive actions for implementing adaptation.","[O'Toole, Daniel; Brandt, Leslie A.; Janowiak, Maria K.; Handler, Stephen D.; Ontl, Todd A.; Swanston, Christopher W.] US Forest Serv, USDA, 1992 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Brandt, Leslie A.; Janowiak, Maria K.; Schmitt, Kristen M.; Shannon, P.

Reliable indigenous weather forecasts are, therefore, required to guide rural farmers' decisions in regard to climate change. Much of the literature has shown that western scientific knowledge has failed at rural level. Indigenous knowledge has, for the past century assisted rural farmers' households in tackling the challenges of climate stressors and enhanced decision-making for adaptation. There is, therefore, much room for advancement in assessment processes to ensure adequate credit for indigenous knowledge systems. This study aimed to address two major knowledge gaps (i) to assess the relevance of indigenous knowledge in weather forecasts used by local farmers for climate adaptation, and (ii) examine farmers' perceptions in regard to climate change in Levubu and Nwanedi sites. Indigenous knowledge indicators used by farmers for weather forecasting, within their communities, were collected through questionnaires, interviews and focus group discussions. The results revealed various forms of indigenous indicators used by local farmers for weather forecasting, such as, star and moon movement, appearance of red and black ants and mist-cover on mountains. A better knowledge of indigenous knowledge systems should play an important role in determining suitable adaptation strategies toward climate change. It is recommended, hence, that policy makers should enhance indigenous knowledge among local communities regarding the implications of climatic stressors to increase crop production.","[Kom, Zongho; Nethengwe, Nthaduleni S.; Mpandeli, Sylvester] Univ Venda, Fac Sci Engn & Agr, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Thohoyandou, Limpopo Provinc, South Africa; [Mpandeli, Sylvester] Water Res Commiss, Pretoria, South Africa; [Chikoore, Hector] Univ Limpopo, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Polokwane, Limpopo, South Africa",University of Venda; University of Limpopo,"Kom, Z (corresponding author), Univ Venda, Fac Sci Engn & Agr, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Thohoyandou, Limpopo Provinc, South Africa.",zogokom@yahoo.fr,,"Sekgota Nemphagane, Wendy Maphefo/0000-0002-3113-7275; Kom, Zongho/0000-0002-3294-8651",,,,,60,0,0,8,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

The article reviews literature linking the climate emergency with disaster resilience and collective land-based models. It brings into focus the case of the Cano Martin Pena communities in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where residents started a Community Land Trust (CLT) in Latin America and the Caribbean, resulting from an extensive process of community participation. We highlight the importance of this case as still one of the only CLT's in the Global South, a mechanism not yet sufficiently understood as a highly developed instrument for secure land tenure and adaptation to climate change in the Global South. We analyse the mechanisms by which the CLT's collective tenure model effectively ensures greater environmental justice - both regarding ongoing flooding issues, and specific extreme natural events such as hurricanes. Collective land ownership allows residents to remain in the area despite forces of gentrification and displacement after disasters induced by global warming. We conclude with a reflection on the need for similar land-based solutions, and summon public authorities to consider these as a route to effective environmental management.","[Veronesi, Mariangela] World Habitat, Coalville, England; [Algoed, Line] Vrije Univ Brussels, Ctr Urban Res, Dept Geog Cosmopolis, Brussels, Belgium; [Torrales, Maria E.

Measurements of cut shoots were conducted in a climate chamber to eliminate the direct effect of field conditions. The An, An:SPAD ratio, and gl_day were higher in the humidification treatment (H) than in the control (C) (P < 0.05) in autumn. The R was higher in the control than in the humidification treatment across the study period. The gl_night increased considerably in September in both treatments (P < 0.05) and was significantly correlated with R.

Experiments can causally link precipitation change to plant diversity change, however, these experiments vary in their methods and in the diversity metrics reported, making synthesis elusive. Here, we explicitly account for a number of potentially confounding variables, including spatial grain, treatment magnitude and direction and background climatic conditions, to synthesize data across 72 precipitation manipulation experiments. We find that the effects of treatments with higher magnitude of precipitation manipulation on plant diversity are strongest at the smallest spatial scale, and in drier environments. Our synthesis emphasizes that quantifying differential responses of ecosystems requires explicit consideration of spatial grain and the magnitude of experimental manipulation. Given that diversity provides essential ecosystem services, especially in dry and semi-dry areas, our finding that these dry ecosystems are particular sensitive to projected changes in precipitation has important implications for their conservation and management. The responses of terrestrial ecosystems to changes in precipitation patterns are highly context-dependent. Here the authors perform a quantitative synthesis of field rainfall manipulation experiments, showing stronger effects of precipitation on plant diversity at small spatial scales and in arid biomes.","[Korell, Lotte; Auge, Harald; Knight, Tiffany M.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Korell, Lotte; Harpole, W.

Use of diversified crops, nonconventional water resources and rehabilitation of marginal lands are alternate options to produce more food to face climate change projections. Adaptation to climate change through climate smart agriculture practices, agroecology activities, and crop-based management packages can help transform the marginal lands from environmental burdens into productive and economic blocks. This review discusses the recent advancements on specialty group of alternate crops (oil seeds, legumes, cereals, medicinal, lignocellulose, and fruit crops) which can adapt in the marginal environments. Availability of alternate water resources (saline water, treated wastewater) for irrigation cannot be omitted. Crop diversification systems involving drought and salt-tolerant crops are likely to be the key to future agricultural and economic growth in the regions where salt-affected soils exist and/or saline aquifers are pumped for irrigation. These systems may tackle three main tasks: sustainable management of land resources and enhancement of per unit productivity; intensification of agroecological practices to increase soil fertility; and improving productivity of marginal lands for diversified climate smart crops. This review explores various aspects of marginal lands and selection of tolerant crop genotypes, crop diversification, and agroecological practices to maximize benefits.","[Iftikhar Hussain, Muhammad] Univ Vigo, Dept Plant Biol & Soil Sci, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Farooq, Muhammad] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Agr & Marine Sci, Dept Plant Sci, Al Khoud 123, Oman; [Farooq, Muhammad] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Agron, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Muscolo, Adele] Mediterranea Univ, Dept Agr, I-89122 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Rehman, Abdul] Dankook Univ, Dept Crop Sci & Biotechnol, 119 Dandae Ro, Cheonan Si 31116, South Korea",Universidade de Vigo; Sultan Qaboos University; University of Agriculture Faisalabad; Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria; Dankook University,"Hussain, MI (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Dept Plant Biol & Soil Sci, Vigo 36310, Spain.",iftikhar@uvigo.es,"REHMAN, ABDUL/Q-5798-2018; Rehman, Abdul/HIZ-6275-2022; Hussain, Muhammad Iftikhar/AGQ-4987-2022; Farooq, Muhammad/F-1617-2010","REHMAN, ABDUL/0000-0002-4789-3462; Hussain, Muhammad Iftikhar/0000-0002-9710-3801; Farooq, Muhammad/0000-0003-4368-9357",,,,,264,22,22,7,49,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

In recent years, to face the challenges caused by the climate change, the concepts of, urban ecological resilience, specifically, climate resilience have been introduced. Climate resilience, is a type of urban ecological resilience, which is defined as the urban resilience to climate change. Urban green infrastructure has an established role as one of the strategies for adapting to climate change and for developing and promoting climate resilience in cities. Given the theoretical gap existing in this field, this question arises: How and based on which features of the green infrastructure can we assess and analyze climate resilience in a city? To answer this question, the landscape ecology principles and relationship between them and green infrastructure in cities were studied. The relationship was developed in the Yousef Abad neighborhood of Tehran and was qualitatively tested using the aerial images, field surveys and preparation of basic and analytical GIS maps.

The situation in the US is more polarised, with the Republican Party almost uniformly denying the existence of climate change and any human impact on rising global temperatures. Instead of taking scientific reports on impacts, risks and adaptation to climate change seriously, the Trump administration is focused on increasing US production of oil, natural gas and coal.

The cost of adapting to climate change in Africa is estimated to be $20 to $30 billion per year, but the total amount pledged to finance adaptation falls significantly short of this requirement. The difficulty of assessing and monitoring when adaptation is achieved is one of the key barriers to the disbursement of performance-based adaptation finance. To demonstrate the potential of Bayesian Belief Networks for describing the impacts of specific activities on climate change resilience, we developed a simple model that incorporates climate projections, local environmental data, information from peer-reviewed literature and expert opinion to account for the adaptation benefits derived from Climate-Smart Agriculture activities in Malawi. This novel approach allows assessment of vulnerability to climate change under different land use activities and can be used to identify appropriate adaptation strategies and to quantify biophysical adaptation benefits from activities that are implemented. We suggest that multiple-indicator Bayesian Belief Network approaches can provide insights into adaptation planning for a wide range of applications and, if further explored, could be part of a set of important catalysts for the expansion of adaptation finance.","[de Nijs, Patrick J.; Berry, Nicholas J.; Wells, Geoff J.; Reay, Dave S.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"de Nijs, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",patrick.denijs@gmail.com,"Reay, David/F-4054-2010","Reay, Dave/0000-0001-5829-9007; Wells, Geoff/0000-0002-5416-951X",NERC [NE/L013363/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/L013363/1] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,39,8,8,1,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,OCT 20,2014,4,,,,,,,,6682,10.1038/srep06682,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep06682,,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,AR4XZ,25327826,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000343590800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Small island developing states (SIDS) are more sensitive, and have a lower capacity to adapt to climate change than mainland countries, yet, estimates of future rainfall over SIDS are subject to large relative uncertainties. Ordinary least squares regression analyses are used to model mean annual and monthly rainfall in Mauritius over the period 2000-2011, and derive a physical basis for understanding spatial patterns in rainfall. The final models incorporate latitude, longitude, slope, distance to coast, elevation and their interactions and account for 68% of the variance in mean annual rainfall and 55-72% of variance in mean monthly rainfall across the island. The variables included in the model and the spatial patterns that they bring about are physically consistent with basic rainfall generating processes. We highlight the value of incorporating the modelled estimates into a hydrological model, and discuss the applicability of our modelling framework in terms of cost, computational efficiency and transferability to other mountainous areas, particularly on small island developing states.

By relying on observed discharge records and on precipitation data from reanalysis and climate models, we analyse the 2022 event in the framework of the recent past statistics and in future scenarios. Alongside with a projection of future rainfall regimes on the Po River basin in two climate change scenarios, our analysis shows that persistent negative rainfall anomalies like the ones that characterised the 2022 event, though unlikely to become a typical feature of future climate, could remarkably increase their frequency, particularly in a severe climate change condition. Moreover, their impacts will be magnified by rising temperatures and, in coastal areas, by rising sea level, enhancing the salinisation of agricultural lands and altering the dynamics of transitional ecosystems.

The failure of OECD countries is major constraint concerning global progress on curbing GHG emissions and mitigation of climatic changes as it provides rationale for developing countries to avoid their commitments. Therefore, the major focus of COP26 was to explore policy options for sustainable transition of energy from fossil fuel to clean renewables. This study analyzes the impact of innovation in environmental technology along with various policy regimes on energy transition in OECD countries from 2000 to 2019. The driving factors of energy transition in OECD countries are analyzed, under moderation of environmental governance regimes. This objective is realized by constructing an Energy Transition Index that accounts for the movement along the energy ladder. This index is developed using the Energy Ladder Hypothesis. Using two-step system-GMM and segregating the sample across level of emissions, the results show that the regional authority augments the energy transition, while enforecement of the climate change laws shows mixed results. Based on the study outcomes, a policy framework is recommended for attaining the SDG objectives by realigning the climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.","[Hu, Kexiang] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Business Adm, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Sinha, Avik] Goa Inst Management, Ctr Excellence Sustainable Dev, Sattari, India; [Sinha, Avik] Lebanese Amer Univ, Adnan Kassar Sch Business, Beirut 11022801, Lebanon; [Tan, Zhixiong] Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Shah, Muhammad Ibrahim] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol REES, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Shah, Muhammad Ibrahim] Univ Dhaka, Alma Mater Dept Econ, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Abbas, Shujaat] Ural Fed Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Chongqing Technology & Business University; Goa Institute of Management; Lebanese American University; Chongqing University; University of Alberta; University of Dhaka; Ural Federal University,"Tan, ZX (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",tzxcqu@126.com,,"Sinha, Avik/0000-0001-7795-1259","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Chongqing University [2018CDYJSY0055, 2022CDJSKJC26, 2021CDSKXYGG013]",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Chongqing University,"This study was financially funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Chongqing University (2018CDYJSY0055, 2022CDJSKJC26, 2021CDSKXYGG013).",,104,4,4,8,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

This study utilizes partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to identify the main indicators of Indigenous support for coping with unfavorable climate impacts. Using a case study and a purposive sampling approach, a survey of 328 Indigenous peoples was conducted in rural Kinabatangan, Sabah, Malaysia. Results showed that communities' attitudes had a large effect on the Indigenous support for adaptation (f(2) = 0.380), followed by the communities' awarenesses (f(2) = 0.063), rapid onset events (f(2) = 0.051), and climate impacts on tourism (f(2) = 0.016). Communities prioritize the impacts of climate change on their health, livelihoods, and environmental resources. Nevertheless, they do not draw a causal link between the effects and responses to climate hazards. Coping strategies such as the inclusion of Indigenous livelihoods, a bottom-up approach, and transparent communication are suggested to cultivate Indigenous support for climate change adaptation. Decision-makers can apply these findings to prepare climate change policies and enhance the adaptation strategies of Indigenous communities.","[Pimid, Marcela; Nasir, Mohammad Rusdi Mohd] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Architecture & Ekist, Bachok 16300, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Scian, Joanna] 10961 Burnt Mill Rd,1528, Jacksonville, FL 32256 USA; [Ahmad, A.

The present study examines changes in rainfall and temperature over 5 important jute growing districts of West Bengal, India. Both rainfall and temperature trend for period of 1980-2019 were analysed using Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator. Analysis of the data for 39 years revealed that while Howrah and Hooghly district had decreasing rainfall trend, Burdwan and Nadia districts showed increasing trend of rainfall during jute growing period. North-24 Parganas recorded negative rainfall trend. Compared with rainfall, lesser variability of temperature was recorded for all the districts except Burdwan. The positive Sen's Slope exhibited by Nadia and North-24 Parganas showed an increasing temperature trend. The results herein suggests that jute sowing should be done by March end-April to take advantage of the optimum temperature (25-35 degrees C) and rainfall due to Norwesters. Thus, studying spatio- temporal dynamics of temperature and rainfall across jute growing states of West Bengal will be helpful for climate change adaptation and successful cropping.","[DATTA, D. E.

Therefore, EbA presents a potential for more comprehensive, cost-efficient, multifunctional and multidimensional measures in flood disaster risk management. Essentially, EbA integrates biodiversity and ecosystem services as an approach to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. This study adopts descriptive and exploratory analytical approaches aimed at assessing the trends of flood events in South Africa and their potential risk management through EbA. The study reveals that between 1959 and 2019, several major floods have occurred, resulting in losses of life and livelihoods and significant infrastructure damages among others. Recovery has taken years and needed continuous investment. Unfortunately, many communities have not been able to bounce back/bounce forward, despite all these efforts. This study revealed that EbA strategies can be instituted regionally and nationally to offer efficient flood disaster adaptation or mitigation in flood-prone areas. In general, utilising EbA can stabilise or reduce flood impacts, minimise environmental impacts and damages associated with flood disasters by developing innovative EbA strategies. Therefore, the study recommends an increased awareness of EbA strategies to enhance universal adoption in ameliorating flood risk.","[Busayo, Emmanuel Tolulope; Kalumba, Ahmed Mukalazi; Afuye, Gbenga Abayomi; Orimoloye, Israel Ropo] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Private Bag X1314, ZA-5700 Alice, Eastern Cape Pr, South Africa; [Busayo, Emmanuel Tolulope; Kalumba, Ahmed Mukalazi; Afuye, Gbenga Abayomi] Univ Ft Hare, Geospatial Applicat Climate Change & Environm Sus, ZA-5700 Alice, South Africa; [Olusola, Adeyemi Oludapo] Univ Ibadan, Dept Geog, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Olusola, Adeyemi Oludapo] Univ Free State, Dept Geog, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Ololade, Olusola Oluwayemisi; Orimoloye, Israel Ropo] Univ Free State, Ctr Environm Management, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of Fort Hare; University of Fort Hare; University of Ibadan; University of the Free State; University of the Free State,"Busayo, ET (corresponding author), Univ Ft Hare, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Private Bag X1314, ZA-5700 Alice, Eastern Cape Pr, South Africa.",etobusayo@yahoo.com,"Olusola, Adeyemi Oludapo/AAC-9641-2020; Olusola, Adeyemi/GQP-2042-2022; Ololade, Olusola/Y-2309-2019","Olusola, Adeyemi Oludapo/0000-0003-2295-5214; Ololade, Olusola/0000-0001-7348-5422","Govan Mbeki Research Development Center (GMRDC) , University of Fort Hare, South Africa","Govan Mbeki Research Development Center (GMRDC) , University of Fort Hare, South Africa","Sincere thanks to Govan Mbeki Research Development Center (GMRDC) , University of Fort Hare, South Africa, for the support of this research and for creating an enabling environment for research and to the anonymous reviewers for their wonderful insights that strengthened this paper.",,59,6,6,5,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2665-9727,,,ENVIRON SUSTAIN IND,Environ.

To consider investment in disaster risk reduction, policymakers need information on appropriate scales of investment depending on disaster damage occurred and socioeconomic development. However, there is a limited number of empirical studies that examine investment in disaster risk reduction, since the dataset of investments across countries is rarely available. This study aims at proposing the approaches of financing investment in flood protection, which is integrated with climate change adaptation. To our knowledge, this study is the first empirical analysis on the relationship between investment and damage and socio-economic development across economies. A multiple regression model is applied to analyze the relationship between investment in flood protection and flood damage and other socio-economic development. Investment data were collected from government agencies in major flood-prone countries in Asia. It was found that greater flood damage is associated with a larger budget for flood protection. The governments start increasing budgets after major disasters happen and further increase them as GDP per capita and population density rise. To study investment in disaster risk reduction further, datasets of budgets need to be established.","[Ishiwatari, Mikio] Japan Int Cooperat Agcy, Tokyo, Japan; [Ishiwatari, Mikio] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; [Sasaki, Daisuke] Tohoku Univ, Int Res Inst Disaster Sci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan",University of Tokyo; Tohoku University,"Ishiwatari, M (corresponding author), Japan Int Cooperat Agcy, Tokyo, Japan.",ishiwatari.mikio@jica.go.jp; dsasaki@irides.tohoku.ac.jp,"Ishiwatari, Mikio/GRR-8871-2022","Ishiwatari, Mikio/0000-0002-5606-5036; Sasaki, Daisuke/0000-0002-7569-4217","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [JP 21H03680]; International Research Institute of Disaster Science (IRIDeS), Tohoku University","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); International Research Institute of Disaster Science (IRIDeS), Tohoku University","This paper has been prepared as a part of the research project Research on Demand Estimate of Infrastructure in Asia conducted by the JICA Ogata Sadako Research Institute for Peace and Development.

Under-standing the spatial pattern of heatwave is vital for providing the corresponding weather services, making climate change adaptation strategies and heat-health actions. In this study, we present an approach to estimate the heatwave spatial patterns by utilizing the WUDAPT Level 0 data and machine learning. The analysis is based on two years (2009 and 2016) of air temperature data from 86 meteorological monitoring stations in Guangdong province of China, a subtropical region with frequent hot and sultry weather in summer. First, heatwave conditions were quantified by calculating the number of hot days and frequency of heatwave events in each year and used as the response variables. Then, random forest models were built by using a geospatial dataset con-sisting of WUDAPT and urban canopy parameters (UCP) as predictor variables. Based on the resultant models, spatial patterns of heatwave were estimated and mapped at 100 m spatial -resolution. The results show that this approach is able to estimate heatwave spatial patterns using open data and inform urban policy and decision-making. The study is also a new perspective and a feasible pathway of utilizing WUDPAT Level 0 product to facilitate urban environment applications.","[Shi, Yuan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Future Cities IOFC, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ren, Chao; Li, Xinwei] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Architecture, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Luo, Ming] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Ching, Jason] Univ N Carolina, Inst Environm, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Bilal, Muhammad] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Lab Environm Remote Sensing LERS, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Fang, Xiaoyi] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ren, Zhihua] Natl Meteorol Informat Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong; Sun Yat Sen University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS),"Fang, XY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",fangxy@cma.gov.cn,"Bilal, Muhammad/L-1546-2014; REN, Chao/L-8938-2019; Shi, Yuan/AFK-2138-2022; Luo, Ming/AAE-8527-2021; Shi, Yuan/AAF-9427-2022","Bilal, Muhammad/0000-0003-1022-3999; REN, Chao/0000-0002-8494-2585; Shi, Yuan/0000-0003-4011-8735; Luo, Ming/0000-0002-5474-3892; Shi, Yuan/0000-0003-4011-8735; Li, Xinwei/0000-0002-0914-6108",General Research Fund (RGC) from the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong [14610717]; Research Impact Fund (RGC) from the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong [R4046-18F],General Research Fund (RGC) from the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong; Research Impact Fund (RGC) from the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong,Acknowledgement This research is supported by the General Research Fund (RGC Ref No. 14610717) and Research Impact Fund (RGC Ref No. R4046-18F) from the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong.

This technique requires a spatially continuous separation surface connecting chart datum (CD) to a geodetic ellipsoid. The Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS), with support from the Canadian Geodetic Survey, has developed a new suite of such surfaces, termed Hydrographic Vertical Separations Surfaces, or HyVSEPs, for CD and seven tidal levels. They capture the spatial variability of the tidal datum and levels between tide gauges and offshore using semiempirical models coupling observations at tide stations with relative sea-level rise estimates, dynamic ocean model solutions, satellite altimetry, and a geoid model. HyVSEPs are available for all tidal waters of Canada, covering over seven million square kilometers of ocean and more than 200,000 kilometers of shoreline. This document provides an overview of the CHS's modeling approach, tools, methods, and procedures.The HyVSEP for CD defines the new hydrographic datum for the tidal waters of Canada. HyVSEPs for other tidal levels are fundamental for coastal studies, climate change adaptation and the definition of the Canadian shoreline and offshore boundaries.

Federal land management agencies are also undergoing land management planning efforts that will initiate revision of fire management plans across the country. Using the southern Sierra Nevada as a case study, we briefly describe the underlying framework of fire management plans, assess their consistency with guiding principles based on current science information and federal policy guidance, and provide recommendations for the development of future fire management plans. Based on our review, we recommend that future fire management plans be: (1) consistent and compatible, (2) collaborative, (3) clear and comprehensive, (4) spatially and temporally scalable, (5) informed by the best available science, and (6) flexible and adaptive. In addition, we identify and describe several strategic guides or tools that can enhance these core principles and benefit future fire management plans in the following areas: planning and prioritization, science integration, climate change adaptation, partnerships, monitoring, education and communication, and applied fire management. These principles and tools are essential to successfully realize fire management goals and objectives in a rapidly changing world.","[Meyer, Marc D.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Reg, Clovis, CA 93611 USA; [Roberts, Susan L.; Brooks, Matthew] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Yosemite Field Stn, Oakhurst, CA 93644 USA; [Wills, Robin] Natl Pk Serv, Pacific West Reg, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA; [Winford, Eric M.] Natl Pk Serv, Sequoia & Kings Canyon Natl Pk, Three Rivers, CA 93271 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Department of the Interior,"Meyer, MD (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Reg, 1600 Tollhouse Rd, Clovis, CA 93611 USA.",mdmeyer@fs.fed.us,,,"US Geological Survey Terrestrial, Freshwater, and Marine Ecosystems Program; USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region","US Geological Survey Terrestrial, Freshwater, and Marine Ecosystems Program; USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service)","We thank P.

The objective of this study is to examine the economic impacts of climate change on net crop income in Nile Basin Ethiopia using a Ricardian fixed effect approach employing the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) household survey data for Ethiopia in 2015 and 2016. The survey samples were obtained through a three-stage stratified sampling technique from the five regions (Amhara, Tigray, Benishangul Gumuz, Oromia, and Southern Nation Nationality and People (SNNP) along the Nile basin Ethiopia. There are only 12-14% female household heads while there are 80-86% male households in the regions under study. In the regions, more than half of (64%) the household heads are illiterate and almost only one-tenth of them (12%) had received remittance from abroad from their relatives or children. Crop variety adoption rate is minimal, adopted by the 31% of farmers. Only 30% of the surveyed farmers mentioned that they planted their crop seeds in row whereas the rest 70% had not applied this method. The regression results from the fixed effect least square dummy variable model showed that literacy, household size, remittance, asset value, and total land holdings have significant and positive impacts on the net crop income per hectare. The regional dummy variables estimate indicated that all the regions are negatively affected by climate change at varying levels. Strategies to climate change adaptation have significant and positive contributions in leveraging the damaging effects of climate change. The results also showed that increased winter and summer temperature and rainfall increase net crop income per hectare. The estimated coefficient of the interaction term of spring temperature and rainfall is significant and negative. On the other hand, while the mean annual temperature is damaging to crops, annual rainfall is beneficial. It can be deduced that, while increased temperature and rainfall in summer and winter increase the net crop income, the converse is true for winter and spring seasons. The study also proposes a specific, context-dependent, farm-level adaptation analysis of how farmers cope with the different climatic impacts of the Nile Basin and maintain the income levels that they have previously enjoyed.","[Baylie, Melese Mulu] Debre Tabor Univ, Dept Econ, Debra Tabor 272, Ethiopia; [Baylie, Melese Mulu] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Dept Rural Dev Engn, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Fogarassy, Csaba] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Dev & Farming, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Fogarassy, C (corresponding author), Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Dev & Farming, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.",meske131621@gmail.com; fogarassy.csaba@uni-mate.hu,,"Baylie, Melese Mulu/0000-0002-2218-335X; Fogarassy, Csaba/0000-0002-8670-5874","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation OfficeNKFIH [OTKA 131925]","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation OfficeNKFIH(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary)","Special thanks to the Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation OfficeNKFIH (Program ID: OTKA 131925).",,71,2,2,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,13,,,,,,,7243,10.3390/su13137243,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13137243,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TG1BW,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000671147700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, often methods for assessing the performance of existing infrastructure and also for adapting new projects are missing. Within the BMUB funding initiative Klimpass-Aktiv such methods can be developed and put into practice. This article addresses the issue of infiltration ditch systems that are commonly applied for the infiltration of rainwater and to protect against surface runoff on hillsides. These interception and infiltration ditches have to be designed in terms of their volumes for the expected runoff volume. The design is based on location and is largely determined by the expected rainfall. In contrast to the site conditions, the rain intensity cannot be affected or adjusted. Therefore, this represents a particular uncertainty factor in the prognostic analysis. Projections of precipitation are currently only available for daily and in one special application for hourly precipitation totals. Unfortunately, the uncertainties are high and there are no higher-resolution projections that enable design calculations in the classic sense. Therefore, the problem can only be solved qualitatively by, for example, increasing or decreasing intensities which are assumed. For the region of the city of Sangerhausen (Saxony-Anhalt), a considerable increase of the yearly precipitation amounts and increased discharges are assumed (Kropp et al. 2009). However, evidence with regard to the development of precipitation intensities is not clearly available (see chap. 2.4.). In the present study, therefore, the performance of an existing infiltration ditch system in the city of Sangerhausen has been investigated based on a trial-and-error application. Using different scenarios of precipitation intensities, the critical rainfall intensity was determined in which a failure of the system occurs. This is based on the runoff volumes, which are generated by these critical intensities. These are not only helpful in assessment of the infiltration ditches, but also provide a useful basis for decisions regarding the design or redesign of runoff areas and even for the future selection of suitable development areas. Consequentially, information with regard to the required expansion of existing systems can also be derived.","[Reinstorf, Frido; Ohme, Jan] Hsch Magdeburg Stendal, Fachbereich Wasser Umwelt Bau & Sicherheit, Breitscheidstr 2, D-39114 Magdeburg, Germany; [Scheinert, Martin; Heilmann, Andrea] Hsch Harz, Fachbereich Automatisierung & Informat, Friedrichstr 57-59, D-38855 Wernigerode, Germany",,"Reinstorf, F (corresponding author), Hsch Magdeburg Stendal, Fachbereich Wasser Umwelt Bau & Sicherheit, Breitscheidstr 2, D-39114 Magdeburg, Germany.",frido.reinstorf@hs-magdeburg.de; jan.ohme@web.de; mscheinert@hs-harz.de,,"Reinstorf, Frido/0000-0003-2785-8042",,,,,13,0,0,1,3,BUNDESANSTALT GEWASSERKUNDE-BFG,KOBLENZ,"POSTFACH 200 253, KOBLENZ, 56002, GERMANY",1439-1783,,,HYDROL WASSERBEWIRTS,Hydrol.

There is less information, however, on climate adaptation among smaller cities and towns: Are their approaches similar when undertaking adaptation? Do the barriers they face mirror those of large cities? In this study, we undertake fine-grained empirical research on the perceptions of 18 municipal planners in 14 coastal cities and towns in Massachusetts; our findings are thus limited to planners' perceptions of efforts and barriers in one region of the United States. These communities are very early in the uptake of climate adaptation policies and use a range of approaches when they do begin adaptation, including planning, mainstreaming, or addressing current hazards. The planners interviewed reported that barriers to adaptation actions tend to be interconnected; for example, the strength of private property interests often limits local political leadership on the issue. Without such leadership, it is difficult for planners to allocate time and/or money to adaptation activities. It is also challenging to gain support from local residents for climate adaptation action, while a lack of accepted technical data complicates efforts. Takeaway for practice: In coastal Massachusetts, and perhaps elsewhere, local residents, planners, and their municipal bodies, as well as the states, must act in multiple ways to encourage the development of meaningful climate adaptation action in smaller cities and towns.","[Hamin, Elisabeth M.; Emlinger, Ana Mesquita] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Gurran, Nicole] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Sydney,"Hamin, EM (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",emhamin@larp.umass.edu; nicole.gurran@sydney.edu.au; amesquit@larp.umass.edu,"Gurran, Nicole/AAR-7267-2020","Gurran, Nicole/0000-0003-2646-384X",,,,,63,71,71,1,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0194-4363,1939-0130,,J AM PLANN ASSOC,J.

What knowledge do these policy statements value? How are rural community and Indigenous knowledges included? What are the implications of the answers to these questions for effective adaptation policy for health, particularly for rural communities? These potentially influential government policy statements have not yet been collectively analysed for the ways they reproduce particular discourses in the operation of their meaning-making for health adaptation. This international study investigates and maps health adaptation policy via a discourse analysis of an exhaustive set of twenty-one national adaptation policy documents from twelve Annex 1 countries in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The study uses the techniques of critical discourse analysis to reveal that the national policy texts operate within an ordered universe of discourses that most values climate science and epidemiology and least values local community knowledge, needs and adaptive assets. This is true even for the discourse that emphasises particular forms of translational knowledge and methods for health services development critical to adaptation in these communities. In this respect, national adaptation policy, including for health, does not appear consistent with the prescriptions of global policy frameworks provided by the UN and WHO which emphasise local knowledges. The study's findings are explored with reference to critiques of scientism and Foucault's metaphor of the panopticon to suggest how national policy has worked as a mechanism for the appropriation, governance and regulation of rural communities, limiting its effectiveness.

A data -driven approach is required to guide these investments and maximize their impact. In the African Great Lakes Region (GLR), root, tuber and banana (RT&B) crops are a vital component of smallholder farming systems, but little is known about strategies to mitigate climate change impacts on these crops.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a spatial prioritisation and targeting framework based on the risk of climate-related impacts to guide research investments and prioritisation in CSA for RT&B crops in the GLR.METHODS: Climate change impact data on crop suitability were layered onto other spatially-explicit biophysical and socio-economic data to map clusters of homologous regions, called socio-agroeocological homologues (SAHs). The SAHs were defined by the risk of climate-related impacts, resulting from the interaction of hazards,exposure and vulnerability. The framework was applied to RT&B crops (banana, potato, cassava and sweet -potato) in the African GLR. Its utility was illustrated by elaborating adaptation scenarios for selected SAHs of one long-duration (banana) and one short-duration (potato) RT&B crop.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Four SAHs were identified for banana, potato and sweetpotato and five for cassava. For each crop, SAHs were prioritised for investment in climate change adaptation based on the level of risk of climate-related impacts. Scenario analysis showed that the introduction of drought-tolerant varieties would in-crease suitability for banana from 0.30 to 0.47 under baseline conditions and from 0.54 to 0.71 under future climates in a prioritised SAH with low to moderate suitability for typical varieties. For potato, the introduction of heat-tolerant genotypes, intercropping with legumes or the combination of both would allow compensating negative impacts of climate change on crop suitability in two SAHs representing important mid-altitude potato growing areas, from an average of-0.19 and-0.16 to an average of up to +0.25 and + 0.15 respectively. Scaling approaches should consider the difference in socio-economic conditions between the two SAHs.SIGNIFICANCE: We envision the framework to be useful for a diverse range of users throughout the innovation and scaling continuum to understand where climate change impacts are expected to be most severe, what type of innovations are needed to help farmers adapt, and how these innovations should be scaled to enable uptake by considering socio-economic drivers of adoption.","[Vandamme, Elke] Int Potato Ctr CIP, Rwan, Kigali, Rwanda; [Manners, Rhys; Adewopo, Julius] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, Kigali, Rwanda; [Thiele, Graham; Friedmann, Michael] Int Potato Ctr CIP, CGIAR Res Program Roots Tubers & Bananas, Lima, Peru; [Thornton, Philip] Clim Eat, Netherlands Food Partnership, Utrecht, Netherlands",CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP); CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP),"Vandamme, E (corresponding author), Int Potato Ctr CIP, Rwan, Kigali, Rwanda.",e.vandamme@cgiar.org,,,"CGIAR Research Program on Roots, Tubers and Bananas (RTB); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Trust Fund; Belgian Directorate General for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid (DGDC); Consortium for Improving Agricultural Livelihoods in Central Africa","CGIAR Research Program on Roots, Tubers and Bananas (RTB)(CGIAR); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR); Belgian Directorate General for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid (DGDC); Consortium for Improving Agricultural Livelihoods in Central Africa","We would like to thank James Legg and Bernard Vanlauwe for providing useful comments to earlier versions of the manuscript.

The two Thai and H'mong communities were selected for the household survey. Household livelihood vulnerability in each community was assessed using a composite livelihood vulnerability index that references the IPCC framework. Results were analyzed using a multiple linear regression model with latent variables. The study indicated that the H'mong community is significantly more vulnerable than the Thai community. The H'mong community is more vulnerable to climate change mainly due to the higher level of sensitivity to natural disasters while the ability to adapt to climate change is lower. The key factors determining the vulnerability of the both communities are related to the adaptive capacity that households have including social networks, livelihood strategies and their household demographics. The results are helpful in identifying determinants of livelihood vulnerability to climate change of mountainous ethnic minority communities and may be applicable to other mountainous regions worldwide. Strategies to cope with climate change in the region are suggested.","[Yen Thi Bich Nguyen] Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Fac Nat Resources & Environm, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Leisz, Stephen J.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Anthropol & Geog, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA); Colorado State University,"Nguyen, YTB (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Hanoi, Vietnam.",ntbyen@vnua.edu.vn; steve.leiz@colostate.edu,"Leisz, Stephen/GQY-8145-2022","Leisz, Stephen/0000-0002-0726-8996; Nguyen, Yen/0000-0003-1019-8594","Small Grant Fund, a component of the Vietnam-Australia Human Resource Development Partnership, Australia [SGF-08]","Small Grant Fund, a component of the Vietnam-Australia Human Resource Development Partnership, Australia","This work was supported by the Small Grant Fund, a component of the Vietnam-Australia Human Resource Development Partnership, Australia (grant number SGF-08, 2018).",,63,13,13,5,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

The climate change has an increasingly serious impact on water resources and grain production. Strengthening scientific research in relevant fields of climate change and enhancing grain production in order to adapt to climate change is of vital significance to guarantee food security, improve farmers' income and maintain social stability. This paper constructs a new economic-climate model based on the original Cobb-Dougla (C-D) production function by adding climate factors, and empirically analyzes the impacts of climate change on grain yield and illustrates regional differences. Constraints of water resource restriction on agricultural yields and agricultural planting structure are also proposed. Based on the analysis of the correlation between climate change and grain yield, the relationship between the use of irrigation water and irrigation is proposed. Human factors such as agricultural technology innovation, policy mechanism guarantee and increase in farmland water conservancy construction investment can mitigate all kinds of negative impacts of climate warming on the Chinese agricultural water to a certain extent.","[Lu, Shibao; Li, Wei; Wang, Ning] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Bai, Xiao] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Bai, X (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.",baixiao@zufe.edu.cn,,,"Zhejiang province Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists [LR15E090002]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation [LQ18E090004, LQ16E080006]",Zhejiang province Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),"This research was supported by Zhejiang province Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists (Grant No.: LR15E090002) and Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation (Grant No: LQ18E090004, LQ16E080006).",,37,73,78,44,171,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0040-1625,1873-5509,,TECHNOL FORECAST SOC,Technol.

Important climate-related risks - such as floods and droughts vary by season, year and location, and are modified by water infrastructure. Recent experience of negative impacts increases levels of concern about risks. Risks from droughts were perceived to have significantly worsened. The overall level of awareness of climate change among fish farmers is high, suggesting that future work should focus on building on from how farmers manage risks under the current climate, to then take into account climate change.

Sub-national regions such as the U.S. states wish to increase energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, or adapt to climate change. Evaluating sub-national policies to reduce energy use and emissions is difficult because of the large uncertainties in socioeconomic factors, technology performance and cost and energy and climate policies. Climate change itself may undercut such policies. However, assessing all of the uncertainties of large-scale energy and climate models by performing thousands of model runs can be a significant modeling effort with its accompanying computational burden. By applying fractional-factorial methods to the GCAM-USA 50-state integrated-assessment model in the context of a particular policy question, this paper demonstrates how a decision-focused sensitivity analysis strategy can greatly reduce computational burden in the presence of uncertainty and reveal the important drivers for decisions and more detailed uncertainty analysis.

Environmental damage is increasing, including erosion, salinity, desertification, deforestation, threats, to biodiversity, and water scarcity. Moreover, climate change/variability is having a profound influence on agroecosystems, posing serious threats to food security, human, health, and protection of the environment. Thus, comprehensive agrometeorological adaptation policy guidelines, focusing on preparedness, mitigation, and adaptation measures to support sustainable agricultural development, are needed to cope with the impacts of climate change/variability. Adaptation policy can not be an effective stand alone strategy, but should be incorporated into a broader policy objective. For example, adaptation to climate change should be a part of a broader socio-economic policy such as agricultural, forest, water resources, natural resources, or coastal-zone management policy.

This exploratory qualitative study examines the institutional barriers faced by policymakers in this process, particularly in the health system of concern. We applied in-depth interviews with policymakers, using framework analysis. We identified the barriers to implementing climate change and health programmes and categorized the barriers according to the Framework to diagnose barriers to climate change adaptation. Policymakers identified eight interconnected barriers through the framework: Four barriers in the management phase (insufficient financial resources, frequent turnover, policy-politics disconnect /weak structural support, unsustainable programming), three in the planning phase (heft of bureaucracy/lack of political will, diverging development priorities, insufficient cooperation), one in the larger context of Burkina Faso's environment (national security). The respondents mentioned no barriers in the understanding phase. These barriers are indicative of weak institutional support systems and limited resource allocation to climate and health work in Burkina Faso.","[Sorgho, Raissa; Bhatt, Mahir; Danquah, Ina; Sauerborn, Rainer] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg Inst Global Hlth, Neuenheimer Feld 324, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Sorgho, R (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg Inst Global Hlth, Neuenheimer Feld 324, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",raissa.sorgho@uni-heidelberg.de,,"Danquah, Ina/0000-0003-3222-3498; Bhatt, Mahir/0000-0002-0534-1643",,,,,57,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Based on prior research and stakeholder interactions with policymakers and practitioners in the Nordic countries, we contend that critical issues related to the usefulness of adaptation research seem less associated with content (i.e. research outputs), but rather centre around the efforts made to design and communicate research, that is, to put research at the service of society and make the case for adaptation on the political agenda. This, we argue, to some extent mirrors the situation and political context in the Nordic countries, where adaptation in many locations still is an issue in its infancy, not firmly established on the political agendas, and where working procedures are not yet institutionally settled. In this context, science is considered and sometimes used as a discursive tool to make the case for adaptation. Based on the calls for research that inspires, raises hope and helps to raise the issue of adaptation on the political agendas, we elaborate the role of honest issue advocates for researchers in the field of adaptation science.","[Bohman, Anna; Glaas, Erik; Neset, Tina-Simone; Linner, Bjorn-Ola; Juhola, Sirkku] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Linkoping, Sweden; [Klein, Johannes] Geol Survey Finland, Espoo, Finland; [Landauer, Mia] Univ Lapland, Arctic Ctr, Rovaniemi, Finland; [Landauer, Mia] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Juhola, Sirkku] Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, Helsinki, Finland",Linkoping University; Geological Survey of Finland (GTK); University of Lapland; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Helsinki,"Bohman, A (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Linkoping, Sweden.",anna.bohman@liu.se,"Linnér, Björn-Ola/AAL-2040-2020; Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Landauer, Mia/0000-0002-7153-8495; Klein, Johannes/0000-0003-0721-4063; Neset, Tina-Simone/0000-0003-1151-9943; Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282",,,,,32,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Few empirical studies have however examined households' asset vulnerability and adaptation to such extreme events in Ghana. Based on qualitative research with two ecologically fragile communities in Ghana, this paper explores the asset vulnerability and adaptation strategies of households against periodic flooding. Findings suggested that households' assets most vulnerable to flooding were farmlands, human health, housing and financial savings. However, flooding did not affect households' assets equally; the effects were gendered and differentiated, often occasioned by inequalities in exposure, vulnerability, access to resources, capabilities and opportunities. Nonetheless, many households are actively adapting their assets by acquiring new knowledge about early warning systems, employing different farming practices and diversifying their assets. Understanding the differences in households' asset vulnerability as well as in the priorities that men and women, as well as the young and old, place on different asset adaptation strategies could therefore be important in the effectiveness of climate change adaptation as well as the sustainability of communities.","[Afriyie, Kwadwo] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog & Rural Dev, Sustainable Livelihoods Rural Governance & Povert, Kumasi, Ghana; [Ganle, John Kuumuori] Univ Ghana, Dept Populat Family & Reprod Hlth, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Santos, Eric] Intelligence Nat Int, Accra, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Ghana,"Ganle, JK (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Dept Populat Family & Reprod Hlth, Legon, Accra, Ghana.",johnganle@yahoo.com,,"GANLE, JOHN KUUMUORI/0000-0002-8382-3437",,,,,48,28,29,0,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

As a financial mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the largest dedicated climate fund, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) is critical to achieving this goal. How GCF allocates its resources is therefore a critical area of research. This article assesses GCF's commitment to the local delivery of adaptation finance and identifies the key barriers to GCF's achievement of this commitment. The analysis finds that although GCF's policies and communications fully commit to funding local level adaptation, three key barriers still prevent it from delivering finance to the local level. First, GCF lacks a unified framework for identifying and defining the local level, local actors, and local adaptation processes. Second, GCF exhibits limited transparency and accountability in relation to how approved funding for adaptation is spent, particularly for projects that claim to generate local level adaptation outcomes. Third, some Accredited Entities have limited experience and capacity for designing and implementing projects that deliver finance to the local level. This is because the local delivery of finance is not prioritized by GCF during the accreditation of entities or provision of readiness support to Accredited Entities. Our findings indicate limited evidence of GCF's full operationalization of its commitment to supporting local adaptation. We recommend that GCF develop and apply a unified framework for defining what constitutes 'local'. Key policy insights GCF is committed to supporting local adaptation finance in developing countries but has failed to adequately operationalize this commitment. To increase local delivery of climate finance, GCF should develop a unified framework for local delivery of adapation finance that emphasises local actors' leadership in design, implementation, and management of adaptation projects. GCF should also increase transparency and accountability of funded projects to enable independent assessments of local delivery of adaptation finance by making project information, including financial reports publicly available. GCF should ensure that Accredited Entities have capacity to develop and deliver projects that deliver adaptation finance to the local level e.g. by requiring entities to provide evidence of support for local adaptation during accreditation.","[Omukuti, Jessica] Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc InSIS, Oxford, England; [Omukuti, Jessica] Univ Oxford, Dept Anthropol, Oxford, England; [Barrett, Sam] Int Inst Environm & Dev IIED, London, England; [White, Piran C.

Residential buildings are expected to last at least 50 years according to Brazilian standards. Many residential projects in the sector already perform medium or poorly in terms of energy efficiency and thermal comfort today, and their designs are not analysed considering climate change. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the result of analysing the thermal and energy performance of social housing projects considering climate change, and to assess the impact on the operational phase of introducing energy efficiency measures in the sector, and exploring methods of adaptation to climate change. A representative project of the lower income sector housing was used as case study with the evaluation of measures through thermal and energy simulation with current and future weather files for the cities of Sao Paulo and Salvador. Results were compared using predicted energy consumption and cooling and heating degree-hours as indicators. The results highlighted some differences related to the climate scenarios and indicator analysed, and showed that the incorporation of energy efficiency measures in current social housing projects is of fundamental importance to minimize the effects of climate change in the coming decades.

However, this approach is limited when uncertainty needs to be accounted for. In this paper, we assess coastal flood risk from sea-level rise and extreme events in 120 major cities around the world using an alternative stochastic approach that accounts for uncertainty. Probability distributions of future relative (local) sea-level rise have been used for each city, under three IPPC emission scenarios, RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. The approach allows a continuous stochastic function to be built to assess yearly evolution of damages from 2030 to 2100. Additionally, we present two risk measures that put low-probability, high-damage events in the spotlight: the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES), which enable the damages to be estimated when a certain risk level is exceeded. This level of acceptable risk can be defined involving different stakeholders to guide progressive adaptation strategies. The method presented here is new in the field of economics of adaptation and offers a much broader picture of the challenges related to dealing with climate impacts. Furthermore, it can be applied to assess not only adaptation needs but also to put adaptation into a timeframe in each city.","[Maria Abadie, Luis; Galarraga, Ibon; Sainz de Murieta, Elisa] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Leioa 48940, Spain",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Galarraga, I (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change, Leioa 48940, Spain.",ibon.galarraga@bc3research.org,"Sainz de Murieta, Elisa/D-4946-2012; de Murieta, Elisa Sainz/M-1166-2019; ABADIE, LUIS MARIA/M-7134-2013","Sainz de Murieta, Elisa/0000-0001-8120-3392; de Murieta, Elisa Sainz/0000-0001-8120-3392; ABADIE, LUIS MARIA/0000-0002-2254-6800",European Union [603906]; Basque Government [GIC12/177-IT-399-13]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2015-68023]; Horizon Project RESIN [H2020-DRS-9-2014],"European Union(European Commission); Basque Government(Basque Government); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Horizon Project RESIN","The authors acknowledge funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no 603906, Project: ECONADAPT and Horizon 2020 Project RESIN (grant agreement no.

In these cases, while providing importance to reducing national emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), the priority actions would be addressed to adapting to climate change and to reducing emissions that determine local and regional pollution, which have adverse effects, especially on health. The present paper examines Cuba's contribution to global greenhouse gases emissions, which turns out to be modest. Then, the problem of local pollution in the nation is addressed, reporting data from experimental measurements and comparing them with national regulations. The methodology employed and the results obtained on the levels of pollution generated by the national energy sector and corresponding impacts on health and its costs are discussed. The work may provide support for decision makers on the priorities in the use of available resources, with the aim of environmental preservation. Some approaches about how to deal the right balance of local and global responsibilities for countries as Cuba, are also presented. As the development of those countries proceeds, their contribution to GHG emissions is expected to become more relevant.

The nature of the linkages depends on the dimensions: economic, institutional or environmental, and on the scale. Differences are pervasive: adaptation and mitigation usually have different temporal and spatial scales and are mostly relevant for different economic sectors, so that costs and benefits are distributed differently. The article concludes that generally the global, regional and - in most countries - national potential of synergetic options to mitigate and adapt to climate change is relatively low, and both strategies should be considered as complementary. However, a few notable exceptions are identified in the land and water management and urban planning sectors, in particular in countries or locations where these sectors provide important adaptation and mitigation opportunities. What is the theoretically most efficient and least expensive mixture of adaptation and mitigation policies may not be a very urgent policy question. Instead, five pragmatic ways of broadening climate policy are suggested, while taking into account the linkages between adaptation and mitigation: (1) avoiding trade-offs - when designing policies for mitigation or adaptation, (2) identifying synergies, (3) enhancing response capacity, (4) developing institutional links between adaptation and mitigation - e.g. in national institutions and in international negotiations, and (5) mainstreaming adaptation and mitigation considerations into broader sustainable development policies.","[Swart, Rob] Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, MNP, NL-3720 AH Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Raes, Frank] Joint Res Ctr European Union, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, Italy",Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Swart, R (corresponding author), Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, MNP, POB 303, NL-3720 AH Bilthoven, Netherlands.",Rob.Swart@rivm.nl,,"Swart, Rob/0000-0002-1563-1150",,,,,41,168,168,0,70,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Methodology developed for the MINK study has improved the ability of impacts analysis to deal with questions of (1) spatial and temporal variability in climate change; (2) CO2-enrichment effects; (3) the reactions of complex enterprises (farms and forests) to climate change and their ability to adjust and adapt; and (4) integrated effects on current and, more particularly, on future regional economies. The methodology also provides for systematic study of adjustment and adaptation opportunities and of the inter-industry linkages that determine what the overall impacts on the regional economy might be. The analysis shows that with a 1930s 'dust bowl' climate the region-wide economic impacts would be small, after adjustments in affected sectors. In this final paper we consider whether synergistic effects among sectoral impacts and more severe climate change scenarios might alter this conclusion. The MINK analysis, as is, leads to the conclusion that a strong research capacity will be required to ensure that technologies facilitating adaptation to climate change will be available when needed. The capacity to deal with climate change also requires an open economy allowing for free trade and movement of people and for institutions that protect unpriced environmental values. More severe climate scenarios and negative synergisms can only strengthen these conclusions.","PACIFIC NW LAB, WASHINGTON, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"CROSSON, PR (corresponding author), RESOURCES FUTURE INC, 1616 P ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA.",,,,,,,,8,9,9,0,3,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

However, its adoption rate has been low despite the decade of dissemination in Asia, especially in the Philippines. Using cross-sectional farm-level survey data, this study empirically explored factors shaping AWD adoption in a gravity surface irrigation system. We used regression-based approaches to examine the factors influencing farmers' adoption of AWD and its impact on yield. Results showed that the majority of the AWD adopters were farmers who practiced enforced rotational irrigation (RI) scheduling within their irrigators' association (IA). With the current irrigation management system, the probability of AWD implementation increases when farmers do not interfere with the irrigation schedule (otherwise they opt to go with flooding). Interestingly, the awareness factor did not play a significant role in the farmers' adoption due to the RI setup. However, the perception of water management as an effective weed control method was positively significant, suggesting that farmers are likely to adopt AWD if weeds are not a major issue in their field. Furthermore, the impact on grain yields did not differ with AWD. Thus, given the RI scheduling already in place within the IA, we recommend fine-tuning this setup following the recommended safe AWD at the IA scale.","[Samoy-Pascual, Kristine; Rafael, Marvelin; Regalado, Manuel Jose] DA Philippine Rice Res Inst, Rice Engn & Mechanizat Div, Sci City Munoz, Nueva Ecija 3119, Philippines; [Yadav, Sudhir; Evangelista, Gio; Burac, Mary Ann; Cabangon, Romeo] Int Rice Res Inst, Sustainable Impact Platform, Los Banos 4031, Philippines; [Tokida, Takeshi] Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Natl Agr & Food Res Org, 3-1-3,Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Mizoguchi, Masaru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Global Agr Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan",CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan; University of Tokyo,"Samoy-Pascual, K (corresponding author), DA Philippine Rice Res Inst, Rice Engn & Mechanizat Div, Sci City Munoz, Nueva Ecija 3119, Philippines.;Yadav, S (corresponding author), Int Rice Res Inst, Sustainable Impact Platform, Los Banos 4031, Philippines.",kspascual@exchange.philrice.gov.ph; s.yadav@irri.org; g.evangelista@irri.org; m.burac@irri.org; ml.rafael@philrice.gov.ph; r.cabangon221@gmail.com; tokida@affrc.go.jp; amizo@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp; mjcregalado@exchange.philrice.gov.ph,"Yadav, Sudhir/K-7110-2012; Samoy-Pascual, Kristine/AAZ-5237-2020; Tokida, Takeshi/F-7203-2010","Yadav, Sudhir/0000-0001-7658-8144; Samoy-Pascual, Kristine/0000-0003-1224-1314; Mizoguchi, Masaru/0000-0001-8175-4880; Evangelista, Gio/0000-0001-8623-6046; Tokida, Takeshi/0000-0001-7245-2952","The DA-Bureau of Agricultural Research [PhilRice-RTF-002-246, IRRI-A-2017-21]; The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) [81016734]",The DA-Bureau of Agricultural Research; The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),The DA-Bureau of Agricultural Research funded the survey under project WateRice (PhilRice-RTF-002-246 and IRRI-A-2017-21).

These stressors are posing challenges to cities in terms of housing, infrastructure and provision of basic services as well as climate change adaptation. Despite the high dynamics and novel characteristics of city transformation, this urban transition seems to take place rather quietly' and has, so far, obviously hardly been understood or appreciated by researchers and governments. Subsequently, the multifaceted and extremely challenging problems associated with the process of urbanisation cannot be adequately addressed. Green infrastructure (GI) is currently emerging as a concept for cost-effective urban sustainability and livelihood security. Preservation and provision of accessible urban green spaces is increasingly recognised as an essential part of the liveability of cities. Extensive literature review revealed that the systematic integration of GI concepts in urban planning is seen by an increasing number of researchers as an essential approach to tackle major current and future challenges. Based on the literature review, we suggest that broadening the concept of urban GI by linking it to governance and rights-based conceptualisations will have the potential to unlock more resourceful paths for sustainable, green, and inclusive urban development of cities in Southern and Eastern Africa.","[Titz, Alexandra] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Inst Geog, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Chiotha, Sosten S.] LEAD Southern & Eastern Africa, Fishing Flies Rd, Zomba, Malawi",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Titz, A (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Inst Geog, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany.",alexandra.titz@fau.de; schiotha@leadsea.mw,,,Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"Research for this particular paper received no external funding.

These two drivers for adaptation are often in conflict in many secondary cities in the global south (SCGS). It is possible to align these seemingly conflicting drivers into a productive unity, a conceptual alignment, which is the first step in achieving harmony while implementing adaptation actions. This paper focuses on the practical aspects of implementing aligned adaptation action that leads to improvements in liveability, sustainability, and resilience of SCGS. At an abstract level, the nature of the adaptation problem is similar to the complex problems identified in various domains, such as software development, manufacturing, and supply chain management. The widely accepted agile principles-used in the above domains-is the basis for developing a set of twelve principles for urban adaptation, which are synthesized from numerous recent studies that have implicitly proposed or applied most of these principles to climate change adaptation in urban settings. These principles lead to four essential objectives appertaining to the process of sustainable urban adaptation. The urban agile principles are used to analyze the current state of adaptation of Can Tho City in Vietnam and to ascertain the agile ways of addressing its adaptation challenges. Analysis of the outcomes shows that harmonized approaches can simultaneously address both adaptation deficits and gaps.","[Pathirana, Assela; Radhakrishnan, Mohanasundar; Ashley, Richard; Zevenbergen, Chris] UNESCO IHE Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands; [Pathirana, Assela; Radhakrishnan, Mohanasundar; Ashley, Richard] Cooperat Res Ctr Water Sensit Cities, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Nguyen Hong Quan] Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City VNU HCM, IER, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City,"Pathirana, A (corresponding author), UNESCO IHE Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands.;Pathirana, A (corresponding author), Cooperat Res Ctr Water Sensit Cities, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",assela@pathirana.net,,"Pathirana, Assela/0000-0003-0907-1764; Nguyen, Hong Quan/0000-0001-7685-8191",EPSRC [EP/I029346/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,53,3,3,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Empirical research on the effects of climate change on the delta's agriculture and an assessment of the vulnerability are becoming necessary. This study explores the vulnerability of farm households to sea level rise using two methods: the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI), which is comprised of 37 indicators, and the Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index (SeVI), which contains 35 indicators. Interviews with 178 farmers were conducted in Bogale, Pyapon and Dedaye Townships in Pyapon District. In addition, 7 focus group discussions were performed, with at least 2 discussions in each Township. Both methods identify Bogale to be the most vulnerable Township, followed by Dedaye and Pyapon Townships. Following the LVI approach, Bogale Township has the highest sensitivity to climate effects and the highest exposure to natural hazards, but also a higher adaptive capacity than the other townships. In contrast using the SeVI approach, Bogale was found to have the highest sensitivity and exposure to natural hazards but the lowest adaptive capacity score. The study found that the climate change adaptation measures taken by the farmers are important to limit vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and thus promotion of the adaptive capacity of farmers is important for the delta region of Myanmar.","[Oo, Aung Tun; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido; Speelman, Stijn] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Oo, AT (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium.",aungtun.oo@ugent.be,,"speelman, stijn/0000-0001-7692-3459; Tun Oo, Aung/0000-0003-2203-5549",World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) _Russell E.

Therefore examining the vulnerability of these factors is essential to identify the reason and recognise the most vulnerable communities. This study is an attempt to study on the vulnerability of the factors of household food utilisation and its linkage with climatic changes in Malaysia. The study is based on primary data collected in the months of July-October, 2012 through a questionnaire survey on 460 low income households from East Coast Economic Region (ECER) in Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database, based on cluster random sampling technique. The study found that the vulnerability of the factors of household food utilisation has increased statistically significantly over the last five years period due to difference between rural and city food quality, occurrences of natural disasters, incidences of mosquitoes, insects, pest, etc., and diseases like dengue, malaria, heat stretch, cold, skin disease, etc. This study suggests that the food security programs need to be integrated with climatic change adaptation programs to ensure more effective and sustainable household food security in future, especially among the poor and low income group.","[Alam, Md.

On the one hand, floods destroy human heritage and jeopardize sustainable development, which can be defined as 11 non-decreasing quality of life.  On the other hand, following the most common interpretation of sustainable development, one should not choose flood protection policies that could be rated by future generations as inappropriate options of flood defense. This is how several large structural flood defenses are often viewed. Non-structural measures are in better agreement with the spirit of sustainable development, being more reversible, commonly acceptable, and environment-friendly. Among such measures are source control (watershed/landscape structure management), laws and regulations (including zoning), economic instruments, an efficient flood forecast-warning system, a system of flood risk assessment, awareness raising, flood-related data bases, etc. As flood safety cannot be reached in most vulnerable areas with the help of structural means only, further flood risk reduction via non-structural measures is usually indispensable, and a site-specific mix of structural and non-structural measures seems to be a proper solution. Since sustainabiliiy requires thinking about the future generations, the climate change issue becomes important. Non-structural measures lend themselves well to application in climate change adaptation strategies. As uncertainty in the assessment of climate change impacts is high, flexibility of adaptation strategies is particularly advantageous.","Polish Acad Sci, Res Ctr Agr & Forest Environm, Poznan, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences,"Kundzewicz, ZW (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Res Ctr Agr & Forest Environm, Poznan, Poland.",zkundze@man.poznan.pl,,,,,,,39,100,100,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0250-8060,1941-1707,,WATER INT,Water Int.,MAR,2002,27,1,,,,,3,13,,10.1080/02508060208686972,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02508060208686972,,,11,"Engineering, Civil; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Water Resources,549QL,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000175455700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, the Thousand Pillars Dwelling (TPD) is taken as a research objective to explore its climate adaptation strategies and effectiveness for the local climate in the view of passive elements (PEs) and passive spaces (PSs). By the methodologies of literature reviews, field investigations and software simulations, the buffer effect (BE) created by PEs (composed of doors, windows, walls etc.) and PSs (composed of patios, corridors etc.) contributing to the improvement of indoor comfort level (ICL) is researched qualitatively. An additional study on in-situ measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and illuminance in diverse parts of TPD was carried out to research their effectiveness of climate adaptation quantitatively. This study shows that BEs are effective at mitigating the impact of outdoor climate on internal spaces, which is helpful for the extension of indoor comfort time (EICT) by 3472 h per year. The research results of passive strategies are summarized from the study case of TPD and its effectiveness of climate adaptation can provide some methods and implications to create more comfortable indoor environments for rural residences.

The study used content analysis of existing policy documents to understand if specific variables are explicit, implicit or not mentioned in four urban and climate change policies in Ghana. It was found that there is a minimal degree of coherence only in the adaptation measures, but there is a general lack of coherence in the motivation and implementation. This can be attributed to radically different current institutional arrangements for urban planning and climate change, inconsistent use of data and terminologies, and lack of embracement of innovations in urban planning in African cities. The findings suggest that attention must be given to integrated collaborative adaptation planning to address these impediments in urban planning context of African cities.","[Ahmed, Abubakari; Akanbang, Bernard Afiik A.; Derbile, Emmanuel K.] SD Dombo Univ Business & Integrated Dev Studies, Fac Planning & Land Management, Dept Planning, Wa, Ghana; [Poku-Boansi, Michael] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Ahmed, A (corresponding author), SD Dombo Univ Business & Integrated Dev Studies, Fac Planning & Land Management, Dept Planning, Wa, Ghana.",abukson1987@gmail.com,"Ahmed, Abubakari/AAM-7972-2020; Ahmed, Abubakari/GQZ-7476-2022","Ahmed, Abubakari/0000-0001-5574-614X; Poku-Boansi, Michael/0000-0003-4929-0961; Derbile, Emmanuel Kanchebe/0000-0001-6215-9090; Akanbang, Bernard Afiik Akanpabadai/0000-0001-7968-7877",International Foundation For Science [I-3-S-6470-1],International Foundation For Science(International Foundation for Science),This work was funded by the International Foundation For Science.

Understanding how biogeochemical transformation and erosion-induced SOC redistribution influence SOC profiles and stocks is critical to our food security and adaptation to climate change. The important roles of erosion and deposition on SOC dynamics have drawn increasing attention in the past decades, but quantifying such dynamics is still challenging. Here we develop a process-based quasi 3-D model that couples surface runoff, soil moisture dynamics, biogeochemical transformation, and landscape evolution. We apply this model to a subcatchment in Iowa to understand how natural forcing and farming practices affect the SOC dynamics in the critical zone. The net soil thickness and SOC stock change rates are -0.336 (mm/yr) and -1.9 (gC/m(2)/year), respectively. Our model shows that in a fast transport landscape, SOC transport is the dominant control on SOC dynamics compared to biogeochemical transformation. The SOC profiles have noses below the surface at depositional sites, which are consistent with cores sampled at the same site. Generally, erosional sites are local net atmospheric carbon sinks and vice versa for depositional sites, but exceptions exist as seen in the simulation results. Furthermore, the mechanical soil mixing arising from tillage enhances SOC stock at erosional sites and reduces it at depositional ones. This study not only helps us understand the evolution of SOC stock and profiles in a watershed but can also serve as an instrument to develop practical means for protecting carbon loss due to human activities. Plain Language Summary Understanding how soil organic carbon (SOC) content changes in space and time are critical for our food security and adaptation to climate change. It changes through the belowground transformationdecomposition of litter and release of CO2, and surficial transportlateral physical redistribution. The balance between the two interactions has been strongly shifted by human activities. Quantifying such interactions has remained challenging. Here we developed a 3-D model, which simulates the movement and burial of SOC and compare the impacts of natural and human activities in the critical zone. We apply this model to a watershed in Iowa. Our results show that the net soil thickness and SOC stock change rates are both decreasing. The fast burial of legacy carbon by modern carbon results in a nose profile at depositional sites, which is consistent with soil cores sampled in the watershed. The lateral transport rate can be significantly larger than the transformation rate, but this balance is modified by the mechanical mixing from tillage. Generally, erosional sites are net sinks for atmospheric carbon and depositional sites are net sources. The model can serve as an important tool for protecting soil carbon change caused by both human and natural events.","[Yan, Qina; Le, Phong V.

We describe examples of real-world forest-management planning projects that integrate climate change information with this resource to identify actions that simultaneously benefit forest carbon along with other project goals. These examples highlight that the inclusion of information on climate vulnerability, considering the implications of management actions over extended timescales, and identifying co-benefits for other management goals can reveal important synergies in managing for carbon and climate adaptation.","[Ontl, Todd A.; Janowiak, Maria K.; Swanston, Christopher W.; Handler, Stephen] US Forest Serv, Northern Inst Appl Climate Sci, USDA, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Ontl, Todd A.; Swanston, Christopher W.] USDA, Northern Forests Climate Hub, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Daley, Jad] Amer Forests, Washington, DC USA; [Cornett, Meredith] Nature Conservancy, Duluth, MN USA; [Hagenbuch, Steve] Natl Audubon Soc, Huntington, VT USA; [Handrick, Cathy] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Grand Rapids, MN USA; [McCarthy, Liza] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Two Harbors, MN USA; [Patch, Nancy] Vermont Dept Forests Pk & Recreat, St Albans, VT USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Ontl, TA (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Northern Inst Appl Climate Sci, USDA, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.;Ontl, TA (corresponding author), USDA, Northern Forests Climate Hub, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",todd.ontl@usda.gov; maria.janowiak@usda.gov; christopher.swanston@usda.gov; jdaley@americanforests.org; stephen.handler@usda.gov; mcornett@tnc.org; shagenbuch@audubon.org; cathy.handrick@state.mn.us; liza.mccarthy@state.mn.us; nancy.patch@vermont.gov,,"Ontl, Todd/0000-0003-4036-4848",,,,,70,51,52,22,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-1201,1938-3746,,J FOREST,J.

This leads to more research in climate adaptive strategies such as traditional design methods, construction techniques and building materials. Traditional dwelling has been successful in achieving harmony between dwelling and climatic environment, which is one of the most important conditions for sustainability. Firstly, this paper focused on analyzing the characteristics of traditional dwellings in Qinba mountainous areas to adapt to the climatic environment. Secondly, two typical dwellings constructed respectively with brick and earth materials were selected for monitoring and simulating of its indoor thermal, luminous and ventilation environment in summer and winter. In addition, the research summarized the advantages and disadvantages of the dwelling's physical environment in response to climatic characteristics. It revealed that the traditional earth dwelling is well adapted to the local climate during summer, although the indoor thermal comfort is not fully satisfactory during winter. Finally, we prompted effective climate adaptive strategies of traditional earth dwelling, such as natural ventilation, thermal insulation and thermal buffer space. We want to provide guidance and reference for the development of traditional dwellings in the mountainous areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In response, they are developing climate action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones, relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty, supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors: support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines. More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed. Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in national planning policies.","[Smith, A.

Sixteen climate extreme indices were analyzed using ClimPACT2 tool and nine hydrological extremes using IHA tool. Five CMIP6-based climate models driven by SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios were used to project the future climate. Results showed that the SWWs have experienced progressive warming and increased rainfall during the historical period (1980-2014), and this rising trend is projected to be more prominent in the future (2021-2100), posing risks to the socio-environmental equilibrium.

We show in a model that directed innovation can either mitigate or exacerbate climate change's potential economic damage depending on the substitutability between new technology and favorable climatic conditions. To empirically investigate the technological response to climate change, we measure crop-specific exposure to damaging extreme temperatures and crop-specific innovation embodied in new variety releases and patents. We find that innovation has redirected since the mid-twentieth century toward crops with increasing exposure to extreme temperatures. Moreover, this effect is driven by types of agricultural technology most related to environmental adaptation. We next show that U.S. counties' exposure to induced innovation significantly dampens the local economic damage from extreme temperatures. Combining these estimates with the model, we find that directed innovation has offset 20% of potential losses in U.S. agricultural land value due to damaging climate trends since 1960 and that innovation could offset 13% of projected damage by 2100. These findings highlight the vital importance, but incomplete effectiveness, of endogenous technological change as a source of adaptation to climate change.","[Moscona, Jacob; Sastry, Karthik A.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Moscona, Jacob; Sastry, Karthik A.] Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Harvard University,"Moscona, J (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Moscona, J (corresponding author), Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",,,,,,,,85,0,0,20,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

As wind erosion is controlled by climatic factors, research on this phenomenon is urgently needed in soil and land management in order to better adapt to climate change. In this paper, the impact of wind erosion on the soil surface in relation to particle size distribution was investigated. Changes in percentage of sand, silt and clay fractions based on historical KPP data (1961-1970), LUCAS data base (2009), and field measurements (2016) were analysed in five cadastral areas impacted by wind erosion (Zahorie Lowlands, Slovakia). With the use of GIS tools, models of spatial distribution of sand, silt, clay and erodible fraction (EF) content were developed based on those measurements. Our findings proved that soil texture change driven by wind erosion could happen relatively quickly, and a significant proportion of soil fine particles may be carried away within a few years. The results indicate that the soil surface became much rougher over the period of more than 50 years, but also that the accumulation of fraction of the silt particles occurred in most of the areas affected by the erosive effect.","[Lackoova, Lenka] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Hort & Landscape Engn, Dept Landscape Planning & Ground Consolidat, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Pokryvkova, Jozefina] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Hort & Landscape Engn, Dept Water Resources & Environm Engn, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Dufkova, Jana Kozlovsky] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac AgriSci, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Policht-Latawiec, Agnieszka] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Land Reclamat & Environm Dev, Fac Environm Engn & Land Surveying, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Michalowska, Krystyna] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Geodesy, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland; [Michalowska, Krystyna] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Environm Engn & Land Surveying, Dept Geodesy, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Dabrowska, Jolanta] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, Dept Civil Engn, PL-50363 Wroclaw, Poland",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Mendel University in Brno; Agricultural University Krakow; Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; Agricultural University Krakow; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences,"Michalowska, K (corresponding author), Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Geodesy, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.;Michalowska, K (corresponding author), Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Environm Engn & Land Surveying, Dept Geodesy, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland.",lenka.lackoova@uniag.sk; jozefina.pokryykova@uniag.sk; jana.dufkova@mendelu.cz; a.policht@urk.edu.pl; krystyna.michalowska@pg.edu.pl; jolanta.dabrowska@upwr.edu.pl,"Pokrývková, Jozefína/AAG-9432-2020; Lackóová, Lenka/ABA-1856-2021; Dąbrowska, Jolanta/S-7901-2016; Dufkova, Jana Kozlovsky/K-8101-2018","Pokrývková, Jozefína/0000-0002-1545-2515; Lackóová, Lenka/0000-0002-1921-0708; Dąbrowska, Jolanta/0000-0002-6017-6919; Dufkova, Jana Kozlovsky/0000-0002-4603-6936; /0000-0001-7749-3622",Integrated Infrastructure Operational Programme - ERDF [ITMS2014+ 313011W580]; SUA grant agency [09-GASPU-2021],Integrated Infrastructure Operational Programme - ERDF; SUA grant agency,"This research is the result of the projects: Scientific support of climate change adaptation in agriculture and mitigation of soil degradation, (ITMS2014+ 313011W580) supported by the Integrated Infrastructure Operational Programme funded by the ERDF.

Making scientific knowledge locally relevant can be assisted by an understanding of the way ` placed knowledge' comes into being. Taking two prominent conceptions of place (Massey and Ingold), we ground these empirically using narratives from graziers in the eastern Australian rangelands. We examine placed conceptions of risk and uncertainty and the ways they are linked to narratives of identity, local environmental change, and understandings of place. Paying heed to narratives enables a reframing of risk and uncertainty into locally-meaningful forms. This fosters dialogue between various epistemic communities in ways that acknowledge and respect different ways of knowing and differences in the content of knowledge. It provides an analytical basis for scientists and institutions to reflect on the applicability of their information and technology in particular contexts. With this approach, scientists, policymakers and other rural community stakeholders can develop their awareness of how placed narratives link social practices and locally-legitimate understandings of good farm management and biophysical systems. This will help to ` place' science for NRM, agricultural extension and rural development.","[Leith, Peat] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Vanclay, Frank] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Cultural Geog, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Tasmania; University of Groningen,"Leith, P (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Peat.Leith@utas.edu.au; frank.vanclay@rug.nl,"Leith, Peat/ABB-2829-2021; Vanclay, Frank/B-2194-2008","Vanclay, Frank/0000-0002-9945-6432","University of Tasmania; Land and Water Australia; Australian Wool Innovations through the Land, Water and Wool programme","University of Tasmania; Land and Water Australia; Australian Wool Innovations through the Land, Water and Wool programme","This research was supported by the University of Tasmania, Land and Water Australia, and Australian Wool Innovations through the Land, Water and Wool programme.

Against this background one possible adaptation measure is a holistic approach and the management of water according to the basin principle. This article examines current water sector reforms and especially the transformation from administrative to hydrological boundaries. It concludes that this transformation might help to make the South African water governance system more adaptive to climate change. However, the analysis shows that the transformation towards hydrological boundaries is affected by a number of trade-offs. These are the trade-offs between, firstly, (a) the improved fit between the social and the ecological system and (b) the misfit between scales within the social system. Secondly, a trade-off exists between (a) correct classification along hydrological boundaries (holistic approach) and (b) a feasible size for effective management, meaningful stakeholder participation and financial viability, which may require a splitting and merging of hydrological entities and thus a violation of the hydrological principle.

To assess the impact of increased precipitation intensity on water security, we applied a regional-scale hydrological and soil erosion model, forced with regional climate model projections. We specifically considered the impact of climate change on the distribution of water between soil (green water) and surface water (blue water) compartments. We show that an increase in precipitation intensity leads to a redistribution of water within the catchment, where water storage in soil decreases and reservoir inflow increases. This affects plant water stress and the potential of rainfed versus irrigated agriculture, and increases dependency on reservoir storage, which is potentially threatened by increased soil erosion. This study demonstrates the crucial importance of accounting for the fact that increased precipitation intensity leads to water redistribution between green and blue water, increased soil erosion, and reduced water security. Ultimately, this has implications for design of climate change adaptation measures, which should aim to increase the water holding capacity of the soil (green water) and to maintain the storage capacity of reservoirs (blue water), benefiting rainfed and irrigated agriculture.","[Eekhout, Joris P.

Third, based on selected urban studies, we examine how inter-relationships between the two policy objectives or practical measures have been studied, in which context, and what is the main outcome of these studies. We also present what suggestions there are for solving conflicts, and how synergies can be enhanced in urban areas.

Telephone surveys were conducted with landholders from viticultural (n = 97) or cereal growing (n = 195) backgrounds in rural South Australia. A variety of descriptive and inferential statistics were used to examine the influence of human-induced climate change and winter/spring drying trend terms on adaptation responses and uncertainties surrounding climate change science. We found that the terms used to describe climate change leads to significant differences in adaptation response and levels of scepticism surrounding climate change in rural populations. For example, those respondents who accepted human induced climate change as a reality were significantly more likely to invest in technologies to sow crops earlier or increase the amount of water stored or harvested on their properties than respondents who accepted the winter/spring drying trend as a reality. The results have implications for the targeting of climate change science messages to both rural landholders and communities of practice involved in climate change adaptation planning and implementation.

Climate change projections indicate impacts will likely worsen with increasing risk to forest operations and resources. Despite the calls for adaptation, there is little evidence that adaptation is taking place, whether in terms of planning or practices. Much of the forest industry response to date has been ad hoc and reactive. In contrast, Louisiana-Pacific Canada Ltd. (LP) in Swan Valley, MB decided to proactively address climate impacts and risks. A Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) was completed to review past weather-related disruptions, identify their vulnerabilities to both the current weather extremes and to future climates. Through the help of an independent facilitator, the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers' guidebook was tailored to meet LP's context and needs. The CVA team identified a wide range of possible adaptation options and created business cases for short-listed adaption priorities that LP is beginning to pursue and implement. The outcomes from this effort show what is necessary to support an adaptation process that is mainstreamed into company decision-making procedures and can be applied more broadly across the Canadian forest sector. One key innovation was the incorporation of business cases into the assessment. Identifying and quantifying the expected benefits helped support vulnerability implementation in several different ways. Furthermore, at a more systemic level, the experience identifies the importance local knowledge plays in advancing adaptation action and how these local efforts can contribute towards supporting more effective climate adaptation action across the entire forest management system. This work also contributes to laying the groundwork for future policy focus, integrating science, and management into forest management systems.","[Andrews-Key, Sheri A.] Innovat Climate Strategies, Saskatoon, SK S7H 0B2, Canada; [LeBlanc, Paul A.] Louisiana Pacific Canada Ltd, Forest Resources Div, Swan River, MB R0L 1Z0, Canada; [Nelson, Harry W.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Andrews-Key, SA (corresponding author), Innovat Climate Strategies, Saskatoon, SK S7H 0B2, Canada.",sheri@climatestrategies.ca,,,Natural Resources Canada,Natural Resources Canada(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service),"This Climate Vulnerability Assessment was part of a larger research project, the Northern Prairie Forests Regional Integrated Assessment funded by Natural Resources Canada.

The shorter the drying time before wet storage, i.e., faster delivery to the mill, the more significant the increase in MC. The increase in MC during wet storage was more significant in pulpwood with a low degree of bark damage. Climate-adapted wet storage reduced the variation of the MC.

Studies of the effectiveness of management measures in the field of land use showed that in the period 2000-2009, responding measures for climate change prevention were mostly targeted, and in 2010-2020 acquired signs of systemicity, while for the entire study period the effectiveness of adaptation measures underwent minor changes. At the same time, having positive dynamics, but different trends in the period from 2012 to 2014, measures to respond and adapt to climate challenges equalized in effectiveness. It is found that after 2014, more efforts, financial resources and means have begun to be spent on combating the consequences than on measures to adapt to climate change. This means that the current land management system needs immediate transformation. After all, it is impossible to allow any extreme phenomena to jeopardize the food security of the state. The effectiveness of management activities should be not only in a timely response, but first of all in trying to be proactive reducing vulnerability and increasing the resilience of land use to climate change. Originality / scientific novelty. This is the first comparative analysis of the effectiveness of land management measures regarding the interaction of climate change with land use according to indicators in dynamics. The need to increase the adaptive capacity to reduce potential losses in land use in the future is substantiated. Practical value / implications. The results of the study can serve as a basis for modernization of existing land use projects and improvement of ways to manage them on the basis of low-carbon development to ensure food security of the population of Ukraine in the context of climate change.","[Budziak, Olha] Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Kiev, Ukraine; [Budziak, Vasyl] State Univ Trade & Econ, Kiev, Ukraine; [Drebot, Oksana] Polissia Natl Univ Ukraine, Zhytomyr, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Taras Shevchenko National University Kiev; State University of Trade & Economics,"Budziak, O (corresponding author), Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Kiev, Ukraine.",,"Будзяк, Василь/HNT-0559-2023; Budziak, Olha/HHC-3572-2022","Budziak, Olha/0000-0003-3690-1735",,,,,29,0,0,4,4,INST EASTERN EUROPEAN RESEARCH & CONSULTING,KHARKIV,"EDUC CAMPUS KNAU, KHARKIV, UKRAINE",,2414-584X,,AGR RESOUR EC INT SC,Agric.

When this happens, socio-economic livelihoods, particularly in developing economies, would be dealt lethal blow in the wake of associated natural causes such as increased disease burden, soil nutrient destruction, desertification, food insecurity, among others. To avert imminent dangers, nations, including those from Africa, signed a legally binding universally accepted climate control protocol to propagate and regulate environmentally-friendly behaviours globally. The climate vulnerability of Africa as established by literature is concerning. Despite contributing relatively less than other continents to aggregate environmental injustice, the continent is projected to bear the most brunt of environmental degradation. This is on account of her inability to put systems and mechanisms in place to stem consequences of climate change. Hence, our resolve to use a combination of scientific and artistic models to design a response system for tackling climate challenges in Africa. Our model formulation encompasses computational model and creative arts model for drawing attention to environmentally friendly behaviours and climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. In this work, we focus on rural Africa to share experience of climate change impact on agriculture mainstay of rural African economy. We examine the carbon footprints of a rural community in Nigeria the Adum-Aiona community as case study and for industrial experience. The authors will provide operational data to substantiate claims of existential threats posed by greenhouse gas (GHG) generation on livelihoods of rural dwellers. The study will also design and test a Climate Change Response System (CCRS) that will enable people to adapt and reduce climate change impact. To achieve the research objective, the researchers will review literature, gather requirements, model the proposed system using Unified Modelling Language (UML), and test CCRS statically. We expect that the implementation of the proposed system will enable people mitigate the effects of, and adapt to, climate change-induced socio-economic realities. This is besides the fact that the empirical data provided by the study will help clear doubts about the real or perceived threats of climate change. Finally, the industrial experience and case study we share from Africa using model-driven engineering approach will scale up the repository of knowledge of both climate change research and model-driven engineering community.","[Okewu, Emmanuel] Univ Lagos, Ctr Informat Technol & Syst, Lagos, Nigeria; [Misra, Sanjay] Covenant Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Ota, Nigeria; [Misra, Sanjay] Atilim Univ, Ankara, Turkey; [Okewu, Jonathan] Fed Univ, Dept Visual & Creat Arts, Lafia, Nigeria",University of Lagos; Covenant University; Atilim University,"Okewu, E (corresponding author), Univ Lagos, Ctr Informat Technol & Syst, Lagos, Nigeria.",okewue@yahoo.com; sanjay.misra@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; jonathan.okewu@gmail.com,"Misra, Sanjay/K-2203-2014","Misra, Sanjay/0000-0002-3556-9331",,,,,58,6,6,0,10,POLITECHNIKA LUBELSKA,LUBLIN,"WYDZIAL INZYNIERII SRODOWSKA, UL NADBYSTRZYCKA 40 B, LUBLIN, 20-618, POLAND",1895-6912,,,PROBL EKOROZW,Probl.

Uncertainty about the timing, structure, and potential impact of proposed legislation such as a national carbon abatement scheme, is leading to planning delays across the country. To assist with these policy uncertainties, organizations can embed themselves in multilevel governance frameworks that inform, structure, and facilitate strategic development, planning, and action. As part of these networks, organizational representatives also engage in formal and informal forums, a type of interorganizational relationship, which can include industry task forces, policy development committees, interagency groups, and specific climate change committees. Forums constitute an additional level of governance that influences decision making. The patterns of relationships within these multilevel governance frameworks are examined in this paper, with a focus on the forum level of organizational cooperation. Specifically, we investigate the type of forums operating and their role in supporting organizational responses to climate change. A series of interviews and focus groups were conducted in two study areas, the Swan Canning region of Western Australia and the Hunter / Central Coast region of New South Wales. The results indicate that organizations participate in a diverse range of forums. Further, forums appear to play a key role in the everyday business of organizations by enhancing their ability to plan and address a range of issues, including those associated with climate change. In addition the research highlights some of the barriers and drivers for the development and implementation of climate adaptation practices that emerge from forum discussions. For example, a lack of government guidance in interpreting climate change policy was described as a barrier yet access to the knowledge and expertise of participants was highlighted as a potential driver. The paper discusses how an ability to create new forums and utilize existing nonclimate related forums assists organizations in addressing climate change impacts. We contend that forums constitute a level of governance deeply embedded in organizational practice that influences both their capacity and motivation to undertake climate adaptation. Our findings suggest that research investigating the rules that govern forums and the structural properties of the networks in which they are embedded is required to further understand the role of multilevel governance in shaping organizational responses to climate change.","[Bates, Lorraine E.; Green, Melissa; Leonard, Rosemary; Walker, Iain] CSIRO Social & Econ Sci Program, Wembley, WA, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Bates, LE (corresponding author), CSIRO Social & Econ Sci Program, Wembley, WA, Australia.",,"Green, Melissa/L-1773-2015; Walker, Iain/G-5457-2010","Walker, Iain/0000-0002-1020-5873",CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship,CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),The authors wish to acknowledge the support of the CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship in providing funding for this research effort as a strategic initiative.

Despite the growing understanding that Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) represent efficient solutions to facilitate adaptation to climate change and increase cities' resilience, their wide-scale adoption is still limited. There is a need to include NBS in urban governance and planning agendas through policy instruments, such as plan/legislative, economic and information instruments. However, there is a lack of studies that assess such policy instruments and, through the use of specific examples, how they can foster NBS adoption. The objective of this study is to address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review, using a bibliometric and a content analysis, collating and reviewing papers that consider policy instruments and NBS in order to: (i) assess the existence of policy instruments that influence the adoption of NBS; and (ii) evaluate the existence of specific examples of policy instruments. Results show that plan/legislative instruments are most mentioned, followed by economic and information instruments.

We tested these predictions against the distribution of previously recorded projectile points in the Paleoindian Database of the Americas and archaeological sites in the Digital Index of North American Archaeology for the Tennessee River drainage from the appearance of Clovis sites in the terminal Pleistocene though the Late Holocene (similar to 13,250-3,000 cal BP). We found that the distribution of points and sites were initially skewed towards lower elevations, and then spread to higher elevations over the course of the Younger Dryas into the Middle Holocene, which is consistent with predictions of the Ideal Free Distribution. However, during the Middle Holocene, sites are more clustered, which is consistent with a shift to an Ideal Free Distribution with Allee effect that was likely driven by a broader distribution of oak-hickory forests. Finally, the distribution of sites after the Middle Holocene was more dispersed, which is consistent with a shift to an Ideal Despotic Distribution.","[Miller, D.

Because the ocean is an integral part of the climate system, stronger inclusion of ocean issues is critical to achieving the Agreement's goals. Here we discuss four ocean-climate linkages that suggest specific responses by Parties to the Agreement connected to 1) accelerating climate ambition, including via sustainable ocean-based mitigation strategies; 2) focusing on CO2 emissions to address ocean acidification; 3) better understanding ocean-based mitigation; and 4) pursuing ocean-based adaptation.

Accordingly, understanding how future climate change may impact soil erosion is critical for developing appropriate management strategies that mitigate negative impacts to the extent practical and potentially build resilience. Here, we review potential impacts of climate change on controls of erosion in US rangelands and discuss potential erosion responses. Projected climate changes are expected to have regionally variable effects on important controls of erosion, especially vegetation cover; community composition; frequency, magnitude, and geographical range of fire disturbance; and high intensity, erosive weather events, all of which have the potential to increase rangeland vulnerability to erosion. We identify knowledge gaps relevant to these controls and discuss management considerations to address climate change impacts to soil erosion concerns for US rangelands. In order to improve resilience and the efficacy of climate change adaptation, we recommend that existing monitoring data be used to create assessments of vulnerability, that soil erosion should be explicitly included in management benchmarks and decision support tools, and that no-regrets management options be implemented in anticipation of future impacts.","[Edwards, B.

The in-depth analysis of the impacts of and resilience to cyclones Oli in Tubuai Island (French Polynesia, Feb. 2010) and Bejisa in Reunion Island (Jan. 2014), raised the major role of natural buffers degradation (i.e. sand-dune systems) in increasing vulnerability. Five processes are analysed here: contraction (reduction in land area), fragmentation of sedimentary cells by coastal structures, shoreline fixation due to coastal defences, removal or modification of vegetation and finally, coral beach extraction. These phenomena alter the attenuation function of waves and wind, and finally increase damages when a coastal hazard occurs. This results have concrete implications in terms of enhancing resilience of territories to sea-related risks, enabling to: (1) design and implement conservation and restoration policies so as to strengthen the buffering capacity of sand-dune systems; (2) consider the sediment cell as the relevant scale for coastal risk management; (3) implement context-specific solutions that take into account long-term changes, so as to initiate a climate change adaptation policy.","[Salmon, Camille; Duvat, Virginie K.

Severe floods cause significant economic shocks and loss of lives, particularly for developing countries such as Jamaica. There is need for more information on the present and projected flood risks to justify macro-scale planning for climate change adaptation and facilitate the decision-making processes. In this study, a catalogue of 198 flood events occurring between 1678 and 2010 is compiled for Jamaica and used to examine the climatology, occurrence, trends, causes and duration of the island's severe events. The annual flood risk is estimated to be a loss of life rate of 4 persons and estimated annual damage of USD96.3 million per annum in 2010 values and approximately 0.84 % of GDP per annum. Macro-scale models for flood risks (deaths and damages) are also developed using data from the flood catalogue and maximum precipitation at the town and parish level. The models examine the relationship between flood risks (death and damages) and extreme rainfall depths and intensities. Future climate risks of loss of lives and damages are predicted to increase 11 and 9 %, respectively, to 4.4 persons and USD105.2 million per annum.","[Burgess, Christopher P.; Taylor, Michael A.; Stephenson, Tannecia] Univ W Indies, Dept Phys, Kingston 7, Jamaica; [Mandal, Arpita] Univ W Indies, Dept Geog & Geol, Kingston 7, Jamaica; [Powell, Leiska] Off Disaster Preparedness & Emergency Management, Kingston, Jamaica",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Mona Jamaica,"Burgess, CP (corresponding author), Univ W Indies, Dept Phys, Kingston 7, Jamaica.",cburgess@ceacsolutions.com,,,,,,,112,8,8,1,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Some types of negative shocks, for example weather-related agricultural losses and vector-borne diseases, are expected to occur more frequently as a result of climate change. In this paper we measure the role of household- and location-specific characteristics in conditioning behavioural responses to a wide range of idiosyncratic and covariate shocks. We use data from 8,000 rural households in 25 developing countries, compiled in the global database of the Poverty Environment Network. We employ a hierarchical multinomial logit model to identify the importance of characteristics observed at different levels of aggregation on a set of strategies aimed at coping with economic shocks. Results indicate that in response to idiosyncratic shocks, households tend to deplete financial and durable assets, whereas covariate and thus often climate-related shocks predominantly result in reduced consumption. Households in sites characterised by high asset wealth tend to cope with shocks in a more proactive way than those in sites with average or below average asset wealth, but the role of asset types in conditioning shock responses varies across regions. Our findings have implications for rural development and climate change adaptation strategies.","[Boerner, Jan] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Boerner, Jan; Wunder, Sven] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Shively, Gerald] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Shively, Gerald] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, As, Norway; [Wyman, Miriam] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",University of Bonn; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Borner, J (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",jborner@uni-bonn.de,"Wunder, Sven/ABE-7773-2020; Börner, Jan/ABF-8775-2021; Börner, Jan JB/I-2139-2015","Wunder, Sven/0000-0002-9422-0260; Börner, Jan/0000-0003-3034-5360; ","ESRC/DFID; Danida; CIFOR; CIM/GIZ; Bureau of Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, US Agency for International Development through the BASIS Assets and Market Access Collaborative Research Support Program; ESRC [ES/E021816/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E021816/1] Funding Source: researchfish","ESRC/DFID; Danida; CIFOR(CGIAR); CIM/GIZ; Bureau of Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, US Agency for International Development through the BASIS Assets and Market Access Collaborative Research Support Program(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","Jan Borner is with the Center for Development Research (ZEF), University of Bonn, Walter-Flex-Str. 3, 53113 Bonn, Germany, and also with the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), Rio de Janeiro-RJ, Brazil, as is Sven Wunder.

The justification for this policy is that a residual domain exists wherein climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and public/private risk transfer mechanisms are insufficient for peoples and places overwhelmed by climate impacts. We link this domain conceptually to scientific research on climate change impacts, and specifically to research on limits to adaptation. The normative position of this academic debate is generally oriented toward the need for transformative adaptation. This paper aims to anticipate the challenges that the Warsaw mechanism will encounter achieving transformation in practice. Both policy design (as it is taking shape) and implementation face a set of interrelated conceptual and operational problems that challenge whether resources can and will address adverse consequences among the most vulnerable. In the end, loss and damage policy may suffer from the same limitations as adaptation policy: it is concerned with the reconstitution of vulnerable states of being, rather than their transformation into something more fundamentally conducive of wellbeing and development.","[Wrathall, David J.] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Oliver-Smith, Anthony] Univ Florida, Dept Anthropol, Gainesville, FL 32605 USA; [Fekete, Alexander] Cologne Univ Appl Sci, D-50679 Cologne, Germany; [Gencer, Ebru] United Nations Off Disaster Risk Reduct UNISDR, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Reyes, Marqueza Lepana] Assoc Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN, Quezon City 1101, Metro Manila, Philippines; [Sakdapolrak, Patrick] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Bonn,"Wrathall, DJ (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",wrathall@ehs.unu.edu; aros@ufl.edu; alexander.fekete@fh-koeln.de; Eag44@columbia.edu; marqueza.lepana@asean.org; psakdapo@uni-bonn.de,"Fekete, Alexander/C-4071-2017; Sakdapolrak, Patrick/AAT-6359-2021","Fekete, Alexander/0000-0002-8029-6774; Sakdapolrak, Patrick/0000-0001-7137-1552",,,,,95,31,32,3,20,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",1758-2083,1758-2091,,INT J GLOBAL WARM,Int.

Recent work relating to the impact of exposure to heat on population health is also noted. Data obtained from a pilot monitoring study carried out in a subset of 36 dwellings (from a total of 110 dwellings in the overall study) across London during the summer of 2009 is then discussed. Preliminary results illustrate the need to quantify the net impacts of individual building characteristics and the location of each dwelling within the London heat island. During a hot period, more than 40% of the monitored bedrooms failed the recommended overheating criteria during the night time. There was some indication of purpose built flats being more prone to overheating. The potential use of such data as the basis of a heat-related health risk epidemiological model for London is discussed.

Divergent views on whether climate change will seriously affect society and what society can do about it can be traced, in part, to divergent views on these characteristics of systems. Issues of scale and how impacts are measured are also important. We identify a set of fundamental characteristics of natural systems and social systems that help to make underlying assumptions in climate change adaptation studies explicit. These are: Short-run autonomous flexibility; short-run non-autonomous flexibility; knowledge and capacity to undertake short-run actions; long-run autonomous flexibility; long-run non-autonomous flexibility; and knowledge and capacity to plan for and undertake adaptations that require changes in long-lived assets. Applications to crop agriculture and ecosystems illustrate how these portraits can be used. We find that if empirical research is to resolve questions of adaptability, more careful specification of the exact measure of impact and far richer models of the process of adaptation, able to test implicit assumptions in much of the existing empirical research, are needed.","MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Econ Res Serv, Resources & Environm Div, USDA, Washington, DC 20005 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Reilly, J (corresponding author), MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,29,81,82,2,25,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Although it is well known that long-duration outages severely impact economies, such outages are usually not well characterized or modeled in grid infrastructure planning tools. Here, we bring together data and modeling techniques and show how they can be used to characterize and model long-duration outages. We illustrate how to integrate outages in planning tools for one promising mode of resilient energy supply-microgrids. Failing to treat these extremes in models can lead to microgrid designs (1) that do not realize their full value of resilience, since models do not see the benefits of protecting against extremes, and (2) that appear reliable on paper yet do not actually protect against extremes. Although utilities record power interruptions, lack of access to that data is hindering research on resilience; making datasets available publicly would substantially aid efforts to improve grid planning tools.","[Hanna, Ryan] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Energy Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hanna, Ryan] Univ Calif San Diego, Deep Decarbonizat Initiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Marqusee, Jeffrey] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Hanna, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Energy Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;Hanna, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Deep Decarbonizat Initiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",rehanna@ucsd.edu,,"Hanna, Ryan/0000-0002-8120-8676",Electric Power Research Institute,Electric Power Research Institute,"This work received no direct or dedicated source of funding.

Integrated sustainable urban planning and management approaches, where the relationship between urban planning and urban infrastructure is re-examined to manage urban risks, manage the capacity of existing infrastructure, and adapt to climate change have been discussed for a long time. Particularly in the last 2 to 3 decades, in various countries and for different reasons, urban planning and urban infrastructure investments have diverged. Under the influence of neo-liberal policies, the urban planning process has often been transformed into a mechanism of re-distributing urban rents via urban projects, and urban infrastructure investments are presented to society as mega projects to help legitimize the effects of this transformation politically. This dissociation results in an inefficient and ineffective use of resources, a negative effect on the urban ecosystem, and an urban daily life that is fragile and disrupted. The development of a framework that re-integrates planning with infrastructure is an inevitable necessity.","[Sahin, Savas Zafer] Atilim Univ, Siyaset Bilimi & Kamu Yonetimi Bolumu, Ankara, Turkey",Atilim University,"Sahin, SZ (corresponding author), Atilim Univ, Siyaset Bilimi & Kamu Yonetimi Bolumu, Ankara, Turkey.",zafer.sahin@atilim.edu.tr,"Şahin, Savaş Zafer/HIK-3009-2022",,,,,,18,0,0,4,24,KARE PUBL,ISTANBUL,"CONCORD ISTANBUL, DUMLUPINAR MAH, CIHAN SK NO 15, B BLOK 162 KADIKOY, ISTANBUL, 00000, TURKEY",1300-7319,,,PLANLAMA,Planlama,,2018,28,1,,,,,6,11,,10.14744/planlama.2018.75547,http://dx.doi.org/10.14744/planlama.2018.75547,,,6,Regional & Urban Planning,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Public Administration,GF4QQ,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000431948500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This normalisation of loss means atoll countries now face a future that is apparently finite, which is a grievous situation no other country has to contend with. This paper explains the dilemmas this presents to atoll countries. If there is a risk of forced migration, then strategic planning can minimise its social impacts. Yet, doing so may bring future dangers into the present by undermining efforts to facilitate adaptation to climate change, creating new identities and deterring investments in sustainable resource management. To overcome this dilemma, the paper argues for a more hopeful approach to the future of atoll countries, because for as long as the science of loss remains uncertain, and the limits to adaptation are unknown, forced migration cannot be taken as a matter of fact and could possibly be averted through emission reductions and a vastly improved and significantly more creative approach to adaptation.","[Barnett, JonathOn] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, 221 Bouverie St, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Barnett, JonathOn] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Barnett, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, 221 Bouverie St, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Barnett, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",jbarn@unimelb.edu.au,"Barnett, Jon/AAQ-9002-2021","Barnett, Jon/0000-0002-0862-0808",,,,,59,43,43,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1360-7456,1467-8373,,ASIA PAC VIEWP,Asia Pac.

This paper demonstrates an alternative future analysis by coupling a system dynamics (SD) and a cellular automata (CA) model. The potential impact of different climate change scenarios on ULD from 2009 to 2030 was simulated and evaluated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan megalopolis cluster area (BTT-MCA). The results suggested that the integrated model, which combines the advantages of the SD and CA model, has the strengths of spatial quantification and flexibility. Meanwhile, the results showed that the influence of climate change would become more severe over time. In 2030, the potential urban area affected by climate change will be 343.60-1260.66 km(2) (5.55 -20.37 % of the total urban area, projected by the no-climate-change-effect scenario). Therefore, the effects of climate change should not be neglected when designing and managing urban landscape. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The study first recounts people's perception of environmental change - what are the issues of greatest concern identified by local communities? Second, it explores people's responses to identified environmental problems and in particular the role of forests in these processes. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of changing land management practices, and how their implementation may affect the future adaptation strategies of such communities. Results suggest that people's current and potential responses and adaptation to environmental change are influenced by the availability and access to forests and forest resources, and the degree to which their livelihood strategies have diversified away from forest dependence. Thus we conclude that forest policies such as REDD+ will need to be responsive to diverse forest-based adaptation needs, rather than assuming a 'one size fits all' relationship between forest conservation and adaptation to climate change.","[Gross-Camp, N.

A conceptual watershed model and several climate scenarios were used to estimate the effects of climate change on three lakes in the Vuoksi watershed for 2010-2039, 2040-2069 and 2070-2099. The adaptation possibilities were studied by using alternative regulation strategies. In Lake Pielinen the impacts of these water level changes on social, economic and ecological indicators were assessed with two different outflow strategies. According to the results, climate change will alter snow accumulation and melt and therefore cause large seasonal changes in runoff and water levels. Runoff and water levels will decrease during late spring and summer and increase during late autumn and winter. In some lakes current calendar-based regulation practices and limits, which have been developed based on past hydrology, may not be appropriate in the future.

The marginal products of agricultural land, labor, machinery, chemical fertilizers and pesticides are 1.54 thousand USD per hectare, 0.32 thousand USD per person, 0.31 thousand USD per kWh, 21.63 thousand USD per ton and 0.88 USD per ton, respectively. Climate change refers mainly to temperature and precipitation, and we analyzed their effects on the marginal products. Temperature has a statistically significant positive effect on the marginal product of fertilizers and machinery, whereas precipitation harms the marginal product of land.

Focus groups, semi-structured interviews and in depth observation were conducted in six cooperatives in Rhamna province to examine the extent to which women's traditional knowledge is applied and whether it is recognized. Our study reveals that the women's traditional knowledge is readily integrated in the development of natural products, vital in product development, yet is not officially acknowledged by the employers and national legislation. With international organisations increasingly putting pressure on countries such as Morocco to integrate the Access to Benefit Sharing (ABS) and particularly article 8j of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the challenge lies now in securing recognition of women's traditional knowledge involved in these activities.","[Montanari, Bernadette; Bergh, Sylvia I.] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies ISS, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Montanari, B (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies ISS, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",bernadettemontanari@hotmail.com; bergh@iss.nl,"Montanari, Bernadette/AAE-9619-2020","Montanari, Bernadette/0000-0002-2124-7059; Bergh, Sylvia I./0000-0002-0651-6732",European Union Marie SklodowskaCurie Actions Individual Fellowships (IF); Project EWTEK [657223],European Union Marie SklodowskaCurie Actions Individual Fellowships (IF); Project EWTEK,This work was supported by the European Union Marie SklodowskaCurie Actions Individual Fellowships (IF).

The extent of collective action and inclusivity of 6 APDs in Northern Ghana are analysed, combining theory from common-pool resource management and equity and justice in climate change adaptation into a proposed Inclusive Collective Action (ICA) model. Practically, the article demonstrates that neither fully excluding Fulani pastoralists nor making dams openly accessible results in inclusive APD usage and management where collective action is successful, and more dynamic forms of regional inclusion and exclusion are needed. Theoretically, the article identifies some of the limitations of applying the enabling conditions for collective action of common-pool resource theory as it tends to overlook negative aspects of excluding certain user groups in culturally heterogeneous contexts from managing and using a commons.","[Weesie, Ruben] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Weesie, R (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.v.weesie@uu.nl,,"Weesie, Ruben/0000-0001-6846-6075","Utrecht University, department of Human Geography and Planning","Utrecht University, department of Human Geography and Planning","This research received no external funding.

Cities contribute 85% of the total CO2 emissions in China and thus are considered as the key areas for implementing policies designed for climate change adaption and CO2 emission mitigation. However, the emission inventory construction of Chinese cities has not been well researched, mainly owing to the lack of systematic statistics and poor data quality. Focusing on this research gap, we developed a set of methods for constructing CO2 emissions inventories for Chinese cities based on energy balance table. The newly constructed emission inventory is compiled in terms of the definition provided by the IPCC territorial emission accounting approach and covers 47 socioeconomic sectors, 17 fossil fuels and 9 primary industry products, which is corresponding with the national and provincial inventory. In the study, we applied the methods to compile CO2 emissions inventories for 24 common Chinese cities and examined uncertainties of the inventories. Understanding the emissions sources in Chinese cities is the basis for many climate policy and goal research in the future. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Using two orographically dissimilar sub -alpine systems located in the Australian Alps and Chilean Dry Andes, the rational selection of adaptation measures and local options is framed into a spatio-temporal adaptation model. Decision-making here is supported by the interpretation of adaptation pathway analogues following key adaptation typologies (like flexibility and deepness) and representative landscape functionalities found in specific rural spaces. The model is based on estimating multi-scale land suitability gaps and feasible biophysical and irrigation-potential combination of adjustments seen as necessary to propose specific adaptation strategies for a baseline, mid-century and end-century periods. Decision-making insights resulting from this exercise could improve the evaluation when corroborating and generalising regional-type adaptation pathways in the light of adaptation opportunities and limits.","[Cornwell, Edward; Sposito, Victor; Faggian, Robert] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Cornwell, Edward; Sposito, Victor; Faggian, Robert] Deakin Univ, Ctr Reg & Rural Futures CeRRF, 75 Pigdons Rd, Waurn Ponds, Vic 3216, Australia",Deakin University; Deakin University,"Cornwell, E (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",ecornwel@deakin.edu.au,,"Faggian, Robert/0000-0001-8750-3062",,,,,54,0,0,1,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-4645,2211-4653,,ENVIRON DEV,Environ.

We adopt a polycentric perspective and use focus group interviews with Swedish actors within the business sector, politics, and government agencies, to analyse participants' views on what it means to lead, preconditions of leadership, and division of responsibilities, in a context of transformative change. Our results suggest that participants focus on collective dimensions of leadership rather than front-running but see multiple ways of demonstrating climate leadership as being available to actors across governance levels and issue areas. Challenges to these views on leadership include the request for shared rules and regulations, and courage among leaders to enact coercive top-down leadership to handle conflicts and trade-offs.

A conceptual framework to support the integration of geographic visualization for vulnerability assessments has been designed and applied for the development of AgroExplore, an interactive tool for assessing agricultural vulnerability to climate change in Sweden. To open up the black box of composite vulnerability indices, AgroExplore enables the user to select, weight, and classify relevant indicators into sub-indices of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.

This paper examines apparent resistance to policy change and the persistence of business-as-usual through a 'lock-in perspective', which means that attention is paid to how reinforcing mechanisms drive stabilisation and resistance in policy systems. Offering a fresh synthesis of known lock-in mechanisms in the literature, this paper explores the role of those mechanisms in two empirical cases of coastal adaptation: England (U.K.) and Schleswig-Holstein (Germany). While several known lock-mechanisms are observable, some are newly identified in this adaptation context. We offer a critical reflection on the added value of the lock-in perspective for understanding policy stability.

However, there are limits to how much rainfall sponge cities can absorb, hence, they are unlikely to be a panacea for flooding problems in cities. We argue that bottom-up community-based measures are essential part of the intervention development framework that is required to transform sponge cities into flood resilient cities. This community-based approach can effectively build on the distinctive and unique feature of Chinese cities, that is, the prevalence of gated communities, which provides a solid foundation for implementing community-based measures for flood management. A range of such community-based measures including resilience mapping, property-based resistant and resilient measures, flood insurance, and social resilience building are discussed. Flood resilience building does not just mean investments in gray-green-blue infrastructure, it requires social transformation toward flood resilient communities.

Buyout laws, acquisitions of severely flood-impacted homes, enabling owners to relocate, and require localities to rezone acquired land as open space. Despite the growing interest in flood buyouts as a tool for climate change adaptation, there has been little attention by policymakers or scholars to the capacity of buyouts to incentivize buy ins  to flood buyouts' increasing role in climate retreat. This Article reconceptualizes buyouts from their current focus on dispossession to a form of climate transition relief that balances incentive effects against individual losses. Specifically, this Article advocates for a presumption against buyouts for flooded homeowners in order to curb incentives for high-risk housing choices. This reform would carve out a significant exception for low-income residents of floodplains and means test buyouts. In the face of severely constrained housing choice, unaffordable flood insurance, and high marginal costs from property loss, this group is less vulnerable to incentive distortion from compensation and more vulnerable to harm from dislocation. While this Article focuses on flood buyouts, the model of climate transition relief I propose can inform climate compensation and retreat policymaking more broadly.","[Stern, Stephanie M.] Univ Arizona, James E Rogers College of Law, Law, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Stern, SM (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, James E Rogers College of Law, Law, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",,,,,,,,287,0,0,0,0,DUKE UNIV,DURHAM,"SCHOOL LAW BOX 90364, DURHAM, NC 27708-0364 USA",0012-7086,1939-9111,,DUKE LAW J,Duke Law J.,OCT,2022,72,1,,,,,161,233,,,,,,73,Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,5K5ST,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000869787200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In response, authorities have built water management infrastructure for irrigation and salinity protection. This study assessed the impact of one such project, the Ba Lai dam in Ben Tre province, on the livelihoods of aquaculture farmers. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to assess the impact of the Ba Lai dam on the livelihood capitals of 18 farming households in four communes, located both upstream and downstream of the dam. Findings The authors find that, apart from some positive effects, the dam has also brought negative environmental consequences, such as increased water pollution. The authors also find that farmers have responded to the changes by adapting their livelihood practices. Research limitations/implications The samples were relatively small, encompassing four communes in Ben Tre province. On the other hand, this case study is instructive to the many ongoing infrastructure projects in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Social implications The project have caused an increase in water-related social conflict. Originality/value The case of the Ba Lai dam provides a cautionary example for infrastructure-based water management plans, both in Viet Nam and more broadly. The study suggests the need to strengthen community participation and prioritize impacts of farmers' capital assets when constructing water management infrastructure for climate change adaptation.","[Thu Trang Thi Ngo; Phuong Lan Thi Ngo] Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City VNU HCM, Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Hong Quan Nguyen] Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City VNU HCM, Inst Environm & Resources IER, Ctr Water Management & Climate Change WACC, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Hong Quan Nguyen] Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City VNU HCM, Inst Circular Econ Dev ICED, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Gorman, Timothy] Montclair State Univ, Dept Sociol, Montclair, NJ USA; [Quang Ngo Xuan] Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Inst Trop Biol, Dept Environm Management & Technol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Quang Ngo Xuan] Grad Univ Sci & Technol, Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Vanreusel, Ann] Univ Ghent, Biol Dept, Marine Biol Res Grp, Ghent, Belgium",Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Montclair State University; Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); Ghent University,"Nguyen, HQ (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City VNU HCM, Inst Environm & Resources IER, Ctr Water Management & Climate Change WACC, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Nguyen, HQ (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City VNU HCM, Inst Circular Econ Dev ICED, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",nh.quan@iced.org.vn,"Ngo, Quang Xuan/R-4477-2019","Ngo, Quang Xuan/0000-0003-2587-1999; Gorman, Timothy/0000-0003-2684-9523; Ngo Thi Phuong, Lan/0000-0002-1061-5418","Flemish Interuniversity Council for University Development Cooperation (VLIR-UOS), Belgium [ZEIN2015PR414];  [KHCN-TNB-DT/14-19/C20]","Flemish Interuniversity Council for University Development Cooperation (VLIR-UOS), Belgium; ","The authors thanks to reviewers for their insightful comments, suggestions.Funding: This research is funded by The Flemish Interuniversity Council for University Development Cooperation (VLIR-UOS), Belgium under grant number ZEIN2015PR414.

Thus, this study examines farmers' perception of climatic change, related risks, and adaptation practices that farmers have adopted to address the adverse pressures on livelihoods and resources in different agro-ecological communities of Gurage zone, Southern Ethiopia. A research approach involving both quantitative and qualitative methods was used. 357 household surveys were conducted with representative households. Statistical differences in selecting adaptation strategies between the agro-ecological communities were measured by employing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A Post-Hoc analysis was also performed to identify the location of the variance. The study revealed, the majority of the respondents interviewed in different agro-ecological communities had perceived declining precipitation and increased temperature. Similarly, respondents reported that the frequency of extreme events like drought, flood, frost, and storm had increased. A significant difference was found between agro-ecological communities in farm management practices. A Tukey post hoc test revealed that farm management practices were mostly practiced by the lowland and highland (p < 0.005) agro-ecological communities. Therefore, since climate stress coupled with socio-economic and institutional stress has serious implications for farmer's livelihood sources, a holistic climate change adaptation strategy considering agro-ecological variation is required to sustain farm household livelihood.","[Dendir, Zelalem] Madda Walabu Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resource, Bale Robe, Ethiopia; [Simane, Belay] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Environm & Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Dendir, Z (corresponding author), Madda Walabu Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resource, Bale Robe, Ethiopia.",zelalemdendir@gmail.com,,"Dendir, Zelalem/0000-0002-2296-2417",,,,,68,4,4,3,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8807,,,CLIM SERV,Clim.

The data were collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and household surveys. The qualitative data were analyzed through thematic analysis. Whereas descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used for quantitative data analyses. The result showed that the majority of the respondents have local knowledge and used in their daily activities. Furthermore, the LK is reported to have the adaptive capacity in managing land resource degradation, treating disease, mitigating food insecurity, and enhancing social capital, among others. Likewise, the logistic regression analysis showed that age, gender, and education status of the household head were significantly correlated (p<0.05) to knowledge level, indicating their predictive power for the acquisition of LK. Accordingly, old-aged (60+ years) male respondents who attended primary education were higher to acquire LK than their counterparts. The result realized that the adaptive roles (land resource management, medication, climate change adaptation, etc.) of local knowledge systems could contribute to enhancing resilience. More importantly, the presence of social mechanisms is insurance to maintain LK. Thus, both intergenerational and intragenerational information gaps are filled with education and promotion on the roles of local knowledge systems. Besides, local-decision options should participate in custodians to share their experiences, that could contribute to sustaining ecosystem resilience.","[Asmamaw, Mengistu; Mereta, Seid Tiku; Ambelu, Argaw] Jimma Univ, Dept Environm Hlth Sci & Technol, Jimma, Ethiopia; [Asmamaw, Mengistu] Debre Berhan Univ, Dept Biol, Debre Berhan, Ethiopia",Jimma University,"Asmamaw, M (corresponding author), Jimma Univ, Dept Environm Hlth Sci & Technol, Jimma, Ethiopia.;Asmamaw, M (corresponding author), Debre Berhan Univ, Dept Biol, Debre Berhan, Ethiopia.",mengistuasmamaw21@gmail.com,"Asmamaw, Mengistu/ABD-8054-2021; Mereta, Seid Tiku/HIA-0661-2022; Ambelu, Argaw/V-8317-2018; Ambelu, Argaw/GQA-6114-2022","Asmamaw, Mengistu/0000-0001-9656-748X; Ambelu, Argaw/0000-0003-1898-4100; Ambelu, Argaw/0000-0003-1898-4100; Mereta, Seid Tiku/0000-0001-8036-4995","Debre Berhan University, Ethiopia; Jimma University, Ethiopia; International Foundation for Science (IFS), Stockholm, Sweden [1-1-A-6055-1]","Debre Berhan University, Ethiopia; Jimma University, Ethiopia; International Foundation for Science (IFS), Stockholm, Sweden(International Foundation for Science)","Financial support for this study was partly obtained from Debre Berhan and Jimma Universities, Ethiopia as well as from the International Foundation for Science (IFS), Stockholm, Sweden, through a grant N0.-1-1-A-6055-1 (by Asmamaw M.).",,48,5,5,1,7,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,SEP 4,2020,15,9,,,,,,,e0238460,10.1371/journal.pone.0238460,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238460,,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,NQ7QN,32886702,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000571064300050,View Full Record in Web of Science

Over the years, several development interventions have been undertaken to address these issues. Although recent studies particularly emphasize the need to integrate climate change adaptation into development planning, empirical analysis of causal relationships is less explored, specifically in India. Consequently, this study firstly attempts to identify whether synergies exist between development activities and agricultural adaptation decision-making. Secondly, it assesses the impact of such decisions on farmers' well-being. The empirical analysis is based on a survey of 549 rural households in drought-prone regions of western Odisha, India, where western Orissa rural livelihoods project was implemented in the last decade to improve the living standards. Using an 'endogenous switching regression approach', this study reveals two findings. Firstly, livelihood interventions enhance the likelihood of undertaking farm-level adaptation measures, and the other drivers are access to technical education, formal and informal institutions and agricultural extension services. Secondly, adaptations lead to significant gains in income from crops. The paper concludes with implications for policies to promote various rural livelihoods projects in rural India. From a broader policy perspective, it is imperative to integrate climate change in development planning to reduce the risk of maladaptation.","[Patnaik, Unmesh] TISS, Sch Habitat Studies, Ctr Climate Change & Sustainabil Studies, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Das, Prasun Kumar] APRACA, Bangkok, Thailand; [Bahinipati, Chandra Sekhar] Indian Inst Technol Tirupati, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India",Tata Institute of Social Sciences; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Tirupati,"Patnaik, U (corresponding author), TISS, Sch Habitat Studies, Ctr Climate Change & Sustainabil Studies, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",unmeshpatnaik@gmail.com,"BAHINIPATI, CHANDRA SEKHAR/H-8627-2019","BAHINIPATI, CHANDRA SEKHAR/0000-0002-4013-8915","South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE), Kathmandu, Nepal [SANDEE/2013-06]","South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE), Kathmandu, Nepal","The data collection for this study was done through a research grant from South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE), Kathmandu, Nepal [SANDEE/2013-06].",,65,10,10,7,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The objective of this commentary is to explore the potential for wildlife to contribute to climate change early warning for public health protection in Canada. Wildlife impact many determinants of human health through both direct and indirect mechanisms; several of which are strongly interconnected. There is a long history of wildlife serving as bio-sentinels for environmental pollutants and pathogens. Wildlife health could support public health threat detection, risk assessment and risk communication by detecting and tracking infectious and non-infectious hazards, being bio-sentinels of effects of new or changed hazards, providing biologically understandable information to motivate changes in personal risk behaviours and providing insights into new and unanticipated threats. Public health risk communication and strategic planning priorities for climate change could benefit from a wildlife health intelligence system that collects data on incidents of disease and hazard discovery as well as information on social and environmental conditions that affect risk perception and likelihoods of human exposure or harms.","[Stephen, Craig] Canadian Wildlife Hlth Cooperat, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Stephen, C (corresponding author), Canadian Wildlife Hlth Cooperat, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",cstephen@cwhc-rcsf.ca,"Stephen, Craig/HNJ-6213-2023",,Public Health Agency of Canada,Public Health Agency of Canada,This work was funded in part by the Public Health Agency of Canada.,,71,10,10,1,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

These risks include increased water scarcity, increased heat, and the introduction and emergence of vector-borne and other climate sensitive diseases. To respond to these threats, it is necessary for the government, at every level, to adopt more mitigation and adaptation strategies. Here, focus groups were conducted with representatives from five Lima municipalities to determine priorities, perception of climate change, and decision-making processes for implementing projects within each municipality. These factors can affect the ability and desire of a community to implement climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. The results show that climate change and other environmental factors are of relatively low priority, whereas public safety and water and sanitation services are of highest concern. Perhaps most importantly, climate change is not well understood among the municipalities. Participants had trouble distinguishing climate change from other environmental issues and did not fully understand its causes and effects. Greater understanding of what climate change is and why it is important is necessary for it to become a priority for the municipalities.

High rates of tree and plant growth, coupled with anaerobic, water-logged soils that slow decomposition, result in large long-term C storage. Given their global significance as large sinks of C, preventing mangrove loss would be an effective climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy. It has been reported that C stocks in the Indo-Pacific region contain on average 1,023MgC ha(-1) (ref. 2). Here, we estimate that Indonesian mangrove C stocks are 1,083 +/- 378MgC ha(-1). Scaled up to the country-level mangrove extent of 2.9 Mha (ref. 3), Indonesia's mangroves contained on average 3.14 PgC. In three decades Indonesia has lost 40% of its mangroves(4), mainly as a result of aquaculture development(5). This has resulted in annual emissions of 0.07-0.21 Pg CO(2)e. Annual mangrove deforestation in Indonesia is only 6% of its total forest loss(6); however, if this were halted, total emissions would be reduced by an amount equal to 10-31% of estimated annual emissions from land-use sectors at present.

This paper contributes to the analysis of the relevance of EU Cohesion Policy-related environmental sustainability investments, by assessing the impacts of the Operational Programme for Sustainability and Use of Resources (POSEUR 2014-2020), in the Portuguese North NUTS II. In detail, the impact scores of the following five analytical dimensions related to this programme were obtained: (i) low-emissions economy, (ii) adaptation to climate change, (iii) risk prevention and management, (iv) environmental protection and (v) resource efficiency. The analysis was supported by a territorial impact assessment methodology (TARGET_TIA) which was complemented by an online analytic geographic information system (GIS) policy evaluation platform (Impact-WEB_GIS). The results showed that the POSEUR's regional implementation efficiency fell short of the stakeholders' expectations. This can be explained by factors such as the obstacles posed by the prior underdeveloped infrastructural conditions, coupled with the panorama created by the Covid-19 outbreak. Nonetheless, the risk prevention and management dimension had a solid positive impact score that reflected the efficacy of POSEUR in tackling environmental threats, mostly in rural ecosystems.","[Medeiros, Eduardo] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIACET IUL, Lisbon, Portugal; [Valente, Bernardo] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, CIS IUL, Lisbon, Portugal; [Medeiros, Eduardo] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIACET IUL, Ave Forcas Armadas, Edificio Sedas Nunes, Sala 2W4, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Medeiros, E (corresponding author), Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIACET IUL, Ave Forcas Armadas, Edificio Sedas Nunes, Sala 2W4, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",Eduardo.Medeiros@iscte-iul.pt,"Valente, Bernardo/HJY-3024-2023; Medeiros, Eduardo/F-7046-2016","Medeiros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8877-5606",,,,,83,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-4313,1469-5944,,EUR PLAN STUD,Eur.

Considering that Mexico relies on groundwater, it is vital to develop a portfolio of alternatives to recover aquifers and examine policies and programs regarding reclaimed water and stormwater. Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) may be useful for increasing water availability and adapting to climate change in semi-arid regions of Mexico. In this paper, we present an overview of water recharge projects that have been conducted in Mexico in the last 50 years, their methods for recharge, water sources, geographical distribution, and the main results obtained in each project. We found three types of MAR efforts: (1) exploratory and suitability studies for MAR, (2) pilot projects, and (3) MAR facilities that currently operate. This study includes the examination of the legal framework for MAR to identify some challenges and opportunities that Mexican regulation contains in this regard. We find that beyond the technical issues that MAR projects normally address, the regulatory framework is a barrier to increasing MAR facilities in Mexico.","[Cruz-Ayala, Mary Belle] Univ Arizona, 1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Megdal, Sharon B.] Univ Arizona, Water Resources Res Ctr, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Cruz-Ayala, MB (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, 1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",marybelca@email.arizona.edu; smegdal@email.arizona.edu,,,Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research [CRN3056]; NSF [GEO-1128040]; Udall Center for Studies in Public Policy; Tinker Field Research Grant via the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Arizona,Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Udall Center for Studies in Public Policy; Tinker Field Research Grant via the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Arizona,Partial funding for this research was provided by the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research CRN3056 Project (supported by NSF Grant No. GEO-1128040) via support from the Udall Center for Studies in Public Policy and the Tinker Field Research Grant (Summer 2019) via the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Arizona.,,118,13,13,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2020,12,2,,,,,,,474,10.3390/w12020474,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12020474,,,24,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,KU6TF,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000519846500165,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding the ability of households in these countries to adapt to climate change is critical in order to determine the magnitude of the potential damages. In this paper, I investigate the ability of farmers in India to adapt to higher temperatures. I use a methodology that exploits short-term weather fluctuations as well as spatial variation in long-run climate. Specifically, I estimate how damaging high temperatures are for districts that experience high temperatures more or less frequently. I find that the losses from high temperatures are lower in heat-prone districts, a result that is consistent with adaptation. However, while adaptation appears to be modestly effective for moderate levels of heat, my results suggest that adaptation to extreme heat is much more difficult. Extremely high temperatures do grave damage to crops, even in places that experience these temperature extremes regularly. The persistence of negative impacts of high temperatures, even in areas that experience high temperatures frequently, underscores the need for development policies that emphasize risk mitigation and explicitly account for climate change-related risks.

We examine the role of institutional arrangements, the players operating under them, the barriers and enablers for adaptation decision-making in the developed nation of New Zealand. We examine how the roles and responsibilities between national, regional and local governments influence the ability of local government to deliver long-term flexible responses to changing climate risk. We found that the disciplinary practices of law, engineering and planning, within legal frameworks, result in the use of static mechanisms which create inflexible responses to changing risk. Several enablers are identified that could create greater integration between the different scales of government, including better use of national policy instruments, shared professional experience, standardised information collection and risk assessment methods that address uncertainties. The framing of climate risk as dynamic and changing that differentiates activities over their lifetime, development of mechanisms to fund transitions towards transformational change, are identified as necessary conditions for delivering flexible responses over time.","[Lawrence, Judy] New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Level 1,Cotton Bldg, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Sullivan, Frances] Local Govt New Zealand, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Lash, Alison] Kapiti Coast Dist Council, Paraparaumu 5254, New Zealand; [Ide, Gavin] Hawkes Bay Reg Council, Napier 4142, New Zealand; [Cameron, Chris] Wellington City Council, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [McGlinchey, Lisa] Tasman Dist Council, Richmond 7050, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Lawrence, J (corresponding author), New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Level 1,Cotton Bldg, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",judy.lawrence@vuw.ac.nz,"Lawrence, Judy/W-9823-2019","Lawrence, Judy/0000-0001-6798-3636; Cameron, Chris/0000-0002-6624-5452",Ministry of Science and Innovation (MSI) [VICX805],"Ministry of Science and Innovation (MSI)(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government)","The research for this paper was undertaken through three research programmes, namely Community Vulnerability, Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Change programme led by the Climate Change Research Institute at Victoria University of Wellington (VICX805) and an Envirolink programme, both funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation (MSI) and doctoral research undertaken by the first author in the School of Government, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.",,96,56,56,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2015,20,3,,,,,298,320,,10.1080/13549839.2013.839643,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2013.839643,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,V79WE,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000212144300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Damages during pluvial flood events are associated with overwhelmed urban drainage (stormwater and wastewater) systems. During the period from 2013 to 2021, Canadian property and casualty insurers reported approximately CAD 2 billion in personal property (residential) pluvial sewer backup claims during flood catastrophes. There has been growing interest in managing pluvial urban flood risk, notably through newly funded national programs focused on climate change adaptation. These programs have included the development of new guidelines and standards focused on managing the underlying factors contributing to urban and basement flooding. Inflow and infiltration (I/I) has received limited attention in the pluvial flood literature, however. Informed by significant engagement with practitioners in Canada, this paper provides a review of the issue of I/I into wastewater systems and its relation to pluvial flooding. The paper will address concerns related to private property engagement in I/I and urban pluvial flood reduction programs. Both improved technical standards and administrative support are needed to ensure that wastewater infrastructure is less susceptible to I/I over its lifecycle.","[Sandink, Dan] Inst Catastroph Loss Reduct, 20 Richmond St East,Suite 210, Toronto, ON M5C 2R9, Canada; [Robinson, Barbara] Norton Engn Inc, 243 Glasgow St, Kitchener, ON N2M 2M3, Canada",,"Sandink, D (corresponding author), Inst Catastroph Loss Reduct, 20 Richmond St East,Suite 210, Toronto, ON M5C 2R9, Canada.",dsandink@iclr.org; nortonengineeringinc@gmail.com,,,,,,,136,0,0,6,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2022,14,11,,,,,,,1716,10.3390/w14111716,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14111716,,,24,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,2B1DO,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000809934700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These hazards enhance erosion processes and flooding events, producing severe socio-economic impacts and posing a challenge to ocean engineers and stakeholders in finding the optimal strategy to protect both the coastal communities and the health of the environment. The impact of coastal hazards is actually worsened not only by an enhancing rate of relative sea level rise and storminess driven by climate changes, but also by increasing urban pressure related to the development of the sea economy. With regard to larger environmental awareness and climate change adaptation needs, the present study focuses on a stepwise approach that supports the actions for coastal protection at Calabaia Beach, which is located in the Marine Experimental Station of Capo Tirone (Cosenza, Italy). These actions first aim to protect humans and coastal assets, then to restore the environment and the local habitat, overcoming the need for the emergency interventions carried out in the last decades and pointing out that healthy ecosystems are more productive and support a sustainable marine economy (Blue Growth).","[Maiolo, Mario; Mel, Riccardo Alvise; Sinopoli, Salvatore] Univ Calabria, Environm Engn Dept UNICAL DIAm, Capo Tirone Expt Marine Stn, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Calabria,"Maiolo, M (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, Environm Engn Dept UNICAL DIAm, Capo Tirone Expt Marine Stn, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",mario.maiolo@unical.it; riccardo_alvise.mel@unical.it; salvatore.sinopoli@unical.it,"; MAIOLO, Mario/D-2704-2019","Critelli, Salvatore/0000-0001-7325-0228; MAIOLO, Mario/0000-0002-6208-1307; Sinopoli, Salvatore/0000-0003-2262-3607; Mel, Riccardo Alvise/0000-0002-5534-7170","Governo Italiano, Piano di interventi infrastrutturali di emergenza in Calabria-eventi alluvionali settembre 2000, Ordinanza di Protezione Civile [3081/2000]; Regione Calabria, Progetto Integrato Strategico-Rete Ecologica Regionale, POR Calabria-Asse I-Misura 1.10 [1562]; Provincia di Cosenza, Progetto esecutivo per la difesa e riqualificazione del litorale nei Comuni di Bonifati, Sangineto e Belvedere M.-Tratto da nord Capo Bonifati a nord Capo Tirone, PEG-Bilancio 2004","Governo Italiano, Piano di interventi infrastrutturali di emergenza in Calabria-eventi alluvionali settembre 2000, Ordinanza di Protezione Civile; Regione Calabria, Progetto Integrato Strategico-Rete Ecologica Regionale, POR Calabria-Asse I-Misura 1.10; Provincia di Cosenza, Progetto esecutivo per la difesa e riqualificazione del litorale nei Comuni di Bonifati, Sangineto e Belvedere M.-Tratto da nord Capo Bonifati a nord Capo Tirone, PEG-Bilancio 2004","This research was funded by Governo Italiano, Piano di interventi infrastrutturali di emergenza in Calabria-eventi alluvionali settembre 2000, Ordinanza di Protezione Civile no3081/2000, by Regione Calabria, Progetto Integrato Strategico-Rete Ecologica Regionale, POR Calabria-Asse I-Misura 1.10, Convenzione no 1562, and by Provincia di Cosenza, Progetto esecutivo per la difesa e riqualificazione del litorale nei Comuni di Bonifati, Sangineto e Belvedere M.-Tratto da nord Capo Bonifati a nord Capo Tirone, PEG-Bilancio 2004.",,112,15,15,2,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2020,12,10,,,,,,,2677,10.3390/w12102677,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12102677,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,OM7PH,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000586211200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study proposes the evaluation system for a rain barrel sharing network (RBSN) considering three performance criteria of reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability, under plausible climate change scenarios. First, this study shows how the system can be improved in terms of the performance criteria using historical daily rainfall data based on the storage-reliability-yield relationship. This study then examined how the benefits from RBSN are affected by climate change after 100 years. Three climate change scenarios (A1B, A2 and B2) and three global circulation models were used for this purpose. The results showed that the reliability and vulnerability are improved due to sharing and their improvements become larger under climate change conditions. In contrast, the resiliency reduces slightly due to sharing and its reduction is attenuated under climate change conditions. In particular, vulnerability will be reduced significantly under climate change. These results suggest that the sharing of various water resources systems can be an effective climate change adaptation strategy that reduces vulnerability and increases the reliability of the system.","[Noh, Seong Jin] Korea Inst Civil Engn & Bldg Technol, Goyang 411712, South Korea; [Chung, Eun-Sung] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Seoul 139798, South Korea; [Seo, Yongwon] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Gyongsan 712749, South Korea",Korea Institute of Civil Engineering & Building Technology (KICT); Seoul National University of Science & Technology; Yeungnam University,"Seo, Y (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 280 Daehak Ro, Gyongsan 712749, South Korea.",sjnoh@kict.re.kr; eschung@seoultech.ac.kr; yseo@ynu.ac.kr,"Chung, Eun-Sung/U-9010-2019; Noh, Seong Jin/I-3607-2019; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Noh, Seong Jin/0000-0002-2683-7269; Chung, Eun-Sung/0000-0002-4329-1800; Seo, Yongwon/0000-0001-5689-2165","Basic Science Research Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) from the Ministry of Science, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Future Planning [NRF-2013R1A1A1058964]; Strategic Research Project - Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology","Basic Science Research Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) from the Ministry of Science, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Future Planning; Strategic Research Project - Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology","This study was supported by the Basic Science Research Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) from the Ministry of Science, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Future Planning (NRF-2013R1A1A1058964) and also supported by a grant from a Strategic Research Project funded by the Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology.",,39,3,3,4,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2015,7,7,,,,,3466,3485,,10.3390/w7073466,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w7073466,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,CP5CL,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000359898800014,View Full Record in Web of Science

This case utilises households as sites of active agency, rather than as passive recipients of climate change or associated governance. Design/methodology/approach - This research trialled an approach to engaging a community in the context of disaster risk reduction (DRR). It involved a two-stage quantitative door-knocking survey (reported elsewhere), followed by a qualitative interview with interested households. In total, 76 quantitative surveys contextualise 15 qualitative interviews, which are the focus of this analysis. The findings are presented comparatively alongside the current literature. Findings - Heatwaves are understood to be the most concerning hazard for the households in this sample who associate their increasing frequency and severity with climate change. However, subsequent (in) action is shown to be situated within the complexities of day-to-day activities and concerns. While respondents did not consider themselves to have expert knowledge on climate change, or consider their actions to be a direct response to climate change, most had undertaken actions resulting from experience with heatwaves. These findings suggest there may be an under-representation of DRR, which includes climate change adaptation actions, within the existing research. Research limitations/implications - While this sample justifies the arguments and conclusions, it is not a representative sample and therefore requires follow-up. It does however challenge traditional approaches to risk management, which focus on awareness raising and education. The research highlights the unique contexts in which households perceive and act on risk, and the need for risk experts to consider such contexts. Originality/value - This research provides empirical evidence of urban household responses to perceived climate change-related risk, an often-neglected dimension of heatwave and adaptation studies in Australia. The findings also suggest promise for the methodological approach.","[Cornes, Isabel Clare; Cook, Brian] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Fac Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Cornes, IC (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Fac Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",isabel.cornes@unimelb.edu.au,"Cook, Brian/U-8657-2019","Cook, Brian/0000-0002-5618-1395",University of Melbourne Engagement Grant; Victoria State Emergency Service,University of Melbourne Engagement Grant; Victoria State Emergency Service,"This research was supported by the University of Melbourne Engagement Grant.

Although there has been an initial implementation of the integrated strategy at the national level, the progress of its adoption at the local level is relatively less studied. The study aims to examine the integration development of climate adaptation measures into urban development strategies by looking at its drivers and benefits in two coastal cities of Indonesia, i.e., Semarang and Bandar Lampung. Both cities have experienced climate change impacts and the preliminary effort of the integration process. The study was depended on close-ended Likert-scale questions with key actors representing local authorities and relevant stakeholders. Then, a Weighted Average Index was applied to transform their perceptions. The assessment of their knowledge of related issues was conducted. Secondary data was obtained from a desk study. The study found out that the effort of the integration process had influenced stakeholder's understanding of the issue of climate change and urban development, as well as its relationship. The level of stakeholder's knowledge related to the issue was very high. The result also revealed that the most influencing driver of the integration process is related to the motivation and initiative of municipal officers. It significantly contributed local governments to adopt its integration strategy. There was a strong consensus regarding the benefits of the integration process.

In this study, we apply systems thinking for the assessment of barriers in agricultural decision-making for food security and climate adaptation. Using a mixed method approach of participatory simulation game design and causal loop diagrams, we explore the dynamic pathways through which barriers inhibit farmers from achieving food security and climate adaptation in Southern Mali. Results show that the key barriers in the region are financial, land, and climate-related barriers including unavailability of formal credit sources, high input prices, inadequate land access and ownership rights, time and labor constraints in collective vs individual plots, and climate risks such as early and late season droughts, high temperature, excessive rainfall, water scarcity, and pest incidences. These barriers operate in complex, interdependent, and dynamic ways where factors that act as enablers in one context can also function as barriers in another context. We see such interdependencies in three cases: i) access to interlocked credit and loans for cotton cultivation acts as enablers of income generation for male farmers but become barriers to female farmers who do not cultivate cotton ii) land ownership and land use rights for male farmers act as enablers for cultivation of income generating cash and food crops but acts as a barrier for female farmers by way of intra-household labor dynamics within collective plots iii) increase in land allocation to cotton and maize cultivation acts as enablers for increased household income but becomes a barrier to food security due to higher vulnerability to climate risks. Assessment of causal loop diagrams identified deep and shallow leverage points. Policies and interventions that focused on input subsidies and credit facilities are shallow leverage points where incremental changes will only lead to small improvements in farmers' livelihoods. Policies that support improved access and ownership of land to female farmers are deep leverage points that can potentially shift the dominant cropping pattern to more diversified and climate-resilient production.

Intensive breeding farms require maintaining an adequate indoor thermal environment that results in high energy demands, usually covered by fossil fuels and electricity. This paper addresses the application of the combined slurry technology for a particular pig farm that currently uses a diesel boiler to supply the piglet heating energy needs. The study also considers different options based on closed ground source heat pump systems. After the design of the slurry alternative and the geothermal ones, notable advantages are detected compared to the existing diesel system. Results show that the implementation of the slurry technology implies an important reduction of the operational costs, which, in turn, involves short amortization periods for this system in relation to the diesel one. Greenhouse gases emissions are also highly reduced in the slurry alternative based on the low electricity use of the heat pump. The environmental side is reinforced by the reduction of polluting substances such as methane of ammonia derived from the descent of temperature of the slurry. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

We explore how the utilization of different policy tools shapes our ability to use forests to mitigate and adapt to climate change and consider the challenges of policy mixes and integration, taking a close look at three areas of international forest policy, including the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and voluntary carbon offset markets. As it is our expertise, we then examine in detail the case of the USA as a country that lacks aggressive implementation of national climate policies but has potential to increase CDR through reforestation and existing forest management on both public and private land. For forest-based CDR to succeed, a wide array of policy tools will have to be implemented in a variety of contexts with an eye towards overcoming the challenges of policy design with regard to uncertainty in policy outcomes, policy coherence around managing forests for carbon simultaneously with other goals and integration across governance contexts and levels.","[vonHedemann, Nicolena; Timberlake, Thomas J.; Sinkular, Emily; Schultz, Courtney A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, 1401 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Wurtzebach, Zachary] Ctr Large Landscape Conservat, Bozeman, MT USA",Colorado State University,"vonHedemann, N (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, 1401 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",nvonhedemann@email.arizona.edu,,"Schultz, Courtney/0000-0002-9972-7802",National Science Foundation Macrosystems Biology Program [1702996]; US Forest Service Office of Sustainability and Climate [16-CS-11132000-272],National Science Foundation Macrosystems Biology Program; US Forest Service Office of Sustainability and Climate,This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Macrosystems Biology Program (grant no. 1702996) and the US Forest Service Office of Sustainability and Climate (agreement no. l 6-CS-11132000-272).,,131,8,8,6,65,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2042-8898,2042-8901,,INTERFACE FOCUS,Interface Focus,OCT 6,2020,10,5,,,,,,,20200001,10.1098/rsfs.2020.0001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsfs.2020.0001,,,16,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,NE7PI,32832067,"Green Accepted, Bronze, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000562794000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

To do this, we worked with statistical information from the Puno Regional Agrarian Directorate and the agroclimatic variables provided by the National Meteorology and Hydrology Service-Puno. The study used the method of the multiple linear regression function based on ordinary least squares to explain the yield of canihua production under climate change conditions in the highland region. The results indicate that for each variation in a unit of the maximum temperature the yield of the canihua increases by 3%, and for each variation in a unit of the maximum precipitation the yield increases 0.34%, for each variation in a unit of the minimum precipitation yield drops by -2.16%. While the variable maximum humidity for each variation in a unit influenced the yield in 0.70%, and the minimum humidity in 0.93%. In conclusion, canihua maintained its production yield in the last 20 years; while rice, corn, wheat and other food grains were affected by climate change in Latin American countries and the world. The canihua tolerated critical negative anomalies of the agroclimatic variables of the region. The high Andean grain is a food plant adaptable to climate change in the highland - Puno region.","[Benique Olivera, Eusebio] Univ Nacl Altiplano, Fac Ingn Econ, Puno, Peru",Universidad Nacional del Altiplano,"Olivera, EB (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Altiplano, Fac Ingn Econ, Puno, Peru.",ebenique17@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,0,0,2,10,UNIV NACL ALTIPLANO,PUNO PUNO,"SESQUICENTENARIO, PUNO PUNO, 51, PERU",2306-8582,2313-2957,,REV INVESTIG ALTOAND,Rev.

The challenges relate to taking advantages of the strengths of an existing tool whilst adapting it and its supportive resources such that they are fit for purpose and accepted within the targeted community/organisation. This paper identifies and explores these opportunities and challenges through those revealed as a result of transferring and translating the UKCIP Adaptation Wizard for use within other parts of the world and in different communities and organisations. Whilst drawing on a number of different examples of where the Wizard has been translated, this paper particularly focuses on the transfer and translation for use in Portugal and in Brazil.

For the first time we extend its geographical reach by investigating its potential for clean-up of water from a highly polluted British river (Nant-Y-Fendrod, a tributary of the River Tawe). Investigations using the plant were conducted at three levels: a bench-scale study using polluted river water and synthetic solutions; an in-situ trial using water hyacinth within the Nant-Y-Fendrod; and a bankside trial to pump and treat river water. The removal of the largest number of heavy metals (21) from water in a single study using ICP-MS is reported, including Sb, for the first time. Results are promising, with bench-scale tests demonstrating up to 63% removal of Al, 62% Zn, 47% Cd, 22% Mn and 23% As, during just seven hours exposure to the plant. When extended to three weeks exposure, removal is evident in the order Al > Cd > Zn > Mn > Ni > As > V. Furthermore, in-situ mean removal of 6%, 11% and 15% of Mn, Zn and Cd respectively is demonstrated. As the world learns to adapt to climate change, studies of the type reported here are needed to exploit the remarkable phytoremediation potential of water hyacinth.","[Jones, Jonathan L.; Jenkins, Richard O.; Haris, Parvez I.] De Montfort Univ, Fac Hlth & Life Sci, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England; [Jones, Jonathan L.] Nat Resources Wales, Britann Way West, Llandarcy SA10 6JQ, Neath Port Talb, Wales",De Montfort University,"Haris, PI (corresponding author), De Montfort Univ, Fac Hlth & Life Sci, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England.",pharis@dmu.ac.uk,,"Haris, Parvez/0000-0002-4071-3553",De Montfort University; Natural Resources Wales,De Montfort University; Natural Resources Wales,"The authors would like to thank De Montfort University for supporting this research.

However, little empirical evidence exists on what kinds of conservation actions aimed specifically at climate change adaptation are being implemented in practice, let alone how transformative these actions are. In response, we propose and trial a novel typology-the R-R-T scale, which improves on existing concepts of Resistance, Resilience, and Transformation-that enables the practical application of contested terms and the empirical assessment of whether and to what extent a shift toward transformative action is occurring. When applying the R-R-T scale to a case study of 104 adaptation projects funded since 2011, we find a trend towards transformation that varies across ecosystems. Our results reveal that perceptions about the acceptance of novel interventions in principle are beginning to be expressed in practice. Guillaume Peterson St-Laurent et al. introduce the R-R-T (Resistance-Resilience-Transformation) conservation typology that enables the empirical assessment of whether and to what extent a management shift toward transformative action is occurring. They apply the R-R-T scale to 104 adaptation projects and find a shift towards transformation over time and differential responses across ecosystems, with more transformative actions applied in forested ecosystems.","[St-Laurent, Guillaume Peterson; Hagerman, Shannon] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2900 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [St-Laurent, Guillaume Peterson; Oakes, Lauren E.; Cross, Molly; Hagerman, Shannon] Int Union Conservat Nat, Climate Change Specialist Grp, Species Survival Commiss, Rue Mauverney 28, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland; [Oakes, Lauren E.; Cross, Molly] Wildlife Conservat Soc, 1050 East Main St,Suite 2, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA; [Oakes, Lauren E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 59715 USA",University of British Columbia; Wildlife Conservation Society; Stanford University,"St-Laurent, GP (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2900 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.;St-Laurent, GP; Oakes, LE (corresponding author), Int Union Conservat Nat, Climate Change Specialist Grp, Species Survival Commiss, Rue Mauverney 28, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland.;Oakes, LE (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc, 1050 East Main St,Suite 2, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA.;Oakes, LE (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 59715 USA.",Peterson.guil@gmail.com; loakes@wcs.org,,"Peterson St-Laurent, Guillaume/0000-0002-1329-0954",Doris Duke Charitable Foundation,Doris Duke Charitable Foundation(Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF)),"This research was financially supported by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.

Sudan, where wheat demand could triple by 2050, has the world's hottest wheat-growing environments, and observed yield declines in hot seasons are prompting the national government to prepare for a warming of 1.5-4.2 degrees C. Using advanced crop modelling under different climate and socioeconomic scenarios, we show that despite the use of adjusted sowing dates and existing heat-tolerant varieties, by 2050, Sudan's domestic production share may decrease from 16.0% to 4.5-12.2%. In the relatively cool northern region, yields will need to increase by 3.1-4.7% per year, at non-compounding rates, to meet demand. In the hot central and eastern regions, improvements in heat tolerance are essential, and yields must increase by 0.2-2.7% per year to keep pace with climate warming. These results indicate the potential contribution of climate change adaptation measures and provide targets for addressing the wheat supply challenge. Sudan faces population growth to 80 million people, rising temperatures and trebling in demand for wheat by 2050. Crop modelling under climate and socioeconomic scenarios indicates the regional rates of yield growth that must be achieved by breeding heat-tolerant varieties to adapt wheat production to climate change and increased demand.","[Iizumi, Toshichika; Kim, Wonsik] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Ali-Babiker, Imad-Eldin A.; Gorafi, Yasir S.

Nevertheless, very few studies have focused on this question, especially with cattle breeders. This study compares the climate change perception of cattle breeders in the dry and sub-humid tropical zones of Benin with the climatic data of the last 40 years. For this purpose, 360 cattle farmers were surveyed in these areas. The data collected were related to the socio-demographic characteristics of the farmers, as well as their perception of climate change. In addition, climatic data covering the period 1976-2015 were collected in the meteorological stations closest to each study area. Survey data were processed through frequency analysis and climate data through standardized anomalies. The results show that more than 70% of farmers in both study areas perceived a later installation of the rainy season, and an increase in temperature and pockets of drought, which is consistent with climate data. Nevertheless, there is a disagreement between climate data and farmers' perceptions on rainfall decrease and earlier ending of the rainy season. This study allows us to conclude that the integration of indicators of change perceived by cattle farmers would be relevant to develop appropriate climate change adaptation strategies, consensual and sustainable. It will facilitate understanding and dialogue between farmers and scientists.","[Idrissou, Yaya; Assani Seidou, Alassan; Tossou, Frejus Mahougnon; Sanni Worogo, Hilaire Sorebou; Adjassin, Josias Steve; Assogba, Brice Gerard Comlan; Alkoiret Traore, Ibrahim] Univ Parakou, LESPA, FA, 01 BP 123, Parakou, Benin; [Baco, Mohamed Nasser] Univ Parakou, Lab Soc Environm LaSEn, Fac Agron, 01 BP 123, Parakou, Benin",,"Idrissou, Y (corresponding author), Univ Parakou, LESPA, FA, 01 BP 123, Parakou, Benin.",yayaidriss2617@gmail.com,"IDRISSOU, Yaya/GXF-4957-2022",,,,,,26,3,3,2,3,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1166-7699,1777-5949,,CAH AGRIC,Cah.

As a signatory to the Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction (DRR), Canada has committed to a whole of society approach to DRR that includes engaging youth as credible stakeholders. Historically, in the context of disasters, young people (children and youth) have more often been framed one-dimensionally as a population at high risk of experiencing negative impacts during disasters, and, therefore, a population in need of protection. However, youth have more recently been recognized as having potential as change agents in their communities and stakeholders in the development and implementation of DRR policies and practices (Cox et al. in Int J Disaster Risk Reduct 22:249-356, 2017). As the first digitally native generation, youth today are equipped with unprecedented technological savvy, an entrepreneurial orientation, and confidence in their ability to change the world. From this perspective, youth, aged 15-24, stand poised as a significant capacity multiplier in Canada's efforts to reduce the risks and impacts associated with disasters and climate change.

However, there is a lack of knowledge of adaptation strategies that would be able to reduce the impacts of extreme heat to cope with an uncertain future, especially on the local scale. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of adaptation strategies to reduce the mortality risk under two climate change mitigation scenarios, using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5. We selected four street-level adaptation strategies: Green walls, sidewalk greenways, reduced-albedo sidewalks and street trees. As an extreme heat assessment criterion, we used a pedestrian mean radiant temperature threshold, which was strongly related to heat mortality. The results, projected to the 2050s, showed that green walls, greenways and reduced-albedo sidewalks could adequately reduce the extreme heat impacts under RCP2.6; however, only street trees could reduce the extreme heat impacts under RCP8.5 in the 2050s. This implies that required adaptation strategies can vary depending on the targeted scenario. This study was conducted using one street in Seoul, but the methodology can be expanded to include other adaptation strategies, and applied to various locations to help stakeholders decide on effective adaptation options and make local climate change adaptation plans.","[Park, Chae Yeon; Hyun, Jung Hee] Seoul Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Landscape Architecture, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Lee, Dong Kun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Coll Agr Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, DK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Coll Agr Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",dklee7@snu.ac.kr,,"park, chaeyeon/0000-0002-5641-892X; Hyun, Jung Hee/0000-0001-6960-9277","Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) [19AUDP-B102406-05]; BK 21 Plus Project in 2019 (Seoul National University Interdisciplinary Program in Landscape Architecture, Global Leadership Program toward innovative green infrastructure); National Research Foundation of Korea [22A20130012463] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)","Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA)(Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA)); BK 21 Plus Project in 2019 (Seoul National University Interdisciplinary Program in Landscape Architecture, Global Leadership Program toward innovative green infrastructure); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work was supported by the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) [grant number 19AUDP-B102406-05] and by the BK 21 Plus Project in 2019 (Seoul National University Interdisciplinary Program in Landscape Architecture, Global Leadership Program toward innovative green infrastructure).",,60,5,5,4,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL 2,2019,11,14,,,,,,,3801,10.3390/su11143801,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11143801,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IS6KX,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000482261800046,View Full Record in Web of Science

The goal of this study was to use statistically down-scaled and debiased precipitation projections for the state of Wisconsin derived from 14 general circulation models (GCMs) to assess the projected precipitation changes for the mid-21st century in a way that is relevant to water-resource decision making. The authors analyzed metrics that are relevant to storm-water design, such as the 100-year, 24-h quantile, and the authors also evaluated the changes in a risk-assessment context using idealized damage functions that translate precipitation depths into economic damages. The results of our design-metric analysis show that the 100-year, 24-h quantiles for Wisconsin are projected to have significant but modest increases of approximately 11% over the next 50 years. Our risk assessment shows that the largest percent changes in risk for Wisconsin are projected to be in the northeast portion of the state. Both of these analyses will be used as part of the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI) to develop climate-change adaptation strategies for communities throughout the state.

An adaptation levy of 2% is currently imposed on all CDM transactions which could raise around $500 million between now and 2012. This paper analyses the scope for raising further adaptation finance from the CDM, the economic costs (deadweight loss) of such a measure and the incidence of the levy, that is, the economic burden the levy would impose on the buyers and sellers of credits. We find that a levy of 2% could raise up to $2 billion a year in 2020 if there are no restrictions on demand. This could rise to $10 billion for a 10% tax. Restrictions on credit demand (called supplementarity limits, the requirement that most emission abatement should happen domestically) curtail trade volumes and consequently tax revenues. They also alter the economic impact of the CDM levy. Without supplementarity restrictions sellers (developing countries) bear twothirds of the cost of the tax. If there are supplementarity limits they can pass on the tax burden to buyers (developed countries) more or less in full. Without supplementarity restrictions the distortionary effect of the levy (its deadweight loss) rises sharply with the tax rate. With them the deadweight loss is close to zero. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

How much food security and market stability in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, both depending on wheat production and its interannual variability, are going to be compromised by global warming is an overarching question. To contribute in addressing it, we use a recently established indicator to quantify crop production climate resilience. We present a methodological framework allowing to compute the annual production resilience indicator from nonstationary time series. We apply this approach on the wheat production of the 10 most important producers in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Our findings shows that if no adaptation will take place, wheat production reliability in the Mediterranean and the Middle East will be threatened by climate change already at 1.5 degrees C global warming. Average climate-related wheat production losses will exceed the worst past event even if the 2 degrees C mitigation target is met.

In this regard, the separation of baseflow from streamflow and the analysis of recession curves make a significant contribution to integrated river basin management. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) RECESS model adopting the master-recession curve (MRC) method can enhance the accuracy with which baseflow may be separated from streamflow, compared to other baseflow-separation schemes that are more limited in their ability to reflect various watershed/aquifer characteristics. The RECESS model has been widely used for the analysis of hydrographs, but the applications using RECESS were only available through Microsoft-Disk Operating System (MS-DOS). Thus, this study aims to develop a web-based RECESS model for easy separation of baseflow from streamflow, with easy applications for ungauged regions. RECESS on the web derived the alpha factor, which is a baseflow recession constant in the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and this variable was provided to SWAT as the input. The results showed that the alpha factor estimated from the web-based RECESS model improved the predictions of streamflow and recession.

However, the mechanisms and complex interactions in urban areas underlying land surface temperature are still being understood. Understanding these mechanisms is necessary to design strategies that mitigate land temperatures in our cities. Using the recently available night-time moderate-resolution thermal satellite imagery and employing advanced nonlinear statistical models, we seek to answer the question What is the influence and relative importance of urban characteristics on land surface temperature, during both the day and night? To answer this question, we analyze urban land surface temperature in four cities across the United States. We devise techniques for training and validating nonlinear statistical models on geostatistical data and use these models to assess the interdependent effects of urban characteristics on urban surface temperature. Our results suggest that vegetation and impervious surfaces are the most important urban characteristics associated with land surface temperature. While this may be expected, this is the first study to quantify this relationship for Landsat-resolution nighttime temperature estimates. Our results also demonstrate the potential for using nonlinear statistical analysis to investigate land surface temperature and its relationships with urban characteristics. Improved understanding of these relationships influencing both night and day land surface temperature will assist planners undertaking climate change adaptation and heat wave mitigation.","[Logan, T.

This notion often ignores the nature of migration as a tried and tested livelihood choice amid a variety of socio-economic and environmental opportunities and limitations. This paper closely looks at the behavioural aspects of migration decision-making in Bangladesh in the context of changes in its economy, and, increasingly, exposure to the impacts of climate variability and change. We find that villagers in areas particularly affected by increasing climatic stresses and shocks are diversifying their traditional livelihood strategies by migrating. Environmental factors, including climatic stresses and shocks, often make such shifts even more necessary. Although the migrants' primary motivation is better income, in effect, migration becomes an effective form of adaptation. Based on a qualitative study in three geographically distinct places of Bangladesh, we propose that migration is a socially acceptable behaviour that occurs in the context of perceived environmental change and climate variability. Migration decisions are mediated by a set of 'behavioural factors' that assesses the efficacy of different responses to opportunities and challenges, their socio-cultural acceptance and the ability to respond successfully. This understanding has policy relevance for climate change adaptation, in terms of both how migrants are perceived and how their movements are planned for.","[Martin, Maxmillan; Black, Richard; Kniveton, Dominic] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England; [Billah, Motasim; Siddiqui, Tasneem; Abrar, Chowdhury] Univ Dhaka, RMMRU, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Black, Richard] Univ London, SOAS, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of Sussex; University of Dhaka; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Martin, M (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",mm584@sussex.ac.uk; d.r.kniveton@sussex.ac.uk,"Martin, Max/K-9037-2018","Martin, Max/0000-0001-8047-078X; Black, Richard/0000-0003-4276-2057",,,,,108,52,53,1,95,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0199-0039,1573-7810,,POPUL ENVIRON,Popul.

However, little research effort has been devoted to exploring how farmers in those countries perceive climate variability and how the perceptions link to adaptive responses. This paper deploys information from three focus group discussions with 30 male farmers; and six in-depth interviews with one female and five male agricultural officers in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Recorded 34-year meteorological data in the delta from 1978 to 2011 is also incorporated to demonstrate the actual climate variability of the region. We find that farmers are becoming increasingly conscious of local climate variability issues. However, they have limited understanding of the importance of adaptation to their livelihoods. They also have limited knowledge of where and who to contact for appropriate climate change adaptation information. No opinions about the link between global warming and local climate variability and change were observed. Casual observation via public media and personal experience dominated farmers' sources of information. Barriers to farmers' adaptation are not exclusively restricted to socio-economic factors and resource constraints; e.g. land tenure, technical knowledge, market, social relationship, credit, information, health care, and demographics. Maladaptation, habit, and the perception of the importance of climate variability and adaptation are found as additional constraints. Observed differences in farmers' and agricultural officers' perspectives regarding barriers to farmers' adaptation suggest important policy implications.","[Hoa Le Dang; Li, Elton; Bruwer, Johan; Nuberg, Ian] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia; [Hoa Le Dang] Nong Lam Univ, Fac Econ, Linh Trung Ward, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",University of Adelaide; Nong Lam University,"Dang, HL (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Level 3,WIC Bldg,Waite Campus, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia.",danglehoa@yahoo.com; elton.li@adelaide.edu.au; johan.bruwer@adelaide.edu.au; ian.nuberg@adelaide.edu.au,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020; Bruwer, Johan/L-1280-2013","Dang, Hoa Le/0000-0002-5943-9515; Bruwer, Johan/0000-0001-7568-605X","AusAID; School of Agriculture, Food and Wine; University of Adelaide","AusAID(Australian Aid (AusAID)); School of Agriculture, Food and Wine; University of Adelaide","This paper is part of a PhD research at the University of Adelaide.

Urbanization is a growing stressor due the 2.5 billion additional people projected to live in urban areas by 2050. Potential climate change impacts to natural systems increase the need for sustainable urbanization, which should integrate land use needs for urban growth with climate adaptation objectives such as maintaining biodiversity, food production and ecosystem services. Here we compare climate-neutral and climate-adaptive urbanization scenarios to see which produces the most sustainable urbanization, defined as being the most effective at meeting development, conservation, and two climate adaptation objectives. We modeled five urban growth scenarios portraying an increase of 25.8 million people by 2050 for California, USA comprising three climate-neutral scenarios: business-as-usual, compact-new-growth and infill (redevelopment); and two climate-adaptive scenarios: preservation of agricultural climate refugia or future plant dispersal corridors. Infill was the least impacting for the multiple objectives tested; preserving 46-57% more land for other uses. Each climate-adaptive scenario reduced land consumption for its respective target, but increased impacts to the opposite climate-adaptive scenario target. Infill has the potential to contribute towards sustainable urbanization, particularly if combined with other climate adaptation targets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Their effective applicability to a targeted problem is nevertheless conditional on a detailed evaluation of their ability to simulate the near-term climate evolution under specific conditions. Here we explore the performance of the IPSL-CM5A-LR DCP system in predicting air temperature over Europe, by proposing a systematic assessessment of the prediction skill for different time windows (periods of the calendar time, forecast years and months/seasons). In this framework, we also compare raw and de-biased hindcasts, in which the temperature outputs have been corrected using a quantile matching method. The systematic analysis allows to discern certain conditions conferring larger predictability, which we find to be intermittent in time. The predictions appear more skilful around the 1960s and after the 1980s, in coincidence with large shifts of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, which are well reproduced in the hindcasts. Averages on longer forecast periods also generally imply better prediction skill, while the best predicted months appear to be mainly those between late spring and early autumn. Moreover, we find an overall added value due to initialisation, while de-biased predictions significantly outperform raw predictions only for a few specific time windows. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of the proposed systematic exploration of skill opportunities in DCPs for integrated applications in climate sensitive sectors.","[Sgubin, Giovanni; Swingedouw, Didier] Univ Bordeaux, Environm & Paleoenvironm Ocean & Continentaux EPO, Pessac, France; [Borchert, Leonard F.; Menary, Matthew B.; Mignot, Juliette] Sorbonne Univ SU, CNRS, IRD, LOCEAN Lab,Inst Pierre Simon Laplace,MNHN, Paris, France; [Noel, Thomas; Loukos, Harilaos] Climate Data Factory TCDF, Paris, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Saclay,"Sgubin, G (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, Environm & Paleoenvironm Ocean & Continentaux EPO, Pessac, France.",giovanni.sgubin@u-bordeaux.fr,"Borchert, Leonard/Y-2057-2019; Swingedouw, Didier/M-5471-2019; Mignot, Juliette/F-3138-2011","Borchert, Leonard/0000-0002-3232-7409; Swingedouw, Didier/0000-0002-0583-0850; Loukos, Harilaos/0000-0001-5417-5947; Mignot, Juliette/0000-0002-4894-898X",EUCP project - European Union's Horizon 2020 program [776613],EUCP project - European Union's Horizon 2020 program,"This study was supported by the EUCP project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 program, grant agreement number 776613.

In this study, we propose a framework for evaluating different impacts of climate change on IWD by sector, considering both direct and indirect effects. Data from 34 industrial sectors in Hebei Province, China, showed that the impacts of climate change varied by sector, and IWD in 22 of the 34 sectors was affected, ranging from -15.11 to 37.36% under the average rates of change in precipitation and temperature. The corresponding volumetric change of IWD was between -31.148 and 141.890 million m(3), considering the difference in the water demand scale between sectors. The overall impact of climate change on IWD gradually decreased from more than 12.8% to approximately 4.1% from 2007 to 2016 due to the substantial improvement of water use efficiency. The indirect effects caused by the total industrial output value offset about 60-50% of the direct growth impacts. By contrast, the increase in IWD caused by the rise in temperature accounted for nearly 90% of the change, whereas only approximately 10% was caused by the decrease in precipitation. In general, an industrial sector may be directly and indirectly affected by temperature and precipitation, and the different impacts may offset each other. This study provides evidence and explanations for the heterogeneity of climate change impacts, and the research results can provide information for regional industrial water resource managers to adapt to climate change.","[Zhang, X.; Ao, T.

Elderly women are considered to be the most vulnerable to climate variability and change because they are the poorest in the community, followed by elderly men, the disabled, female-headed households, married women, men and, finally, the youth. Less than 30 per cent of women and men in both Katilu and Loima are able to read and write. The cross-tabulation results show that there is a statistical significant relationship between gender, age and education level and climate change vulnerability. This implies that gender, age and education level have a significant effect on climate change vulnerability. Social implications This paper draws from several other efforts to show the critical relationships between gender, social capital and climate change. They are tracking adaptation and measuring development framework; ending drought emergencies common programme framework; and feminist evaluation approach. Originality/value This paper is important in identifying the link between gender, social capital and adaptation to climate change.","[Omolo, Nancy; Mafongoya, Paramu L.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Omolo, N (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Durban, South Africa.",nancy.omolo@gmail.com; Mafongoya@ukzn.ac.za,,,,,,,28,11,11,2,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Research is needed to inform health policy and practice for managing risks, with community based adaptation (CBA) emerging as one approach to conducting research to support such efforts. Few, if any, studies however, have critically examined the application of CBA in a health or Indigenous peoples context. We examine the strengths, challenges, and opportunities of health-related CBA research in Indigenous community settings, drawing on the experiences of the multi-nation interdisciplinary Indigenous Health Adaptation to Climate Change (IHACC) project. Data collection was guided by a framework developed to evaluate CBA projects. Semi-structured interviews (n = 114) and focus groups (n = 23, 177 participants) were conducted with faculty-based researchers, institutional partners, community members, students, and trainees involved in the IHACC project in Canada, Uganda, and Peru. Results illustrate the importance of CBA in co-generating knowledge on climate-health vulnerability and adaptation options, capacity building, and informing decision choices. There are also significant challenges of conducting CBA which can have unintended negative consequences, with results emphasizing the importance of managing the tension between health research and tangible and immediate benefits; developing a working architecture for collective impact, including team building, identification of common goals, and meaningful engagement of knowledge users; and the need to continuously monitor and evaluate progress. CBA holds significant promise in a health adaptation context, but only in the 'right' circumstances, where considerable time is spent developing the work with partners.","[Ford, James D.; Sherman, Mya; Berrang-Ford, Lea; Marcello, Thomas; Maillet, Michelle] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Llanos, Alejandro; Carcamo, Cesar] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Publ Hlth, Lima, Peru; [Harper, Sherilee] Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Lwasa, Shuaib] Makerere Univ, Dept Geog, Kampala, Uganda; [Namanya, Didacus] Minist Hlth, Kampala, Uganda; [Edge, Victoria] Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",McGill University; University of Leeds; Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia; University of Guelph; Makerere University; Public Health Agency of Canada,"Ford, JD (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",j.ford2@leeds.ac.uk,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013; Lwasa, Shuaib/G-3723-2014","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Lwasa, Shuaib/0000-0003-4312-2836",International Development Research Centre IRIACC program; Canadian Institute for Health Research; Canadian Institute for Health Research Applied Public Health Chair Program; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada; ArcticNet; Fonds de la Recherce en Sante du Quebec; Public Health Agency of Canada; International Development Research Centre,International Development Research Centre IRIACC program; Canadian Institute for Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canadian Institute for Health Research Applied Public Health Chair Program(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); ArcticNet; Fonds de la Recherce en Sante du Quebec; Public Health Agency of Canada; International Development Research Centre,"This work was supported by the International Development Research Centre IRIACC program, Canadian Institute for Health Research, the Canadian Institute for Health Research Applied Public Health Chair Program, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, ArcticNet, Fonds de la Recherce en Sante du Quebec, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the International Development Research Centre.

However, because the potential ecological and political side effects of SRM are not well understood, and because SRM will cross national boundaries, an international research perspective on the general public's perception of this technology is required. We conducted an online survey on the general public's perception and acceptance of SRM in Canada, China, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Our findings confirmed the need for an international perspective, as we found several cross-country differences. Chinese respondents, for example, indicated greater acceptance for SRM than their North American and European counterparts. Moreover, results of regression analyses on acceptance of SRM by country revealed that lower acceptability ratings for SRM in Canada and Europe were mostly related to stronger beliefs that SRM tampers with nature. Chinese respondents, by contrast, were more accepting of SRM when they held stronger beliefs that it may reduce the motivation to adopt burdensome climate change mitigation efforts. Although our research-and previous studies-suggest that opposition to SRM remains, dismissing the technology entirely on these grounds and without conducting a careful, cross-national, and transdisciplinary decision-support process to set up an international policy regime seems premature as people from countries that are less prepared to mitigate and adapt to climate change seem to be more supportive of SRM.","[Visschers, Vivianne H.

It is based on a mass tourism model strongly modulated by seasonality and with high environmental costs. Main tourism stakeholders are currently implementing complementary activities to mitigate seasonality, regardless of climate change. But climate is-and will remain-a key resource or even a limitation for many types of tourism. Assessing the present conditions and exploring the future evolution of climate potential for these activities have become a priority in this area. To this end, the climate index for tourism (CIT)-originally designed to rate the climate resource of beach tourism-is adapted to specifically appraise cycling, cultural tourism, football, golf, motor boating, sailing and hiking. Climate resources are derived by using observed and projected daily meteorological data. Projections have been obtained from a suite of Regional Climate Models run under the A1B emissions scenario. To properly derive CITs at such local scale, we apply a statistical adjustment. Present climate potentials ratify the appropriateness of the Bay of Palma for satisfactorily practicing all the examined activities. However, optimal conditions are projected to degrade during the peak visitation period while improving in spring and autumn. That is, climate change could further exacerbate the present imbalance between the seasonal distributions of ideal climate potentials and high attendance levels. With this information at hand, policy makers and regional tourism stakeholders can respond more effectively to the great challenge of local adaptation to climate change.","[Bafaluy, D.; Amengual, A.; Romero, R.; Homar, V.] Univ Illes Balears, Grp Meteorol, Dept Fis, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Amengual, A (corresponding author), Univ Illes Balears, Grp Meteorol, Dept Fis, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.",arnau.amengual@uib.es,"Homar Santaner, Victor/K-2678-2014; Amengual, Arnau/L-2783-2014","Homar Santaner, Victor/0000-0003-1459-2003; Amengual, Arnau/0000-0002-6108-2850; Romero, Romualdo/0000-0002-9091-8688","MEDI-CANES [CGL2008-01271/CLI]; PREDIMED Spanish project [CGL2011-24458]; FEDER; El Centro Nacional de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion para el Turismo (CIDTUR); European Commission [GOCE-CT-2003-505539]","MEDI-CANES; PREDIMED Spanish project; FEDER(European Commission); El Centro Nacional de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion para el Turismo (CIDTUR); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre)","Prof. Wolfgang Cramer, editor-in-chief of Regional Environmental Change, and two anonymous reviewers are acknowledged for their valuable comments which helped to improve the quality of this manuscript.

A geoarchaeological approach to deciphering the consequences of human activity in pre-protohistoric times: selected cases from the Po Plain (northern Italy),RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI,,,English,Article,,,,,,Anthropocene; Pre-protohistory; Geoarchaeology; Mediterranean basin; Climate change; Human impact,HUMAN IMPACT; BRONZE-AGE; CLIMATIC CHANGES; HOLOCENE; RECORD; FLUCTUATIONS; LANDSLIDES; STRATEGIES; VEGETATION; TERRAMARE,"The term Anthropocene generally indicates the period of the human history that began with the Industrial Revolution; from that time, the massive anthropogenic combustion of fossil fuels has led to an increasing impact on the climate system. However, over the last 8,000 years, ice cores have recorded an abnormal increase in greenhouse gases dating from the spread of agriculture in a vast region of the Old World. Indeed, this event may backdate the beginning of human influence on the Earth's climate to the early Holocene. In a general perspective, this assumption is acceptable and in the present paper is argued through case studies from the Po Plain in northern Italy ranging from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age and dating to the Atlantic and the Subboreal periods. These cases will be compared with others of the same period distributed along the arid circum-Mediterranean region (Sahara and Near East). In any case, terrestrial archives (landscapes, soils, sediments), and the archaeological sites they contained, suggest a complex response of the pre-protohistoric civilizations to the constraints of climate change. During this long period, the anthropogenic control of the environment, while rising with time on a global scale, did not display a linear trend. But it occurred through an alternating series of successes and failures; in particular, the latter was determined by the inability to adapt to climate change and/or by the over-exploitation of natural resources beyond the limits of environmental sustainability.","Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Terra Ardito Desio, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Cremaschi, M (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Terra Ardito Desio, Via Mangiagalli 34, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",mauro.cremaschi@unimi.it,"cremaschi, mauro/N-3261-2013","cremaschi, mauro/0000-0003-2934-3210",,,,,95,8,8,0,49,SPRINGER-VERLAG ITALIA SRL,MILAN,"VIA DECEMBRIO, 28, MILAN, 20137, ITALY",2037-4631,1720-0776,,REND LINCEI-SCI FIS,Rend.

Design/methodology/approach - Multiple methods and data sources were used, comprising: a socio-economic survey of 295 households; informal interviews with pastoralists, conservancy managers, and tourism investors; focus group discussions; a stakeholder workshop. Monthly rainfall data was used to analyse drought frequency and intensity. A framework of the interactions between pastoralists' drought coping and risk mitigation strategies and the conservancy effects was developed, and used to qualitatively assess some interactions across the three study sites. Changes in household livestock holdings and sources of cash income are calculated in relation to the 2008-09 drought. Findings - The frequency and intensity of droughts are increasing but are localised across the three study sites. The proportion of households with per capita livestock holdings below the 4.5 TLU poverty vulnerability threshold increased by 34 per cent in Kitengela and 5 per cent in the Mara site, mainly due to the drought in 2008-2009. Payment for ecosystem services was found to buffer households from fluctuating livestock income, but also generates synergies and/or trade-offs depending on land use restrictions. Originality/value - The contribution of conservancies to drought coping and risk mitigation strategies of pastoralists is analyzed as a basis for evaluating the potential for ecosystem-based adaptation.","[Osano, Philip M.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Said, Mohammed Y.] Int Livestock Res Inst, PLE, Nairobi, Kenya; [de Leeuw, Jan] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, East Africa Subreg Off, Nairobi, Kenya; [Moiko, Stephen S.] McGill Univ, Dept Anthropol, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Kaelo, Dickson Ole] Univ Nairobi, Ctr Sustainable Dryland Ecosystems & Soc, Nairobi, Kenya; [Schomers, Sarah] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Muencheberg, Germany; [Birner, Regina] Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany; [Ogutu, Joseph O.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Bioinformat Unit, Stuttgart, Germany",McGill University; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); McGill University; University of Nairobi; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); University Hohenheim; University Hohenheim,"Osano, PM (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",philip.osano@mail.mcgill.ca,"said, mohammed/E-4932-2019","said, mohammed/0000-0001-9278-3193; Osano, Philip/0000-0002-6065-5151; de Leeuw, Jan/0000-0001-7020-2503; Ogutu, Joseph O/0000-0002-7379-0387",,,,,29,16,17,1,75,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Moreover, based on demographic data derived from Statistical Yearbooks, the exposure of urban and rural populations to CDHNs was also studied. The results show that on the NCP, the average number of heatwave event days was 33.41, and CDHNs, IHDs, and IHNs accounted for 21.07, 38.59, and 40.34% of this total, respectively.

The proportion of the urban population exposed to CDHNs was only 12% in the 1960s but increased to 58% in the 2010s. Although the exposure of urban and rural populations showed a significant increasing trend on the NCP, the driving factors showed opposite trends. The exposure of urban populations was mainly driven by the population effect, while the exposure of rural populations was mainly caused by climate effects. In this study, we demonstrated a method for assessing the impacts of heatwave events on exposed populations, thus forming a scientific basis for the development of governmental policies regarding climate change adaptations.","[Wang, Anqian; Wu, Quanyuan; Zhang, Baolei] Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm, Jinan 250358, Peoples R China; [Tao, Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jinlong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Inst Disaster Risk Management, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuyan] Xinxiang Meteorol Bur, Xinxiang, Henan, Peoples R China","Shandong Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","Wang, AQ (corresponding author), Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm, Jinan 250358, Peoples R China.",wangaq1990@163.com,"wang, yuyan/HNC-3272-2023","Zhang, Baolei/0000-0001-8866-6728; Wang, Anqian/0000-0001-6487-8937",Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2021QD139]; Special Support for Postdoc Creative Funding in Shandong Province [2021BHCX54],Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Special Support for Postdoc Creative Funding in Shandong Province,"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, Grant/Award Number: ZR2021QD139; Special Support for Postdoc Creative Funding in Shandong Province, Grant/Award Number: 2021BHCX54",,51,1,1,6,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

The complexity and diversity of current and future demands (biomedical applications, HVAC, smart buildings, climate change adapted cities, etc.) require making the thermal characterization methods used in laboratory more accessible and portable, by miniaturizing, automating, and connecting them. Designing new materials with innovative thermal properties or studying the thermal properties of biological tissues often require the use of miniaturized and non-invasive sensors, capable of accurately measuring the thermal properties of small quantities of materials. In this context, miniature electro-thermal resistive sensors are particularly well suited, in both material science and biomedical instrumentation, both in vitro and in vivo. This paper presents a one-dimensional (1D) electro-thermal systemic modeling of miniature thermistor bead-type sensors. A Godunov-SPICE discretization scheme is introduced, which allows for very efficient modeling of the entire system (control and signal processing circuits, sensors, and materials to be characterized) in a single workspace. The present modeling is applied to the thermal characterization of different biocompatible liquids (glycerol, water, and glycerol-water mixtures) using a miniature bead-type thermistor. The numerical results are in very good agreement with the experimental ones, demonstrating the relevance of the present modeling. A new quasi-absolute thermal characterization method is then reported and discussed. The multi-physics modeling described in this paper could in the future greatly contribute to the development of new portable instrumental approaches.","[Heyd, Rodolphe] Arts & Metiers ParisTech, Procedes & InnovAt LAMPA, Lab Angevin Mecan, Blvd Ronceray 2,BP 93525, F-49035 Angers 01, France",Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology,"Heyd, R (corresponding author), Arts & Metiers ParisTech, Procedes & InnovAt LAMPA, Lab Angevin Mecan, Blvd Ronceray 2,BP 93525, F-49035 Angers 01, France.",Rodolphe.HEYD@ensam.eu,,"HEYD, Rodolphe/0000-0003-2783-135X",,,,,40,0,0,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,DEC,2021,21,23,,,,,,,7866,10.3390/s21237866,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21237866,,,29,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,XV7AA,34883893,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000735089100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Some 483 successful questionnaire samples were collected through telephone surveys in Hong Kong. Our major findings include: (1) the inconsistent results from regression analysis of PAC as a single construct and results from factors of PAC obtained from exploratory factor analysis; (2) higher level of PAC in terms of Mental flexibility, knowledge and interest in global warming promotes sustainable attitude on adaptation and frequency of use of electrical fan; (3) sustainable attitude of individuals is weaker when they perceive a high effectiveness in their adaptive action and availability of resource; and (4) individuals demonstrating higher level of risk perception uses air-conditioners more frequently. The results showed that some individuals might express maladaptations which may potentially lead to a deterioration of overall public adaptation and long-term sustainability in the society. Such an aberrant response would imply a need for education on concepts of risk and sustainability on climate change adaptation to rectify the misconception. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we discuss changes in flood hazard and flood risk in China. First, we review published results (including our own works) on change detection in observed records of intense precipitation, high river flow and flood damage in China. We provide information on essential features of extreme floods in last decades - floods on large rivers, urban floods, and flash floods. Next, we review available projections for the future (including our own results), related to intense precipitation, high river flow and flood damage in China. We try to interpret the difference in flood hazard projections obtained in various publications. Since the spread of river flood hazard projections is large, projections have to be interpreted with caution, because of the impact on decisions related to climate change adaptation, flood risk reduction, and water resources management. We review flood risk reduction strategies in China, focusing on the present situation and division of responsibilities. China has embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task to improve flood preparedness, by both structural (hard) defences, such as: dikes, dams and flood control reservoirs, and diversions, as well as non-structural (soft) measures: spatial planning and zoning; watershed management (source control), flood forecasting and warning systems; and awareness raising. The strategy of flood mitigation includes flood retention and urban water management to alleviate the burden of flash and urban flooding.","[Kundzewicz, Z.

While the media, policy, and often scientific arenas essentially focus their attention on Small Island Developing States (SIDS), which are widely recognised as hotspots of global climate change, the situation of the numerous other vulnerable island territories has been relatively neglected. As a result, the focus on SIDS has paved the way for mainstream adaptation research and, in turn, for biases in the interpretation of climate change vulnerability and risks of small islands in general. Here, we argue that such an overly narrow scope severely limits our understanding of island-specific issues that influence island societies' adaptability to on-going and future climate change. This article reviews the current perspective on challenges and opportunities for climate change adaptation on SIDS and compares it with other types of island territories, especially dependent islands of continental states and semi-autonomous sub-national island jurisdictions (SNIJ). This comparison reveals that despite critical socio-political differences between the respective island types, more general lessons can be learned as island territories at large face similar issues both regarding the drivers of vulnerability and exposure and the adaptation measures needed. We propose an analytical framework for looking beyond SIDS' that includes the recognition of critical issues (asymmetrical governance structures, archipelagic constellations, inter-island connections) that shape island societies' vulnerability and leeway for adaptation to climate-related hazards.","[Petzold, Jan] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Marktstr 3, D-28195 Bremen, Germany; [Magnan, Alexandre K.] Inst Sustainable Dev & Int Relat IDDRI, Paris, France; [Magnan, Alexandre K.] Univ Rochelle, CNRS, UMR 7266, Dept Geog,LIENSs, La Rochelle, France","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE)","Petzold, J (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Marktstr 3, D-28195 Bremen, Germany.",jan.petzold@awi.de,"Petzold, Jan/ABB-1785-2021; Magnan, Alexandre K/I-3377-2017","Petzold, Jan/0000-0003-0508-3362; Magnan, Alexandre K/0000-0001-7421-5184",,,,,63,35,36,6,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

A total of 208 respondents were randomly sampled from Olokemeji and Onigambari forest reserves in Oluyole and lbarapa East Local Government Area (LGA), respectively. Data collected were analyzed using frequency distribution, percentages Chi square and PPMC. Result shows that major livelihood activities were farming (100.0%) and trading of forest products (92.8%). Respondents were vulnerable to climate change effects with respect to undefined season (90.4%), shortage of food production (84.1%), reduction in crop yield (80.8%), pest and disease outbreak (77.9%) which affects their livelihood activities. Major adaptation strategies utilized were soil protection through tree planting (88.5%), planting of different varieties of NTFPs and TFPs (87.0%), practicing shifting cultivation (81.8%) and use of organic fertilizer (81.7%). Respondents' use of weather insurance was sparing in the study area. Significant relationship existed between farm size (r=-0.257; p <= 0.01), monthly income (r=-0.319; p <= 0.01) and perceived effect of climate change. Adaptation strategies (r=0.309; p <= 0.05) used was significantly related with perceived effect of climate change. Afforestation should be encouraged among forest dependent farmers in addition to adaptation strategies utilised against climate change. The study recommends the need to educate farmers on the importance and benefit of weather insurance against financial loss due to climate change effects.","[Luqman, Akinbile A.; Oluwafunmilayo, Aminu O.; Kolade, R., I] Univ Ibadan, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Dev, Ibadan, Nigeria",University of Ibadan,"Luqman, AA (corresponding author), Univ Ibadan, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Dev, Ibadan, Nigeria.",lakinbile@yahoo.com; funmiaminu83@gmail.com; kolade2018@yahoo.com,,"Aminu, Oluwafunmilayo/0000-0002-6251-2816",,,,,32,3,3,2,7,AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION SOC NIGERIA,KWARA STATE,"AGRICULTURAL & RURAL MANAGEMENT TRAINING INST, PMB 1343 ILORIN, KWARA STATE, 00000, NIGERIA",1119-944X,2408-6851,,J AGRIC EXT,J.

This paper studies the long-term impacts of climate change and land-use planning on flood risk, with a particular focus on flood risk insurance in the Netherlands. This study estimates the full probability distributions of flood damage under four different scenarios of climate change and socio-economic development for the year 2040. Subsequently, the risk-based (re)insurance premiums for flood coverage are estimated for each of the 53 dyke-ring areas in the Netherlands, using a method that takes into account the insurer's risk aversion to covering uncertain catastrophe risk. On the basis of the results, we can draw four main lessons. First, extreme climate change with a high sea level rise has a higher impact on flood (re)insurance premiums compared with future socio-economic development. Second, (re)insuring large flood losses may become very expensive in the future. Third, a public-private insurance system in which the government acts as a risk-neutral reinsurer of last resort, accompanied by comprehensive adaptation and risk reduction measures, could be a good solution for making flood risk insurance available at an affordable price. Fourth, given the projected increase in flood risk, it is especially important that flood insurance contributes to climate change adaptation.","[Paudel, Youbaraj; Botzen, Wouter J.

Production agriculture in the US is becoming increasingly complex and challenging in the face of a rapidly changing climate and the need to balance growing crop productivity with environmental protection. Simultaneously, extension budgets are diminishing and extension personnel are stretched thin with numerous, diverse stakeholders and decreasing budgets. Evidence from surveys of farmers suggests that they are more likely to go to private retailers and consultants for information than extension. This paper explores the role that extension can play in facilitating climate change adaptation in agriculture using data from a survey of agricultural advisors in Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Nebraska and a survey of extension educators in the 12 state North Central Region. Evidence from these surveys shows that a majority of extension educators believe that climate change is happening and that they should help farmers prepare. It also shows that private agricultural advisors trust extension as a source of information about climate change. This suggests that extension needs to continue to foster its relationship with private information providers because working through them will be the best way to ultimately reach farmers with climate change information. However extension educators must be better informed and trained about climate change; university specialists and researchers can play a critical role in this training process.","[Prokopy, Linda Stalker; Carlton, J.

This two-part series of papers develops and implements a novel scenario-neutral framework enabling an assessment of the vulnerability of flood flows in British catchments to climatic change, to underpin the development of guidance for the flood management community. In this first part, the sensitivity of the 20-year return period flood peak (RP20) to changes in precipitation (P), temperature (T) and potential evapotranspiration (PE) is systematically assessed for 154 catchments. A sensitivity domain of 4,200 scenarios is applied combining 525 and 8 sets of P and T/PE mean monthly changes, respectively, with seasonality incorporated using a single-phase harmonic function. Using the change factor method, the percentage change in RP20 associated with each scenario of the sensitivity domain is calculated, giving flood response surfaces for each catchment. Using a clustering procedure on the response surfaces, the 154 catchments are divided into nine groups: flood sensitivity types. These sensitivity types show that some catchments are (very) sensitive to changes in P but others buffer the response, while the location of catchments of the same type does not show any strong geographical pattern. These results reflect the range of hydrological processes found in Britain, and demonstrate the potential importance of catchment properties (physical and climatic) in the propagation of change in climate to change in floods, and so in characterising the sensitivity types (covered in the companion paper).","[Prudhomme, Christel; Crooks, Sue; Kay, Alison L.; Reynard, Nick] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Prudhomme, C (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.",chrp@ceh.ac.uk,"Prudhomme, Christel/K-2669-2012; Reynard, Nick/I-6509-2012; Kay, Alison L/D-1981-2012","Prudhomme, Christel/0000-0003-1722-2497; Reynard, Nick/0000-0002-5185-3869; Kay, Alison L/0000-0002-5526-1756",Defra; Environment Agency for England and Wales [FD2020]; Natural Environment Research Council [ceh010022] Funding Source: researchfish,"Defra(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); Environment Agency for England and Wales; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","The work presented was funded by Defra and the Environment Agency for England and Wales (FD2020 'Regionalised impacts of climate change on flood flows') with additional contribution from the NERC-CEH Water science programme.

We therefore need more systematic efforts in trying to reduce disaster risks. In 2005, the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction created the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005-2015: 'Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities', in order to enable a more systematic planning, implementation and evaluation of disaster risk reduction (DRR) activities. In this paper, we examine Indonesia's success in improving DRR by reviewing the country's progress in implementing the HFA Priorities for Actions. This includes an analysis of the drivers, challenges and emerging issues in building resilience to natural hazards. The study is undertaken through literature reviews and interviews with 26 representatives of key organisations in DRR and climate change adaptation (CCA) in Indonesia. Our findings indicate that the building disaster resilience in Indonesia has been, to a large extent, driven by the existence of the necessary regulatory policies and frameworks and the participation of various non-government stakeholders. Impediments to process include a lack of capacity and capability for DRR at the local government level, a lack of systematic learning and a lack of commitment from government to mainstream DRR into broader development agendas. Emerging pressing issues that are likely to challenge future resilience building activities include the integration of DRR and CCA and urban risk governance.","[Djalante, Riyanti; Thomalla, Frank; Carnegie, Michelle] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Sinapoy, Muhammad Sabaruddin] Haluoleo Univ, Fac Law, Kendari, Indonesia",Macquarie University; Universitas Halu Oleo,"Djalante, R (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",riyanti.djalante@mq.edu.au,"McLean, Laurence JA/C-7367-2014; Djalante, Riyanti/X-3179-2019; Djalante, Riyanti/C-8063-2013; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Djalante, Riyanti/0000-0001-6301-8409; Carnegie, Michelle/0000-0001-6493-6922",,,,,124,57,57,1,113,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

We focus on opportunities linked to the provision of climate information, raising the question of whether they are limited to incremental adaptation, or can also bring about transformational adaptation. We address this question through an archetype analysis based on 26 peer-reviewed articles. In each article, opportunities are identified, coded using the social-ecological system framework, and then bundled into archetypes that encompass similar opportunities reappearing across multiple cases. Results suggest that the provision of climate information can constitute an opportunity for adaptation that goes beyond purely incremental adjustments to a changing climate. Specifically, two of the six archetypes identified enable transformational adaptation by bringing long-term implications of current impacts into focus and by addressing the issue of capacity of existing institutions to respond to climate change. However, there is a high degree of heterogeneity in the characterization of opportunities, and the six archetypes only cover about one in three of the opportunities identified.

The result finds that the effect of fluctuation in temperature and rainfall on the crop profit of farmers is not uniform across the three regions (North, Central and South) and also considerable variation across rain-fed and irrigated farms. For the rain-fed farming system, (i) rainfall in the dry season has a nonlinearly (boolean AND) association with the profit, but rainfall in the rainy season has no effect, and (ii) dry season temperature and rainy season temperature have, respectively, boolean AND-shaped and U-shaped relationship with the profit. For the irrigated farming systems, the temperatures in the dry season and rainy season have a U-shaped relationship with the profit. The findings show that the irrigated farming systems have been effective in the long term in the face of climate change. Therefore, in preparation for adaptation to climate change, the Vietnamese agricultural sector needs a complete irrigation system at both farm and regional levels.","[Ho, Huu Phuong Chi; Nguyen, Tuan Kiet; Vo, Thanh Danh; Nguyen, Ngoc Lam] Can Tho Univ, Sch Econ, Can Tho, Vietnam; [Arora, Anchal] Indian Inst Foreign Trade, Econ Discipline, New Delhi, India",Can Tho University,"Nguyen, TK (corresponding author), Can Tho Univ, Sch Econ, Can Tho, Vietnam.",ntkiet@ctu.edu.vn,"NGUYEN, Kiet/J-2359-2017","NGUYEN, Kiet/0000-0001-9724-0323",Can Tho University Improvement Project by a Japanese ODA loan;  [VN14-P6],Can Tho University Improvement Project by a Japanese ODA loan; ,This study was funded by the Can Tho University Improvement Project VN14-P6 supported by a Japanese ODA loan.,,39,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1747-6585,1747-6593,,WATER ENVIRON J,Water Environ.

This distinct economic shock directly affected campesinos, or small-scale farmers who depend on subsistence and commercial food production. Some Guatemalan farmer organizations have been promoting agroecology for decades in efforts to strengthen rural livelihoods and food sovereignty, defend Indigenous rights, and adapt to climate change, and agroecology is positioned as a tool for resilience to various shocks. We consider the neoliberal cooptation of the concept of resilience, and its usefulness in preserving alternative and previous (Indigenous) practices. Data from surveys and semi-structured interviews with farmers and leaders at eight organizations that promote agroecology suggests that prior engagement with a farmer organization, enacted through both agroecological practices and social networks, contributes to campesino resilience to the pandemic's economic shock at the farm level, with regards to production and consumption. This study illustrates the range and diversity of strategies taken up by campesinos during the pandemic, and considers the importance of social networks for collective actions that increase current and future economic solidarity in campesino communities.","[Rice, Anika M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Einbinder, Nathan] Schumacher Coll, Programme Lead Regenerat Food & Farming, Totnes, England; [Calderon, Claudia Irene] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Hort, Madison, WI USA; [Calderon, Claudia Irene] Univ San Carlos de Guatemala, Escuela Biol, Guatemala City, Guatemala",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala,"Rice, AM (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",Amrice2@wisc.edu,,"Einbinder, Nathan/0000-0003-3616-2952; Calderon, Claudia Irene/0000-0002-5350-9463","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE-1747503]; University of Wisconsin Madison: the Latin American, Caribbean & Iberian Studies (LACIS) Program; 4W Initiative; Institute for Regional and International Studies; Center for Integrated Agricultural Systems (CIAS); Conference of Latin American Geographers (CLAG) summer fieldwork grant","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Wisconsin Madison: the Latin American, Caribbean & Iberian Studies (LACIS) Program; 4W Initiative; Institute for Regional and International Studies; Center for Integrated Agricultural Systems (CIAS); Conference of Latin American Geographers (CLAG) summer fieldwork grant","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program under Grant No.DGE-1747503.

Nature-based solutions can offer a perfect example of sustainable solutions to cope with climate change mitigation and adaptation challenges.

This experience demonstrates how this process of mainstreaming adaptation actions and NBSs is possible at all levels of government of the territory. It also highlights the virtuosity of replicability in other contexts of the CMVe and the transition from theoretical concepts to concrete actions (NBSs) for adaptation into existing plans.

Results showed that: (i) the modified model can describe surface energy and MB of XDKMD well; (ii) net shortwave and longwave radiation, accounting for more than 80% of total heat flux, dominated the glacier energy balance during both summer and winter months; (iii) summer MB spatial patterns dominated annual MB, consistent with the fact that DKMD is a summer accumulation type glacier; and (iv) effect of increase in air temperature on glacier MB is higher than that of decrease in air temperature. The sensitivity of MB revealed by the modified DSEBM can help to understand MB changes influenced by the climate changes and to regulate water management strategies to adapt to climate changes at the catchment scale.","[Liang, Liqiao; Cuo, Lan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liang, Liqiao; Cuo, Lan] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cuo, Lan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qiang] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qiang] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Minist Educ, Key Lab Water & Sediment Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University","Cuo, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Cuo, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Cuo, L (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lancuo@itpcas.ac.cn,,"liang, li qiao/0000-0001-5282-9855; Liu, Qiang/0000-0003-3403-923X",Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41190083]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771042]; Hundred Talents program by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hundred Talents program by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),"The Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41190083), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41771042) and the Hundred Talents program granted to Lan Cuo by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) financially supported this study.

Communities in the Global South that rely on an intact resource base and struggle with poverty, existing inequalities and historical injustices will especially be affected by predicted changes in temperature and precipitation. The objective of this article is to better understand under what conditions local communities can adapt to anticipated impacts of climate change. The empirical part of the paper answers the question as to what extent local women engaged in fish processing in the Chilwa Basin in Malawi have experienced climate change and how they are affected by it. The article assesses an adaptation project designed to make those women more resilient to a warmer and more variable climate. The research results show that marketing and improving fish processing as strategies to adapt to climate change have their limitations. The study concludes that livelihood diversification can be a more effective strategy for Malawian women to adapt to a more variable and unpredictable climate rather than exclusively relying on a resource base that is threatened by climate change.","[Jorstad, Hanne] Univ Agder, Ctr Gender & Equal, Agder, Norway; [Webersik, Christian] Univ Agder, Dept Global Dev & Planning, Agder, Norway",University of Agder; University of Agder,"Webersik, C (corresponding author), Univ Agder, Dept Global Dev & Planning, Agder, Norway.",christian.webersik@uia.no,,,Universitat Hamburg's Cluster of Excellence Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction (CliSAP),Universitat Hamburg's Cluster of Excellence Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction (CliSAP),"We would like to thank two anonymous referees and the editor for their rigorous and constructive comments that have improved the paper.

The first part of the text focuses on traditional construction techniques, showing several programs with different levels of appropriation by the local population. Traditional construction techniques are a heritage tool of a particular relevance in the current context of climate change adaptation and sustainable edification. The second part of the text interprets various activities related to traditional music and dance, to analyse how they have evolved from an auxiliar daily activity to an identity symbol.

This study assessed the structure of such competencies among 341 Malaysian extension workers selected randomly. The data obtained from a structured questionnaire was subjected to Varimax rotation of the principal component analysis. The KMO obtained was 0.847 while Bartlett's Test was significant (p < 0.001). Assessment of internal consistency revealed a Cronbach alpha of 0.926. Using Kaiser's criterion, seven components explaining 76.053% variance were extracted. However, parallel analysis streamlined and retained five components. This implied that CSA competency among Malaysian extension workers had a five component structure.

However, local governance can be a greater determinant of flood risk than the hazard itself. Identifying strengths and weaknesses in local governance for water management is therefore crucial. This paper presents a governance assessment for Quarry Road West informal settlement, Durban, South Africa, in relation to flood risk by applying the Capital Approach Framework. Through developing a deeper understanding of the current governance system, the embeddedness of several social values can also be gauged. This is important particularly for integrative and transdisciplinary management of flood risk, enacted in the case of Quarry Road West informal settlement through the Palmiet Rehabilitation Project, a multi sector partnership at the climate change and water governance interface. Findings from this study indicate that, currently, climate change adaptation remains a challenge for decision-makers and policy-planners. A more effective integration of the residents of Quarry Road West informal settlement into local governance for water management is urgently needed. This is particularly important in the context of informal settlements that are marginalized and often lacking governance mechanisms to affect change.","[Williams, David Samuel; Costa, Maria Manez; Celliers, Louis] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany; [Sutherland, Catherine] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Built Environm & Dev Studies, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Williams, DS (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany.",david.williams@hzg.de; maria.manez@hzg.de; louis.celliers@hzg.de; sutherlandc@ukzn.ac.za,"Costa, Maria Mánez/P-1225-2017; Celliers, Louis/AAP-7650-2021; Celliers, Louis/GRO-6282-2022; Williams, David Samuel/ABD-7998-2020","Costa, Maria Mánez/0000-0001-5415-0811; Celliers, Louis/0000-0001-5096-1713; Celliers, Louis/0000-0001-5096-1713; /0000-0002-1418-589X",KnowHow project under the European Commission Marie Curie IRSES Grant [PIRSES-GA-2013-612-615]; European Union project Enhancing Risk Management Partnerships for Catastrophic Natural Hazards in Europe (ENHANCE); CLIMWAYS project of the National Research Foundation South Africa,KnowHow project under the European Commission Marie Curie IRSES Grant; European Union project Enhancing Risk Management Partnerships for Catastrophic Natural Hazards in Europe (ENHANCE); CLIMWAYS project of the National Research Foundation South Africa,"The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their invaluable comments, contributing significantly to the depth and meaningfulness of the paper.

The developed model is referred to as the 'reference' model and calibrated against field-measured groundwater levels and a map of land use and land cover. Then, five prediction/projection models are developed based on modification of the boundary conditions of the calibrated 'reference' model to quantify climate change impacts under various scenarios of sea-level rise and precipitation change projected to 2050. Model results indicate that west Merritt Island will encounter lowland inundation and saltwater intrusion due to its low elevation and flat topography, while climate change impacts on Cape Canaveral Island and east Merritt Island are not significant.

Governments, resource managers, and communities recognize the value of assessing the social and ecological impacts of climate change, but there is little consensus on the most effective framework to support vulnerability and adaptation assessments. The framework presented in this research is based on a gap analysis developed from the recommendations of climate and adaptation experts. The article highlights social and ecological factors that affect vulnerability to climate change; adaptive capacity and adaptation options informing policy and conservation management decisions; and a methodology including criteria to assess current and future vulnerability to climate change. The framework is intended for conservation practitioners working in developing countries, small island nations, and traditional communities. It identifies core components that assess climate change impacts on coastal communities and environments at the local scale, and supports the identification of locally relevant adaptation strategies. Although the literature supporting vulnerability adaptation assessments is extensive, little emphasis has been placed on the systematic validation of these tools. To address this, we validate the framework using the Delphi technique, a group facilitation technique used to achieve convergence of expert opinion, and address gaps in previous vulnerability assessments.","[Mcleod, Elizabeth] Nature Conservancy, Austin, TX 78749 USA; [Szuster, Brian] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tompkins, Emma L.] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [Marshall, Nadine] James Cook Univ, CSIRO, Land & Water, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Marshall, Nadine] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Downing, Thomas] Oxford Ctr Innovat OCFI, Global Climate Adaptat Partnership, Oxford, England; [Wongbusarakum, Supin] Univ Hawaii, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, NOAA, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wongbusarakum, Supin] NOAA, Ecosyst Sci Div, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Patwardhan, Anand] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hamza, Mo] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Anderson, Cheryl] Univ Hawaii, Social Sci Res Inst, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Bharwani, Sukaina] Oxford Ctr, Stockholm Environm Inst, Oxford, England; [Hansen, Lara] EcoAdapt, Bainbridge Isl, WA USA; [Rubinoff, Pamela] Univ Rhode Isl, Coastal Resources Ctr, Narragansett, RI USA",Nature Conservancy; University of Hawaii System; University of Southampton; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); James Cook University; James Cook University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Copenhagen; University of Hawaii System; University of Oxford; University of Rhode Island,"Mcleod, E (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, 7707 Vail Valley Dr, Austin, TX 78749 USA.",emcleod@tnc.org,"Szuster, Brian/AAF-7228-2020; Marshall, Nadine/D-9339-2011; patwardhan, anand/GOK-0386-2022; Hamza, Mo/ABC-1814-2020; Tompkins, Emma/B-6863-2016","Marshall, Nadine/0000-0003-4463-3558; Tompkins, Emma/0000-0002-4825-9797","Nature Conservancy; German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUB)","Nature Conservancy; German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUB)","This study is an outcome of a project that is financially supported by the Nature Conservancy and the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUB).

A sequence was identified which indicated how parts of each property are affected by soil moisture limitations. The sequence was combined with soil properties to indicate targeted strategies for each location aimed to improve soil moisture availability, biomass utilisation, and long-term viability of the farm or ranching enterprise. As a result of training of land owners and operators in use of this tool, 97% of participants indicated that they have begun or intend to make changes in land management; 78% are intending to make three or more substantial changes; and 91% felt better prepared for the impacts of climate change. The key to the success of this technique is that it identifies critical sustainable production drivers in a simple plan format and offers tailored management options which can address more variable climate conditions. The integrated planning tool has application as a driver of climate change adaptation in agricultural regions where farm units contain substantial landscape variation and seasonal rainfall is frequently limiting to production.","NSW Dept Primary Ind, Nat Resource Advisory Serv, Wollongbar, NSW 2477, Australia",NSW Department of Primary Industries,"Reid, GH (corresponding author), NSW Dept Primary Ind, Nat Resource Advisory Serv, Bruxner Highway, Wollongbar, NSW 2477, Australia.",greg.reid@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,Northern Rivers Catchment Management Authority,Northern Rivers Catchment Management Authority,"Landscan,'' a training package authored by Mike Keys, provided a foundation for the development of the extension program outlined in this paper.

Although the relationship between climate adaptation and displacement is typically associated with the involuntary relocation of human bodies and livelihoods, in this article I offer an alternative perspective. Through an examination of recent trends in the Indonesian cocoa sector, I argue that fixing labor and capital in place-often in the form of smallholder producers-has emerged as a core strategy for corporate entities to manage the threat of their own economic displacement. Although this strategy enables corporate entities to maintain cocoa production in the face of economic and environmental disruption, the associated loss of smallholder mobility, constrained livelihood options, and new forms of financial dependency increase smallholder vulnerability to economic and environmental impacts associated with climate change. This work highlights emerging tensions between climate adaptation, displacement, and agrarian change while raising new questions concerning who and what is displaced and how in the context of climate adaptation in the Global South.","[Kennedy, Sean F.] Univ Illinois, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Kennedy, SF (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",seankenn@illinois.edu,,,,,,,43,2,2,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2469-4452,2469-4460,,ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR,Ann.

The central aim is to reveal under what circumstances such adaptation takes place in a coordinated fashion, as opposed to adaptation by individual administrative units within their respective competences. Applying the concept of integrative vs. segregative institutions, the paper draws upon evidence from fourteen climate-sensitive municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The analysis, based on set-theoretic methods, finds that integrative institutions constitute a sufficient but not necessary condition for integrative adaptation. State administrations may thus avoid additional climate-related burdens for citizens and conflicts among resource users by providing local administrations with means for additional coordination.

The concept of thermally adaptive walls is that the thermal performance of walls can be dynamically changed based on cooling/heating demands to adapt to the climate better and achieve a higher level of energy saving. However, the concept of thermally adaptive walls has been rarely mentioned. Research on thermal adaptive walls technology is in its infancy, mostly scattered and unsystematic. This article briefly classifies and organizes the existing technologies for thermally adaptive walls. The working principles and thermal performance of thermally adaptive walls are discussed. Specifically, phase change material (PCM) integrated walls can effectively transfer the peak load in time and reduce the heat gain/loss of buildings. The thermal resistance (R-value) of dynamic insulation walls can be adjusted based on the cooling/heating demand to achieve the purpose of adapting to the climate. PCM integrated dynamic insulation walls combine the advantages of the above two and better reflect thermal adaptability. Moreover, the critical challenges in the application of thermally adaptive wall technologies are discussed, which highlight future research priorities for their application in buildings.

Benefit Transfer is a practical way to consider non-market values using functions and estimates acquired through primary valuation methods from other sites. Among the primary methods, Choice Experiments appear to particularly accommodate Benefit Transfer. Nevertheless, validity and reliability of international value transfers obtained from Choice Experiments have not been adequately examined. To this end, two identical Choice Experiments were conducted in Greece and Italy in the context of river services adaptation, testing validity and reliability of Benefit Transfer. The application of validity and reliability tests for different types of transfers is supportive for the use of Benefit Transfer, at least for the value transfer types. In particular the reliability of value transfer was higher when income adjustments were taken into account. Overall, Benefit Transfer can be attentively considered to evaluate cost-effective adaptation policies across countries experiencing similar climate change trends. The latter gains more importance given that an international Benefit Transfer setting as regards the non-market benefits of adaptation to climate change for river services is absent in the relevant literature.

However, to date, most work has been in frontier environments with less attention - both conceptually and empirically -on how urban land systems affect the carbon cycle. Much of what is known about urban areas and the carbon cycle is limited to aggregate levels of activities within urban areas, usually by sector, with little focus on how the spatial configuration of urban land systems affects carbon-emitting activities. Given that urban areas produce about 70% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, it is crucial to understand the relationship between urban environments, the activities they influence, and the resulting carbon emissions. This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge of how urban land systems affect carbon emissions and vulnerability, and identifies research gaps and opportunities for urban land science to contribute to climate change science, particularly through land architecture. We argue that more attention to urban land science conceptualization, measurement, and analysis would contribute to both fundamental knowledge about urban systems, as well as help identify policies and strategies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change at the urban scale.","[Stokes, Eleanor C.; Seto, Karen C.] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 380 Edwards St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Stokes, EC (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 380 Edwards St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",Eleanor.stokes@yale.edu,"Seto, Karen C./C-2722-2008","Seto, Karen C./0000-0002-4928-2446","NASA Harriet G.

This paper describes and analyses local and indigenous knowledge and practices related to climate-related hazards identified and documented in Indonesia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste. These include observations of changes in the environment and celestial bodies to predict climate-related hazards. Communities use local materials and methods to prevent and/or mitigate such hazards, and adapt to and prepare for them. Rituals and ceremonies are based on traditional or religious beliefs. Together with customary laws that govern behaviour, these rituals engender and reinforce respect for the environment, strengthen social cohesion, and thus help communities to better face and respond to the impacts of climate change and climate-related hazards. After going through a process of documentation, analysis and validation, local and indigenous knowledge can be grouped and categorised, which helps us better understand how such knowledge can be integrated with science. This will then enable communities to develop strategies to cope with climate-related hazards and adapt to climate change. Scientists, practitioners and policy-makers can also harness this knowledge for further research, education, and policy.

This paper highlights an interesting site of co-production: the second Dutch Delta Committee. Consisting of representatives of science, politics, policy and industry, this state committee advised the Dutch government on adapting to climate change in 2008. Although the committee went beyond common climate projections and advocated non-incremental policy recommendations, its report provoked little opposition. Subsequently, its recommendations shaped institutional reform and policy development in Dutch adaptive governance. Using the concept of boundary organisations, this paper opens up the black box of the advisory process to explain the Delta Committee's functioning. We conclude that the current understanding of the effectiveness of boundary organisations tends to focus on their internal organisation. The internal processing, shaped by the deliberate composition and organisation of the committee, was indeed important for the production of useful knowledge and management of multiple boundaries. However, this was paralleled by external practices of continued interaction with a range of political, departmental, scientific and public actors in which the Committee positioned the advise. While the former mainly enabled the production of a high quality advice, the latter quested for its acceptation and legitimacy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It seeks to discuss why it is important to take climate change considerations into account in business decisions, how this can be done and what further action is required from managers and business scholars. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes ways of reducing emissions and adapting to climate change that can be implemented by any business. As an illustration, the proposed climate strategy of a large European utility company, RWE, is provided. Findings - There are numerous ways to reduce emissions within business operations, along the supply chain and surrounding product usage and disposal. Climate-proofing operations is also becoming increasingly pertinent to businesses. Research limitations/implications - New ways have to be found yet in order to take emission reductions to a more ambitious level by altering patterns of production and consumption. Practical implications - The paper discusses how businesses can reduce their carbon footprint and anticipate changes in the physical and political environment related to climate change. Originality/value - The paper is of value to managers who, today, are expected not only to reduce emissions from operations, but also to gain an awareness of the physical, political and social risks stemming from the impacts of climate change.","[Wittneben, Bettina B.

Kiribati's historical 'Migration With Dignity' (MWD) relocation scheme has been abandoned as an official government strategy, replaced instead by an approach based on economic prosperity, climate change adaptation and mitigation. Through a human rights perspective aimed at securing the minimally good life for those affected by climate change, this article seeks to explore and contrast in detail the potentials and limitations of cross-border relocation with the new adaptation strategy, exemplified in the ongoing urban and land development project in Temaiku Bight on the capital island of South Tarawa. It further considers increased quotas for labour migration and the creation of humanitarian visas and argues that while adaptation and economic growth may bide some time and regional cross-border relocations give no precedent for best practice, the best solution is a combination of options which cannot exist in isolation. It sums up the numerous policy issues which as a minimum must be addressed for there to be any hope of migration and dignity for the people of Kiribati in the years to come.","[Kupferberg, Jakob Schou] Univ London Sch Adv Study, Human Rights Consortium, 107A High St, London WC1E 7HU, England",,"Kupferberg, JS (corresponding author), Univ London Sch Adv Study, Human Rights Consortium, 107A High St, London WC1E 7HU, England.",jakobs.kupferberg@gmail.com,"Kupferberg, Jakob Schou/HME-2464-2023",,,,,,113,6,6,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1364-2987,1744-053X,,INT J HUM RIGHTS,Int.

This article develops a Geographic Information Systems-based methodology to evaluate the spatial distribution of rainwater catchment potential to identify the most favorable urban areas for the installation of these infrastructures. Since performance and water saving potential of rainwater harvesting systems greatly depends on population density and roof size, this assessment was performed for each residential plot on a per capita basis, based on cadastral data and a method of demographic disaggregation. Furthermore, to evaluate spatial variation of runoff coefficient per building, a supervised classification was carried out to consider the influence of roof types on the rainwater catchment potential. After calculating rainwater catchment potential per capita for each residential plot, the spatial clustering of high (hot spots) and low values (cold spots) was assessed through the Getis-Ord General G statistic. Results indicate a spatial pattern of high rainwater catchment potential values in low-density urban areas, where rainwater catchment systems are expected to offer a better performance and a shorter amortization period. These results may be useful for the enactment of local legislation that regulates the obligation to install these infrastructures or offers subsidies for their implementation.","[Villar-Navascues, Ruben] Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, Water & Terr Res Grp, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain; [Perez-Morales, Alfredo; Gil-Guirado, Salvador] Univ Murcia, Dept Geog, Murcia 30001, Spain; [Gil-Guirado, Salvador] Univ Alicante, Dept Reg Geog Anal & Phys Geog, Lab Climatol, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; University of Murcia; Universitat d'Alacant,"Villar-Navascues, R (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, Water & Terr Res Grp, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain.",rvnavascues@ua.es; alfredop@um.es; salvagil.guirado@ua.es,"Gil-Guirado, Salvador/AHE-1631-2022; NAVASCUES, RUBEN ALEJANDRO VILLAR/AAR-5809-2020; Gil-Guirado, Salvador/GVS-2136-2022","Gil-Guirado, Salvador/0000-0002-3486-7476; NAVASCUES, RUBEN ALEJANDRO VILLAR/0000-0002-1693-7741; Gil-Guirado, Salvador/0000-0002-3486-7476; Perez Morales, Alfredo/0000-0001-7532-8711","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CSO2015-65182-CS-2-P, FPU15/01144, IJCI-2016/29016]; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport(Spanish Government)","This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under Grant Number CSO2015-65182-CS-2-P.

Despite a growing recognition of the need for climate adaptation action, there are limited assessment frameworks and strategic evaluation resources to support our understanding of regional adaptive capacity. We build on the literature and on information provided by climate adaptation experts to design a multi-criterion framework called the Regional Fingerprint. This framework consists of five critical categories - adopted actions, institutional capacity, research quality, planning processes, and regional collaboration - and twenty-one evaluation criteria. The framework is designed to uncover asymmetries between places, identify opportunities for intervention, and track progress in adaptive capacity. We further applied this framework to regions in California to test its viability and glean insights into the framework's capacity to generate new and useful policy relevant information. Through this work we find that the Regional Fingerprint offers insights into adaptive capacity and can be used to highlight critical areas for strategic intervention by state and local planners.","[Hirschfeld, Daniella] Utah State Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, 4005 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Hirschfeld, Daniella; Hill, Kristina E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Environm Design, 202 Wurster Hall 2000, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hirschfeld, Daniella; Riordan, Bruce] Climate Readiness Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hirschfeld, D (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, 4005 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",Daniella.hirschfeld@usu.edu; kzhill@berkeley.edu; bruce@climatereadinessinstitute.org,,,California's Ocean Protection Council (OPC),California's Ocean Protection Council (OPC),Some of the work for this manuscript was performed as part of Daniella Hirschfeld's Ph.D. thesis work.

We compared different cultivars, soils, and fertilizer options in three planting seasons. We analyzed the simulated yields to spatially classify high-impact spots of climate change across the four countries.

Yields increased in the Guatemalan highlands, towards the Atlantic coast, and in southern Nicaragua (10-41 % increase).

It is argued that the incidental benefits of ES schemes, which capture those benefits to the wider economy and society beyond the scheme's original remit, are as yet poorly understood and insufficiently recognised in current policy evaluation criteria. This paper describes research which has systematically addressed this evidence gap through the application of sub-regional economic models to capture the direct, indirect and induced effects of a variety of ES schemes beyond the farm gate. Findings reveal the sub-regional income and employment effects of such schemes to be significant, in particular for those schemes rewarding higher standards of environmental management.

Although developing countries have little historical responsibility for climate change, they are likely to be most affected by it since they lack resources to cope with or to adapt to its effects. Studies show that the semi-arid northeast region of Brazil - where the country's poorest populations are concentrated - is one of the most vulnerable to climate change and thus likely to suffer its impacts more severely. The present paper addresses these problems by presenting a concrete initiative for strengthening adaptive capacity in the rural community of Pintadas as a first step in the development of a comprehensive methodology to help smallholder farmers in the region adapt to climate change. Based on the project results this paper highlights the integration of development, adaptive capacity and adaptation strategies. Furthermore, the necessity of vulnerability studies and concrete local experiences is highlighted in order to develop adaptation strategies that can alleviate poverty and minimize climate change impacts for the poor.

However, the current performance shown by the global greensukukmarket does not meet the expectation, whereas the limited amount of studies providing clear evidence on the actual drivers impacting greensukukissuance is an obstacle. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the drivers influencing greensukukissuance and identify the mechanisms underlying each of these drivers in order to propose strategic actions geared for the policymakers to drive its presence. This was achieved through a qualitative case study conducted with the participation of greensukukissuers in Malaysia. As a result, it was revealed that competitiveness, legitimation and ecological responsibility influenced the issuance of greensukuk. Hence, the findings may inspire the policymakers towards utilising the roles of greensukukdrivers and positioning a comprehensive attempt in boosting its presence. This can be potentially achieved by an increased amount of favourable legislative measures and applicable promotion and education strategies of the green agenda for a strengthened green sukuk market.","[Abdullah, Mohammad Syafiq; Keshminder, J.

The centrepiece of this recasting of development thinking is the notion of resilience, which ties together the various activities proposed under the Plan. Resilience must respectively be strengthened, empowered and enabled in order for African countries to withstand climate change impacts. In this paper we subject this new climate-resilient development discourse to critical scrutiny. Using the theoretical lens of post-politics, we caution how the ill-defined category of resilience is deployed to reinforce a profoundly depoliticising agenda in which climate change is posited as an external threat to an otherwise seamless narrative of African advancement. In so doing, we illustrate how the Bank obscures the contested histories of African development and uses the discourse of climate-resilient development to perpetuate its neoliberal agenda within the continent.","[Mikulewicz, Michael] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Taylor, Marcus] Queens Univ, Global Dev Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada",Glasgow Caledonian University; Queens University - Canada,"Mikulewicz, M (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",michael.mikulewicz@gcu.ac.uk,"Mikulewicz, Michael/AAU-9365-2021","Taylor, Marcus/0000-0003-0944-601X",,,,,96,17,17,5,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It is an emerging research field with the potential to integrate various lines of environmental security research. Environmental peacebuilding practices have also been widely applied by conservation, development and peacebuilding practitioners, including those working at the grass-roots level in local communities. While its positive effects are considerable, environmental peacebuilding can also have adverse effects. This dark side of environmental peacebuilding has received little attention and remains under-researched. Based on evidence from a broad set of cases located in various world regions, I discuss these adverse effects within six categories (the six Ds): depoliticisation, displacement, discrimination, deterioration into conflict, delegitimisation of the state, and degradation of the environment. Only with sufficient consideration of these adverse effects, their interactions and the associated risk factors will environmental peacebuilding be able to fully develop its potential to simultaneously address environmental problems and threats to peace.

Scientific literature proposed that organic farming is a promising adaptation strategy, but micro-level studies are lacking. This study compared the adaptive capacity to climate risks of organic and conventional vegetable farmers in La Trinidad, Benguet in the Philippines. Guided by the Sustainable Livelihoods framework, thirty variables under the five livelihood capitals were used to compute Household Adaptive Capacity Index (HACI). Organic farming households have higher adaptive capacity than the conventional group, and have higher natural, financial, human, and social capital. The higher adaptive capacity of organic farmers was due to farm practices related to organic agriculture such as crop diversification, sustainable land management, and participation in organizations. This indicated that organic farming potentially enhances adaptive capacity of vegetable farming households. Findings support literature on the contribution of organic farming to the resilience of agricultural systems. Increased support toward higher adoption of organic farming in areas with similar context is recommended for adaptive management to climate change.","[Colting-Pulumbarit, Clarice] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Human Ecol, Dept Social Dev Serv, Laguna 4031, Philippines; [Lasco, Rodel D.] Int Ctr Res Agroforestry, Los Banos, Philippines; [Colting-Pulumbarit, Clarice; Rebancos, Carmelita M.; Coladilla, Jesusita O.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Sch Environm Sci & Management, Los Banos, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Colting-Pulumbarit, C (corresponding author), Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Human Ecol, Dept Social Dev Serv, Laguna 4031, Philippines.;Colting-Pulumbarit, C (corresponding author), Univ Philippines Los Banos, Sch Environm Sci & Management, Los Banos, Philippines.",ccpulumbarit@up.edu.ph,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Rodel, Lasco/AAA-6206-2022","Rodel, Lasco/0000-0003-3675-4237",,,,,52,4,4,0,14,UNIV PHILIPPINES LOS BANOS COLLEGE,LAGUNA,"SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & MANAGEMENT, LAGUNA, 4031, PHILIPPINES",0119-1144,,,J ENVIRON SCI MANAG,J.

Here, the infection ability of leaf blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) was modeled based on the epidemiological parameters of minimum (T (min)), optimum (T (opt)), and maximum (T (max)) temperatures for sporulation and lesion development. An infection ability response curve was used to assess the impact of rising temperature on the disease. The simulated spatial pattern of the infection ability index (IAI) corresponded with observed leaf blast occurrence in Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP). The IAI for leaf blast is projected to increase during the winter season (December-March) in 2020 (2010-2039) and 2050 (2040-2069) climate scenarios due to temperature rise, particularly in lower latitudes. However, during monsoon season (July-October), the IAI is projected to remain unchanged or even reduce across the IGP. The results show that the response curve may be successfully used to assess the impact of climate change on leaf blast in rice. The model could be further extended with a crop model to assess yield loss.","[Viswanath, K.; Sinha, P.; Sharma, Taru; Saxena, Shalini; Shukla, Shalu Mishra] ICAR Indian Agr Res Inst, Div Plant Pathol, New Delhi 110012, India; [Viswanath, K.] ANGRAU, RARS, Inst Frontier Technol, Tirupati 517502, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Kumar, S.

This raises fundamental questions over how coherent portfolios of policy interventions across vital themes can best be advanced and managed. Taking the Lake Chad Basin (LCB) as an empirical example, we analyse transboundary policies and intervention documents relating to climate adaptation, water governance and conflict management to ascertain the interdependencies at the adaptation-water-peace nexus. Using a Qualitative Document Analysis (QDA) approach and a set of subjective integration scoring criteria, we assess whether and how integration is planned, setting out ways forward for mutually beneficial integration actions. Despite recent progress in addressing lake drying and recognising cross-thematic challenges, most LCB intervention plans continue to adopt standalone basin-scale agendas and seldom consider action plan preparedness based on local-level assessments. Analysis of a few (existing) cross-thematic, well-integrated initiatives indicates that the timings of societal challenges and funding arrangements appear to play a key role in shaping policy strategies, the manner in which climate adaptation, water or security are treated and the level of integration attained. Based on the notion that integration is inherently desirable, we suggest a new 'policy integration thinking' that embraces a development landscape logic and balances short-term and long-term development priorities.","[Okpara, Uche T.; Stringer, Lindsay C.; Dougill, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Fac Environm, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Okpara, UT (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Fac Environm, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",uche4purpose@yahoo.co.uk,,,UK Economic and Social Research Council via the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy [ES/K006576/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Economic and Social Research Council via the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This study was funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council via the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (ES/K006576/1).,,58,15,15,1,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Thus, assessing the effect of future climate change on urban flooding and adopting effective flood management measures is becoming increasingly important. In this study, an urban rainstorm model and a scenario simulation method were applied to central Shanghai, China. We first examined the risks of flooding in the study area under the impact of future climate change using a simulation with different rainfall return periods. We then evaluated the benefits of traditional drainage system adaptation measures and Low Impact Development (LID) practices on alleviating the current urban flood hazard. Finally, we explored the effectiveness of using an integrated flood management scheme to adapt to climate change. The results show that the urban flood volume increases nonlinearly with increasing rainfall intensity under climate change. The maximum flooding area also increases accordingly, and is much more sensitive to smaller rainfall events. Both traditional drainage system adaptation measures and LID practices can effectively alleviate flooding, while an integrated flood management scheme that emphasizes the combination of the two methods is shown to be the most effective in reducing flooding under future climate change.","[Sun, Xiaojing] East China Normal Univ, Sch Chem & Mol Engn, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Li, Ruonan; Shan, Xinmeng; Xu, Hanqing; Wang, Jun] East China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Li, Ruonan; Shan, Xinmeng; Xu, Hanqing; Wang, Jun] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; East China Normal University; East China Normal University,"Wang, J (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",xjsun@chem.ecnu.edu.cn; liruonan0421@163.com; xmshan@stu.ecnu.edu.cn; xuhq@stu.ecnu.edu.cn; jwang@geo.ecnu.edu.cn,,,Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China [18ZDA105]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41971199]; Project of Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [19DZ1201505],Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality,"This work was financially supported by the Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China (18ZDA105), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41971199), and the Project of Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (19DZ1201505).",,47,14,14,17,74,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Although the availability of water from this has increased over time, there is a growing gap between water demand and availability, driven mainly by growth in tourism. Closing this gap is essential, particularly in the context of adaptation to climate change. In this regard, solar-driven water desalination plants have been installed on the islands to augment RWH supplies, thus creating a hybrid system. Although, the desalinated water (DW) is highly subsidised, there is a general reluctance to embrace its availability and to pay for it. In Carriacou, the borehole supply that was used to augment rainwater in the urban area was replaced by DW, resulting in increased use of the public supply. The potential of augmenting rainwater with DW is restricted by concerns about quality, a general unwillingness to pay for the water, the strong preference for rainwater and the inability of the utility company to recover costs. The initial lessons learnt from this hybrid system can be important for developing appropriate water policies for islands that have traditionally been dependent on RWH.","[Peters, Everson J.] Univ West Indies, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine,"Peters, EJ (corresponding author), Univ West Indies, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",everson.peters@sta.uwi.edu,,,,,,,66,3,3,0,7,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",1741-7589,1751-7729,,P I CIVIL ENG-WAT M,Proc.

However, there is a major gap in understanding the nature of protein interactions and pathway complexes needed to mediate carotenogenesis. In this study, we focused on carotene ring hydroxylation, which is performed by two structurally distinct classes of enzymes, the P450 CYP97A and CYP97C hydroxylases and the nonheme diiron HYD enzymes. The CYP97A and HYD enzymes both function in the hydroxylation of beta-rings in carotenes, but we show that they are not functionally interchangeable. The formation of lutein, which involves hydroxylation of both beta- and epsilon-rings, was shown to require the coexpression of CYP97A and CYP97C enzymes. These enzymes were also demonstrated to interact in vivo and in vitro, as determined using bimolecular fluorescence complementation and a pull- down assay, respectively. We discuss the role of specific hydroxylase enzyme interactions in promoting pathway flux and preventing the formation of pathway dead ends. These findings will facilitate efforts to manipulate carotenoid content and composition for improving plant adaptation to climate change and/or for enhancing nutritionally important carotenoids in food crops.","[Quinlan, Rena F.; Shumskaya, Maria; Bradbury, Louis M.

For the future we estimate substantial yield increases for bambara groundnut, soybean and groundnut, and little or no change and even decreases of maize and sorghum yields, varying according to the climate scenario and the agricultural region. Maize and sorghum (both C4 crops) yields are expected to decrease by 14.6 and 39.9%, respectively, across the whole country under GISS 2080 scenarios. The results also show that the effect of temperature patterns on climate change is much more important than that of precipitation.

These are likely to be exacerbated by global climate change and direct impacts from local human activities. Our ability to understand coastal changes has been limited by an incomplete understanding of the processes and the difficulty of obtaining detailed data. Recent advances in satellite techniques have made it possible to obtain rich coastal data sets that provide a solid foundation for improving climate change adaptation strategies for humanity and increasing the resilience of ecosystems for sustainable development. In this article, we review West African coastal layout and current socio-environmental challenges together with key parameters that can be monitored and several coastal management programs that rely on satellite techniques to monitor indicators at the regional level. The social, technical and scientific problems and difficulties that hinder the interest of coastal practitioners and decision-makers to use the satellite data are identified. We provide a roadmap to precisely respond to these difficulties and on how an improved satellite earth observation strategy can better support future coastal zone management in West Africa.","[Almar, Rafael] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, CNES, LEGOS IRD, 14 Av Edouard Belin, F-31401 Toulouse 9, France; [Stieglitz, Thomas] CEREGE Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Coll France, IRD,INRAE, Batiment Pasteur Europole Mediterraneen Arbois BP, F-13545 Aix En Provence 4, France; [Addo, Kwasi Appeaning] Univ Ghana, POB LG209, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Ba, Kader] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, Ch A Diop Corniche Ouest,BP 206, Dakar, Senegal; [Ondoa, Gregoire Abessolo] Univ Douala, Inst Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Ecosyst & Fishery Resources Lab, BP 2701, Douala, Cameroon; [Bergsma, Erwin W.

Previous studies have suggested that ocean-atmosphere coupling plays a key role in this intensification, but the precise role of the different components of the coupling has not been explored and quantified. In this paper, using a hierarchy of ocean coupling experiments, we isolate and quantify the respective roles of thermodynamic (changes in surface heat fluxes) and dynamic (changes in ocean heat flux convergence) ocean coupling in the projected intensification of North Atlantic transient eddy kinetic energy (TEKE). We show that dynamic coupling accounts for nearly all of the future TEKE strengthening as it overcomes the much smaller effect of surface heat flux changes to weaken the TEKE. We further show that by reducing the Arctic amplification in the North Atlantic, ocean heat flux convergence increases the meridional temperature gradient aloft, causing a larger eddy growth rate and resulting in the strengthening of North Atlantic TEKE. Our results stress the importance of better monitoring and investigating the changes in ocean heat transport, for improving climate change adaptation strategies.","[Chemke, Rei] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Rehovot, Israel; [Zanna, Laure] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY USA; [Orbe, Clara] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Sentman, Lori T.] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY USA",Weizmann Institute of Science; New York University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Chemke, R (corresponding author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Rehovot, Israel.",rei.chemke@weizmann.ac.il; clara.orbe@nasa.gov; lori.sentman@noaa.gov,"Zanna, Laure/L-3169-2019","Zanna, Laure/0000-0002-8472-4828",Israeli Science Foundation [906/21],Israeli Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),We are grateful to Ivan Mitevski for analyzing the GISS ModelE data.

This paper evaluates how the literature is studying the importance of law to protect traditional communities and respective territories and integrate their knowledge in climate change adaptation mechanisms. For this purpose, it undertakes a literature review of scientific articles that cross the topics of indigenous/traditional communities, climate change, territory, water, and law, published between 2010 and 2020. The findings show a residual number of articles on climate change paying attention to traditional communities and an uneven distribution of case studies among the world' regions. Furthermore, they bring to the fore that, despite the potential to foster the protection of traditional communities from climate change impacts and to assure the integration of their knowledge into resilience policymaking, the role of law is scantly referred to in articles and the Paris Agreement has not exerted significant influence in the development of new studies with this approach.

Climate models are the primary tools for providing information on future precipitation change, though communicating and interpreting results of different model simulations is challenging. Using an online survey, completed by producers and users of climate model information, we compare and evaluate interpretations of different approaches used to summarise and visualise future climate projections. Results reveal large differences in interpretations of precipitation change arising from choices made in summarising and visualising the data. Respondents interpret significantly smaller ranges of future precipitation change when provided with the multi-model ensemble mean or percentile information, which are commonly used to summarise climate model projections, compared to information about the full ensemble. The ensemble mean is found to be particularly misleading, even when used with information to show model agreement in the sign of change. We conclude that these approaches can lead to distorted interpretations which may impact on adaptation policy and decision-making. To help improve the interpretation and use of climate projections in decision-making, regular testing of visualisations and sustained engagement with target audiences is required to determine the most effective and appropriate visualisation approaches.","[Daron, Joseph] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Daron, Joseph] Univ Bristol, Fac Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Lorenz, Susanne; Taylor, Andrea; Dessai, Suraje] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Taylor, Andrea] Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Met Office - UK; University of Bristol; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Daron, J (corresponding author), Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England.;Daron, J (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Fac Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.",joseph.daron@metoffice.gov.uk,"Daron, Joseph/I-3942-2014; Lorenz, Susanne/G-3893-2014","Daron, Joseph/0000-0003-1917-0264; Lorenz, Susanne/0000-0002-9124-9690; Taylor, Andrea/0000-0002-8949-1234",Met Office Academic Partnership (MOAP) Collaboration Fund,Met Office Academic Partnership (MOAP) Collaboration Fund,"We acknowledge the Met Office Academic Partnership (MOAP) Collaboration Fund for supporting collaboration with the University of Leeds.

Research has focused on the overarching institutional architecture of global adaptation, particularly how it relates to development, political economy, efficiency and equity. In contrast to the transnational dimension of climate mitigation, the transnationalization of adaptation governance has received scant attention. By creating a dataset of adaptation projects, we examine transnational adaptation governance in terms of its scope, institutionalization and main functions. We find transnational adaptation governance to be firmly anchored within the UNFCCC, but a recent change towards adaptation governed by a transnational constituency can be identified. When non-state actors become integral to the project of governing adaptation, a 'fourth era' of adaption seems to be emerging. This new era is not replacing other forms of governing, but is emerging alongside and in a complementary fashion. In the 'fourth era', adaptation is increasingly governed globally and transnationally, and the attention is turned toward 'softer' forms of governance such as agenda setting, information sharing and capacity building.

This paper reviews research inputs into the concept of vulnerability and highlights the challenges of resolving its spatial and temporal variability with building resilience and adaptation. We hypothesise that a clear understanding of scale is key to integrating these related issues, by differentiating three dimensions of scale when analysing relationships between the observed and the intrinsic scale of a given phenomenon, namely space, time and dimensional level. The paper analyses 20 vulnerability assessment approaches, ranging from the global down to the local scale, and positions them with regard to their integration of the spatial component. We then develop a vulnerability cube as a framework to position existing approaches and to map them in a three-dimensional space. The three axes represent space, time and dimension and provide a structure for the different notions of scales and ultimately for a spatial analysis workflow. The vulnerability cube framework helps us to position different vulnerability assessments and to identify overlaps, differences and specific characteristics.

An exploration of stakeholder viewpoints on how to organize adaptation",CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate adaptation; Stakeholder perspectives; Governance; Q methodology,WICKED PROBLEMS; MARKETS; NETHERLANDS; HIERARCHIES; NETWORK,"There are many normative answers on the question how to realize climate adaptation, ranging from pleas for the government to play a decisive role, to calls for refraining from action and relying upon spontaneous adaptation of both government and non-governmental actors. In this article, we present a Q methodological study, aimed at investigating the governance preferences among non-governmental actors in the Netherlands and the narratives they use to motivate these preferences. Our empirical results underline the fact that the question how to organize adaptation, is a controversial one. The results resemble the various positions in the current academic debate about the governance of adaptation, and add important insights and nuances to it. Many respondents feel that the current climate adaptation policy is too non-committal. The dominant viewpoint underscores a need for more rules and norms and the possibility to sanction organizations that do not adapt. Minority viewpoints show an urge to stimulate and support self-organization of partners, as well as a need for more action. However, financial and regulatory preconditions are needed to stimulate actors in order to see to the necessary investments. Policy-makers have to invest in mixing their policy instruments. Clearly, most nongovernmental actors are in favor of the government setting a framework with rules and norms for climate adaption. However, the viewpoints show that this is not sufficient. The government should facilitate networks, joint efforts and create the financial and regulatory preconditions to remove current barriers blocking adaptation measures.","[Molenveld, Astrid; van Buuren, Arwin] Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Molenveld, Astrid] Univ Antwerp, Res Grp Polit & Publ Governance, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Ellen, Gerald-Jan] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Antwerp; Deltares,"Molenveld, A (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Molenveld, A (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Res Grp Polit & Publ Governance, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",molenveld@essb.eur.nl,,"Molenveld, Astrid/0000-0003-0228-6893",,,,,79,12,12,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In a survey of visitors to one National Park wilderness in California, visitors revealed that they largely do not support biophysical intervention in wilderness to mitigate the effects of climate change, but broad support for activities that restore natural conditions exists. In an attempt to understand how these attitudes vary among visitors, it was found that those visitors who most value naturalness aspects of wilderness character also most positively support restoration and are most negative toward climate change intervention practices. More information about visitor-defined wilderness character attributes is needed and strategic planning to guide intervention decisions and restoration should be a priority. In this study, it was found that wilderness character is largely defined by visitors based on its wildness attributes, which include natural sounds, low density of people, pure water, clean air, and the presence of humans substantially unnoticeable.","[Watson, Alan; Christensen, Neal] USDA, Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Aldo Leopold Wilderness Res Inst, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Martin, Steve] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Management, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Fauth, Gregg] Sequoia Natl Pk, Three Rivers, CA 93271 USA; [Fauth, Gregg] Kings Canyon Natl Pk, Three Rivers, CA 93271 USA; [Williams, Dan] USDA, Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; California State University System; California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service","Watson, A (corresponding author), USDA, Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Aldo Leopold Wilderness Res Inst, 790 East Beckwith Ave, Missoula, MT 59801 USA.",awatson@fs.fed.us,,,Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks; Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute; Humboldt State University,Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks; Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute; Humboldt State University,"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding and other support from Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute, and Humboldt State University.

Forest managers have developed ambitious deterministic approaches to provide the services demanded, and thus the use of deterministic approaches for adapting to climate change seem to be a logical continuation. However, as uncertainty about the intensity of climate change is high, forest managers need to answer this uncertainty conceptually. One may envision an indeterministic approach to cope with this uncertainty; but how the services will be provided in such a concept remains unclear. This article aims to explore the fundamental aspects of both deterministic and indeterministic approaches used in forestry to cope with climate change, and thereby point out trade-offs in service provisioning and adaptability. A forest owner needs to be able to anticipate these trade-offs in order to make decisions towards sustainable forest management under climate change.","[Wagner, Sven; Huth, Franka] Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Silviculture, Dresden, Germany; [Nocentini, Susanna] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food & Forestry Syst, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Hoogstra-Klein, Marjanke] Wageningen Univ, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Florence; Wageningen University & Research,"Wagner, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Silviculture, Dresden, Germany.",,"Wagner, Sven/HHD-1329-2022; nocentini, susanna/I-4563-2018","nocentini, susanna/0000-0003-1600-1000; Hoogstra-Klein, Marjanke/0000-0001-8405-4345",,,,,102,47,50,0,46,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Initiatives to identify adaptation needs and to improve adaptive capacity increasingly start with an assessment of the vulnerability of the system of interest, in terms of who and what are vulnerable, to what stresses, in what way, and what capacity exists to adapt to changing risks. Notwithstanding the scholarship on climate change itself, there are few studies on the nature of Arctic communities' vulnerability to climate-change risks. We review existing literature on implications of climate change for Arctic communities, develop a conceptual model of vulnerability, and present an analytical approach to assessing climate hazards and coping strategies in Arctic communities. Vulnerability is conceptualized as a function of exposure to climatic stresses and the adaptive capacity to cope with these stresses. The analytical framework employs place-specific case studies involving community residents and integrates information from multiple sources, both to document current exposures and adaptations and to characterize future exposures and adaptive capacity.","Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Ford, JD (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jford01@uoguelph.ca; bsmit@uoguelph.ca,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456",,,,,104,379,384,1,113,ARCTIC INST N AMER,CALGARY,"UNIV OF CALGARY 2500 UNIVERSITY DRIVE NW 11TH FLOOR LIBRARY TOWER, CALGARY, ALBERTA T2N 1N4, CANADA",0004-0843,1923-1245,,ARCTIC,Arctic,DEC,2004,57,4,,,,,389,400,,10.14430/arctic516,http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic516,,,12,"Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,880NA,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000225795300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Researching and documenting all resorts between 1969-2019, we find that 59% of all resorts in North America have closed since the resort boom of the 1960s and 70s (65% in the United States, 31% in Canada). This shift has left some states or provinces with only one or no resorts remaining. To proactively persevere with a variable climate, less water, and a need for more energy to make snow, we suggest mountains holistically plan for sustainability. Recommendations include third party environmental certification, commitment to sustainability at the management level, communication to customers about sustainability practices and implementing unique models for remaining open and competitive. These practices include resort consolidation, multi-mountain passes, and/or unique ownership models.

A framework for 'accommodative leadership' was created - building on the work of Meijerink and Stiller (2013) regarding leadership in climate change adaptation, and the work of Sotarauta (2010) on place leadership. The combination of the two provides a leadership framework which aims to include both governmental actors and local citizens initiatives as potential leaders in wind energy development. Three cases studies in three regions of the Netherlands were assessed. The results show that provinces adopt various leadership styles, referred to as 'facilitative decentralization', 'deliberative innovation' and 'authoritative reluctance'. Our conclusion is that there is no madmap for effective accommodative leadership, as it occurs in many forms. Nonetheless the developed framework can be used by regional governments as an assessment tool to understand the roles and actions which can potentially be taken by this authority to purposefully allocate their leadership capacities, while allowing citizen-led wind energy development.","[Horlings, Lummina Geertruida] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, Landleven 1, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands; [van Aalderen, Nicolien] KWR Water Res Inst, Groningenhaven 7, NL-3430 BB Nieuwegein, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Horlings, LG (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, Landleven 1, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands.",nicolien.van.aalderen@kwrwater.nl; l.g.horlings@rug.nl,,"Horlings, Lummina/0000-0002-8690-7986",,,,,57,10,10,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2020,138,,,,,,,,111249,10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111249,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111249,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LD6BZ,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000526116500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Commonly, they are designed as embankments with grass covers or grey revetments accounting for the prevailing hydraulic loads. So far, incorporation of ecological aspects in the dike design is limited. With regard to increasing environmental awareness and climate change adaptation needs, the present study reviews methods for ecological enhancement of sea dikes and discusses limitations and challenges related to these methods. In doing so, one key aspect is to maintain dike safety while increasing the ecological value. Potential for ecological enhancement of sea dikes has been found regarding natural or nature-based solutions in the foreshore, dike surface protection measures (vegetated dike covers, hard revetments and dike roads) and the dike geometry. While natural and nature-based solutions in the foreland are investigated thoroughly, so far only few experiences with ecological enhancements of the dike structure itself were gained resulting in uncertainties and knowledge gaps concerning the implementation and efficiency.

Understanding how to build livelihood resilience to these effects is a pressing need. Agroforestry is one potential solution. Although many people intuitively link agroforestry with livelihood resilience to floods and drought, little comprehensive empirical evidence exists. Here, we strive to answer the call for more empirical evidence by drawing on field work in Isiolo County, Kenya to ask the research question: How does agroforestry help smallholder farmers build livelihood resilience to floods and drought? We used a mixed- methods approach that included 20 qualitative case study households and 338 quantitative household surveys. Our major findings are: (1) practicing agroforestry can influence perceptions of floods and drought, (2) specific environmental and livelihood benefits of agroforestry contribute to livelihood resilience, and (3) agroforestry directly and indirectly builds livelihood resilience to floods and drought. Identifying potential climate change adaptation strategies is crucial for smallholder farmers.

The Samoan seasonal calendar is predominantly based on the observations of local environmental changes, which are in turn influenced by weather and climate. Monitoring changes in plants and animal behaviour, for example, are key indicators used by the Samoans to forecast changes in weather and climate. In addition, their communal and family social activities like hunting, fishing and feasting are driven by the seasonal calendar. The Samoans knowledge of cloud formation, conditions conducive to the formation and onset of severe weather systems and seasonal changes in climate, helped them anticipate, plan and adapt to extreme weather and climate events. The ability and knowledge of the Samoans to forecast the onset of extreme weather and climate events, relying predominantly on local environmental changes are vital tools that should be incorporated in the formulation of human induced climate change adaptation strategies.","MetServ Meteorol Serv New Zealand Ltd, Sci Res & Dev, Wellington 6140, New Zealand",,"Lefale, PF (corresponding author), MetServ Meteorol Serv New Zealand Ltd, Sci Res & Dev, 30 Salamanca Rd,POB 722, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",pene.lefale@metservice.com,,,"NIWA; New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology (FRST) [CO1X0202]","NIWA; New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology (FRST)(New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology)","I have received many helpful comments from various people during the course of this research.

The results showed a positive trend in annual, dry (March-May) and small rain (Octo-ber-February) seasons rainfall in more than 54% of the stations and a decreasing trend in the main rain (June-September) season rainfall in 65.4% of the stations. Several extreme rainfall indices showed insignificant positive trends in the basin. Although there is a positive trend in extreme rainfall, the number of consecutive wet days (CWD) and the simple daily intensity index (SDII) show insignificant negative trends in most stations. In addition, a warming trend of the annual and seasonal maximum and minimum temperature extreme indices was noted. Overall, the increase in extreme rainfall and a warming trend in the extreme temperature indices indicate signs of climate change in the UBNB. The findings of this study suggests the need for developing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the UBNB.","[Mohammed, Jemal Ali; Gashaw, Temesgen; Addisu, Solomon] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Nat Resource Management, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Tefera, Gebrekidan Worku] Prairie View A&M Univ, Coll Agr & Human Sci, Prairie View, TX 77446 USA; [Dile, Yihun T.] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, College Stn, TX USA; [Worqlul, Abeyou W.] Texas A&M Univ, Blackland Res & Extens Ctr, Temple, TX USA; [Mohammed, Jemal Ali] Mekdela Amba Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Forestry, Germame, Ethiopia",Bahir Dar University; Texas A&M University System; Prairie View A&M University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System,"Mohammed, JA (corresponding author), Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Nat Resource Management, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.",jemalali344@gmail.com,"Tefera, Gebrekidan Worku/AFJ-7307-2022","Tefera, Gebrekidan Worku/0000-0003-3750-0490","College of Agriculture and Environmental Science, Bahir Dar University","College of Agriculture and Environmental Science, Bahir Dar University","The climate data was received from the Ethiopian National Meteorological Services Agency (NMSA).

Our results show that hierarchical and market arrangements co-exist in the various stages of the policy process. Cities with a higher prevalence of hierarchical arrangements have substantially higher implementation rates for green roofs. Although private sector involvement is crucial for raising efficiencies, a significant level of public responsibility taken by local governments appears to be salient for unleashing the potential of green roofs.","[Mees, Heleen L.

Strong evidence of recovery has been reported across North America and Europe, driving chemical responses. The primary chemical responses identified in this review were in-creasing concentration and changing character of natural organic matter (NOM) towards predominantly hydrophobic nature. The concentration of NOM also influenced trace metal cycling as many browning surface waters also reported increases in Fe and Al. Further, climate change and other factors (e.g., changing land use) act in concert with reduc-tions in atmospheric deposition to contribute to widespread browning and will have a more pronounced effect as de-position stabilizes. The observed water quality trends have presented challenges for drinking water treatment (e.g., increased chemical dosing, poor filter operations, formation of disinfection by-products) and many facilities may be under designed as a result. This comprehensive review has identified key research areas to be addressed, in-cluding 1) a need for comprehensive monitoring programs (e.g., larger timescales; consistency in measurements) to assess climate change impacts on recovery responses and NOM dynamics, and 2) a better understanding of drinking water treatment vulnerabilities and the transition towards robust treatment technologies and solutions that can adapt to climate change and other drivers of changing water quality.","[Anderson, Lindsay E.; DeMont, Isobel; Dunnington, Dewey D.; Redden, Dave J.; Gagnon, Graham A.] Dalhousie Univ, Ctr Water Resources Studies, Dept Civil & Resource Engn, 1360 Barrington St, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Bjorndahl, Paul] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Brophy, Michael J.] CBCL Ltd, 1505 Barrington St, Halifax, NS B3J 3K5, Canada",Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University,"Anderson, LE (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Ctr Water Resources Studies, Dept Civil & Resource Engn, 1360 Barrington St, Halifax, NS, Canada.",Ln998177@dal.ca,,"Redden, David/0000-0001-5567-3868",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Industrial Research Chair program [IRCPJ: 349838-16]; NSERC Post-Graduate Scholarship Program; Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships; NSERC ASPIRE CREATE program; Killam Trusts,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Industrial Research Chair program; NSERC Post-Graduate Scholarship Program; Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships; NSERC ASPIRE CREATE program; Killam Trusts,"We would like to acknowledge funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Industrial Research Chair program (grant number IRCPJ: 349838-16).

Improving water use efficiency, implementing precision irrigation could help achieve sustainable use of water resources. Cereal production reusing treated water could contribute to strengthening resilience and adaptation to climate change in Cape Verde. Our pilot project demonstrates that the safe and profitable reuse of water produced by Cape Verde's water treatment plants is possible by avoiding water and plant contact using Subsurface Drip Irrigation (SDI), obtaining food yields between 10,000 and 7000 kg of cob/ha, with a water consumption of about 300 L/kg Dry-Matter and a Water-Use-Efficiency of about 3 g/L. These studies also showed that it is necessary to provide training to farmers and to conduct further studies to help solve present challenges. This project identif installation failures as water shortages can compromise farmers' profitability. To guarantee the sustainability of water reuse, it is also necessary to consider economic and social factors, including that all water that is not reused is poured, increasing environmental and sanitary risk and decreasing the possibility of recovering water treatment costs.","[Mendoza-Grimon, Vanessa; Palacios-Diaz, Maria del Pino] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Invest IUNAT, Grp GEOVOL, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35001, Spain; [Fernandez-Vera, Juan Ramon] Lab Agroalimentario & Fitopatol Cabildo Gran Cana, Arucas 35013, Spain; [Silva, Gilbert Duarte] Inst Nacl Invest & Desenvolvimento Agr INIDA, Sao Jorge Dos Orgaos 84, Cape Verde; [Semedo-Varela, Angelo] Instalacoes Gerais & Manutencao Lda Praia, INDUS, Rua Santa Luzia Palmarejo, Praia 7601, Cape Verde",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Palacios-Diaz, MD (corresponding author), Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Invest IUNAT, Grp GEOVOL, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35001, Spain.",v.mendozagrimon@ulpgc.es; jrfernandezv@grancanaria.com; gilbert.silva@inida.gov.cv; indusgestcv@gmail.com; mp.palaciosdiaz@ulpgc.es,"Palacios-Diaz, M.P./ABE-8038-2020","Palacios-Diaz, M.P./0000-0003-4075-2592; Mendoza-Grimon, Vanessa Reyes/0000-0002-0755-5637",Interreg MAC 2104-2020 Program ADAPTaRES Proyect [MAC/3.5b/102],Interreg MAC 2104-2020 Program ADAPTaRES Proyect,This research was funded by Interreg MAC 2104-2020 Program ADAPTaRES Proyect (MAC/3.5b/102) http://adaptares.com/es/.,,30,4,4,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2021,13,2,,,,,,,160,10.3390/w13020160,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13020160,,,14,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,PY5BE,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000612058700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

By employing data from 1800 Bangladeshi farm-households in eight drought-prone and groundwater-depleted districts of three climatic zones and logit models, this study breaks new ground in investigating farm-level adaptation to climate change. Results showed that farmers' perceptions of climatic variability supported macro-level evidence. Science-driven (e.g., drought tolerant rice), environmental resource-depleting (e.g., groundwater), and crop-switching (e.g., non-rice crops) typified preferred farm-level adaptation strategies to alleviate adverse effects of climate change. Drought severity, extent of groundwater depletion, education level, farm-size, access to climate information, and electricity for irrigation, and agricultural subsidies were significant factors underpinning farmers' decision to adapt. Inadequate access to climate information and scientific research outcomes, limited irrigation facility and resource-base represented major adaptation barriers. Strengthening agricultural research and support services including information accessibility, community-focussed farming education and training for improved crop culture practices, and expanded and efficient surface-water irrigation infrastructure are critically important for creating an effective adaptation process to climate change. Scientific research-driven adaptation measures with stronger support systems appear more sustainable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This meta-analysis indicated that the blue carbon ecosystems of India could have a collective carbon stock of 67.35 Tg C (mangroves, seagrass, and salt marsh accounting for 67 Tg C, 0.0630 Tg C, and 0.0049 Tg C, respectively). Several studies have ubiquitously measured the spatial extent of mangroves (similar to 4991 km(2)) and seagrasses (similar to 517 km(2)) in India; however, the salt marshes (290-1398 km(2)) have contradictions in estimates. The green payments against the blue carbon ecosystems of India can be as high as similar to 9.6 billion US $, whereas the social cost of carbon sequestered by these ecosystems can vary between 0.47 and 5.43 billion US $. The present study also identified the key research areas that require priority to minimize the uncertainties in blue carbon stock assessment to foster a robust ecosystem-based approach for climate change adaptation in the country. The study identified that less than half of the total mangrove habitats of India are yet to be sampled leaving a scope of substantial uncertainty in nationwide blue carbon estimates. The spatial extent of India's salt marshes is another aspect that needs to be delineated with a higher confidence level.","[Akhand, Anirban] Port & Airport Res Inst, Coastal & Estuarine Environm Res Grp, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan; [Akhand, Anirban] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ocean Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chanda, Abhra] Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Jameel, Yusuf] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Dasgupta, Rajarshi] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Integrated Sustainabil Ctr ISC, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan",Port & Airport Research Institute; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Jadavpur University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Chanda, A (corresponding author), Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata, W Bengal, India.",abhrachanda1985@gmail.com,,"DasGupta, Rajarshi/0000-0003-0051-5090; Chanda, Abhra/0000-0002-3280-1959; Akhand, Anirban/0000-0002-4239-8841",Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) under Collaborative Regional Research Programme (CRRP) [CRRP2018-03MY-Hashimoto],Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) under Collaborative Regional Research Programme (CRRP),This research work is supported by the Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) under Collaborative Regional Research Programme (CRRP) with grant number CRRP2018-03MY-Hashimoto.,,74,0,0,11,15,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

Based on ethnoecological fieldwork, in this paper we examine how people living in the cuvette centrale of the Congo basin have adopted flood-recession agriculture on islands in the Congo River, taking advantage of a secular shift since the 1980s in the hydrological regime of the Congo River. Analyses of the hydrological data reveal that this shift decreased flood risk and significantly extended the growing season on the islands, long enough to enable cultivation of fast-maturing varieties of manioc and other crops. Flood-recession farming on islands in the river is today not only an important source of food, but also a source of income for women, who are primarily responsible for seasonal cultivation of fields during the low-water season. Hydrological changes alone are insufficient to explain the adoption of the new agricultural practice; adoption also arose as a result of dynamic interactions among river fishing, trading, and broader socio-economic forces. Climate-change models project an increased frequency of extreme floods. Our results suggest that this change may limit island cultivation in the future. More generally, our findings point to the importance of looking beyond single-factor, solely environmental explanations in studies of climate-change adaptation.","[Comptour, Marion; Caillon, Sophie; McKey, Doyle] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, UMR CEFE, Univ Montpellier, CNRS,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Cosiaux, Ariane] Univ Montpellier, UMR DIADE, IRD, Montpellier, France; [Coomes, Oliver T.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bader, Jean-Claude] IRD, UMR G EAU, Montpellier, France; [Malaterre, Pierre-Olivier] IRSTEA, UMR G EAU, Montpellier, France; [Yoka, Joseph] Univ Marien Ngouabi, Fac Sci & Tech, Brazzaville, Rep Congo; [McKey, Doyle] Inst Univ France, Paris, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; McGill University; AgroParisTech; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); AgroParisTech; INRAE; Institut Universitaire de France,"Comptour, M (corresponding author), Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, UMR CEFE, Univ Montpellier, CNRS,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France.",marion.comptour@cnrs.fr,"Malaterre, Pierre-Olivier/AAK-3309-2020","Coomes, Oliver T/0000-0002-8220-8758; McKey, Doyle/0000-0002-7271-901X","Institut Universitaire de France; CNES (Centre Nationale d'Etudes Spatiales); Groupement de Recherche Mosaique [GDR 3353 INEE/CNRS]; French Ministere de l'Enseignement superieur, de la Recherche et de l'Innovation","Institut Universitaire de France; CNES (Centre Nationale d'Etudes Spatiales); Groupement de Recherche Mosaique; French Ministere de l'Enseignement superieur, de la Recherche et de l'Innovation","Institut Universitaire de France; CNES (Centre Nationale d'Etudes Spatiales); Groupement de Recherche Mosaique, Grant/Award Number: GDR 3353 INEE/CNRS; French Ministere de l'Enseignement superieur, de la Recherche et de l'Innovation",,47,2,3,5,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0016-7398,1475-4959,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

Most impacts of climate variability and change affect regions and jurisdictions in complex ways, and techniques for assessing this transmission of risk are still somewhat limited. Here, we begin to define new approaches to risk assessment that can account for transboundary and trans-sector risk transmission, by presenting: (i) a typology of risk transmission that distinguishes clearly the role of climate versus the role of the social and economic systems that distribute resources; (ii) a review of existing modelling, qualitative and systems-based methods of assessing risk and risk transmission; and (iii) case studies that examine risk transmission in human displacement, food, water and energy security. The case studies show that policies and institutions can attenuate risks significantly through cooperation that can be mutually beneficial to all parties. We conclude with some suggestions for assessment of complex risk transmission mechanisms: use of expert judgement; interactive scenario building; global systems science and big data; innovative use of climate and integrated assessment models; and methods to understand societal responses to climate risk.

Moreover, given considerable model inadequacies, irreducible uncertainties, and poor accessibility to model output, we may legitimately ask whether or not regional climate projections ought to have a central role in guiding climate change adaptation decisions. This question is addressed by analysing the value of regional downscaled climate model output in the management of complex socio-ecological systems (SESs) vulnerable to climate change. We demonstrate, using the example of the Dwesa-Cwebe region in South Africa, that the management of such systems under changing environmental and socio-economic conditions requires a nuanced and holistic approach that addresses cross-scale system interdependencies and incorporates complexity thinking. We argue that the persistent focus on increasing precision and skill in regional climate projections is misguided and does not adequately address the needs of society. However, this does not imply that decision makers should exclude current and future generations of regional climate projections in their management processes. On the contrary, ignoring such information, however uncertain and incomplete, risks the implementation of maladaptive policies and practices. By using regional climate projections to further explore uncertainties and investigate cross-scale system dependencies, such information can be used to aid understanding of how SESs might evolve under alternative future societal and environmental scenarios.","[Daron, Joseph David; Sutherland, Kate; Jack, Christopher; Hewitson, Bruce C.] Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Daron, JD (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.",jdaron@csag.uct.ac.za,"Hewitson, Bruce/B-3295-2014; Daron, Joseph/I-3942-2014; Jack, Christopher/B-7926-2014","Hewitson, Bruce/0000-0001-7546-4430; Daron, Joseph/0000-0003-1917-0264; /0000-0003-1890-8394; Jack, Christopher/0000-0002-0936-7277",Climate System Analysis Group at the University of Cape Town,Climate System Analysis Group at the University of Cape Town,"The authors would like to acknowledge the helpful input of Lisa Coop, Chris Lennard and Piotr Wolski.

In view of the geo-political complexity, climate-driven changes in water availability are of particular importance in this region. Water shortages during summer will become more frequent as precipitation is expected to further decrease and glacial meltwater releases will decrease in the long-term due to reduced glacier volume. Being the main valve to the entire Syr Darya river system, the Toktogul reservoir in Kyrgyzstan could take over, at least partly, the role of glaciers as seasonal water redistributors, thus allowing the generation of energy in winter -benefiting upstream countries - and irrigation for large-scale agriculture in summer-benefiting downstream countries. To date, however, there is no regional consensus on a balanced reservoir management, which currently favours irrigation according to past Soviet priorities. Moreover, the perception of water as a 'national concern' in Central Asia discourages efforts towards cooperation between states at the regional level. So far, climate change adaptation has focused on technical rather than institutional solutions. We suggest that policy-relevant adaptation measures should include consistent data collection and dissemination, cross-sectoral collaboration, promotion of national responsibility and initiative, and agreeing on a regional strategy.

This paper uses causal inference estimators to evaluate the effect of these technologies on irrigators at the farm level in two irrigated valleys in Central Chile. Doubly robust estimators were employed to address the selection bias of the adoption of improved irrigation technologies. The results show first a low level of technology adoption, with only 18% of irrigators adopting irrigation, where access to credits and education plays a crucial role in their adoption. Despite this low rate, the estimates show consistently positive and significant impacts on adopters in terms of annual margins and land use. As a result, our research calls for attention towards focusing programs and policy targeting on reducing entry barriers and broadening the adoption of irrigation technologies, allowing to reduce the gap in terms of economic wellbeing and the long-term sustainability and adaptation to climate change of irrigated areas.","[Jordan, Cristian; Speelman, Stijn] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Donoso, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Econ Agr, Casilla 306-22, Santiago, Chile; [Donoso, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Derecho & Gest Aguas, Santiago, Chile",Ghent University; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Jordan, C (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",cristian.jordandiaz@ugent.be,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Donoso, Guillermo/A-1643-2012","speelman, stijn/0000-0001-7692-3459; Donoso, Guillermo/0000-0001-9958-4787","government of Chile through the National Agency for Research and Development (Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo, ANID) , Programa de Formacion de Capital Humano Avanzado, Becas Chile [72180081]","government of Chile through the National Agency for Research and Development (Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo, ANID) , Programa de Formacion de Capital Humano Avanzado, Becas Chile","The government of Chile supports this research through the National Agency for Research and Development (Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo, ANID) , Programa de Formacion de Capital Humano Avanzado, Becas Chile, Grant No: 72180081.",,75,5,5,4,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-3774,1873-2283,,AGR WATER MANAGE,Agric.

This paper critically examines the assumptions, exclusions, and orientations that characterize this broad literature, and suggests revising and expanding the terms upon which it is carried out. It focuses in particular on the exclusion of colonialism from the study of human vulnerability and adaptation to climatic change, the framing of Indigenous peoples and communities in terms of the local and the traditional, and the ways in which efforts to improve the lives of northern Indigenous peoples risk perpetuating colonial relations. The paper argues that these exclusions and orientations lead scholars to systematically overlook the immense importance of resource extraction and shipping as human dimensions of climatic change in the Canadian Arctic, and it examines the implications of such oversights.

Drainage is required to use the land: for the inhabitants, for agriculture and for nature. Traditionally drainage was by gravity: through open (and later pipe) drains excess rainfall was transferred into open collector drains, from where the water was pumped out to a river, lake or the sea. Since the 1950s, land use has been changing towards a more diverse and intensive agriculture, more attention for nature, recreation and continuing urbanization. On top of this, the climate is changing: significant increases in precipitation, both average and extreme. Until recently, the solution to more excess water was to increase pump capacity. Yet the combined problems of climate change, sea level rise, subsidence and urbanization require more structural changes in water management. Drainage systems have to be modified to enable the shift from a strategy of rapid removal of all excess water to one that continuously controls water levels individually in each agricultural plot. A new approach of 'retention, storage and controlled removal' is being used to develop climate adaptation scenarios for the three hydro-ecological zones in the Netherlands, i.e.: (1) the man-made polder areas with marine clay soils along the North Sea coast and the former Zuider Sea; (2) the low-lying peat lands in the west and north; and (3) the sandy and loamy soils areas in the centre, south and east. New approaches for tailor-made drainage solutions following this strategy are being tested in various pilot areas in the three zones. Although the research is still ongoing, this paper presents the lessons learned to date related to the challenges, risks and limitations associated with the introduction of these new drainage strategies for coping with climate change in the Netherlands.","[Ritzema, H.

A total of 200 sample households of various land size categories were contacted for collecting data using a well-structured and pre-tested schedule. Study findings revealed that variability in temperature and rainfall has affected adversely to the livelihoods of farmers. Low level of livelihood status, fewer non-farm employment opportunities and low cropped area under irrigation were the main barriers to climate change adaptation. Insurance and credit were the main positive determinants that motivated farmers to adjust farm practices. Early maturing seed varieties and less water consuming crop varieties were the most profitable adaptation strategies.

To analyze drought risks, weather data obtained by the statistical downscaling method were entered to produce runoff series by runoff modeling and water balance was analyzed based on water use scenarios to review changes in the storage volume under climate change. To analyze flood risks, changes in water levels of the dam in future flood seasons were reviewed based on the current dam operation method. The results of the review indicated that both the drought and the flood risks of the dam would increase in the future. The reason was considered to be the movement of the flood season's runoff characteristics from July and August to August and September because of climate change. Therefore, for climate change adaptation planning, not only quantitative changes in hydrologic values but also changes in temporal characteristics should be considered and given importance.","[Kim, Soojun] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Columbia Water Ctr, Upper Manhattan, NY USA; [Kwak, Jaewon; Noh, Hui Seong; Kim, Hung Soo] Inha Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Inchon 402751, South Korea",Inha University,"Kim, HS (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Inchon 402751, South Korea.",soojun78@gmail.com; firstsword@naver.com; heesung@hanmail.net; sookim@inha.ac.kr,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korean government (MEST) [2011-0028564]; National Research Foundation of Korea [2011-0028564] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korean government (MEST)(Ministry of Education, Science & Technology (MEST), Republic of KoreaKorean Government); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) and grant funded by the Korean government (MEST; No. 2011-0028564).,,43,6,6,1,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

The purpose of this study is to assess the perception of farmers to climate change, adaptation strategies and determinants of adaptation choice in central Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach The study used data from randomly selected 240 farm households. Descriptive statistics were used to describe farmers' perceptions of climate change and adaptation strategies. Also, a multivariate probit model was used to identify the major factors affecting farmers' choice of adaptation strategies to climate change in central Ethiopia. Findings Smallholder farmers perceive climate change in the past two decades in response; the majority (91.47%) of farmers used adaptation options. Improved crop varieties and input intensity, crop diversification, planting date adjustment, soil and water conservation activities and changing of the crop type were used as adaptation options in the study area. A few of these strategies were significantly confirmed a complementary and supplementary relationship. The study identified sex, family size, agroecology, climate information, crop-fail history and formal extension service as significant determinants for farmers' adaptation choices as these variables significantly affected more than two farmers' adaptation strategies simultaneously. Research limitations/implications Farmers' choice of adaptation was highly constrained by institutional factors and all these identified factors can be possibly addressed through a better institutional service provision system. It is, therefore, recommended that local administrators should explore the institutional service provision system for a better farm-level adaptation while considering demographic characteristics as well. Originality/value This study identified factors affecting farmers' several adaptation strategies at a time and provides information for the policymaker to make cost-effective interventions for better farm-level adaptation practices.","[Addis, Yonnas] Wolkite Univ, Welkite, Ethiopia; [Abirdew, Solomon] Wolkite Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, Welkite, Ethiopia",,"Addis, Y (corresponding author), Wolkite Univ, Welkite, Ethiopia.",yonnas.addis@wku.edu.et,"Addis, Yonnas/AAB-8547-2022",,Wolkite University - Wolkite University research and community service office,Wolkite University - Wolkite University research and community service office,"The authors are grateful for the financial support from Wolkite University for this study.

While these results should be treated with caution, they suggest that the PSNP may not be helping smallholders diversify income sources in a positive manner for climate adaptation.

This study extensively hand-collects data on water usage, the existence of CSR committees from CSR reports, and the annual reports of companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and Taipei Exchange companies during 2017-2020. Our findings support the stakeholder theory that the existence of CSR committees likely set water use reduction targets and facilitated water usage reduction.

Because it explicitly incorporates uncertainty, scenario planning is regularly employed in climate change adaptation. An early and essential step in developing scenarios is identifying climate futures-descriptions of the physical attributes of plausible future climates that could occur at a specific place and time. Divergent climate futures that describe the broadest possible range of plausible conditions support information needs of decision makers, including understanding the spectrum of potential resource responses to climate change, developing strategies robust to that range, avoiding highly consequential surprises, and averting maladaptation. Here, we discuss three approaches for generating climate futures: a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)-ensemble, a quadrant-average, and an individual-projection approach. All are designed to capture relevant uncertainty, but they differ in utility for different applications, complexity, and effort required to implement. Using an application from Big Bend National Park as an example of numerous similar efforts to develop climate futures for National Park Service applications over the past decade, we compare these approaches, focusing on their ability to capture among-projection divergence during early-, mid-, and late-twenty-first century periods to align with near-, mid-, and long-term planning efforts. The quadrant-average approach and especially the individual-projection approach captured a broader range of plausible future conditions than the RCP-ensemble approach, particularly in the near term. Therefore, the individual-projection approach supports decision makers seeking to understand the broadest potential characterization of future conditions. We discuss tradeoffs associated with different climate future approaches and highlight suitable applications.","[Lawrence, David J.; Runyon, Amber N.; Gross, John E.; Schuurman, Gregor W.] Natl Pk Serv, Climate Change Response Program, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA; [Miller, Brian W.] US Geol Survey, North Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Lawrence, DJ (corresponding author), Natl Pk Serv, Climate Change Response Program, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA.",david_james_lawrence@nps.gov,,"Runyon, Amber/0000-0002-7282-1217; Lawrence, David/0000-0002-1457-9944; Gross, John/0000-0002-8758-6205; Miller, Brian/0000-0003-1716-1161; Schuurman, Gregor/0000-0002-9304-7742",National Park Service Climate Change Response Program - U.S. Geological Survey North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center,National Park Service Climate Change Response Program - U.S. Geological Survey North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center,Climate future development has been supported by the National Park Service Climate Change Response Program.

The South Asian countries are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change specially in the form of rising temperatures and increasing frequency of heat waves. The passive building design measures can be useful in mitigating and adapting to the climate change by increasing energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study various passive climate change adaptation measures (PCAMs) have been used individually and in form of combinations in order to analyze their impact on the energy efficacy of residential buildings in Pakistan. It has been found that the natural ventilation and front green wall are the most efficient options for reducing the overall energy consumption. By implementation of these PCAMs, cooling demand can be decreased by 27.75% while heating demand can be reduced by 35%. Secondly, the prospect of net zero-energy building and reduced CO2 emissions are also studied. It has been shown that building can achieve net-zero energy on an annual basis at every orientation and it can attain the status of nearly zero-energy building on a monthly basis. Moreover, emitted CO2 can be reduced by 31% by using the renewable energy.","[Anwar, Muhammad Wasim; Ali, Zaib; Javed, Abdullah; Din, Emad Ud; Sajid, Muhammad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech & Mfg Engn, Islamabad, Pakistan",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Anwar, MW (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech & Mfg Engn, Islamabad, Pakistan.",wasimanwar.pg@smme.edu.pk,"Sajid, Muhammad/B-5313-2013","Sajid, Muhammad/0000-0001-6281-3136; ANWAR, MUHAMMAD WASIM/0000-0002-3544-3528",,,,,75,11,11,4,26,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"B605D, XUE YAN BUILDING, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",1996-3599,1996-8744,,BUILD SIMUL-CHINA,Build.

Studies on endogenous cultural institutions (ECIs) in climate adaptation are fragmented, impeding policy orientation. This suggests the need for complementary evidence on ECIs to inform adaptation practice. Through a sample of 158 households in rural Cameroon, we contribute to bridge this gap, by: (1) exploring socio-political factors shaping peasant farmers' compliance with agro-based ECIs, and (2) estimating the effect of ECI compliance on farmers' adaptation practices. Our estimation revealed the following: While political factors do not sufficiently explain compliance, state influence, mirrored through the application of formal rules negatively affects ECI compliance. Traditional rain forecast significantly explains climate adaptation; however, the pouring of libation does not. The age of peasant farmers also positively affects compliance with ECIs. We conclude that compliance with ECIs manifest in climate adaptation in varying proportions.","[Kimengsi, Jude Ndzifon] Tech Univ Dresden, Forest Inst & Int Dev FIID Res Grp, Fac Environm Sci, Tharandt, Germany; [Kimengsi, Jude Ndzifon] Univ Bamenda, Dept Geog, Bamenda, Cameroon; [Silberberger, Magdalene] Witten Herdecke Univ, Inst Social & Inst Change ISIC, Witten, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Kimengsi, JN (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Forest Inst & Int Dev FIID Res Grp, Fac Environm Sci, Tharandt, Germany.",jude_ndzifon.kimengsi@tu-dresden.de,,"Kimengsi, Jude Ndzifon/0000-0002-1927-7443",,,,,61,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1920,1521-0723,,SOC NATUR RESOUR,Soc.

To do so, we adapt the seminal model of Moore and Lobell (2014) who applied panel data econometrics to data aggregated from the farm to the regional (subnational) level. We discuss and empirically investigate the advantages and challenges of applying such models to farm-level data, including issues of endogeneity of explanatory variables, heterogeneity of farm responses to weather shocks, measurement errors in meteorological variables, and aggregation bias. Empirical investigations into these issues reveal that endogeneity due to measurement errors in temperature and precipitation variables, as well as heterogeneous responses of farms toward climate change may be problematic. Moreover, depending on how data are aggregated, results differ substantially compared to farm-level analysis. Based on data from Austria and two climate scenarios (Effective Measures and High Emission) for 2040, we estimate that the profits of farms will decline, on average, by 4.4% (Effective Measures) and 10% (High Emission). Adaptation options help to considerably ameliorate the adverse situation under both scenarios.

It is believed that these phenomena will intensify in the long-term, and that sewage systems will be overloaded with stormwater. Consequently, cities will need more opportunities to protect themselves from flooding. Moreover, longer periods of drought will increase the temperatures in towns. The use of blue and green infrastructure is being used to adapt to climate change and to limit its effects in cities. However, it is important not to apply these solutions indiscriminately. They have obvious advantages, but are also limited in their uses. Facilities are also being developed for the design and construction of green infrastructure. This article presents the benefits of using rain gardens in urban spaces and in relation to other forms of blue-green infrastructure; it also explored the problems that may occur while using them. More important facilitations in the implementation of rain gardens into urban fabrics are discussed, particularly in the context of the existing inconveniences.

The model offers potential use by practitioners for engaging publics at the early stages of technoscientific innovations. Findings fall into two categories: youth priorities for geoengineering and authorial responsibility as a way of supporting youth action. Tentative conclusions from youth participants are (i) action must be prioritised now to mitigate and adapt to climate change, rather than continuing with 'business as usual'; and (ii) there is a need for proactive international cooperation on governance and research on geoengineering to understand potential environmental and social consequences of geoengineering proposals for people at different temporal and spatial scales.

The youth guide and policy brief co-authored by participants and facilitators, and the dialogic methods used in their production, can contribute to this dialogue.","[Dunlop, Lynda; Atkinson, Lucy; Stubbs, Joshua; Su, Chrissy; Turkenburg-van Diepen, Maria; Blake, Celena; Calvert, Saul; Dhassi, Kirndeep; Yuan, Xinyue] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Rushton, Elizabeth; Mirjanic, Jovana] Kings Coll London, London, England; [Cornelissen, Eef] Odisee Univ Coll, Brussels, Belgium; [De Schrijver, Jelle] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; [Stadnyk, Tetiana] Youth & Environm Europe, Prague, Czech Republic; [Veneu, Fernanda] Ctr Fed Educ Tecnol Celso Suckow Fonseca, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Decle, Clementine; Vellekoop, Suzan] Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands; [Edwards, Rosalind] Whitchurch High Sch, Cardiff, Wales; [Malaj, Greta] Univ Tirana, Tirana, Albania; [Saunders, William] Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford, England; [Sinkovec, Yara] Polytech Inst Setubal, Setubal, Portugal",University of York - UK; University of London; King's College London; University of Antwerp; Centro Federal de Educacao Tecnologica Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET-RJ); Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; University of Tirana (UT); Oxford Brookes University; Instituto Politecnico de Setubal,"Dunlop, L (corresponding author), Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England.",lynda.dunlop@york.ac.uk,"de schrijver, jelle/HJI-8663-2023; Turkenburg-van Diepen, Maria Gertrudis Wilhelmina/R-5134-2017","Veneu, Fernanda/0000-0002-1082-1836; Atkinson, Lucy/0000-0002-6384-2227; De Schrijver, Jelle/0000-0003-2292-504X; Turkenburg-van Diepen, Maria Gertrudis Wilhelmina/0000-0002-2841-3339; Rushton, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6981-8797; Stubbs, Joshua/0000-0002-0703-2342; Dunlop, Lynda/0000-0002-0936-8149; Cornelissen, Eef/0000-0002-7585-5447",University of York ESRC Impact Acceleration Account,University of York ESRC Impact Acceleration Account(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by University of York ESRC Impact Acceleration Account.,,40,1,1,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2154-8455,2154-8463,,INT J SCI EDUC PART,Int.

We conduct a systematic review of 1,682 academic studies on human adaptation responses to identify patterns in constraints and limits to adaptation for different regions, sectors, hazards, adaptation response types, and actors. Using definitions of constraints and limits provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we find that most literature identifies constraints to adaptation but that there is limited literature focused on limits to adaptation. Central and South America and Small Islands generally report greater constraints and both hard and soft limits to adaptation. Technological, infrastructural, and ecosystem-based adaptation suggest more evidence of constraints and hard limits than other types of responses. Individuals and households face economic and socio-cultural constraints which also inhibit behavioral adaptation responses and may lead to limits. Finance, governance, institutional, and policy constraints are most prevalent globally. These findings provide early signposts for boundaries of human adaptation and are of high relevance for guiding proactive adaptation financing and governance from local to global scales.","[Thomas, Adelle] Univ Bahamas, 1 Univ Dr, Nassau, Bahamas;

Also, we framed our research under the paradigm of environmental humanities to help reinterpret the influence of long-term climate change on human migration. Our statistical results quantitatively analyzed and evidenced the reluctance of agriculturalists toward migration as a general feature of history in China. Yet, at the long-term and large spatial scale, climate change can exert indirect effects on agriculturalists' migration by contributing to social crisis, which is a more direct trigger. Based on our statistical results and existing literature, the attitude toward migration of agriculturalists and pastoralists in historical China was compared in a quantitative perspective.

Basic data were obtained for implementing the REDD mechanism in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for scientific decision-making to prevent deforestation and forest degradation. The potential effects according to the implementation of the REDD mechanism in the DPRK based on forest status data (the latest) are as follows. If the deforestation rate is reduced to a level below 6% through a 20-year REDD mechanism beginning in 2011, 0.01-11.64 C-tons of carbon credit per ha could be issued for DPRK. Converted into CO2-tons per ha, this amounts to 0.03-42.68 CO2-tons, which translates to a minimum of 226,000 CO2-tons and a maximum of 289,082,000 CO2-tons overall for forests in DPRK. In terms of carbon price, this measures up to 1.10 million USD-1.4 billion USD, considering that the REDD carbon price in voluntary carbon markets in 2010 was around 5 USD.","[Park, Hong Chal] Korea Natl Pk Res Inst, Korea Natl Pk Serv, Wonju 26441, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Oh, Choong Hyeon] Dongguk Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Goyang Si 10326, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Dongguk University,"Oh, CH (corresponding author), Dongguk Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Goyang Si 10326, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",ecologist84@gmail.com; ecology@dongguk.edu,,,,,,,17,2,2,1,9,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1672-6316,1993-0321,,J MT SCI-ENGL,J Mt.

Even if initial attempts have been made to operationalize the concept of resilience, a gap exists between the intense theoretical discussion and the use of resilience thinking in planning practice. On the basis of a discussion of existing attempts that define resilience principles, the authors derive eight principles for urban and regional resilience: diversity, redundancy, flexibility and adaptability, modularity, interdependency, stabilizing and buffering factors, mobility, as well as planning and foresight. Referring to two exploratory studiesthe City and Region of Stockholm (Sweden) and the City and Region of Rostock (Germany)this article aims to explore whether spatial planning already contributes to these principles and so to build resilience. The analysis shows that spatial planning already contributes to urban and regional resilience. Also, the principles, as suggested here, can be used to operationalize the idea of resilience. Prospectively, such principles may support spatial planning to choose adaptation measures and specific objectives and to contribute to urban and regional resilience.","[Albers, Meike; Deppisch, Sonja] HafenCity Univ Hamburg, D-22085 Hamburg, Germany",,"Albers, M (corresponding author), HafenCity Univ Hamburg, Winterhuder Weg 29, D-22085 Hamburg, Germany.",meike.albers@hcu-hamburg.de,,,,,,,32,36,37,2,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-4313,1469-5944,,EUR PLAN STUD,Eur.

With a concern of climate responsivity, this research brings a critical perspective on the current urbanization trends in Turkish cities and underlines the inconsistence nature of ongoing urban developments with the foreseen climate change adaptation and mitigation policies. The research is constructed based on a comparative study between the traditional urban pattern that has been developed since the Artuqids era and the contemporary urban pattern that has been developed from the 60s in the province of Mardin. The comparative study focused on responsivity of the produced urban spaces both in terms of both the climatic conditions and the ways which local people uses the urban space. While doing that, the research explored the role of urban space on the provision of urban thermal comfort in everyday life. The research revealed that existing development trends in Mardin leave citizens vulnerable to the negative effects of increasing temperature values and potential heat waves in future.","[Peker, Ender] Ingiliz Arastirma Enstitusu, Ankara, Turkey",,"Peker, E (corresponding author), Ingiliz Arastirma Enstitusu, Ankara, Turkey.",pekerender@gmail.com,"Peker, Ender/ABF-4142-2021","Peker, Ender/0000-0002-1371-5270",,,,,23,1,1,2,6,KARE PUBL,ISTANBUL,"CONCORD ISTANBUL, DUMLUPINAR MAH, CIHAN SK NO 15, B BLOK 162 KADIKOY, ISTANBUL, TURKEY",1300-7319,,,PLANLAMA,Planlama,,2021,31,1,,,,,108,119,,10.14744/planlama.2020.92679,http://dx.doi.org/10.14744/planlama.2020.92679,,,12,Regional & Urban Planning,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Public Administration,QR6PG,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000625337800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Model validation employed the statistical mean and Pearson correlation, while trends in projected rainfall and number of rainy days were computed using the Mann-Kendall trend test and the magnitudes of trends were determined by Sen's slope estimator. Temporal and spatial distribution of future extreme dryness and wetness was established by using the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). The results show that RCMs adequately represented annual and inter-annual rainfall variability and the ensemble average outperformed individual models. Trend results for the projected rainfall suggest a significant decreasing trend in future rainfall (2016-2100) for all stations at p < 0.05. In addition, a general decreasing trend in the number of rainy days is projected for future climate, although the significance and magnitude varied with station location. Model results suggest an increased occurrence of future extreme events, particularly towards the end of the century. The findings are important for developing proactive sustainable strategies for future climate change adaption and mitigation.","[Sibanda, S.; Grab, S.

Urban planners and researchers, however, are still assessing their relative impacts on the design of recent large-scale development projects. This paper answers the question of whether, and at what scale, anticipated changes to mapped flood risk are associated with mitigation actions to accommodate climate change. A case study of the Climate Change Preparedness and Resiliency Checklist in Boston, Massachusetts presents a database of 171 unique survey responses from 104 proposed projects. Comparing developments with documentation to an internal subset of 54 projects in the Boston Planning and Development Agency's projected Sea Level Rise - Flood Hazard Area (SLR-FHA), this paper finds projects impacted by updated Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) are associated with different building uses, higher sea level rise assumptions and greater abilities to endure inundation. There are also neighbourhood-level differences in climate expertise and the projects' ability to withstand utility disruption. Both of these observed impacts may have important implications for the formulation and application of voluntary resilience standards in other coastal cities.","[Wilson, Michael T.] RAND Corp, Boston, MA 02116 USA",RAND Corporation,"Wilson, MT (corresponding author), RAND Corp, Boston, MA 02116 USA.",miwilson@rand.org,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Wilson, Mike/0000-0002-4907-1550",Boston Area Research Initiative Seed Grant; Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) Emerson Travel Grant; Lynne Sagalyn and Gary Hack DUSP Fund,Boston Area Research Initiative Seed Grant; Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) Emerson Travel Grant; Lynne Sagalyn and Gary Hack DUSP Fund,This work was conducted as a Doctoral Candidate and supported by the Boston Area Research Initiative Seed Grant as well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) Emerson Travel Grant and Lynne Sagalyn and Gary Hack DUSP Fund.,,61,0,0,3,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

This article examines how a series of interventions in a particular dryland area in southern Kenya became embroiled in a long-running territorial conflict between the Loita Maasai (the beneficiary community) and their neighbours, the non-beneficiary Purko Maasai. Based on ethnographic research and by taking a historical perspective, it shows how Loita Maasai leaders systematically appropriated these outside interventions, used and reworked them with the strategic aim of stopping land loss to ongoing Purko encroachment. The analysis reveals two ways in which Loita leaders realized this: (a) by using interventions to stake out spatial claims to land; and (b) by capitalizing on the tendency of interventions to simplify local contexts. This article contributes to the debate on the linkages between intervention and conflict by highlighting the agency of intervention beneficiaries and showing that, through their actions, interventions may unwittingly reproduce and even aggravate existing conflicts.","[Garcia, Angela Kronenburg] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Garcia, AK (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",angela.kronenburg@uclouvain.be,,"Kronenburg Garcia, Angela/0000-0003-4547-9468",MaGW Social Sciences; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [400-05-146]; Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [677140 MIDLAND],MaGW Social Sciences; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),"This work is based on my PhD research, which was funded by MaGW Social Sciences, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (grant number 400-05-146), and through a grant from the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds.

Rising to this challenge may require adaptation of forest management, and therefore should trigger proactive measures by forest managers, but it is unclear to what extent this is already happening. Methods: The survey carried out in this research assesses how forest stakeholders in Belgium perceive the role of their forest management in the context of climate change and the impediments that limit their ability to prepare and respond to these changes. Results: Respondents indicated strong awareness of the changing climate, with more than two-thirds (71 %) expressing concern about the impacts of climate change on their forests. However, less than one-third of the respondents (32 %) reported modifying their management practices motivated by climate change. Among the major constraints limiting their climate related actions, lack of information was considered the most important for managers of both public and private forests. Conclusions: Knowledge transfer is an essential condition for research to lead to innovation. Improving the communication and demonstration of possible solutions for climate change adaptation is therefore likely to be the most effective strategy for increasing their adoption.","[Sousa-Silva, Rita; Muys, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E,Box 2411, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Ponette, Quentin] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Environm Sci, Croix Sud 2,Box L7-05-09, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab, Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, B-9090 Melle Gontrode, Belgium; [Van Herzele, Ann] Res Inst Nat & Forest INBO, Nat & Soc Res Grp, Kliniekstr 25, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Muys, Bart] Forest Inst EFIMED, Sant Pau Hist Site,Sant Leopold Pavil, Barcelona 08025, Spain",KU Leuven; Universite Catholique Louvain; Ghent University; Research Institute for Nature & Forest,"Sousa-Silva, R; Muys, B (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E,Box 2411, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.;Muys, B (corresponding author), Forest Inst EFIMED, Sant Pau Hist Site,Sant Leopold Pavil, Barcelona 08025, Spain.",anarita.silva@kuleuven.be; bart.muys@kuleuven.be,"Muys, Bart/ABN-3906-2022; Sousa-Silva, Rita/K-9520-2013; Muys, Bart/A-3194-2015","Sousa-Silva, Rita/0000-0001-8640-6121; Verheyen, Kris/0000-0002-2067-9108; Ponette, Quentin/0000-0002-2726-7392; Van Herzele, Ann/0000-0002-8289-7231; Muys, Bart/0000-0001-9421-527X",,,,,53,32,32,0,13,KEAI PUBLISHING LTD,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING, DONGCHENG DISTRICT 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-6355,2197-5620,,FOR ECOSYST,For.

Observed changes in temperature, precipitation, permanent snow cover, and glacial extent directly inform villagers' perceptions of and adaptations to Himalayan climate change. Adaptation strategies include a shift from traditional agropastoral practices to a more diversified blend of agropastoralism, tourism services, and cash-crop production. Climate change has tipped the scales in favor of the production of fruits and vegetables, cash crops previously unsuitable to the local climate. Diversification of livelihood strategies signifies transformation within the socio-ecological system of Manang and may enable greater resiliency to long-term climatic change.

Forest ecosystems can be carbon sources or sinks and are therefore integrated in international climate policy. Forest-related carbon mitigation projects are threatened by climate change through altered environmental conditions and forest processes, as well as through synergistic effects of climate change impacts with already existing socioeconomic and environmental stressors. Data on risk management and adaptation strategies were collected by a survey of 28 current forest projects targeting climate change mitigation. Ten of these represent the officially implemented afforestation (A) and reforestation (R) activities under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto protocol. Additionally, the official methodologies for AR activities under the CDM (Scope 14) were examined for potential climate change adaptation requirements. As a result, the adaptation of forest mitigation projects to climate change is found to be insufficient. A systematic approach for the inclusion of climate change risk management and adaptation is developed and guidelines for the design of climate-change-proof afforestation, reforestation and deforestation avoidance projects are proposed. A broader mainstreaming of the issue is required and clear policy regulations are necessary, especially for the post-Kyoto process.","[Reyer, Christopher; Guericke, Martin; Ibisch, Pierre L.] Univ Appl Sci Eberswalde, Fac Forest & Environm, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany",Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development,"Ibisch, PL (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Eberswalde, Fac Forest & Environm, Alfred Moeller Str 1, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany.",pibisch@fh-eberswalde.de,"Reyer, Christopher P.O./A-5515-2013","Reyer, Christopher P.O./0000-0003-1067-1492; Ibisch, Pierre/0000-0001-9820-9272",,,,,85,35,35,9,90,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,1573-5095,,NEW FOREST,New For.,JUL,2009,38,1,,,,,15,34,,10.1007/s11056-008-9129-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-008-9129-0,,,20,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,458BV,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000266988500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The three countries are in varying stages of planning for climate adaptation. Planning frameworks in all three countries suffer from a lack of specificity and urgency. To address this situation, the article recommends two measures. The first is the use of scenario planning, including consideration of high-impact scenarios, to address the downside risks of climate change. Planning in the UK has begun to make use of scenario analysis, although in a less comprehensive manner, while the USA had an earlier experiment in the use of the worst-case scenario as a planning tool. The second recommendation is to identify and prioritise impacts on vulnerable populations such as the elderly, the poor and coastal communities. This recommendation has roots in the US planning proposals, but also resonates with international human rights law.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Farber, DA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dfarber@law.berkeley.edu,,"FARBER, Daniel/0000-0002-9885-8958",,,,,63,10,11,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0952-8873,1464-374X,,J ENVIRON LAW,J.

Few studies have investigated the effects of altitude in rural areas or examined livelihood adaptation strategies in Nepal. Using a survey of farmers in rural areas at high, middle, and low altitudes in Nepal, this article explores the impacts of climate change-related floods and droughts, as well as the water resource utilization, disaster resilience, and livelihood improvement ability of farmers and the influencing factors. This article adopted participatory rural appraisal to obtain survey data from farmers at three altitudes. Through one-way ANOVA and F-tests, farmers' perceptions of floods and droughts were analyzed, and through field investigations, their production and water consumption patterns were established. Logistic regressions show that college education, farming income, and domestic water consumption have the strongest impacts on households' disaster resilience, while non-farm income, male laborer rates, and college education have the strongest impacts on households' abilities to improve livelihoods.

In Southwestern Bangladesh, lack of safe drinking water is a severe crisis due to climate change. The study investigated the impacts of climate change on water resources and human health in a coastal area. A questionnaire survey was carried out in two villages of Shymnagar upazila on the southwestern coast to investigate the present status of safe water sources and health care facilities and their impacts on the local community. The results show that the local community believes that climate change is having substantial impacts on freshwater sources and health. More than 70% of the respondents identified diarrhea, dysentery, and skin diseases as the prime waterborne health risks that occur through climate-related safe water scarcity.

Two water recovery instruments are used: purchasing water rights (buyback) from farmers, and saving water by subsidising irrigator adoption of technically efficient technology. A moratorium on buyback has focused environmental recovery on subsidised technically efficient technology adoption. Economists argue that national welfare is maximised via buyback and highlight the limitations of efficiency savings to recover sufficient environmental water. A risk is that water recovery targets may be reduced in future, limiting welfare gains from water reform. This article evaluates possible welfare trade-offs surrounding environmental water recovery outcomes where arbitrary limits on buyback are imposed. Results suggest that, on average, strategies which attempt to obtain >1500gigalitres (GL) of water from on-farm efficiency investments will only provide sufficient resources to meet environmental objectives in very wet states of nature. We conclude that reliance on technically efficient irrigation infrastructure is less economically efficient relative to water buyback. Importantly, the transformation of MDB irrigation will significantly constrain irrigators' future capacity to adapt to climate change.","[Adamson, David; Loch, Adam] Univ Adelaide South Australia, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Loch, A (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide South Australia, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",adam.loch@adelaide.edu.au,"Adamson, David/A-5310-2011; Loch, Adam/F-4246-2013","Adamson, David/0000-0003-1616-968X; Loch, Adam/0000-0002-1436-8768","University of Queensland's School of Economics Search & Visitors Committee; University of South Australia's School of Commerce; ARC DECRA Grant [DE160100213, DE150100328, DP140103946]; ARC DECRA Grant",University of Queensland's School of Economics Search & Visitors Committee; University of South Australia's School of Commerce; ARC DECRA Grant(Australian Research Council); ARC DECRA Grant(Australian Research Council),"Collaborative funding for this study was provided by the University of Queensland's School of Economics Search & Visitors Committee, and the University of South Australia's School of Commerce.

Analysing the equity implications of policy discourses on climate-smart agriculture (CSA),JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,political economy; triple wins; climate-smart agriculture; climate change; discourses,FOOD SECURITY; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; SYSTEMS; STABILIZATION; ADAPTATION; POLITICS; JUSTICE; NEPAL,"This paper analyses contrasting discourses of climate-smart agriculture' (CSA) for their implications on control over and access to changing resources in agriculture. One of the principal areas of contestation around CSA relates to equity, including who wins and who loses, who is able to participate, and whose knowledge and perspectives count in the process. Yet to date, the equity implications of CSA remain an under-researched area. We apply an equity framework centred on procedure, distribution and recognition, to four different discourses. Depending on which discourses are mobilised, the analysis helps to illuminate: (1) how CSA may transfer the burden of responsibility for climate change mitigation to marginalised producers and resource managers (distributive equity); (2) how CSA discourses generally fail to confront entrenched power relations that may constrain or block the emergence of more pro-poor' forms of agricultural development, adaptation to climate change, or carbon sequestration and storage (procedural equity); (3) how CSA discourses can have tangible implications for the bargaining power of the poorest and most vulnerable groups (recognition). The paper contributes to work showing the need for deeper acknowledgement of the political nature of the transformations necessary to address the challenges caused by a changing climate for the agricultural sector.","[Karlsson, Linus] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Uppsala, Sweden; [Naess, Lars Otto] Inst Dev Studies, Resource Polit Cluster, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Naess, Lars Otto] Univ East Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Nightingale, Andrea] Training & Presently Chair Rural Dev Global South, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Thompson, John] Inst Dev Studies, Rural Futures Cluster, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Thompson, John] Agr Policy Res Africa APRA, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of East Anglia,"Nightingale, A (corresponding author), Training & Presently Chair Rural Dev Global South, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",linus.karlsson@slu.se; l.naess@ids.ac.uk; andrea.nightingale@slu.se; j.thompson@ids.ac.uk,,,"CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Sussex Sustainability Research Programme (SSRP)","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Sussex Sustainability Research Programme (SSRP)","The authors are grateful for financial support for this study from the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

We surveyed Tsimane' adults (77 men and 34 women) living in four communities with different accessibility to the regional markets. The four communities were located in indigenous territories, but two of them overlapped with a co-managed biosphere reserve. We compared households' capacity for adaptation through indicators of access to social, financial and natural assets, entrepreneurial skills and human resources. We also assessed how conservation and markets condition such capacity. Our results show that, across communities, households clustered in four groups with differentiated adaptive capacity profiles: commoners typically participating in community meetings, vulnerable characterized by low shares of adaptive capacity indicators, leaders typically holding community positions, and subsidized mostly relying in government remittances. Overlap with the biosphere reserve was significantly associated with the adaptive capacity profile of vulnerable households. In contrast, access to markets does not seem to be related to household adaptive capacity. We discuss relevant behavioral and structural factors for current adaptation to climatic changes and priority measures to foster local adaptive capacity in indigenous territories overlapping with protected areas.","[Ruiz-Mallen, Isabel] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Internet Interdisciplinary Inst IN3, Av Carl Friedrich Gauss, Barcelona 08860, Spain; [Ruiz-Mallen, Isabel; Fernandez-Llamazares, Alvaro; Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Edifici Z Carrer Columnes, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Fernandez-Llamazares, Alvaro] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Metapopulat Res Ctr, POB 65,Viikinkaari 1, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] ICREA, Passeig Lluis Companys 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain",UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya; Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Helsinki; ICREA,"Ruiz-Mallen, I (corresponding author), Univ Oberta Catalunya, Internet Interdisciplinary Inst IN3, Av Carl Friedrich Gauss, Barcelona 08860, Spain.;Ruiz-Mallen, I (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Edifici Z Carrer Columnes, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",iruiz_mallen@uoc.edu,"Fernández-Llamazares, Álvaro/ABA-6096-2021; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Ruiz-Mallen, Isabel/E-9614-2018; /C-4552-2008","Ruiz-Mallen, Isabel/0000-0002-9679-3329; Fernandez-Llamazares, Alvaro/0000-0002-7813-0222; /0000-0002-2914-8055","European Union [282899, FP7-261971-LEK]; Academy of Finland [292765]; Fundacio Autonoma Solidaria (FAS) at UAB; Gran Consejo Tsimane, UMSS; CBIDSI; Academy of Finland (AKA) [292765] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA); ICREA Funding Source: Custom","European Union(European Commission); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Fundacio Autonoma Solidaria (FAS) at UAB; Gran Consejo Tsimane, UMSS; CBIDSI; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)); ICREA(ICREA)","We thank Tsimane' communities for their hospitality and for participating in this research.

A convergence of these issues is occurring in the Midwestern United States, i.e. the 'cornbelt' region that provides substantial grain supplies to world markets but is also well known for its contribution to hypoxic conditions in the Gulf of Mexico due to agricultural nutrient losses. This review examines anticipated trends in climate and possible consequences for grain production and soil resource management in this region. The historic climate of this region has been ideal for large-scale agriculture, and its soils are among the world's most productive. Yet under current trends, degradation of the soil resource threatens our capacity to ensure a stable food supply and a clean environment in the face of a changing climate. A set of strategies and practices can be implemented to meet these challenges by maintaining and improving hydrologic and plant-growth functions of soil, which will improve outcomes for aquatic ecosystems and for the agricultural sector. Soil management ensures our long-term capacity to provide a reliable food supply, and mitigates pressures to expand agricultural practices into marginal croplands that would lead to further environmental degradation.","[Hatfield, J.

Moreover, emerging literature that has addressed predictable low-frequency oscillations in the probabilistic nature of hydrologic variables has focused almost exclusively on flood flows. This study explores a new approach for conditioning the frequency spectrum of hydrologic extremes on seasonal predictors and applies the method to annual minimum 7 day low flows, a critical low-flow statistic often utilized in water quality management and planning. A semiparametric local likelihood method is used to condition quantile estimates of the 7 day low flow on year-to-year hydroclimatic forecasts for two major rivers in the northeast United States. The local likelihood approach is employed in a Bayesian framework in which regional information is used to inform prior distributions of model parameters. The method is compared against a baseline approach that applies a static Bayesian inference with noninformative priors to derive unconditional parameter and quantile estimates. The implications of the approach for the efficacy of water quality regulations and as an adaptation to climate change are discussed.","[Steinschneider, Scott; Brown, Casey] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Steinschneider, S (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 130 Nat Resources Rd, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",scottsteinschneider@gmail.com,,"Steinschneider, Scott/0000-0002-8882-1908",,,,,63,10,10,0,62,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

In that context, Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture (UPA), thanks to its multifunctionality, could have a high value in providing social, economic, and environmental co-benefits. UPA is an emerging field of research and production that aims to improve food security and climate change impact reduction, improving urban resilience and sustainability. In this paper, a replicable GIS-based approach was used to localize and quantify available areas for agriculture, including both flat rooftop and ground-level areas in the mainland of the city of Venice (Italy). Then, possible horticultural yield production was estimated considering common UPA yield value and average Italian consumption. Climate change mitigation, like CO2 reduction and sequestration, and climate change adaptation, like Urban Flooding and Urban Heat Island reduction, due to the new UPA areas' development were estimated. Despite the urban density, the identified areas have the potential to produce enough vegetables for the residents and improve climate change mitigation and adaptation, if transformed into agricultural areas. Finally, the paper concludes with a reflection on the co-benefits of UPA multifunctionality, and with some policy suggestions.","[Lucertini, Giulia; Di Giustino, Gianmarco] Univ Iuav Venezia, Dept Architecture, Planning & Climate Change Lab, S Croce 1957, I-30135 Venice, Italy; [Lucertini, Giulia; Di Giustino, Gianmarco] Univ Iuav Venezia, Dept Arts, Planning & Climate Change Lab, S Croce 1957, I-30135 Venice, Italy; [Lucertini, Giulia] FEEM Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Palazzo Stelline,Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy",IUAV University Venice; IUAV University Venice,"Lucertini, G (corresponding author), Univ Iuav Venezia, Dept Architecture, Planning & Climate Change Lab, S Croce 1957, I-30135 Venice, Italy.;Lucertini, G (corresponding author), Univ Iuav Venezia, Dept Arts, Planning & Climate Change Lab, S Croce 1957, I-30135 Venice, Italy.;Lucertini, G (corresponding author), FEEM Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Palazzo Stelline,Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",gdigiustino@iuav.it; glucertini@iuav.it,"lucertini, giulia/ABB-4250-2020","lucertini, giulia/0000-0002-5824-6666; Di Giustino, Gianmarco/0000-0003-2728-726X",,,,,65,12,12,8,46,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2021,13,11,,,,,,,5999,10.3390/su13115999,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13115999,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SR0XS,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000660769800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although there have been several studies that have examined the potential effects of climate change on human health broadly, the effects on malnutrition are still not well understood. We conducted a systematic review investigating the role of three climate change proxies (droughts, floods, and climate variability) on malnutrition in children and adults. Methods and findings We identified 22 studies examining the effects of droughts, floods, and climate variability on at least one malnutrition metric. We found that 17 out of 22 studies reported a significant relationship between climate change proxies and at least one malnutrition metric. In meta-analysis, drought conditions were significantly associated with both wasting (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.46, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.05-2.04) and underweight prevalence (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.11).

There remains a significant gap in our knowledge and understanding of the many facets of this theme. The educational sector has been neglected in the climate change scientific debate, although it is acknowledged as a key sector. This article aims to understand how teachers are dealing with the climate change topic: what they think, learn and teach about it. It is focused on teachers at elementary schools (6-14 years old) in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. This type of social research is important for developing countries such as Brazil, where the sociological research on climate change is emergent. The identification of teachers' perceptions on climate change is an important step in finding ways to listen to and engage with them in the formulation of climate change adaptation plans, especially because they will be among the people responsible for preparing the younger generations of citizens. The survey of teachers' knowledge and perception about climate change provides two main approaches: (1) It supports better planning of future school activities, training, and updating knowledge and (2) It suggests how children are being prepared to understand and deal with this contemporary problem of climate change.","[Marchezini, Victor; Londe, Luciana R.] Cemaden Natl Early Warning & Monitoring Ctr Nat H, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil; [Marchezini, Victor] Natl Inst Space Res, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil",Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE),"Londe, LR (corresponding author), Cemaden Natl Early Warning & Monitoring Ctr Nat H, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil.",luciana.londe@cemaden.gov.br,"Marchezini, Victor/GRF-1529-2022",,"Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Brazil [2018/06093-4]","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Brazil(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP))","Victor Marchezini thanks the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Brazil (Grant No. 2018/06093-4).",,35,3,3,4,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

To examine the impact of extreme heat on emergency services in Boston, MA. Methods. We conducted relative risk and time series analyses of 911 dispatches of the Boston Police Department (BPD), Boston Emergency Medical Services (BEMS), and Boston Fire Department (BFD) From November 2010 to April 2014 to assess the impact of extreme heat on emergency services. Results. During the warm season, there were 2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0%, 5%) more BPD dispatches, 9% (95% CI = 7%, 12%) more BEMS dispatches, and 10% (95% CI = 5%, 15%) more BFD dispatches on days when the maximum temperature was 90 degrees F or higher, which remained consistent when we considered multiple days of heat. A 10 degrees F increase in daily maximum temperature, from 80 degrees to 90 degrees F, resulted in 1.016, 1.017, and 1.002 times the expected number of daily BPD, BEMS, and BFD dispatch calls, on average, after adjustment for other predictors. Conclusions. The burden of extreme heat on local emergency medical and police services may be agency-wide, and impacts on fire departments have not been previously documented.

A total of nine key locations in each city were considered and one location in each city was a control. A modified segmented regression analysis was employed to understand the overall climate change and linear regression analysis to evaluate the impacts of urbanisation. The study indicates a significant overall climate change during the 1986-2011 period when compared with the 1960-1985 periods, and urbanisation added to the overall climate change. There were statistically significant increases in T-max and T-min for Sydney and decreases for Melbourne, decrease in T-max and increase in T-min for Brisbane. On the other hand, evaporation values decreased for Sydney and Brisbane but increased for Melbourne. There was a statistically significant increase in rainfall for Brisbane only. The study suggests that climate change adaptation strategies and policies need to consider urbanisation, alongwith greenhouse gases, to cope with future climate change scenarios.","[Maheshwari, B.; Fahey, P.] Western Sydney Univ, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2767, Australia; [Pinto, U.] NSW Off Environm & Heritage, 480 Weeroona Rd, Lidcombe, NSW 2141, Australia; [Akbar, S.] Blacktown City Council, POB 63, Blacktown, NSW 2148, Australia",Western Sydney University; Office of Environment & Heritage - New South Wales,"Maheshwari, B (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2767, Australia.",b.maheshwari@westernsydney.edu.au; Uthpala.Pinto@environment.nsw.gov.au; Saud.akbar@blacktown.nsw.gov.au; P.Fahey@westernsydney.edu.au,"Maheshwari, Basant/AAG-8881-2020; Pinto, Uthpala/T-8875-2019; Fahey, Paul P/B-7985-2013","Maheshwari, Basant/0000-0002-5496-4345; Pinto, Uthpala/0000-0002-7298-7903; Fahey, Paul P/0000-0002-6351-9876",Western Sydney University,Western Sydney University,The funding for this study was provided by internal grant initiative of Western Sydney University.

Resilience is often described in disaster discourse as a strategy designed to overcome vulnerability by helping communities to 'bounce back' in the wake of 'natural' disasters. Using ethnographic research conducted with Community Disaster and Climate Change Committees (CDCs) in Vanuatu in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Pam, this paper seeks to problematise disaster responses that see the 'community' as a space to be acted upon by outsiders, or where people will respond in a unified way to the challenges of rebuilding after disaster. Using political ecology framings this paper critiques the ideas of resilience that appear entrenched in community-based disaster and climate change adaptation discourse and practice in Oceania. Rather than presupposing resilience or vulnerability, this paper details the dispersal and distribution power and agency amongst individual actors and groups that either supported or manipulated, the distribution of goods by Community Disaster Committees. In this way, it moves beyond the limitations of conceptual framings of resilience in disaster management and climate change into a more considered appraisal of power, by exploring what James Ferguson has termed 'the politics of distribution' in the context of disaster.","[McDonnell, Siobhan] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"McDonnell, S (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Siobhan.mcdonnell@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,57,21,21,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0066-4677,1469-2902,,ANTHROPOL FORUM,Anthropol.

The GoN developed NAPA and climate policy prior to LAPA and currently in the process of developing NAP. The implementation of the local adaptation plans has started in western Nepal under the NCCSP. This paper analyzes the LAPA initiatives and process focusing on agriculture including assessment of local climatic contexts, vulnerabilities, adaptations and barriers. Moreover, the paper presents the adaptation cases that has enhanced the awareness and adaptive capacity at the local level. The assessments followed the qualitative research, review and analysis using the participatory and socially inclusive approach. The adaptations were analyzed for their effectiveness in enhancing the adaptive capacity of poor and vulnerable. Furthermore, the institutional mechanism suitable for the LAPA were also assessed and analyzed. The paper concludes the appropriate procedure for LAPA design along with the potential actors and their roles. This paper also suggests the appropriate local government unit (LGU) for mainstreaming adaptation into the development process at the local level in the new governance system.

With few instrumental climate records available for this region before the 1950s, paleoclimatic reconstructions must be used to understand annual-to-centennial-scale climate variations and local climate response to large-scale forcing mechanisms. We developed a maximum latewood density chronology of Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) from the southern slope of the Qilian Mountains, northern Tibetan Plateau. Based on the chronology, we reconstructed August-September temperature for 1780-2008. The temperature reconstruction model accounts for 39.7% of instrumental temperature variance from 1957 to 2008, successfully capturing the most recent warming. Superposed epoch analysis indicated a volcanic forcing for temperature, resulting in pulses of cooler conditions that can persist for 2-4years. Tree-ring data indicated that warm-dry and cold-wet climate combinations mainly occurred in northern Tibetan Plateau before CE 1900, and revealed a clear wetting and warming trend since the 1980s. Our study provides long-term perspective on recent climate change in northern Tibetan Plateau to guide expectations of future climate variability and aid sustainable development, and provides scenarios for climate change adaptation and inputs for climate models representing a broader range of conditions than those of historical climate records.","[Chen, Feng; Wang, Huiqin; Yuan, Yujiang] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Desert Meteorol, Key Lab Tree Ring Phys & Chem Res, Key Xinjiang Lab Tree Ring Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration,"Chen, F (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Inst Desert Meteorol, Key Lab Tree Ring Phys & Chem Res, Key Xinjiang Lab Tree Ring Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China.",desert@idm.cn,"Wang, Hui/HMU-9512-2023; wang, huimin/HDM-8421-2022; Chen, Feng/C-5859-2013; wang, hui/GRS-4730-2022","Chen, Feng/0000-0002-2551-8653; ","Meteorology Public Welfare Industry Research Special project [GYHY(QX)201506001-14]; NSFC Project [91547115, 41405081]; Young Talent Training Plan of Meteorological Departments of China Meteorological Administration; Xinjiang Youth Science and Technology Innovation personnel training project [qn2015yx040]",Meteorology Public Welfare Industry Research Special project; NSFC Project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Young Talent Training Plan of Meteorological Departments of China Meteorological Administration; Xinjiang Youth Science and Technology Innovation personnel training project,"This work was supported by Meteorology Public Welfare Industry Research Special project [grant number GYHY(QX)201506001-14], NSFC Project [grant number 91547115], [grant number 41405081].

This study addresses both foci, which are important to scholars who investigate human-environment interactions and observers who expect greater exposure to weather or climate extremes to translate into stronger support for climate change adaptive measures and mitigative policies. We analyse the extent to which state-level winter temperature anomalies influence the likelihood of perceiving local winter temperatures to be warmer than usual and attributing these warmer temperatures mainly to global warming. We show that actual temperature anomalies influence perceived warming but not attribution of such warmer-than-usual winter temperatures to global warming. Rather, the latter is influenced more by perceived scientific agreement; beliefs about the current onset, human cause, threat and seriousness of global warming; and political orientation. This is not surprising given the politicization of climate science(14,15) and political polarization on climate change beliefs(16,17) in recent years. These results suggest that personal experience with weather or climate variability may help cultivate support for adaptive measures, but it may not increase support for mitigation policies.","[McCright, Aaron M.] Michigan State Univ, Lyman Briggs Coll, Dept Sociol, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA; [McCright, Aaron M.] Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA; [Dunlap, Riley E.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Sociol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Xiao, Chenyang] Amer Univ, Dept Sociol, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; American University,"McCright, AM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Lyman Briggs Coll, Dept Sociol, 919 East Shaw Lane,Room E-35, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA.",mccright@msu.edu,"Dunlap, Riley E./Z-1676-2019; Xiao, Chenyang/J-9033-2019; McCright, Aaron M./Z-1967-2019","Dunlap, Riley E./0000-0002-7047-3757; Xiao, Chenyang/0000-0002-5946-0584; ",Office of Integrative Activities; Office Of The Director [1301789] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Office of Integrative Activities; Office Of The Director(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),,,33,62,62,2,36,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

This concept, which is more than a century old, ignores the due aspect of groundwater management in today's perspective. Recent research has proved that variation in irrigation demand and rainfall within the irrigation units has given birth to varying stresses on groundwater. In response to spatial climate variability, reallocation of canal supplies from the head towards the tail of the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) command was evaluated in this study, with the objective of achieving equitable total irrigation costs. The ensuing groundwater regime was simulated for 50 years' time with a groundwater model. A 25% reallocation from head towards tail-end improves the standard deviation of total irrigation cost equity from 1905 to 241. This command scale integration of available water resources also demonstrated a net saving in groundwater pumping cost to the tune of 7.24 to 18.9%, in comparison with existing equitable canal supplies. With this approach, at least minimal or no waterlogging in the headend area, even during wet years, and no groundwater mining in the tail-end, even during dry periods, are anticipated. In addition, this system-scale integrated water management would increase adaptive capacity to climate change adaptation.","[Basharat, Muhammad] Water & Power Dev Author WAPDA, Int Waterlogging & Salin Res Inst IWASRI, Lahore 54000, Pakistan; [Tariq, Ata-Ur-Rehman] UET, CEWRE, Lahore 54000, Pakistan",,"Basharat, M (corresponding author), Water & Power Dev Author WAPDA, Int Waterlogging & Salin Res Inst IWASRI, CMTL Bldg,Raiwind Rd,PO Thokar Niaz Baig, Lahore 54000, Pakistan.",basharatm@hotmail.com,"Basharat, Muhammad/AGT-4034-2022",,Centre of Excellence in Water Resources Engineering,Centre of Excellence in Water Resources Engineering,"The authors are thankful to the Punjab Irrigation Department, the SCARPs Monitoring Organization of WAPDA and the Pakistan Meteorological Department for providing their valuable data sets used in the study.

It is argued that adaptation to and mitigation of climate change will be required to avert or reduce adverse impacts. Governments are developing climate change adaptation (CCA) strategies. The business community is also stirring to the need to adapt to as well as mitigate climate change, but progress has been slow, particularly in the case of adaptation. This paper explores emerging perceptions of the need for adaptation and some initial adaptation actions within a 'business as usual' economic mode of operation. It also identifies constraints to further action among a cross-section of actors in the business community in South Africa. Data from semi-structured interviews and scrutiny of reports reveals that there are a number of constraints preventing business from engaging more fully in CCA. These findings correspond with findings in other business-sector and CCA studies. They include: issues of terminology (adaptation versus risk management); uncertainty over climate-change projections and scenarios; and concerns about how such information can be used effectively in decision making, particularly long-term business planning. Despite these challenges, some potential synergies between policy, planning and the business community for promoting adaptation are suggested.","Univ Witwatersrand, Revamp Res Grp, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Vogel, C (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Revamp Res Grp, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",coleen.vogel@wits.ac.za,,,,,,,48,9,9,5,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This paper explores how two such responses have been implemented in the UK through the management of specific aspects of anthropogenic climate change and human genetics, which we argue can be described as wicked or post-normal issues. To address these, approaches require that a broader range of epistemic positions and worldviews be recognized as valid in the policy development process. We suggest that the concept of boundary organisations is well suited to examine some of the institutions that have been set up in the UK to deal with the two post-normal issues we consider here. This paper explores the extent to which the UK Climate Impacts Programme and the Human Genetics Commission respond to a post-normal policy approach and their achievements in overcoming epistemological boundaries and effecting integrated management responses. We conclude by considering the insights such an analysis offers into operationalising post-normal policy approaches. As intermediaries and facilitators, we suggest the two organisations can be considered forerunners in applying a post-normal approach to climate change adaptation and human genetics, respectively.

This study uses 2-year household survey panel data from Na'Yong and Zhen'Xiong in southwest China, both of which are typically affected by meteorological disasters. First, we constructed a multi-dimensional induction of sensitivity indicators. Then, we divided farmers' livelihood strategies and identified their sensitivity levels. Finally, we extracted the typical characteristics of farmers' livelihood strategies that contribute to low sensitivity. The research shows that although non-agricultural labour can improve the income level of farmers, there is no clear positive relationship between farmers' income and their sensitivity. Levels of sensitivity depend not only on the risk of farmers with a higher exposure to the natural environment but also on the ability of farmers to disperse and avoid natural risks. Livelihood strategies with lower sensitivities have three main characteristics: diversification, marketization and ecological sustainability. This study provides a practical basis for the sustainable livelihood of farmers in the context of climate change and attempts to provide a reference for other developing countries towards the end of achieving ecological poverty alleviation.","[Lan, Jing; Song, Biqing; Li, Qiuming] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhen] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Business, 1 Wenyuan Rd, Nanjing 210046, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University; Nanjing Normal University,"Liu, Z (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Business, 1 Wenyuan Rd, Nanjing 210046, Peoples R China.",54194@njnu.edu.cn,,"Li, Qiuming/0000-0002-5955-8506; Liu, Zhen/0000-0002-9770-1692","National Natural Science Foundation of China [72074114, 71603126, 719115130164]; Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by three research grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 72074114, 71603126 and 719115130164), Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province.

Spontaneous relocations that occur after catastrophic events can entail high costs, both for those who resettle elsewhere and for the remaining community. Managed retreat attempts to reduce such costs, thereby facilitating the relocation process. Property buyouts, the most prominently discussed policy tool for managed retreat, present significant challenges in terms of equity, timing, finance, and scale. We discuss innovation in buyout policy that allows residents to remain in their homes as renters after being bought out. We develop the basic structure of such a policy and show the pathways through which it can help to finance buyouts, harmonize public and private decision-making, and manage the timing of community transition. We also recommend funding mechanisms and other details to overcome the substantial barriers to implementation. Although buyouts with rentbacks will require institutional innovation in order to serve as an effective policy framework, the policy has the potential to improve social, economic, and environmental outcomes from the eventual unfortunate but necessary migration away from coastal areas.","[Keeler, Andrew G.] East Carolina Univ, Dept Coastal Studies, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Mullin, Megan; Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [McNamara, Dylan E.] Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Dept Phys, Wilmington, NC USA",University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; Duke University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Mullin, M (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",andy.keeler@gmail.com; megan.mullin@duke.edu; mcnamarad@uncw.edu; martin.smith@duke.edu,,"Mullin, Megan/0000-0002-1936-802X",National Science Foundation (NSF) [CNH 1715638]; Carnegie Corporation of New York,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); Carnegie Corporation of New York,This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant no.

Understanding how fishers perceive climate change, and what factors shape these perceptions, can provide insights into behavioural intentions and support required for climate change focused strategies and management. This study interviewed demersal fishers from a south-west UK fishing port to explore: 1) the future risks fishers identified that may affect their business and wider industry; 2) fishers' beliefs and risk perceptions relating to climate change; and 3) the factors influencing these perceptions. Fishers identified a number of environmental, socio-economic and fisheries governance risks but climate change was rarely mentioned. While fishers overall had low risk perceptions of climate change, these perceptions were heterogeneous across the sample. Climate change scepticism and a high perceived self-efficacy to adapt to climate change were associated with lower risk perceptions. These findings provide new insights into how fishers perceive climate change and, importantly, greater understanding of the possible drivers of such perceptions. Findings suggest that undertaking climate-awareness raising initiatives in isolation to support adaptation strategies could be limited in success. Instead, wider focus should be applied to removing barriers to adaptation, managing wider risks and incorporating fishers into decision making to effectively support and motivate fishers' adaptation.","[Maltby, Katherine M.; Simpson, Stephen D.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Stocker Rd, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, England; [Maltby, Katherine M.] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Turner, Rachel A.] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England",University of Exeter; Centre for Environment Fisheries & Aquaculture Science; University of Exeter,"Maltby, KM (corresponding author), Gulf Maine Res Inst, 350 Commercial St, Portland, ME 04101 USA.",katherine_maltby@outlook.com,,,NERC GW4+ studentship; Cefas CASE Industrial support,NERC GW4+ studentship; Cefas CASE Industrial support,"Many thanks go to the fishing community in Brixham for giving their time and knowledge which allowed this work to be undertaken.

The paper demonstrates that port governance is already polycentric, including a variety of actors at different scales with overlapping jurisdictions, but some of the established principles of effective polycentric governance such as collective choice arrangements and distribution of costs are not currently in place. This has resulted in an inability to manage current challenges, which can be broadly divided into environmental challenges (emissions and other pollution, adapting to climate change impacts such as sea level rise and storms) and port investment challenges (conflicts related to port capacity developments). Current static models of port governance exhibit an over-emphasis on hierarchy and internal, formal structures (mostly government, port authority and port terminal operator), whereas a polycentric approach favours explicitly including informal organisations (e.g. citizen and environmental groups) and external actors (e.g. carriers, shipping regulators) in a more dynamic conceptualisation. This enables an application of the known strengths and weaknesses of polycentric governance to the port sector, in order to identify where some of the known measures for successful polycentric governance should be implemented. The paper also feeds back to the theory on polycentric governance regarding the challenges of including global actors within territorial polycentric regimes.","[Monios, Jason] Kedge Business Sch, Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13009 Marseille, France",Kedge Business School,"Monios, J (corresponding author), Kedge Business Sch, Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13009 Marseille, France.",jason.monios@kedgebs.com,"Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019",,,,,,82,13,13,7,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Nevertheless, associated aspects relating, besides others, to the regulation of genome editing, intellectual property rights and potential environmental and health aspects lead to fierce discussions within the European Union. In these discussions, values and moral aspects play a decisive role. To support and set the stage for an open-minded dialogue, the communication behaviour and needs of specific stakeholder groups has been analysed by means of two online surveys. The surveys considered sources and channels used for information sourcing and dissemination, conveyed content and relevant target audiences. In addition, the degree of trust of stakeholders in different information sources was assessed. Stakeholders included representatives from academia, civil society organisations (including environmental and consumer organisations), journalists, the farming community, the seed and plant breeding sector and policymakers across Europe. Our analysis suggests that, in general, a high level of trust is associated with representatives from academia, and that safety-related aspects, transparency and sustainability are considered very important topics across the different stakeholder groups. In addition, social media seem to play a subordinate role for inter-stakeholder communication but is of higher relevance for reaching out to the public.","[Will, Sabine; Krause, Dorthe; Kohl, Christian; Wilhelm, Ralf] Julius Kuhn Inst, Fed Res Ctr Cultivated Plants, D-06484 Quedlinburg, Germany; [Vangheluwe, Nick; Jorasch, Petra] Euroseeds, Brussels, Belgium; [Vangheluwe, Nick; Nanda, Amrit K.] Plants Future European Technol Platform, Brussels, Belgium; [Fischer, Arnout R.

The present paper aims to cover this gap by developing an Urban Climate Comfort Index (UCCI) that integrates critical climate variables for urban tourism and is informed by empirical data from an in-situ survey conducted in southern Europe, namely, in close proximity to the Acropolis Museum in Athens, Greece. The survey provided input on the ideal and unacceptable climatic conditions as perceived by urban tourists and on the relevant weight of the selected climatic parameters. Tourist preferences were then translated into a numerical scale by assigning utility scores of 0% and 100% to the unacceptable and ideal values while using a linear change for the intermediate values. Hence, a best-fitting utility function for each climatic variable was created, and all utility functions were then aggregated through their relative weights to form the UCCI index. The new index can be applied to other similar urban tourist destinations and assist impact assessment studies and tourism management measures, including climate change adaptation.","[Kapetanakis, Dimitrios; Georgopoulou, Elena; Mirasgedis, Sevastianos; Sarafidis, Yannis] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Penteli 15236, Greece; [Kapetanakis, Dimitrios] FACE3TS SA, Athens 11471, Greece",National Observatory of Athens,"Kapetanakis, D (corresponding author), Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Penteli 15236, Greece.;Kapetanakis, D (corresponding author), FACE3TS SA, Athens 11471, Greece.",dkapetan@noa.gr; elenag@noa.gr; seba@noa.gr; sara@noa.gr,,"Georgopoulou, Elena/0000-0001-9388-5124; Kapetanakis, Dimitrios/0000-0003-1262-9669","research program 'THESPIA II' (Development of tools and methodologies for the analysis of future climate projections in Europe/the Mediterranean Basin, the estimation of the impacts of climate change and the assessment of adaptation and mitigation strategi","research program 'THESPIA II' (Development of tools and methodologies for the analysis of future climate projections in Europe/the Mediterranean Basin, the estimation of the impacts of climate change and the assessment of adaptation and mitigation strategi","The present study was partly funded by the research program 'THESPIA II' (Development of tools and methodologies for the analysis of future climate projections in Europe/the Mediterranean Basin, the estimation of the impacts of climate change and the assessment of adaptation and mitigation strategies) realized by the Institute for Environmental Research and Sustainable Development (Athens, Greece) of the National Observatory of Athens (NOA), Greece.",,65,1,1,4,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,FEB,2022,13,2,,,,,,,282,10.3390/atmos13020282,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13020282,,,25,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,ZQ4BM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000767052000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since the IDFs' generation is based on the assumption of stationarity, the rainfall statistics information may be unreliable. Recent research is attempting to develop a new methodology to integrate nonstationarity and climate change into IDFs updating process. Up to now, there is no comprehensive evaluation of the IDFs updating procedure at different locations. In this study, we analyzed the combined effect of non-stationarity and climate change on future IDFs at six selected gauging stations across Canada. New hydrological insights for the region: A comparison of the updated future IDFs with historical IDFs indicates an intensification of extreme events for all study areas, increasing hazard to them. Sites located in the Northeast coastal region will be the most affected in the future by the extreme precipitation. In addition, there is a clear indication that rare events (100-year return period) will become more frequent (in some cases increase up to 443 % of the water infrastructure risk of failure has been observed). We argue that the above findings (i) offer a new overview of future extreme precipitation across Canada, and (ii) should be considered by the stakeholders with respect to climate change adaptation decisions.","[Simonovic, Slobodan P.; Schardong, Andre] Western Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Simonovic, Slobodan P.; Schardong, Andre] Western Univ, Inst Catastroph Loss Reduct, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Silva, Daniele Feitoza; Goldenfum, Joel Avruch] Univ Fed Rio Grande Sul UFRGS, Inst Pesquisas Hidraul IPH, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-90050260 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Silva, DF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande Sul UFRGS, Inst Pesquisas Hidraul IPH, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-90050260 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",daniele.silva@ufrgs.br; simonovic@uwo.ca; aschardo@uwo.ca; joel@iph.ufrgs.br,"SILVA, DANIELE FEITOZA/AAP-1180-2021","SILVA, DANIELE FEITOZA/0000-0001-5862-0681; Goldenfum, Joel/0000-0003-4959-9053",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88882.345767/2019-01]; CAPES-PRINT [88887.363277/2019-00]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CAPES-PRINT; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction,The authors would like to thank the financial support from the Coordenac ~ao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) -Grant number 88882.345767/2019-01 and CAPES-PRINT -Grant number 88887.363277/2019-00 provided to the first author; and Collaborative Research Grant provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction to the second author.

The study utilized the adaptation strategy index to establish the relationship between adopting adaptation strategies and maize production. The farmers ranked the adaptation strategies in terms of their usefulness in adapting to drought and successfully alleviating a decline in maize production. The farmers ranked shifting of planting date, reduction of maize cultivated area, planting drought resistant varieties, crop diversification and intercropping as the most useful adaptation strategies. The study utilized the double hurdle model to identify the factors affecting the farmers' adoption of drought adaptation strategies. The study found that gender of the household head, level of education of the household head, household size, extension services and land ownership influence farmers' choice of adaptation strategies.

Until now, responses to these events and planning for future occurrences have focused on ecological and social impacts, to the almost total exclusion of the impacts on heritage. Cultural heritage includes archaeological sites, historic buildings, and artifacts, but-more importantly-it also includes the meanings, values, and contemporary social behavior associated with these tangible forms of heritage. Thus, place attachment, sense of place, and associated forms of intangible heritage are major societal factors that must be integrated into climate change adaptation and risk management models. Communities, towns, and governments typically disassociate cultural/historical resources from natural resources in issues of planning and development. A transdisciplinary approach to cultural heritage is necessary in times of risk. There is critical need for this approach, since climate change will result in accelerated changes for human communities-from dislocation to a change in the physical manifestations of place.

It is a particularly challenging case of environmental communication because its main cause, greenhouse gas emissions, is invisible. The predominant approach of making climate change visible is the use of iconic, often affective, imagery. Literature on the iconography of climate change shows that global iconic motifs, such as polar bears, have contributed to a public perception of the problem as spatially and temporally remote. This paper proposes an alternative approach to global climate change icons by focusing on recognizable representations of local impacts within an interactive game environment. This approach was implemented and tested in a research project based on the municipality of Delta, British Columbia. A major outcome of the research is Future Delta, an interactive educational game featuring 3D visualizations and simulation tools for climate change adaptation and mitigation future scenarios.

In addition to warming, the signs of climate change are expected to materialise through an increase in the frequency and intensity of weather extremes. Climate-change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) have so far operated fairly independently, but there is an emerging need to examine their synergies due to their similarities. Tourism in the Arctic is also increasingly being encouraged by the different levels of government and seen as an important tool for economic development. The special features of Arctic tourism include a high dependency on natural resources, making it vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This article introduces a methodological framework merging elements from DRR, CCA and tourism development with a focus on community-based data-acquiring technique. Its practicality is emphasised through the focus on current and past community responses to weather anomalies and consequent adaptation measures. It additionally explores the relationship between the environment, community and tourism and aims to understand the characteristics of a community. Two case-study communities in Finnish Lapland demonstrate its relevance and contribution to CCA and to wider sustainable Arctic tourism development.","Univ Oulu, Dept Geog, Oulu, Finland",University of Oulu,"Kajan, E (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Geog, Oulu, Finland.",eva.kajan@oulu.fi,,,,,,,84,19,21,0,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1368-3500,1747-7603,,CURR ISSUES TOUR,Curr.

It is claimed that the sea levels are rising following an exponential growth since the 1990s, and because of that coastal communities are facing huge challenges. Many local governments throughout Australia, including those on the coast, have responded to the various warnings about changes in climate and increases in sea levels by undertaking detailed climate change risk management exercises. These exercises, which use projections passed on by the relevant state bodies, are expensive, but still a fraction of the cost of the capital works that they recommend. Several councils have complained to an Australian Productivity Commission report on climate change adaptation they do not have the money for the capital works required. It is shown here that the exponential growth claim is not supported by any measurement of enough length and quality when properly analysed. The tide gauge results do not support the exponential growth theory. The projections by the relevant state bodies should therefore be revised by considering the measurements and not the models to compute the future sea level rises for the next 30 years following the same trend experienced over the last 30 years.

The emissions Of CO2 continue to rise, and climate models project 1.1 degrees C to 6.4 degrees C rise of average surface temperature over the 21(st) century. Health effects from global warming range from increased mortality by extreme weather, floods, and storms to increase of diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and diarrhea. Korea is not immune to health impacts from global warming. Data on daily temperature of Seoul in 1994 showed a clear association with daily mortality. Rise of sea and surface temperatures also indicates possibility of increase in infectious diseases in Korea. Concentrations of ambient pollutants, particularly ozone, were shown to be associated with surface temperature. Therefore, we are already in the influence of climate change. Adaptation strategy to climate changes is basically a matter of public health, Well -prepared programs for responding to climate changes will minimize health risks. The most effective responses are strengthening of the key functions of environmental management, surveillance, and response to natural disasters and changes of disease patterns associated with global warming. We need to intensify our efforts in preventive public health, and ensure sustainable development and protection of ecosystem for human health.","Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, Seoul 151, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Hong, YC (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, Seoul 151, South Korea.",ychong1@snu.ac.kr,"Hong, Yun-Chul/J-5725-2012",,,,,,5,2,2,5,28,KOREAN MEDICAL ASSOC,SEOUL,"302-75 INCHON-1 DONG, YONGSAN-GU, SEOUL, 140-721, SOUTH KOREA",1975-8456,2093-5951,,J KOREAN MED ASSOC,J.

Methodological challenges have impeded efforts to identify and track adaptation actors beyond the coarse scale of nation states. Yet, for effective adaptation to succeed, who do national governments need to engage, support and encourage? Using the UK as a case study, we conducted a systematic review of official government documents on climate adaptation, between 2006 and 2015, to understand which organisations are identified as key to future adaptation efforts and tracked the extent to which these organisations changed over time. Our unique longitudinal dataset found a very large number of organisations (n = 568). These organisations varied in size (small-medium enterprises to large multinationals), type (public, private and not-for-profit), sector (e.g. water, energy, transport and health), scale (local, national and international), and roles and responsibilities (policymaking, decision-making, knowledge production, retail). Importantly, our findings reveal a mismatch between official government policies that repeatedly call on private organisations to drive adaptation, on the one hand, and a clear dominance of the public sector on the other hand. Yet, the capacity of organisations to fulfil the roles and responsibilities assigned to them, particularly in the public sector, is diminishing. Unless addressed, climate adaptation actions could be assigned to those either unable, or unwilling, to implement them.","[Lorenz, Susanne; Dessai, Suraje] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Lorenz, Susanne; Dessai, Suraje] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Porter, James J.] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, Strand Campus, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Leeds; University of London; King's College London,"Dessai, S (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Dessai, S (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.dessai@leeds.ac.uk,"Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009; Lorenz, Susanne/G-3893-2014","Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364; Porter, James/0000-0002-5442-5544; Lorenz, Susanne/0000-0002-9124-9690",European Research Council under the European Union [284369],European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),"The authors would like to thank the financial support from the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007 2013)/ERC Grant agreement no. 284369, which made this research study possible.",,50,11,11,1,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Results show a lack of studies focused on the global South, especially where there are tropical glaciers, which are likely to be the first to disappear. Climate change impacts can be classified as impacts on food and feed, water availability, natural hazards regulation, spirituality and cultural identity, aesthetics, and recreation. In turn, climate change impacts on infrastructure and accessibility also affect ecosystem services. Several of these impacts are a direct threat to the lives of mountain peoples, their livelihoods and their culture. Mountain tourism is experiencing abrupt changes too.

Connections between demographic factors, belief in climate change, perceived risk, and advisors' attitudes toward adaptation to climate change are examined. Three-fourths of advisors believe climate change is occurring, but disagree on the human contribution. Trust in information sources predicted agricultural advisors' belief in climate change. Consistent with the availability heuristic, perceiving variability in weather made advisors more likely to believe in anthropogenic climate change. Believing climate change is at least partly human caused increased agreement that agricultural adaptation is important. Perceiving greater risk from potential climate impacts and noticing variable weather also significantly increased adaptation attitudes. Findings suggest that trust and availability heuristic could be added to help explain the processes of social amplification and attenuation of risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the anticipated changes to coastal dunes have not yet been demonstrated using field data. Here, we provide evidence of dune translation that is characterized by a linear increase of the dune toe elevation on the order of 13-15 mm/year during recent decades along the Dutch coast. This rate of increase is a remarkable 7-8 times greater than the measured sea level rise. The observed vertical dune toe translation coincides with seaward movement of the dune toe (i.e., progradation), which shows similarities to prograding coasts in the Holocene both along the Dutch coast and elsewhere. Thus, we suspect that other locations besides the Dutch coast might also show such large ratios between sea level rise and dune toe elevation increase.

This special thematic section presents eight papers that highlight local responses and localized impacts of climate change on islands, reiterating the importance of considering local community perspectives in small island contexts to overcome simplistic viewpoints. Such perceptions and perspectives are increasingly being recognized as offering a valuable contribution to climate change adaptation, particularly to counter the misrepresentation of small islands as vulnerable or passive, and the disregard for the fact that climate change is a global, as well as continual process.

Climate change in particular may cause significant perturbations in the supply of important process inputs such as water, energy, or feedstocks. Thus, for industrial complexes, proper risk management strategies must be developed as part of overall climate change adaptation and resilience measures. Rigorous modeling approaches are needed to ensure that economic losses resulting from a disruption are minimized. In this paper, a P-graph-based methodology is used to determine optimal adjustments to crisis conditions in order to minimize manufacturing losses; this graph theoretic methodology has traditionally been used for process network synthesis problems but has recently proven to be useful for structurally analogous problem domains.

Globally, a large data gap exists because wetland surface and shallow subsurface processes remain unaccounted for by traditional vulnerability assessments using tide gauges. Moreover, those processes vary substantially across wetlands, so modelling platforms require relevant local data. The low-cost, simple, high-precision rod surface-elevation table-marker horizon (RSET-MH) method fills this critical data gap, can be paired with spatial data sets and modelling and is financially and technically accessible to every country with coastal wetlands. Yet, RSET deployment has been limited to a few regions and purposes.

The static growth model provides a direct test of whether a significant climate influence on forest growth can be statistically derived, while the dynamic growth model estimates climate effects through site productivity. Results indicate considerable spatial variation in potential future growth and productivity change on loblolly pine plantations due to climate change in the southern United States, while overall regional effects are projected to be marginal.

However, it is still poorly understood about the effects of seasonal LST on the interannual LST change and the dominant driving force for the variation in LST. In this study, trends of time-series LST were analyzed by using both linear and nonlinear methods. Two indices were developed to evaluate the effects of seasonal LST trends on interannual LST change. The main driving factor of LST was identified based on each pixel. Two turning points were founded in 2007 and 2011 during the study period of 2003-2019. A significant cooling trend of LST appeared from 2007 to 2011/2012 with the rates of -0.2237 K/year (daytime) and-0.1239 K/year (nighttime). LST increased in almost all seasons except the daytime in autumn. The warming effect in spring and winter contributed 69.43% to interannual warming of daytime LST, and accounted for 59.02% of interannual warming of nighttime LST. In most regions of China, air temperature and vegetation were the dominant factors influencing the change of LST.

As the second important macronutrient, phosphorus (P) fundamentally mediates the crop adaptability to climate change. An overview on previous work on crop P acquisition and soil P dynamics in responses to elevated CO2 and temperature would be critical for further advancing our knowledge on P cycling under climate change and its management to maintain agroecosystem sustainability. This review focuses on the effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on root morphology, root exudation, and associated biochemical properties in the rhizosphere in relevant to crop P acquisition and soil P availability. Studies indicate that elevated CO2 and temperature could increase P uptake of crops, such as rice and soybean when crops are grown within the range of optimal growth temperature. Elevated CO2 and temperature not only alter root exudates and changes the activity of soil enzymes and microbes the in rhizosphere environment, but also directly influence soil chemical and biochemical processes and thus the bioavailability of P. It is worth to focus on P-solubilizing microbial community composition, and microbial function on soil P mobilization in the rhizosphere of crops grown under climate change.","[Guo, Lili; Li, Yansheng; Yu, Zhenhua; Jin, Jian; Liu, Xiaobing] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Mollisols Agroecol, Harbin 150081, Peoples R China; [Guo, Lili; Liu, Xiaobing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wu, Junjiang; Jin, Jian] Heilongjiang Acad Agr Sci, Soybean Res Inst, Minist Agr, Key Lab Soybean Cultivat, Harbin 150086, Peoples R China; [Jin, Jian] La Trobe Univ, Ctr AgriBiosci, Dept Anim Plant & Soil Sci, Melbourne Campus, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; La Trobe University","Jin, J; Liu, XB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Mollisols Agroecol, Harbin 150081, Peoples R China.;Liu, XB (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Jin, J (corresponding author), Heilongjiang Acad Agr Sci, Soybean Res Inst, Minist Agr, Key Lab Soybean Cultivat, Harbin 150086, Peoples R China.;Jin, J (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Ctr AgriBiosci, Dept Anim Plant & Soil Sci, Melbourne Campus, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",jinjian29@hotmail.com; liuxb@iga.ac.cn,"于, 镇华/AAR-6878-2021",,"National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0504202 / GX18B028, 2017YFD0300300]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671274]; Professional Association of the Alliance of International Science Organizations [ANSO-PA-2020-12]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Professional Association of the Alliance of International Science Organizations,"This research was partially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0504202 / GX18B028; 2017YFD0300300), the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671274], and Professional Association of the Alliance of International Science Organizations (ANSO-PA-2020-12).",,95,3,3,14,73,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1735-6814,1735-8043,,INT J PLANT PROD,Int.

To thoroughly implement the overall requirements for the construction of an ecological civilization and effectively improve the capacity of cities to adapt to climate change, China launched the pilot construction of Climate Resilient Cities in 2017. In this paper, 16 prefecture level cities in Anhui Province of China were selected as the research objects, and the multi-level grey system evaluation method was used to measure the climate resilience of these regions. We used the difference in differences method to evaluate the effect of the pilot policy of Climate Resilient Cities. The pilot policies of the Climate Resilient Cities showed a significant contribution to the regional climate resilience, and, after isolating the impact of other factors on the regional climate resilience, the pilot policies of the Climate Resilient Cities increased the climate resilience of the pilot cities by four percentage points. The pilot policies of the Climate Resilient Cities had a significant contribution to the urban infrastructure development and ecological space optimization, as well as non-significant impacts to the urban water security, emergency management capacity-building, and science and technology innovation initiatives.","[Liang, Zifeng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Liang, ZF (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",liangzf19@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,40,4,4,39,110,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

This study quantifies the impacts of climate change on irrigated agriculture in the snow-dependent Yakima River Basin (YRB) in the Pacific Northwest United States. Here we show that increasingly severe droughts and temperature driven reductions in growing season significantly reduces expected annual agricultural productivity. The overall reduction in mean annual productivity also dampens interannual yield variability, limiting yield-driven revenue fluctuations. Our findings show that farmers who adapt to climate change by planting improved crop varieties may potentially increase their expected mean annaul productivity in an altered climate, but remain strongly vulnerable to irrigation water shortages that substantially increase interannual yield variability (i.e., increasing revenue volatility). Our results underscore the importance for crop adaptation strategies to simultaneously capture the biophysical effects of warming as well as the institutional controls on water availability. Studies on examining the climate impact on irrigated agriculture do not account for regional specific details.

This study proposes an innovative method integrating Geographic Information System (GIS), fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and fuzzy VIekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) for site selection of wind farms in the Wafangdian region, China. The uncertainties caused by subjective judgments of the stakeholders were tackled by the FAHP method firstly, where weight values of six criteria were identified. Next, the fuzzy VIKOR method and GIS tool were used to generate the Qi value of each location for ranking their appropriate degrees for wind energy development. The results demonstrated that the middle and upper parts of the studied area are suitable for the exploitation of wind energy, while the central and eastern areas are unfavorable. The influences exerted by various weight combinations and climate change on a site suitability assessment were examined. The resulting comparison with existing wind farms reflected the practicability and reliability of the proposed method; the estimation of climate change impacts on site selection provided the suggestion and support of a long-term plan for wind power development, and even the energy structure adjustment scheme adapted to climate change.","[Li, Mengran; Xu, Ye; Guo, Junhong; Li, Ye; Li, Wei] North China Elect Power Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, MOE Key Lab Reg Energy & Environm Syst Optimizat, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Xu, Y (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, MOE Key Lab Reg Energy & Environm Syst Optimizat, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",limengran@ncepu.edu.cn; xuye@ncepu.edu.cn; handangjh@163.com; liye@ncepu.edu.cn; li.wei@ncepu.edu.cn,"xu, ye/GQO-8972-2022","Li, Mengran/0000-0002-1337-0794",National Key R&D Program of China CERC-WET Project [SQ2018YFE010367],National Key R&D Program of China CERC-WET Project,This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China CERC-WET Project (Grant No. SQ2018YFE010367).,,27,13,13,1,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAY,2020,13,10,,,,,,,2426,10.3390/en13102426,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13102426,,,19,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,LW6MC,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000539257300019,View Full Record in Web of Science

An econometric model of electricity demand is used, in conjunction with climate projections from a state-of-the-art Global Circulation Model with a regional focus on the Eastern Mediterranean. Annual electricity demand is projected to rise by about 6% compared to a 'no climate change' case. Although these additional power requirements are not very remarkable on an annual basis, total costs up to 2050, which may exceed 730 million Euros at today's prices, imply that the country may need to forgo one or two years of economic growth in order to cope with extra electricity needs due to climate change. This outlook indicates that a reasonable future energy path in regions with Mediterranean climate would involve substantial deployment of solar-powered electricity generation, which can meet peak load requirements while reducing the country's energy dependence. Moreover, this forecast highlights the need for adaptation to climate change through investments in the improvement of the energy performance of the building stock. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Observed increases in atmospheric [CO2] and alteration to rainfall patterns, due to anthropogenic release of greenhouse gases, will likely have a strong influence on soil microbial communities and ultimately the ecosystem services they provide. Therefore, it is vital to understand how soil microbial communities will respond to future climate change scenarios. In a large climate change experiment, we surveyed soil fungal community structure changes under Eucalyptus saligna exposed to a 3-year period of elevated [CO2] and one year of drought. Our results suggest that drought is a key factor in shaping soil fungal community composition and its interactive effect with elevated [CO2] appears to select for a fungal community that is more adapted to drought conditions. In-depth examination of fungal community composition showed that plant pathogenic strains, such as Fusarium sp. and Mycosphaerella sp., appear to be well adapted to climate change conditions, which may have significant implications for eucalypt plantation forest health under future climate conditions. Overall our results indicate that soil water availability regulates the abundance and diversity of the soil fungal community. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Curlevski, Nathalie J.

A total of 3 regions (Port Louis, Vacoas and St Pierre), each with distinctive micro-climates, were selected to assess the thermal discomfort levels under future climate scenarios (RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5). The results show that, in 2100, discomfort levels during occupancy periods will increase by a maximum of 15% in Port Louis, while the other 2 regions will have an increase of 11%, under the worst scenario, while using natural ventilation. Results, thus, establish that natural ventilation will not be efficient under the impact of climate change, although varying for different climate conditions.

A qualitative method was employed to solicit responses from respondents in selected rural areas under four different vegetation zones through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Data were analyzed using Atlas.ti. A difference was found in gender reactions to migration due to socio-cultural factors and family responsibilities. In addition, different types of migration patterns were found to exist among men and women.

This paper studies the spatiotemporal evolution of the green dam in the Moudjbara region (Djelfa Province, Algeria), from 1972 to 2019, by using Landsat imagery, Land Change Modeler, and OpenLand package. The future evolution of pine plantations, for the year 2029, was also forecasted, based on an anthropogenic scenario (i.e., anthropogenic pressure is the main driver of the green dam destruction). Our findings revealed that the green dam project was successful for a few years, but, after that, pine plantations deteriorated significantly, due to forest harvesting, livestock overgrazing, and the proliferation of the pine caterpillar processionary, which destroyed most of the reforestation. Land change modeler predicted a huge degradation of pine plantations for the year 2029, and if the deforestation continues at the same rate, the green dam in the Moudjbara region will disappear during the next few decades. Being aware of this threat, the Algerian authorities are now planning to reforest more than 1.2 million ha under the latest rural renewal policy, by introducing new principles related to sustainable development, fighting desertification, and climate change adaptation. We strongly recommend moving away from the singular tree planting focus, to diversifying desertification control methods.","[Benhizia, Ramzi; Szabo, Gyorgy] Univ Debrecen, Dept Landscape Protect & Environm Geog, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Kouba, Yacine] Univ Larbi Ben Mhidi Oum El Bouaghi, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, Oum El Bouaghi 04000, Algeria; [Negyesi, Gabor] Univ Debrecen, Dept Nat Geog & Geoinformat, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Ata, Behnam] Univ Debrecen, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen; Universite d'Oum El Bouaghi; University of Debrecen; University of Debrecen,"Benhizia, R (corresponding author), Univ Debrecen, Dept Landscape Protect & Environm Geog, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",benhizia.ramzi@science.unideb.hu; yacinoargelino@gmail.com; szabo.gyorgy@science.unideb.hu; nelesi.gabor@science.unideb.hu; b.behnamata@gmail.com,"Négyesi, Gábor/K-4824-2019; Kouba, Yacine/G-1804-2012","Szabo, Gyorgy/0000-0003-2201-2099; Kouba, Yacine/0000-0002-2089-5337","National Research, Development and Innovation Fund of Hungary [TKP2020-IKA-04];  [2020-4.1.1TKP2020]","National Research, Development and Innovation Fund of Hungary; ","Project No. TKP2020-IKA-04 has been implemented with the support provided by the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund of Hungary, financed under the 2020-4.1.1TKP2020 funding scheme.",,42,2,2,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,14,,,,,,,7953,10.3390/su13147953,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13147953,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TO7ZJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000677124200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study focuses on the analysis of monitored high-frequency continuous spring discharge and rainfall data in the contact and fracture type Mathamali spring located in the Garhwal Himalaya. Discharge from the spring and its storage behavior has been studied by analyzing recession components and flow duration curves. Analyzed discharge data revealed that the spring can generate maximum volume during monsoon as compared to winter due to aquifer properties and tendencies to store and transmit water. Springshed intervention practices were implemented in early April 2017. The measured average flow was 16.9 lpm but soon after the interventions, the average flow increased by 2.6 times. The minimum average spring flow was 2.3 lpm which increased by 5 times whereas the average maximum flow increased by 1.8 times. Post-intervention, storage duration has increased by 16%, decaying from 143 lpm (peak flow) to 12.7 lpm (baseflow). The preliminary findings from this spring can be considered as a check for establishing benchmarks for sustainable development of springsheds, climate change adaptation, and development plans to cope up with growing water insecurity in the rural Himalayas.","[Kumar, Vikram; Paramanik, Santosh] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Hydrol, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee,"Kumar, V (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Hydrol, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.",25.vikram@gmail.com,,,"Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee [F.I.G.-100582]; Department of Science and Technology [SER-776]","Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee; Department of Science and Technology(Department of Science & Technology (India))","Both of the authors contributed to the writing of this paper.

Accordingly, Ghana's water sector has seen tremendous changes over the years culminating in the 2007 National Water Policy. This paper evaluates the policy to highlight its strengths and weaknesses, to inform possible future review and guide new policy development in developing countries or troubleshoot existing policies. It draws on a framework based on three thematic areas distilled from global water policy development guidelines. Using a 3-point Likert scale, sub-thematic components are ranked and used to quantitatively compute the theme-specific scores (TSS) and the overall performance (OP) of the policy. Per the study findings, cross-cutting water policy issues including integrated water resources management, climate change adaptation and gender mainstreaming are more highlighted (TSS = 67%) than country-specific water management issues (TSS = 50%). Specifically, the policy neglects key national issues including protection of coastal regions from the onslaught of sea waves, and water resource protection against oil spills, and its institutional framework for implementation excludes key sector institutions. Generally, the policy addresses most pertinent issues in the water sector (OP = 64%) and areas for improvement are further discussed in the paper.","[Monney, Isaac] Univ Educ Winneba, Dept Environm Hlth & Sanitat Educ, POB M40, Mampong Ashanti, Ghana; [Ocloo, Kafui] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Monney, I (corresponding author), Univ Educ Winneba, Dept Environm Hlth & Sanitat Educ, POB M40, Mampong Ashanti, Ghana.",monney.isaac@gmail.com,"Monney, Isaac/A-7248-2014","Monney, Isaac/0000-0003-4990-4732","Regional Water and Environmental Sanitation Centre, Kumasi under the African Centres of Excellence Project of the World Bank","Regional Water and Environmental Sanitation Centre, Kumasi under the African Centres of Excellence Project of the World Bank","The authors acknowledge the support of the Regional Water and Environmental Sanitation Centre, Kumasi under the African Centres of Excellence Project of the World Bank for this study.",,50,5,5,4,31,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1366-7017,,,WATER POLICY,Water Policy,JUN,2017,19,3,,,,,377,389,,10.2166/wp.2017.114,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wp.2017.114,,,13,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,EY5UD,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000404045000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Statistical analyses and hydrological modelling are used to show that the observed multi-decadal wet and dry phases in the Okavango River and Delta result from multi-decadal oscillations in rainfall, which are likely to be related to processes of internal variability in the climate system, rather than external natural or anthropogenic forcing. Analyses of changes in this aspect of variability under projected climate change scenarios are based on data from a multi-model ensemble of 19 General Circulation Models, which are used to drive hydrological models of the Okavango River and Delta. Projections for the 21st century indicate a progressive shift towards drier conditions attributed to the influence of increasing temperatures on water balance. It is, however, highly likely that multi-decadal oscillations, possibly of similar magnitude to that of 20th century, will be superimposed on the overall trend. These may periodically offset or amplify the mean drying trend. This effect should be accounted for in water and catchment management and climate change adaptation strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

There have been major technological advances in environmental chemistry, analytical instrumentation and numerical modelling of the transport of contaminants through air, water, soil and biota. There is now a much greater appreciation of the complexity of biogeochemical, hydrological, social and economic interactions that affect the behaviour of chemical contaminants in urban, industrial, agricultural and natural ecosystems. Arguably, this past emphasis has been on the descriptive and predictive approaches to urban environmental research with a strong emphasis on the biophysical, chemical, biogeochemical, hydrological and atmospheric sciences. The emerging challenge is how environmental scientists can more effectively bring their knowledge to those decision-makers who are responsible for changing urban and industrial processes that cause environmental impacts in the first place. As the global urban population grows, there are a range of new and complex urban climate adaptation challenges and opportunities in the built environment. These challenges include housing the vulnerable, improving indoor air quality, lowering health impacts in cities and adaptations to heat stress. The complexity and scale of these challenges will require environmental scientists to work collaboratively with other urban professionals, including engineers, planners, designers, economists, policymakers, managers and lawyers, and communities to bring about climate adaptation in urban environments.","CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Climate Adaptat Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Kearns, A (corresponding author), CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Climate Adaptat Flagship, GPO Box 284, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",allen.kearns@csiro.au,"Kearns, Allen/D-7878-2011",,,,,,32,2,3,3,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,1745-2627,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

The results show that half of naturally vegetated land surface could be under moderate or severe risk at the end of the 21(st) century under the middle and high emission scenarios. The areas with high risk are the Tibetan Plateau region and an area extended northeastward from the Tibetan Plateau to northeast China. With the three major factors considered, the change in carbon stocks is the main contributing factor to the high risk of ecosystem shifts. The change in carbon fluxes is another important contributing factor under the high emission scenario. The change in water fluxes is a less dominant factor except for the Tibetan Plateau region under the high emission scenario. Although there is considerable uncertainty in the risk assessment, the geographic patterns of the risk are generally consistent across different scenarios.

Livestock productivity, however, can fluctuate due to many environmental factors, including climate variability. Current predictions of continued warming, decreased precipitation, and increased climate variability worldwide raise serious questions for scientists and producers alike. Foremost is understanding how to mitigate livestock production losses attributed to climate extremes and variability. We investigated the influence of spatial heterogeneity on livestock production over six years in tallgrass prairie of the southern Great Plains, USA. We manipulated heterogeneity by allowing fire and grazing to interact spatially and temporally at broad scales across pastures ranging from 430 to 900 ha. We found that the influence of precipitation on livestock productivity was contingent upon heterogeneity. When heterogeneity was absent, livestock productivity decreased with reduced rainfall. In contrast, when heterogeneity was present, there was no relationship with rainfall and livestock productivity, resulting in heterogeneity stabilizing livestock productivity through time. With predicted increases in climate variability and uncertainty, managing for heterogeneity may assist livestock producers in adapting to climate change and in mitigating livestock productivity loss caused by climatic variability.

This paper discusses a more strategic, economic approach to public adaptation and compares it with adaptation practice in Europe. An economic approach to adaptation involves setting priorities, both spatially (where to adapt) and inter-temporally (when to adapt). The paper reviews what we know about Europe's geographic adaptation priorities. On inter-temporal priorities, it recommends fast-tracking two types of action: Win-win measures that yield an immediate return, such as water efficiency, and strategic decisions on infrastructure and spatial planning that have long-term consequences for Europe's vulnerability profile. An economic approach to adaptation involves careful project design to ensure adaptation measures are cost-effective and flexible in the light of climate uncertainty (how to adapt). The final element of an economic approach to adaptation is the division of labour between the state and private actors (who should adapt). The paper argues that the traditional functions of the state-the provision of public goods, creation of an enabling environment and protection of the vulnerable-also apply to adaptation.","[Fankhauser, Samuel] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Fankhauser, Samuel] London Sch Econ, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Fankhauser, Samuel; Soare, Raluca] Vivid Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Fankhauser, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.fankhauser@lse.ac.uk,,"Fankhauser, Samuel/0000-0003-2100-7888",Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Munich Re; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Munich Re; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"An earlier version of this paper was commissioned from Vivid Economics by the European Investment Bank.

However, cumulative targets appear to conflict with the concept of a 'floor' in emissions caused by sectors such as food production. Here, we show that the introduction of emissions floors does not reduce the importance of cumulative emissions, but may make some warming targets unachievable. For pathways that give a most likely warming up to about 4 degrees C, cumulative emissions from pre-industrial times to year 2200 correlate strongly with most likely resultant peak warming regardless of the shape of emissions floors used, providing a more natural long-term policy horizon than 2050 or 2100. The maximum rate of CO2-induced warming, which will affect the feasibility and cost of adapting to climate change, is not determined by cumulative emissions but is tightly aligned with peak rates of emissions. Hence, cumulative carbon emissions to 2200 and peak emission rates could provide a clear and simple framework for CO2 mitigation policy.","[Bowerman, Niel H.

The results showed that (1) the temperature markedly increased in all seasons; (2) the precipitation increased in summer and winter but decreased in spring and autumn; (3) overall, the NDVI increased markedly during 2005-2017, but showed seasonal differences, with decreases in summer and winter and increases in spring and autumn; (4) the annual sediment transport showed a significant decreasing trend and (5) a large number of the population shifted from rural to urban areas, resulting in a decrease in the rural population between 1998 and 2018. Rural depopulation has brought about farmland abandonment, conversion of farmland to forests, which was the factor driving the recovery of the vegetation and the decrease in sediment.

The social factors that drive cities to adapt to and/or prepare for these impacts are largely unknown. Sixty-five qualitative interviews were conducted with multi-sectoral decision-makers to assess factors driving adaptation in six cities across the United States: Tucson, Arizona; Tampa, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Boston, Massachusetts; Portland, Oregon; and Los Angeles, California. We find that there are three type of factors that affect adaptation: (1) swing characteristics of or events within localities that can lead toward or away from action; (2) inhibitors ways of thinking and framing climate change available to decision-makers that slow, but do not necessarily stop change; and (3) resource catalysts types of information and moral grounding that provide a rationale for change. These factors often intersect such that swing factors are only influential in cities with some political acceptance of climate change. In cities where public acceptance of climate change is slowly shifting, resource catalysts are more influential. This is the first qualitative study of climate change adaptation in American cities.

In the next four decades, 120 million people are expected to live in the region, which currently covers 11 major cities, and includes the coastal megacities formed by Hong Kong and Shenzhen. These populous low-lying coastal cities experience emerging flood risk from (i) intense precipitation, (ii) storm surges, (iii) global sea level rise and (iv) rapid urbanization in the flood-prone areas. These have major economic, social and ecological impacts and have made it imperative to adopt a sustainable flood risk management strategy to mitigate these risks. This research uses the case study in Tai O and Shenzhen River sites from Hong Kong and Shenzhen where in-depth discussions were held with various stakeholders to overview and understand current constraints to realizing sustainable flood risk management (SFRM). The outcome shows the authorities have realized the importance of SFRM and climate change adaptation strategies. They seek further improvement in managing flood risk and preparing for unpredictable climatic regimes in both megacities, and by extension comparable urbanizing coastal cities in the PRD and East Asia.

A key challenge is to improve the integration of geodiversity in environmental policy and its implementation in order to deliver more holistic and sustainable environmental management and wider public benefits. This requires greater awareness and recognition of the key benefits and ecosystem services that geodiversity provides for society. With an overall objective of promoting integration of geodiversity into relevant policies and decision frameworks, we advocate a more strategic, ecosystem-based approach to address: the future-proofing of ecosystem services, particularly in a context of climate change and rising sea-levels; conservation and sustainable management of geodiversity both in designated sites and in the wider countryside; raising awareness of the value of geodiversity and its contribution to ecosystem services; and improving understanding of geodiversity and key knowledge gaps.

Twenty-two beaches out of 30 predominantly exhibited shoreline retreat, with the highest retreat value (166.45 m) recorded on the north-eastern coast. While erosion predominated on beaches and at the sand dune front, inner areas generally exhibited accretion, with sand sheets (up to 135 m from the pre-cyclone vegetation line) indicating landward sediment transfer. Natural back-reef beaches exhibited the formation of new beach ridges, marked (up to 2 m) upward growth and alongshore beach extension. The high spatial variability of inferred impacts is attributed to the cyclone's track, coast exposure, beach configuration and, importantly, human-driven environmental change. Whereas vegetation removal exacerbated marine inundation and inhibited the vertical accretion of beaches, shoreline hardening aggravated wave-induced sediment loss while also inhibiting sediment deposition. Four beach response modes are distinguished. Based on findings, we identified three major areas of action for risk reduction and adaptation to climate change. Depending on beach response and site specificities, relocation and the determination of set-back lines, coastal buffer restoration, or engineered structures' upgrading should be prioritized.

Climate governance is the broad multiscalar, mixed method approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. It is founded on neoliberal market logics that commodify carbon, while also attempting to be socially and environmentally sustainable. This research focuses on hydroelectricity, a climate governance mechanism that is simultaneously promoted as a solution to climate change and critiqued for its negative social and environmental impacts. This paradox is explored by assessing the assemblage of interactions occurring within Costa Rica, a place known for their sustainable development and renewable energy production. Local indigenous communities, state, and non-state actors voice a diverse array of perspectives regarding construction of the Diquis hydroelectric project, which the state promotes as a key component of its climate plan. To some indigenous peoples, the project is a threat to their landscapes, livelihoods, and cultures; to others, its delay results in missed economic opportunities.

However, these changes are only just beginning to be incorporated into planning strategies for coastal economies and land use in France. Recent coastal storms marked the turning point, and public authorities have now started to revise coastal management legislation, stating that the managed retreat of settlements and infrastructure is the preferred strategy to adapt to climate change. To date, this managed retreat has almost exclusively been discussed in relation to the current political, social, and economic obstacles that make it difficult to relocate equipment and houses inland. Here, we add to this discussion by depicting how the careful ecological restoration of dunes and salt marshes on land made available by managed retreat could overcome some of these obstacles. First, we describe three possible strategies to adapt to sea-level rise as well as the maladaptation of the current strategy. Then, we focus on the limitations and advantages of ecological restoration in terms of managed retreat and vice versa. Finally, we depict how a new kind of land lease, introduced in draft legislation, can help tackle the multitemporal and multispatial issues that currently hinder managed retreat.","[Fouqueray, Timothee; Frascaria-Lacoste, Nathalie] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, AgroParisTech,Ecol,Systemat,Evolut, F-91400 Orsay, France; [Trommetter, Michel] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, INRA, GAEL,Grenoble INP, F-38000 Grenoble, France",AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE,"Fouqueray, T (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, AgroParisTech,Ecol,Systemat,Evolut, F-91400 Orsay, France.",timothee.fouqueray@agroparistech.fr,,"Fouqueray, Timothee/0000-0003-4773-4733; Frascaria-Lacoste, Nathalie/0000-0002-3425-7838",ENS Lyon; LabEx BASC [16HGY050],ENS Lyon; LabEx BASC,"T.F. thanks the ENS Lyon for providing a doctoral scholarship, Charente-Maritime inhabitants for valuable discussions, and Guillaume Rieu for logistic support.

A considerable amount of literature is dedicated to the adoption of improved cropping practices among smallholder farmers in developing countries. While most studies focus on cash crops or main staple crops, traditional food grains like finger millet have received little attention in the past decades. Traditional food grains have however an important potential to improve food security, reduce micronutrient deficiencies, and enhance smallholder adaptation to climate change. The present study aims to assess the factors that influence adoption decisions among finger millet farmers in western Kenya. Based on cross-sectional household data from 270 farmers, we estimated a multivariate probit model to compare the adoption decisions in finger millet and maize production. While improved practices such as the use of a modern variety or chemical fertilizer are relatively well adopted in maize production, they are less common in finger millet production. Social networks as well as access to extension services play crucial roles in the adoption of improved finger millet practices, while the same variables are of minor importance for the adoption of improved maize practices. A Cobb-Douglas production function shows a positive effect of modern varieties and chemical fertilizer on finger millet yields.","[Handschuch, Christina; Wollni, Meike] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Handschuch, C (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",c.handschuch@posteo.de,,"Wollni, Meike/0000-0002-8460-7840","Courant Research Centre Poverty, Equity and Growth in Developing Countries - German Research Foundation; Gottingen University","Courant Research Centre Poverty, Equity and Growth in Developing Countries - German Research Foundation; Gottingen University","The authors are grateful for financial support provided by the Courant Research Centre Poverty, Equity and Growth in Developing Countries (funded by the German Research Foundation) and by the Dorothea Schlozer Program of Gottingen University.

The proposals are based upon an examination of the present and potential contributions of the strategies to sustainability, adaptability, and mitigation (limitation) of environmental changes, and the various synergies between these strategies. The strategies and principles would meet criteria which recognize that climate change is inevitable, that any climate change will occur in the context of already-occurring global change due to other agents of change, and that reducing vulnerability to these other changes will increase the future adaptability to climate change. Specifically, the strategies should: (a) increase the ability to feed, clothe and shelter the world's expanding population regardless of the agent of change; (b) reduce vulnerability of forests, habitats and biological diversity to demographic and other environmental stresses; (c) be compatible with mitigation measures; (d) be independent of results from more detailed and accurate site-specific impacts assessments which will be unavailable for several years; (e) be implementable today; and (f) have clear benefits now and in the future.",,,"GOKLANY, IM (corresponding author), US DEPT INTERIOR,OFF POLICY ANAL,1849 C ST NW,WASHINGTON,DC 20240, USA.",,,,,,,,74,30,30,0,2,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The frequency and duration of marine heatwaves have been increasing with ocean warming due to climate change. In particular, the Northeast Pacific has experienced intense and extensive marine heatwaves since the late 1990s - characteristically called the Blob. Here, an investigation of satellite-derived and reanalysis data supported by idealized coupled model experiments show that Arctic warming plays an important role in the increase in Northeast Pacific marine heatwave days during boreal summers. Strong Arctic warming has acted to change the atmospheric circulation pattern over the Northeast Pacific and reduce the low-level cloud fraction from late spring to early summer. We show that the enhancement of solar radiative heat fluxes and reduced latent heat loss over a relatively large area has favored an increase in sea surface temperatures and marine heatwave days. An idealized model experiment performed here, designed to isolate the impact of Arctic warming, supports this hypothesis. The projected changes of Arctic climate on the occurrence of marine heatwaves should be considered in climate change adaptation and mitigation plans.","[Song, Se-Yong; Yeh, Sang-Wook] Hanyang Univ, Dept Marine Sci & Convergence Technol, Ansan, South Korea; [Holbrook, Neil J.

However, assessing SOM changes in cropping systems is difficult due to the varying quantity and quality of input data. SOM processes have been described by several models, but these are complex and require high amounts of input data. In this work, we identified and selected frameworks that simulate SOM pools and stocks as well as the effects of different management practices. We also required that the frameworks be easily accessible for farm-related end users and require limited and accessible amounts of input data. In all, six frameworks met our inclusion criteria: SOCRATES (Soil Organic Carbon Reserves and Transformations in EcoSystems), CCB (CANDY and-Carbon Balance), AMG, CENTURY, CQESTR, and RothC (Rothamsted Carbon Model). We collected information on these frameworks and compared them in terms of their accessibility, the model time steps used, the nutrient cycles included in the simulation, the number of SOM pools, and the agricultural management options included. Our results showed that CCB was the most robust of the frameworks considered, while AMG, CQESTR, and RothC performed the least well.

This study aimed to identify suitable sites for WHTs taking into account stakeholders' sustainability criteria. In a participatory assessment framework, Geographic Information Systems and the Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique were combined to generate suitability maps and to guide sustainable WHTs investments. Steps included the calculation of a sustainability index for a set of traditional and newly introduced WHTs from the perspective of two stakeholder groups, farmers and decision-makers, and its integration with layers of biophysical constraints. An application of the framework in the Oum Zessar watershed, southeast Tunisia, shows that traditional techniques are the most suitable and sustainable for farmers and fall within the highly suitable class in 76.4% of the total area, while decision-makers prefer innovative techniques that are highly suitable in 80.4% of the watershed.

Based on a case study of South Korea, this research aims to establish a national-level risk assessment process which includes systematic methodologies given the current limited time/resource and insufficient climate change information. A four-step risk assessment process is proposed: (1) collecting scientific evidence, (2) making list of preliminary risks, (3) making lists of risks and prioritising the risks, (4) categorising the risks. Enough scientific evidence and data about climate change risks of Korea were retained through first two steps, and three components of risk (hazard, exposure, vulnerability) are systematically involved by assessing the magnitude and adaptive capacity of risks. As results of the risks assessment, 93 national-level climate change risks of Korea are identified, and most high priorities in risks have high risk magnitude but low adaptive capacity.

Adaptive capacity is key for moving fisheries onto climate resilient pathways, however, implementing policies to improve adaptive capacity is challenging given the many diverse stakeholders involved in fisheries. Previous research suggests social networks are integral to adaptive capacity because social connectivity can enable, or constrain, knowledge and information sharing. We examine the network of communication among stakeholders in the Basque tropical tuna freezer purse seine fishery in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. We use cluster analysis, descriptive statistics, and exponential random graph models to assess whether different types of actors, occupying different network positions, value similar adaptive capacity strategies. The results indicate that many actor types are frequently connected within the fishery. Preferences for adaptive capacity strategies vary within and across actor types, and the preferences of highly central actors are generally more homogeneous and narrowly focused. All actors agree on the importance of the social organization domain from adaptive capacity, while fishing industry representatives tend to have the most holistic perspective on adaptive capacity overall. We discuss the implications of these findings as they relate to policies for supporting adaptive capacity and climate resilient fisheries.","[Rubio, Iratxe] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Leioa, Spain; [Rubio, Iratxe; Ojea, Elena] Univ Vigo, Future Oc Ans Lab, CIM, Vigo, Spain; [Hileman, Jacob] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Universidade de Vigo; Stockholm University,"Rubio, I (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Leioa, Spain.",,"ojea, elena/D-3709-2018","ojea, elena/0000-0003-4991-8077; Rubio, Iratxe/0000-0002-7025-006X; Hileman, Jacob/0000-0002-5617-6318","project CLOCK, under the European Horizon 2020 Program, ERC Starting Grant - European Research Council [679812]; Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through the BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation [MDM-2017-0714]","project CLOCK, under the European Horizon 2020 Program, ERC Starting Grant - European Research Council; Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program(Basque Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through the BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation","This research was supported by the project CLOCK, under the European Horizon 2020 Program, ERC Starting Grant Agreement n degrees 679812 funded by the European Research Council.

It also supports the livelihoods of a large proportion of the population. At the same time, tea growth is sensitive to climatic conditions making it vulnerable to climate change and variability. Identifying the tea yield response to climatic variability in operational plantations, and identifying the most important climatic variables that impact tea yield is critical to assessing the vulnerability of the industry and informing adaptation. Here, we developed a garden level panel dataset and estimated statistical models to identify the causal effect of monthly temperature, monthly precipitation, drought intensity, and precipitation variability on tea yield. We found decreasing tea yield returns to warmer monthly average temperatures, and when monthly temperatures were above 26.6 degrees C warming had a negative effect. We found that drought intensity did not affect tea yield and that precipitation variability, and in particular precipitation intensity, negatively affect tea yield. An increase in average temperatures as expected with global warming will reduce the productivity of tea plantations, all else held equal. Further, interventions to reduce the sensitivity of tea plantations to warming and precipitation variability will have immediate pay-offs as well as providing climate change adaptation benefits.

We reviewed the potential of underutilised crops with respect to how they can contribute to topical challenges, such as food and nutrition security, human health and well-being, climate change adaptation, the environment, and employment creation in poor rural communities. The fact that underutilised crops are the product of generations of landrace agriculture supports the idea that they are resilient and adapted to the needs of farmers in marginal agricultural environments. In addition, underutilised crops are also seen as offering economic advantages due to their uniqueness, suitability to environments in which they are grown and low input requirements. In certain cases, underutilised crops are associated with specific gender roles with women being seen as particularly significant in their production. Evidence also suggests that the inclusion of underutilised crops in cropping systems contributes to dietary diversity and improved nutrition. In the context of the post-2015 agenda, the potential of underutilised crops to generate income, address food security and their status as a subset of biodiversity links with a number of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) addressing social, economic and environmental issues.","[Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Crop Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [O'Reilly, Patrick; Walker, Sue] Crops Future CFF, Jalan Broga, Semenyih 43500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Mwale, Simon] Ctr Coordinat Agr Res & Dev Southern Africa CCARD, Gaborone 00357, Botswana",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mabhaudhi, T (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Crop Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",tmabhaudhi@gmail.com; patrick.oreilly@cffresearch.org; sue.walker@agro-impact.com; smwale@ccardesa.org,"Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe/AAF-2418-2019; Walker, Sue/ABF-9360-2020","Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe/0000-0002-9323-8127; Walker, Sue/0000-0002-7090-4860; O'Reilly, Patrick/0000-0002-6205-2354",Crops For the Future (CFF); Centre for Coordination of Agricultural Research and Development for Southern Africa (CCARDESA),Crops For the Future (CFF); Centre for Coordination of Agricultural Research and Development for Southern Africa (CCARDESA),Crops For the Future (CFF) and the Centre for Coordination of Agricultural Research and Development for Southern Africa (CCARDESA) are acknowledge for funding the study.

This study presents a new non-parametric statistical K-nearest neighbor algorithm for downscaling climate change scenarios for the Rohini River Basin in Nepal. The study is an introduction to the methodology and discusses its strengths and limitations within the context of hindcasting basin precipitation for the period of 1976-2006. The actual downscaled climate change projections are not presented here. In general, we find that this method is quite robust and well suited to the data-poor situations common in developing countries. The method is able to replicate historical rainfall values in most months, except for January, September, and October. As with any downscaling technique, whether numerical or statistical, data limitations significantly constrain model ability. The method was able to confirm that the dataset available for the Rohini Basin does not capture long-term climatology. Yet, we do find that the hindcasts generated with this methodology do have enough skill to warrant pursuit of downscaling climate change scenarios for this particularly poor and vulnerable region of the world.","[Opitz-Stapleton, Sarah] ISET, Boulder, CO 80304 USA; [Gangopadhyay, Subhrendu] US Bur Reclamat, Denver Fed Ctr, Denver, CO 80225 USA",,"Opitz-Stapleton, S (corresponding author), ISET, 948 North St 9, Boulder, CO 80304 USA.",staplets@i-s-e-t.org,,,UK Department for International Development (DfID) [OHM0837]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA06OAR431008],UK Department for International Development (DfID); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),This research was funded under the UK Department for International Development (DfID) grant OHM0837 and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) grant NA06OAR431008.

Obviously this is due to the nature and characteristics of flood risks, but in part governance approaches vary because of political differences in the nature of governance itself. What is 'appropriate' in this respect depends partly on the prevailing conceptions of the public interest in a country. By applying Alexander's (2002) categorization of public interest to flood risk management practices in The Netherlands, we show that the strongly unitary conception of the public interest (a historic 'flood risk safety for all'), is intertwined with a state-based,'sector-based, hydro-technical governance and expertise system. Although this conception is very strong it is no longer self-evident. Because of changing conceptions of governance in general and because of the felt necessity to adapt to climate change, Dutch flood risk management is gradually changing. Increasingly, the Dutch government has to deal with more dialogical and utilitarian approaches to public interest in the governance of flood risks. The Dutch approach is rooted in community-based interests in flood protection and was centralized and rationalized during the 19th and 20th century. The current flood risk standards are based upon a coarse utilitarian benefit-cost analysis, but evolved into mostly a unitary idea of national safety materialized in law by statutory flood risk standards. The findings show that this unitary concept and status of the public interest of flood risk safety has not diminished; it must, however, increasingly take into account the importance of both processes of decision making (dialogues, deliberations) and neighboring public interests. We conclude that the Dutch conception of the public interest on flood safety is still strong but nevertheless gradually changing, not the least because of a general availability of the information and technology to calculate and differentiate risks.

In this sense, due to its high yield, good adaptation to climate change and high nutritional potential, Moringa oleifera may be an alternative means of fortifying products, in order to improve different food matrices. The different parts of this plant (leaves, seeds, flowers, pods, roots horizontal ellipsis ) can be marketed for their nutritional and medicinal attributes. In this analysis, various scientific studies have been compiled that evaluate the potential of Moringa oleifera in terms of its incorporation into food matrices and its influence on the final sensory characteristics. In general, the incorporation of different parts of moringa into products, such as bread, pastries, snacks and beverages, increases the nutritional profile of the product (proteins, essential amino acids, minerals and fiber), the dried leaf powder representing an alternative to milk and eggs and helping vegans/vegetarians to consume the same protein content. In the case of dairy and meat products, the goal is to improve the antioxidant and antimicrobial capacity. In every food product, adding high concentrations of moringa leads to greenish colorations, herbal flavors and changes in the mechanical properties (texture, hardness, chewiness, volume and sponginess), negatively impacting the acceptance of the final product. This bibliographic review highlights the need to continue researching the technological properties with the dual aim of incorporating different parts of moringa into food matrices and increasing consumer familiarity with this product.","[Trigo, Carla; Luisa Castello, Maria; Dolores Ortola, Maria] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Food Engn Dev, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Castello, ML (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Food Engn Dev, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",cartrigu@etsiamn.upv.es; mcasgo@upv.es; mdortola@tal.upv.es,,, [119RT0567],,The authors thank the support provided by La ValSe-Food-CYTED (119RT0567).,,65,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-9668,1573-9104,,PLANT FOOD HUM NUTR,Plant Food Hum.

Although most research has focused on the need to adopt a plant-based diet to help mitigate climate change, there is also an urgent need to examine the effects of climate change on food systems to adapt to climate change. A systems approach can help identify the pathways through which climate influences food systems, thereby ensuring that programmes combating malnutrition take climate into account. Although little is known about how climate considerations are currently incorporated into nutrition programming, climate information services have the potential to help target the delivery of interventions for at-risk populations and reduce climate-related disruption during their implementation. To ensure climate services provide timely information relevant to nutrition programmes, it is important to fill gaps in our knowledge about the influence of climate variability on food supply chains. A proposed roadmap for developing climate-sensitive nutrition programmes recommends: (i) research aimed at achieving a better understanding of the pathways through which climate influences diet and nutrition, including any time lags; (ii) the identification of entry points for climate information into the decision-making process for nutrition programme delivery; and (iii) capacity-building and training programmes to better equip public health practitioners with the knowledge, confidence and motivation to incorporate climate resilience into nutrition programmes. With sustained investment in capacity-building, data collection and analysis, climate information services can be developed to provide the data, analyses and forecasts needed to ensure nutrition programmes target their interventions where and when they are most needed.","[Nissan, Hannah] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Simmons, Will] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, New York, NY USA; [Downs, Shauna M.] Rutgers Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Urban Global Publ Hlth, One Riverfront Plaza,Suite 1020, Newark, NJ 07102 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Columbia University,"Downs, SM (corresponding author), Rutgers Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Urban Global Publ Hlth, One Riverfront Plaza,Suite 1020, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",sd1081@sph.rutgers.edu,,"Simmons, Will/0000-0003-4120-1063",Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; United Kingdom Economic and Social Research Council through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy [ES/R009708/1],Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; United Kingdom Economic and Social Research Council through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy,"This work was undertaken as part of the Columbia World Project, ACToday, Columbia University, New York City, led by the International Research Institute for Climate and Society.

This will result in an increased burden and stress on the food production systems, particularly in adjustments to several stages of the value chain that will require improvements and/or modifications in their effectiveness such as reducing waste, adapting to climate change, food security, and health. Disruptions such as digital agriculture, digital food, food agility, big data, have been utilized to characterize the changes in the way agro-food systems evolve and function, as well as in the approach they have been analyzed, measured, and monitored. It has been long recognized that the food industry is considered as a data driven enterprise. These characteristics are very important as the food industry becomes global and sustainable. The food industry is currently undergoing significant changes, and with this, challenges are occurring. These challenges are brought about from the food chains, climate changes, and the ability to be resilient in the production of food. Furthermore, health and cultural changes to food are occurring, where the diseases of obesity, diabetes, and aging in the population will continue to change the consumer's patterns and choices; whereby the consumer will be persuaded to choose and eat healthy and more nutritious foods. Indeed, the cultural awareness and social innovation to prevent food waste and therefore improve food security and sustainability will also prove to further complexities.

Principles for country ownership of adaptation within the UNFCCC emphasise on infra-state multi-stakeholder engagement. Multilaterally-funded projects therefore embed multi-level stakeholder collaborations (MSCs) into their approaches. MSCs enable integration of diverse stakeholder voices into adaptation decision making. This supports equitable adaptation, as these stakeholders can highlight local level vulnerabilities and addresses adaptation needs. This paper uses a case study of a project in Tanzania administered by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to understand whether multi-stakeholder engagement in MSCs enables infra-state stakeholder influence in adaptation decision making. Social exchange theory is used to understand power and influence in MSC decision-making. Influence is framed as a factor of resources exchanged, organisational and institutional structures, and rules determining stakeholder engagement. Results from interviews with adaptation stakeholders (n = 47) show that most stakeholders perceived governments control of adaptation finance as a country ownership principle acting as enabling disproportionate government influence and exclusion of other stakeholders from adaptation decision making. The projects national level structures and the international level country ownership requirements limited the engagement of non-government and local actors in project design. These findings suggest that in seeking to implement projects that reflect country ownership principles, multilateral finance mechanisms may be reproducing injustices by creating structures that reinforce marginalization and exclusion of local level communities. The research recommends a re-evaluation of approaches for achieving country ownership, e.g. through identification of practical options for direct engagement with non-government and local level actors.","[Omukuti, Jessica] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Omukuti, J (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",j.a.omukuti@pgr.reading.ac.uk,,"OMUKUTI, Jessica/0000-0003-3094-8647","Leverhulme Doctoral Programme in Climate Justice: Ethics, Politics, Law at the University of Reading [DS-2014-002]","Leverhulme Doctoral Programme in Climate Justice: Ethics, Politics, Law at the University of Reading","This work was funded through the Leverhulme Doctoral Programme in Climate Justice: Ethics, Politics, Law (Grant number DS-2014-002) at the University of Reading.",,153,12,12,4,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,JUL,2020,113,,,,,,26,38,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.04.019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.04.019,,,13,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,LZ3IV,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000541122400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Evaluating these effects, considering the country-specific cultivars' responses to climate, is needed to effectively implement the national adaptation plans to maintain food security under climate change. However, to date, information on the effects of climate change on the local rice cultivars used in developing countries is extremely limited. In the present study, we used a process-based crop growth model, MATCRO-Rice, to predict the impact of climate change on yields of the major local rice cultivar Ciherang in Indonesia during the next 25 years (2018-2042). This model simulated the effects of current to future air temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration on rice yield. A total of 14 future climate scenarios, derived from a combination of four general circulation models and three or four representative concentration pathway scenarios in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, were used to consider the uncertainty of the future climate. The results showed that the rice yield was reduced under all climate scenarios, mainly because of the higher air temperature, leading to reduced photosynthetic rates, increased respiration rates, and phenological changes such as acceleration of senescence. The mean yield reduction across the 14 future climate scenarios was 12.1% for all of Indonesia in 2039-2042. Therefore, to maintain yields in Indonesia, rice production needs to adapt to climate change, and especially to higher air temperatures, in the near future.","[Kinose, Yoshiyuki] Univ Yamanashi, Grad Fac Interdisciplinary Res, Kofu, Yamanashi 4008510, Japan; [Masutomi, Yuji] Ibaraki Univ, Coll Agr, Inashiki, Ibaraki 3000393, Japan; [Shiotsu, Fumitaka] Meiji Univ, Sch Agr, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148571, Japan; [Hayashi, Keiichi] Int Rice Res Inst, Soil Scientist Crop & Environm Sci Div, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Hayashi, Keiichi] Japan Int Res Ctr Agr Sci, Crop Livestock & Environm Div, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058686, Japan; [Ogawada, Daikichi; Gomez-Garcia, Martin; Matsumura, Akilco] Nippon Koei Co Ltd, R&D Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3001259, Japan; [Takahashi, Kiyoshi] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Fukushi, Kensuke] Univ Tokyo, Integrated Res Syst Sustainabil Sci, Inst Adv Studies, Tokyo 1138654, Japan","University of Yamanashi; Ibaraki University; Meiji University; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences; Nippon Koei Co., Ltd.; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of Tokyo","Masutomi, Y (corresponding author), Ibaraki Univ, Coll Agr, Inashiki, Ibaraki 3000393, Japan.",yuji.masutomi@gmail.com,,"TAKAHASHI, KIYOSHI/0000-0002-0163-545X",Program on Development of Regional Climate Change Adaptation Plans in Indonesia of the Ministry of the Environment of Japan; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency [S-12],Program on Development of Regional Climate Change Adaptation Plans in Indonesia of the Ministry of the Environment of Japan; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency,"This study was supported by the Program on Development of Regional Climate Change Adaptation Plans in Indonesia of the Ministry of the Environment of Japan, and by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-12) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency.

Government agencies and nonprofit land trusts heavily rely on perpetual conservation easements. However, climate change and other dynamic landscape changes raise questions about the effectiveness and adaptability of permanent conservation instruments like conservation easements. Building upon a study of 269 conservation easements and interviews with seventy conservation-easement professionals in six different states, we examine the adaptability of conservation easements to climate change. We outline four potential approaches to enhance conservation outcomes under climate change: (1) shift land-acquisition priorities to account for potential climate change impacts; (2) consider conservation tools other than perpetual conservation easements; (3) ensure that the terms of conservation easements permit the holder to adapt to climate change successfully; and (4) provide for more active stewardship of conservation lands. There is still a good deal of uncertainty as to the legal fate of a conservation easement that no longer meets its original purposes. Many state laws provide that conservation easements can be modified or terminated in the same manner as traditional easements. Yet conservation easements are in many ways unlike other easements. The beneficiary is usually the public, not merely a neighboring landowner, and the holder is always a nonprofit conservation organization or a government agency. Thus, there is a case to be made for adaptive protection. An overly narrow focus on perpetual property rights could actually thwart efforts to meet adaptation needs over the long term. We call for careful attention to ensuring conservation outcomes in dynamic landscapes over time.","[Owley, Jessica] SUNY Buffalo, Law Sch, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Cheever, Federico] Univ Denver, Sturm Coll Law, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Rissman, Adena R.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI USA; [Shaw, M.

The objective of the study was to determine the effect of drought stress on the vigor of naked and husked oat (Avena sativa L.) cultivars. The studies concerned eight naked oat cultivars and two husked oat cultivars characterized by high germination capacity (above 95%). Seeds of naked oat cultivars showed susceptibility to varied thermal conditions during drought simulated by the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) at a concentration of -1.5 MPa. An increase in temperature from 10 to 20 degrees C resulted in an average 37% increase in the number of normally germinating seeds, and in a more than 40% increase in germination rate, as well as in a 25% decrease in average germination time. A distinct increase in osmotic potential from -1 to -2 MPa during drought stress induction resulted in 15% decrease in vigor of husked cultivars measured by the percentage of normally developed seedlings. The vigor of oat cultivars, evaluated on the basis of electrical conductivity of exudates, was modified by genotypic variability. In naked cultivars, on average, 60% lower values were noted. The coefficients of correlation between electrical conductivity of exudates and germination capacity (r = -0.784**) or frequency of normally developed seedlings (r = -0.919**) confirm the highly significant interrelationship between the methods used for the evaluation of oat seeds under drought conditions.","[Zielinski, Andrzej; Mos, Maria; Wojtowicz, Tomasz] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Plant Breeding & Seed Sci, Lobzowska 24, PL-31140 Krakow, Poland",Agricultural University Krakow,"Zielinski, A (corresponding author), Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Plant Breeding & Seed Sci, Lobzowska 24, PL-31140 Krakow, Poland.",a.zielinski@ur.krakow.pl,"Wójtowicz, Tomasz/C-5833-2016; Zielinski, Andrzej/AAC-1314-2021","Wójtowicz, Tomasz/0000-0002-9703-3225; Zielinski, Andrzej/0000-0003-1844-5553",,,,,35,1,1,0,7,INST INVESTIGACIONES AGROPECUARIAS,CHILLAN,"CENTRO REGIONAL DE INVESTIGACION QUILAMAPU, CASILLA 426, CHILLAN, 00000, CHILE",0718-5839,,,CHIL J AGR RES,Chil.

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.

Over the last sixty years, and especially since 1990, a substantial portfolio of geoconservation sites, legislation, partnerships and initiatives has developed within the UK and internationally. This includes local, national and international geoconservation audits, suites of protected sites such as Local Geological Sites, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Global Geoparks and World Heritage Sites, geoconservation legislation, policies, frameworks and guidance, partnerships, groups, societies and associations, periodicals and magazines, regular conferences and examples of success in securing funding for a range of geoconservation activities. This portfolio is an extremely valuable resource for science and society, creating opportunities for research, education, training, and recreation and providing 'windows' through which to study and understand past environmental change and thus inform planning to accommodate future change. The current social, economic and environmental context means that the approach to geoconservation must evolve to embrace new challenges and opportunities including the ecosystem approach, adapting to climate change, increasing the relevance of geodiversity to local communities and operating in a financially constrained environment. The future of geoconservation will depend upon innovation and full engagement with new opportunities, but in so doing, it is essential to maintain and build upon, rather than cast aside, the existing hard-won portfolio of sites, legislation, partnerships and initiatives as it provides the foundation from which to build the future of geoconservation.

Climate change risk assessments provide a valuable tool to inform decision-making and adaptation planning through identifying and prioritising climate risks and/or opportunities. Using the first UK Climate Change Risk Assessment as an example, a marine climate change risk assessment was undertaken for the marine and coastal environment of the RSA for the first time. Through an extensive literature review and a workshop involving regional experts, marine and coastal climate change risks were identified, scored and prioritised. A total of 45 risks were identified, which spanned two key themes: 'Risks to Biodiversity' and `Risks to Economy and Society'. Of these, 13 were categorised as 'severe', including degradation of coral reefs and their associated ecological assemblages, shifts in the distribution of wild-capture fisheries resources, changes to phytoplankton primary productivity, impacts on coastal communities, threats to infrastructure and industries, and impacts on operations and safety in maritime transport. The diversity of risks identified and their transboundary nature highlight that climate change adaptation responses will require coordinated action and cooperation at multiple scales across the RSA. This risk assessment provides a crucial baseline for a largely overlooked geographic area, that can be used to underpin future decision-making and adaptation planning on climate change, and serve as a 'blueprint' for similar assessments for other regional shared seas.","[Maltby, K.

I use data on bank credit exposures to large versus small firms across 49 industries for the main banking groups operating in France, which I merge with information on industries' greenhouse gas emission intensities and a score for banks' self-reported climate-related commitments over 2010-2017. I find evidence that higher levels of self-reported climate commitments by banks are associated with a slower growth of lending to large firms in the five most carbon-intensive industries. However, lending to small and medium-sized enterprises across more or less carbon-intensive industries remains unrelated to banks' commitments to green their business. These findings suggest that devising an appropriate carbon reporting framework for small firms is likely to enhance the decarbonization of bank lending. Key policy insights Over 2010-2017, in France, banking groups that self-report to CDP as being more committed to climate change adaptation and mitigation tend to cut their lending relatively faster to domestic firms in the five most carbon-intensive industries. This pattern is entirely driven by the dynamics of banks' credit to large corporations, which in France are legally bound to regular carbon reporting. In contrast, banks' climate commitments do not seem to affect their lending to domestic small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs) in carbon-intensive industries. Overall, the results support recent calls for an extension of mandatory carbon disclosure regulations to SMEs.","[Mesonnier, Jean-Stephane] Banque France, Sci Po, Paris, France; [Mesonnier, Jean-Stephane] Fdn Risque, Chair Energy & Prosper, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Mesonnier, JS (corresponding author), Banque France, Sci Po, Paris, France.;Mesonnier, JS (corresponding author), Fdn Risque, Chair Energy & Prosper, Paris, France.",jean-stephane.mesonnier@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,17,3,3,10,38,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Furthermore, prominent areas of training needs on CSAI were identified which provided direction on areas of curriculum emphasis for in-service training on CSAI.Practical Implication: The recognition of the major areas of competency needs of extension agents on CSAI has far-reaching implications for curriculum innovation in developing trainings that will enhance their knowledge and capacity in the dissemination of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.Theoretical Implication: The study fills the lacuna of scarcity of empirical research studies documenting issues relating to the competence of extension agents on CSAI with particular focus on highlighting the areas of priority training needs especially in the region.Originality/Value: This paper is one of only a few to have pointed out areas of priority competency needs of extension agents on CSAI.

However, the benefits of these watershed development interventions for climate change adaptation are not well documented. This study, therefore, assesses the contributions of CBWD in reducing farmers' vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and variability in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. Data were collected from systematically selected 157 households using questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of questions on climate, ecosystem and households' livelihood capital. Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change Livelihood Vulnerability Index (IPCC-LVI) methods were used to generate vulnerability indices. Vulnerability indices computed for three conserved watersheds were compared with one non-conserved watershed using one-way ANOVA test. LVI score for ecosystem related indicators was significantly low for Adef Wuha compared to the non-conserved watershed. Similarly, LVI scores generated from agriculture, wealth and social indicators were low for Tija Baji and Guansa watersheds. On the other hand, the IPCC-LVI result did not show significant differences in exposure; however, sensitivity scores of conserved watersheds were significantly lower compared to the non-conserved. The adaptive capacities of two conserved watersheds (Guansa and Tija Baji) were also significantly lower as compared to the non-conserved. The overall (composite) vulnerability of watersheds generated from both methods (LVI and IPCC-LVI) showed that the conserved watersheds were less vulnerable to climate change compared to the non-conserved. The findings suggest that CBWD is an important strategy to reduce vulnerability of smallholder farmers to the ongoing and future climate change.","[Siraw, Zewdu; Bewket, Woldeamlak] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew] Debre Markos Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Debre Markos, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Siraw, Z (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",zewdusiraw@yahoo.com,"Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew/GRR-6199-2022","Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew/0000-0001-6316-7543",,,,,38,1,1,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,DEC 2,2018,23,12,,,,,1190,1206,,10.1080/13549839.2018.1541344,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2018.1541344,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,HA6PS,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000450402500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Combined effects of expected changes in climate and socio-economic factors on stormwater quality were examined in two urban test catchments by applying a source-based computer model (WinSLAMM) for TSS and three heavy metals (copper, lead, and zinc) for various future scenarios. Generally, both catchments showed similar responses to the future scenarios and pollutant loads were generally more sensitive to changes in socio-economic factors (i.e., increasing traffic intensities, growth and intensification of the individual land-uses) than in the climate. Specifically, for the selected Intermediate socio-economic scenario and two climate change scenarios (RSP = 2.6 and 8.5), the TSS loads from both catchments increased by about 10 % on average, but when applying the Intermediate climate change scenario (RCP = 4.5) for two SSPs, the Sustainability and Security scenarios (SSP1 and SSP3), the TSS loads increased on average by 70 %. Furthermore, it was observed that well-designed and maintained stormwater treatment facilities targeting local pollution hotspots exhibited the potential to significantly improve stormwater quality, however, at potentially high costs. In fact, it was possible to reduce pollutant loads from both catchments under the future Sustainability scenario (on average, e.g., TSS were reduced by 20 %), compared to the current conditions. The methodology developed in this study was found useful for planning climate change adaptation strategies in the context of local conditions.","[Borris, Matthias; Leonhardt, Gunther; Marsalek, Jiri; Osterlund, Helene; Viklander, Maria] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resourses Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden",Lulea University of Technology,"Borris, M (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resourses Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",matthias.borris@ltu.se,"Leonhardt, Günther/C-3766-2011","Leonhardt, Günther/0000-0003-0367-3449; Osterlund, Helene/0000-0002-4732-7348",DagNat; Swedish Water and Wastewater Association (Svenskt Vatten),DagNat; Swedish Water and Wastewater Association (Svenskt Vatten),"The authors thank Helen Galfi from Lulea University of Technology for providing runoff quality data for the two catchments studied.

The Australian population is particularly focused along the coastline, especially in metropolitan centres; however, the population of regional centres along the coast is increasing steadily in response to a phenomenon termed seachange. Coastal systems are increasingly threatened by potential impacts as a result of climate change, as indicated by the successive assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Although Australia played a central role in applying a common methodology (CM), developed from IPCC guidelines in the 1990s, and in devising alternative approaches, which were initially trialled at nine sites on the Australian coast, there has not been a nationally co-ordinated approach to assessing the coastal vulnerability of Australia, and such an approach is only emerging now. Instead, there have been a series of different approaches adopted to look at the different parts of the Australian coast, including wetland mapping in northern Australia; geomorphic unit mapping in South Australia; storm surge vulnerability modelling in Queensland; probabilistic approaches to beach erosion in New South Wales; indicative mapping of potential coastal retreat in Tasmania. Additionally, there have been methods proposed by insurers and coastal engineers to meet their requirements. Since 2005, the Australian government has once again seen the need for a national coastal vulnerability assessment, and a series of studies are planned or under way to achieve the aims of a National Climate Change Adaptation Framework.","[Harvey, Nick] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5400, Australia; [Woodroffe, Colin D.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Adelaide; University of Wollongong,"Harvey, N (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5400, Australia.",nick.harvey@adelaide.edu.au,"Woodroffe, Colin D/K-5222-2015; Woodroffe, Colin/F-2767-2012","Woodroffe, Colin D/0000-0003-4476-6158; ",,,,,81,50,53,2,69,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

This study aims to construct upland rice yield responses forecasting algebraic formulation code referred as YIELDCAST by using gene-expression programming (GEP) based on observed rainfall and temperatures data (1979-2011), and forcing with global climate model (GCM) downscaled outputs under CO2 emission scenarios SR-A1B, A2 and B1 (2012-2100) over Bobo-Dioulasso, a Sahelian region. Statistically, GEP is a capable tool to downscale climate variables in the region (R = 0.746-0.949), and construct reliable rice YIELDCAST tool (R = 0.930; MSE = 0.037 ton/ha; MAE = 0.155 ton/ha, RSE = 0.137 ton/ha). Yields forecasted (2012-2100) showed a noticeable statistically significant difference between scenarios; however, fluctuating with no substantial increase (average below 1.60 ton/ha); suggesting that the increase observed in temperatures and decrease in rains will either reduced or hindered yield to largely increase in Sahel. With no such YIELDCAST tool to support adaptation decision, Sahel will still be under the trap of the broad array of adaptation strategy, which is a trial and error, less specific and costly. The model can help anticipate adaptation decision support on-farm water management, shift to suitable planting periods, and use of improved drought resistant and short duration varieties adapted to a local weather pattern.","[Traore, Seydou; Fipps, Guy] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Scoates Hall,Room 322, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Zhang, Lei] North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Sch Water Conservancy, Zhengzhou 450045, Henan, Peoples R China; [Traore, Seydou] Global Dev & Innovat Serv, Largo, FL 33774 USA; [Guven, Aytac] Gaziantep Univ, Civil Engn Dept, Hydraul Div, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey; [Traore, Seydou] Metropolitan Solar Inc, Washington, DC 20032 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; North China University of Water Resources & Electric Power; Gaziantep University,"Traore, S (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Scoates Hall,Room 322, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.;Zhang, L (corresponding author), North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Sch Water Conservancy, Zhengzhou 450045, Henan, Peoples R China.",straore@metropolitansolarinc.com; zhanglei@ncwu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Lei/ACJ-3355-2022","Zhang, Lei/0000-0001-5803-8667",National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC 51909092],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 51909092).

In this context, narrative research is often seen as a qualitative social science method used to frame adaptation communication. However, this perspective neglects an important insight provided by narrative theory as applied in the cognitive sciences and other practical fields: human cognition is organized around specific narrative structures. In adaptation, this means that how we 'story' the environment determines how we understand and practice adaptation, how risks are defined, who is authorized as actors in the change debate, and the range of policy options considered. Furthermore, relating an experience through story-telling is already doing 'knowledge work', or learning. In taking narrative beyond its use as an extractive social research methodology, we argue that narrative research offers an innovative, holistic approach to a better understanding of socio-ecological systems and the improved, participatory design of local adaptation policies. Beyond producing data on local knowledge(s) and socio-cultural and affective-emotive factors influencing adaptive capacity, it can significantly inform public engagement, deliberation and learning strategies-features of systemic adaptive governance. We critically discuss narrative as both a self-reflective methodology and as a paradigmatic shift in future adaptation research and practice. We explore the narrative approach as a basis for participatory learning in the governance of socio-ecological systems. Finally, we assemble arguments for investing in alternative governance approaches consistent with a shift to a 'narrative paradigm'. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Pollard, CE",,,,"Pollard, Carol Elaine",,,Up close and personal The value of feedback in implementing an individual energy-saving adaptation,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Intervention; Sustainability; Technology; Adaptation; Feedback; Energy reduction,CLIMATE-CHANGE,"Purpose - The purpose of this research is to explore the drivers of computer-related sustainability behavior at a medium-sized US university and the extent to which an inexpensive energy-saving device installed on 146 administrator, faculty and general staff workstations achieved significant savings in kWh, CO2 kg and dollars. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed-method approach was used to collect qualitative and quantitative data to inform the study, and an intervention was introduced to raise awareness of energy-saving initiatives on a medium-sized university campus at an individual level. A simple computer energy efficiency device to measure the kWh, carbon emissions and monetary savings was installed on office workstations of 146 administrator, faculty and general staff. The research design enabled analysis of university mitigation strategies along with energy-saving behaviors, attitudes and savings in CO2 kg and dollars resulting from the installation of the adaptation intervention. Findings - Extrapolating individual workstation savings over the eight-week study period suggests potential annual average savings of $122,087.21; 1,327,003 kWh of energy; and 577,044 kg CO2. Usage behaviors and attitudes of study participants toward green practices in general and the specific energy-saving device showed participants hold highly positive attitudes toward both. Themes that captured participants' feeling toward the energy-saving device included: easy to use; enjoyment; feedback; habit and technical issues. Drivers that most highly motivated participants to save energy at work were participants' sense of social responsibility and the recognition of the need to reduce energy at work. Practical implications - The implementation of a voluntary individual-level energy-saving adaptation has the potential to be more far effective than expensive mandated strategies imposed on university employees and the value of feedback in positively influencing sustainability behavior. Originality/value - This study is one of the first to report on the implementation of a voluntary individual-level climate change adaptation intervention on a university campus. The research addresses concerns voiced in previous literature that higher education is not stepping up the critical role in climate adaptation required of it and contributes to the sustainability in higher education literature by providing empirical evidence of the usefulness of implementing a simple adaptation technique. Specifically, it documents how increasing sustainability awareness in university employees can encourage socially responsible and energy conversation behaviors and achieve significant energy savings in dollars, kWh and CO2 kg.","[Pollard, Carol Elaine] Appalachian State Univ, Comp Informat Syst, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Pollard, CE (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Comp Informat Syst, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",pollardce@appstate.edu,,,"University Research Council, Walker College of Business Dean's Council and Technology Support Services, Appalachian State University, Boone, NC, USA","University Research Council, Walker College of Business Dean's Council and Technology Support Services, Appalachian State University, Boone, NC, USA","This research was funded in part by the University Research Council, Walker College of Business Dean's Council and Technology Support Services, Appalachian State University, Boone, NC, USA.",,39,2,2,1,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1467-6370,1758-6739,,INT J SUST HIGHER ED,Int.

J,"Ziervogel, G; Enqvist, J; Metelerkamp, L; van Breda, J",,,,"Ziervogel, Gina; Enqvist, Johan; Metelerkamp, Luke; van Breda, John",,,Supporting transformative climate adaptation: community-level capacity building and knowledge co-creation in South Africa,CLIMATE POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Capacity building; transformative adaptation; transdisciplinary methods; adaptation policy; learning; community-level adaptation,,"Calls for transformative adaptation to climate change require attention to the type of capacity building that can support it. Community-level capacity building can help to ensure ownership and legitimacy of longer-term interventions. Given that marginalized communities are highly vulnerable to climate risk, it is important to build their capacity to adapt locally and to integrate their perspectives into higher-level adaptation measures. Current adaptation policy does not pay sufficient attention to this. Using a Cape Town-based project on water governance in low-income urban settlements, this paper explores how a transdisciplinary research project supported capacity building. Our findings suggest that knowledge co-creation at the community level is central to the capacity building that is needed in order to inform transformative adaptation. The collaborative methodology used is also important; we illustrate how a transdisciplinary approach can contribute to transformative adaptation where knowledge is co-produced to empower community-level actors and organizations to assert their perspectives with greater confidence and legitimacy. We argue that if capacity building processes shift from the top-down transferal of existing knowledge to the co-creation of contextual understandings, they have the potential to deliver more transformative adaptation. By considering diverse sources of knowledge and knowledge systems, capacity building can start to confront inequalities and shift dominant power dynamics. Adaptation policy could provide more guidance and support for community-level transdisciplinary processes that can enable this type of transformative adaptation. Key policy insights To address equity and justice issues as well as climate risk, adaptation policy needs to better support transformative adaptation. Community-level capacity building, called for by developing countries, will benefit from more attention to bottom-up approaches as a complement to top-down ones. Community-led research that draws on a diversity of knowledge systems can effectively inform the development of transformative adaptation interventions. Transdisciplinary research methods present a promising pedagogical approach to building transformative adaptation capacity. Adaptation policy for capacity building would benefit from a broader understanding of governance that includes local participation and values bottom-up contributions. A priority for capacity building is getting previously excluded actors a spot at the negotiating table as well as skills to substantiate their arguments.","[Ziervogel, Gina; Enqvist, Johan] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Ziervogel, Gina] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Cape Town, South Africa; [Enqvist, Johan] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Metelerkamp, Luke] Rhodes Univ, Environm Learning Res Ctr, Grahamstown, South Africa; [van Breda, John] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Complex Syst Transit, Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; Stockholm University; Rhodes University; Stellenbosch University,"Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Rondebosch, South Africa.;Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Cape Town, South Africa.",gina@csag.uct.ac.za,"Enqvist, Johan/ABG-4962-2021","Enqvist, Johan/0000-0002-6300-0572; Meteleramp, Luke/0000-0003-1407-7693",AXA Research Fund,AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund),This work was supported by AXA Research Fund.,,75,21,21,2,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

We adapt a concept from ruin theory, which is widely used in econometrics and the insurance industry, to design a growth-ruin model for trees which accounts for climate hazards that can jeopardize tree growth. This model is an elaboration of a classical Cramer-Lundberg ruin model that is used in the insurance industry. The model accounts for the interactions between physiological parameters of trees and the occurrence of climate hazards. The physiological parameters describe interannual growth rates and how trees react to hazards. The hazard parameters describe the probability distributions of the occurrence and intensity of climate events. We focus on a drought-heatwave hazard. The goal of the paper is to determine the dependence of the forest ruin and average growth probability distributions on physiological and hazard parameters. Using extensive Monte Carlo experiments, we show the existence of a threshold in the frequency of hazards beyond which forest ruin becomes certain to occur within a centennial horizon. We also detect a small effect of the strategies used to cope with hazards. This paper is a proof of concept for the quantification of forest collapse under climate change.","[Yiou, Pascal] IPSL, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, UMR 8212, CEA CNRS UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Paris Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Yiou, P (corresponding author), IPSL, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, UMR 8212, CEA CNRS UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",pascal.yiou@lsce.ipsl.fr,"viovy, nicolas/S-2631-2018","viovy, nicolas/0000-0002-9197-6417","European Research Council, FP7 Ideas: European Research Council [A2C2 (338965)]; French ANR [ANR-20-CE01-0008]","European Research Council, FP7 Ideas: European Research Council; French ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR))","This research has been supported by the European Research Council, FP7 Ideas: European Research Council (grant no.

Both articles seek to look at a familiar topic-the Paris Agreement and climate litigation-in new and fresh ways. This second article examines how the Paris Agreement is influencing fact-finding in administrative and judicial decision-making, transforming corporate governance to be better attuned to climate risk and contributing to a ripple effect in climate litigation. The article first considers how the Paris Agreement has altered the factual considerations of climate change by demonstrating global agreement on the causal link between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and the catastrophic consequences of climate change. Secondly, it illustrates how the Paris Agreement is affecting legal responsibilities by focusing on the influence of the Paris Agreement on corporate directors' duties.

China announced its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) at the Paris climate conference in 2015. The carbon cap-and-trade scheme, which plays a key role in carbon emissions abatement, is an effective policy for China to achieve its NDC. This study focuses on the allocation of regional and sectoral initial carbon emission allowances in Shanghai. An impact evaluation on the macro-economy, carbon trading markets and participating sectors for the year 2030 was conducted by applying a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The results show that the carbon cap-and-trade scheme would cause a 3.4% GDP loss and an 8.9% welfare loss in 2030. The carbon price would be 161.2 USDA and 147.2 USD/t under the two representative scenarios. The allocation of initial allowances would have a significant impact on both carbon market scale and sectoral trading behaviors. The power generation sector and the petrol oil sector would undertake the greatest output loss, while the metal smelting sector would become the main seller. Furthermore, the initial allowances allocation under a certain abatement target would hardly affect sectoral production but remarkably affect trade behaviors at the carbon trading markets.

In support of the European Union's Earth Observation Programmes Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the Quality Assurance for Essential Climate Variables (QA4ECV) project fulfilled a gap in the delivery of climate quality satellite-derived datasets, by prototyping a generic system for the implementation and evaluation of quality assurance (QA) measures for satellite-derived ECV climate data record products. The project demonstrated the QA system on six new long-term, climate quality ECV data records for surface albedo, leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and carbon monoxide (CO).

This move has great significance in Chinese history, and the reasons for it have aroused intense and long-lasting controversy. To explore the environmental factors underlying this event, this study focuses on the impact of natural disasters on Pingcheng in the fifth century based on continuous high-resolution paleoclimatic data combined with extensive historical records. It finds that Pingcheng experienced a significant decline in the late 470s CE as a result of continuous droughts and a low-temperature environment. Moreover, it is argued that the rapid growth of the population in Pingcheng might have increased its societal vulnerability to natural disasters. By comparing the food systems and geographical locations of Pingcheng and Luoyang, this study suggests that the relocation of the capital should be considered as an adaptation to climate change and a mitigation of its effects by the Northern Wei dynasty. In addition, the paper shows that other important cities along latitude 40 degrees N in East Asia also stopped growing during this period of rapid climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the effect of building the shared network of a rainwater harvesting system as an adaptation to climate change scenarios. The performance of a rain barrel network under three climate change scenarios and three global circulation models (GCM) is examined. A sample community composed of four prospective users with individual storage is tested with various forms of shared connections. Most importantly, the results show that the benefit from shared rain barrels greatly increases under the climate change conditions compared with the historical rainfall data. Especially, for high reliabilities, the results indicate that the benefit of a rain barrel network increases under future climate change scenarios, whereas it does not show apparent improvement for low reliabilities. However, the performance of a rain barrel network is highly dependent on location and climate change scenarios. In contrast, the GCM does not considerably affect the performance of the shared network.

Agriculture plays a dominant role in supporting rural livelihoods and economic growth over most of Africa. Three aspects of the vulnerability of food crop systems to climate change in Africa are discussed: the assessment of the sensitivity of crops to variability in climate, the adaptive capacity of farmers, and the role of institutions in adapting to climate change. The magnitude of projected impacts of climate change on food crops in Africa varies widely among different studies. These differences arise from the variety of climate and crop models used, and the different techniques used to match the scale of climate model output to that needed by crop models. Most studies show a negative impact of climate change on crop productivity in Africa. Farmers have proved highly adaptable in the past to short- and long-term variations in climate and in their environment. Key to the ability of farmers to adapt to climate variability and change will be access to relevant knowledge and information. It is important that governments put in place institutional and macro-economic conditions that support and facilitate adaptation and resilience to climate change at local, national and transnational level.","Univ Reading, Dept Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, NERC, Ctr Global Atmospher Modelling, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",University of Reading; Met Office - UK; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; NERC National Centre for Earth Observation; University of Reading,"Wheeler, T (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",t.r.wheeler@reading.ac.uk,"Challinor, Andrew/AAK-3023-2020; Challinor, Andrew J/C-4992-2008","Challinor, Andrew/0000-0002-8551-6617; Challinor, Andrew J/0000-0002-8551-6617",,,,,133,313,317,5,141,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In Solomon Islands, the tuna fisheries' SES provides food security, income, employment, and contributes significantly to the nation's economy. However, being at the frontline of climate change impacts, the fisheries' SES is under threat, and these impacts will compound existing challenges. We explore Solomon Islands' tuna fisheries' SES resilience and vulnerability with a focus on examining efforts towards coordination, cooperation, and collaboration within the fisheries and governance framework. The research reveals a 'Pacific-way' of building resilience through multiple scales of collaborative and cooperative governance. Regional level collaborative forums such as the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, national fisheries programmes setting up coordination and cooperative networks, and local cooperative and coordination efforts that carry out multiple functions also build tuna fisheries' SES resilience to climate change. Western technical and top-down approaches translate into social resilience when coupled with education and outreach and leveraged upon existing grass-roots collaborative and cooperative networks. These cross-scale linkages of collaboration and adaptation strategies form resilience across multiple scales of governance. However, it is important to have a deliberate multi-scalar climate change adaptation framework.","[Syddall, Victoria Margaret; Thrush, Simon] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Private Bag, Auckland 92019, New Zealand; [Fisher, Karen] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Private Bag, Auckland 92019, New Zealand",University of Auckland; University of Auckland,"Syddall, VM (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Private Bag, Auckland 92019, New Zealand.",victoria.jollands@auckland.ac.nz; k.fisher@auckland.ac.nz; simon.thrush@auckland.ac.nz,"Fisher, Karen/HJH-3615-2023","Fisher, Karen T/0000-0002-1774-4431; Syddall, Victoria/0000-0001-8939-1295",,,,,96,0,0,9,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,APR 15,2022,221,,,,,,,,106132,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106132,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106132,,MAR 2022,12,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,1C7BN,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000793269900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We evaluated the effects of leaf-to-fruit ratio and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) application on the accumulation of primary and secondary metabolites in berries, in order to optimise climate change adaptation strategies. Methods and Results A range of leaf-to-fruit ratios (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 leaves per bunch) and exogenous ABA (400 mg/L) applied to Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon fruiting-cuttings in a greenhouse prior to veraison were evaluated over six consecutive growing seasons (2013-2018). Reducing the leaf-to-fruit ratio decreased berry sugar and anthocyanin concentration, slightly increased total organic acids, and modified the composition of free amino acids. Exogenous ABA significantly enhanced sugar and anthocyanin concentration and partially restored the balance of sugar and anthocyanins under a low leaf-to-fruit ratio, without altering free amino acid concentration or sugar to acids ratios. Conclusions Combining manipulation of the leaf-to-fruit ratio with application of exogenous ABA offers a potential method to reduce berry sugar concentration, while maintaining anthocyanin concentration. Significance of the Study This study paves the way for possible adaptation strategies for viticulture to global climate change.","[Wang, L.; Brouard, E.; Hilbert, G.; Renaud, C.; Petit, J.

In this paper we identify the short-run impacts of storms and floods on firm growth in labor, capital, and sales, using Enterprise Census data (2000-2014) for Vietnam. We define storms and floods with three different disaster measures: physical intensities, number of deaths, and economic damage. The performance of these disaster measures is compared by estimating dynamic growth models using the Blundell-Bond system generalized method of moments. We find evidence that flooding increases labor growth and capital growth but reduces sales growth significantly up to 3 years after flooding. We also find some evidence of positive impacts on labor growth and capital growth but mostly negative impacts on sales growth for storms within 3 years after storms strike. The impacts of floods and storms on firm growth are more pronounced and persistent for small and medium sized firms. Finally, unlike at the macro level, the direction and scale of disaster impacts found at the firm level are fairly consistent across the three disaster measures.","[Zhou, Fujin; Botzen, Wouter] Vrije Univ, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Dept Environm Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Botzen, Wouter] Univ Utrecht, Utrectht Univ Sch Econ USE, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Botzen, Wouter] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Risk Management & Decis Proc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Utrecht University; University of Pennsylvania,"Zhou, FJ (corresponding author), Vrije Univ, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Dept Environm Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",fujin.zhou@vu.nl; wouter.botzen@vu.nl,"; Botzen, Wouter/L-3123-2013","ZHOU, FUJIN/0000-0001-6043-5805; Botzen, Wouter/0000-0002-8563-4963",,,,,93,3,3,6,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Ghana's coastal lagoons provide unique ecosystem services. However, they are highly fragile and vulnerable to natural processes and anthropogenic activities. Climate Change impacts, such as increased temperatures, sea-level rise, storm surge and increased precipitation are likely to have ecological damage to lagoon ecosystems as a result of erosion, submergence of lagoon barriers, flooding and drying of the surrounding wetlands. Field observation, Geographic Information System modeling were among the methodology applied. The paper identified that anthropogenic activities and Climate Change would combine to have a serious future impact on lagoon ecosystems. Particularly, increased rainfall-induced flooding from the hinterland may be very injurious to the lagoon ecosystem, since the flood water may carry not only nutrients but also various contaminants and solid plastic waste generated by human activities around lagoons catchment into the lagoon channels. Besides, due to the barriers across most lagoon inlets, such polluted runoff water may not be able to flush out to sea, thus impacting negatively on the water quality of the lagoons. The paper proposes some adaptation strategies and recommends the early implementation of Climate Change adaptation strategies, coastal lagoon management measures to prevent potential future destructive impacts.","[Boateng, Isaac] Univ Educ, Dept Construct & Wood, Winneba, Ghana; [Mitchell, Steve; Couceiro, Fay] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Civil Engn & Surveying, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Failler, Pierre] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth, Hants, England",University of Portsmouth; University of Portsmouth,"Boateng, I (corresponding author), Univ Educ Winneba, Dept Construct & Wood, Winneba, Ghana.",isaac.boateng@uew.edu.gh,"Boateng, Isaac/AFL-3730-2022","Boateng, Isaac/0000-0002-2203-4688; Couceiro, Fay/0000-0001-5437-9106; failler, pierre/0000-0002-9225-9399; Mitchell, Steve/0000-0002-7302-5845","University of Portsmouth, UK","University of Portsmouth, UK","This research project was funded by the Research Development Fund of the University of Portsmouth, UK.",,48,3,3,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0892-0753,1521-0421,,COAST MANAGE,Coast.

Under such circumstances, water reuse has the potential to address these challenges but only under a favourable policy environment. In this paper, policy documents were considered as the ethnographic object to understand how people talk about water reuse in Kenya through policies, plans, regulations and guidelines. Using a general inductive approach to content analysis, the findings suggest that Kenya's policy on water reuse has progressed, especially in the recognition of the potential of reused water for addressing water scarcity, pollution, cleaner industrial production, food production, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. While many of the water reuse issues have been discussed under water and irrigation, environment and industrialization, other key sectors such as food and agriculture, housing, urban development and health remain silent on water reuse. Therefore, there is a need to take water reuse conversations beyond the water, environment, and industrialisation sectors if we are to address the water supply and wastewater management issues. Likewise, the study reminds us of the importance of foregrounding public perception and harmonized institutional arrangements in the success of water reuse in the country.","[Wakhungu, M.

To protect biological diversity in the long term, nature conservationists must include potential climate change impacts in their management decisions. In order to incorporate effective climate change adaption strategies in the management of protected areas, potential threats of climate change need to be identified. In this study, climate model projections have been evaluated to derive information about the future exposure of nature parks to climate change. Indicators reflecting climate boundary conditions were selected in a cooperative process, considering both scientifically reliable climate scenario analysis and the requirements of park managers. The evaluation exhibits large uncertainties depending on the indicator. While for temperature, a warming trend is projected for all the regions, future projections for precipitation show the largest inter-model uncertainties. The Climatic Water Balance reflects the potential water availability and aids clarification to stakeholders, as it incorporates the temperature trend. The analysis robustly indicates a prolongation for the climatic growing season. The main challenges related to climate model information for decision-making are the uncertainties, different scales of climate and ecosystem processes and the finding of a common communication level for knowledge transfer.

Cities in low- and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Urbanization is both a cause of and potential solution to global climate change. Most population growth in the foreseeable future will occur in urban areas primarily in developing countries. How this growth is managed has enormous implications for climate change given the increasing concentration and magnitude of economic production in urban localities, as well as the higher consumption practices of urbanites, especially the middle classes, compared to rural populations. There is still much to learn about the extent to which climate change affects urban health equity and what can be done effectively in different socio-political and socio-economic contexts to improve the health of urban dwelling humans and the environment. But it is clear that equity-oriented climate change adaptation means attention to the social conditions in which urban populations live-this is not just a climate change policy issue, it requires inter-sectoral action. Policies and programs in urban planning and design, workplace health and safety, and urban agriculture can help mitigate further climate change and adapt to existing climate change.

Cognitive sciences recognize that affect and emotion play a critical role in human decision-making. This article describes how aesthetic experiences could affect decisions that support or undermine ecological health. While the wellbeing benefits of pleasant landscape experiences have been demonstrated empirically, aesthetic experiences may or may not promote ecological health. The question of how to better align the two remains under debate and investigation. Building on the concept of cultural sustainability, this article elucidates how aesthetic experiences can be used in design tactics to encourage societal acceptance for highly functioning ecosystems that otherwise may be destroyed or resisted for their unappealing or unfamiliar appearance. With examples from China and the United States, this article illuminates how fine-scale, immediately noticeable landscape characteristics, such as cues to care, can change perceptual and affective responses to promote ecological health. This article invites readers to reflect on what role aesthetic experiences may play in conserving, restoring, and creating ecologically sound landscapes as we face new challenges in the urban era of climate change, and how design can help construct aesthetic experiences with immediately noticeable landscape characteristics.","[Li Jiayang; Nassauer, Joan Iverson] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Li, JY (corresponding author), 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jiayang@umich.edu,,,,,,,49,1,1,7,19,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2096-336X,2095-5413,,LANDSC ARCHIT FRONT,Landsc.

Conventionally, trend analysis comprises testing the null hypothesis H-0 (no trend) by applying the Mann-Kendall or Spearman's rho test to the entire time series. This leads to lack of information about hidden short-durational increasing or decreasing trends (hereinafter called sub-trends) in the data. Furthermore, common trend tests are purely statistical in nature and their results can be meaningless sometimes, especially when not supported by graphical exploration of changes in the data. This paper presents a graphical-statistical methodology to identify and separately analyze sub-trends for supporting attribution of hydrological changes. The method is based on cumulative sum of differences between exceedance and non-exceedance counts of data points. Through the method, it is possible to appreciate that climate variability comprises large-scale random fluctuations in terms of rising and falling hydro-climatic sub-trends which can be associated with certain attributes. Illustration on how to apply the introduced methodology was made using data over the White Nile region in Africa.

To face the existing challenges in mitigation and adaptation to climate change, Catalonia has, in recent years, increased its degree of involvement until it has different instruments and standards, among which we highlight Law 16/2017, August 1, climate change. The approval of this Law, a pioneer in Spain, represents a great advance becoming the backbone of Catalonia's public policies in this area. On this standard, the mitigation and adaptation objectives are identified first; second, the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions that are defined as their own; and finally, adaptation mechanisms to climate change, with special reference to planning and programming instruments. But this global analysis of the norm is formulated in the light of the recent Judgment of the Constitutional Court 87/2019, of June 20, 2019, which declares a series of articles, sections or subsections of the aforementioned Law and others unconstitutional and null and void. does not declare them unconstitutional provided that they are interpreted in the terms established, which may lead to a setback in the fight against climate change, thus limiting the actions of autonomous public authorities.","[Rodriguez Beas, Marina] Univ Rovira & Virgili, ANECA, Derecho Adm, Tarragona, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Beas, MR (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, ANECA, Derecho Adm, Tarragona, Spain.",marina.rodriguez@urv.cat,"Rodríguez, Marina/ABG-7571-2020",,,,,,38,1,1,0,1,EDITORA FORUM,MINAS GERAIS,"AV AFONSO PENA 2770, 15-16 ANDAR, BAIRRO FUNCIONARIOS, BELO HORIZONTE, MINAS GERAIS, 00000, BRAZIL",1516-3210,1984-4182,,A C-REV DIREITO ADM,A C-Rev.

High air temperature greatly affects human thermal comfort and public health, particularly in urban areas. Therefore, the challenging task of, urban designers and urban planners in accommodating the increasing population is to make cities with the least level of vulnerability to future climate change. Interest in transferring urban climatic knowledge into urban planning practices, and developing mitigation strategies to adapt to climate change, has been increased in recent years. The use of vegetation and appropriate urban geometry are shown very promising in mitigating the adverse effects of heat island and providing a better pedestrian thermal comfort. This article reviews studies on pedestrian level urban greening and geometry in improving thermal comfort in cities. Such strategies can be applied at the preliminary stages of urban planning and thus directly affect the microclimate. The analyzed data include simulation and field measurement studies. The discussion of this research clearly reflects how urban design guidelines can be applied to enhance outdoor thermal comfort and minimize the heat island effect. This study is helpful in controlling the consequences of city design from the early design stage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The freshwater system on land, particularly runoff, has so far been of relatively low priority in global climate models, despite the societal and ecosystem importance of freshwater changes, and the science and policy needs for such model output on drainage basin scales. Here we investigate the implications of CMIP5 multimodel ensemble output data for the freshwater system across a set of drainage basins in the Northern Hemisphere. Results of individual models vary widely, with even ensemble mean results differing greatly from observations and implying unrealistic long-term systematic changes in water storage and level within entire basins. The CMIP5 projections of basin-scale freshwater fluxes differ considerably more from observations and among models for the warm temperate study basins than for the Arctic and cold temperate study basins. In general, the results call for concerted research efforts and model developments for improving the understanding and modeling of the freshwater system and its change drivers. Specifically, more attention to basin-scale water flux analyses should be a priority for climate model development, and an important focus for relevant model-based advice for adaptation to climate change.","[Bring, Arvid; Asokan, Shilpa M.; Jaramillo, Fernando; Jarsjoe, Jerker; Levi, Lea; Pietron, Jan; Prieto, Carmen; Rogberg, Peter; Destouni, Georgia] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bring, Arvid; Asokan, Shilpa M.; Jaramillo, Fernando; Jarsjoe, Jerker; Levi, Lea; Pietron, Jan; Prieto, Carmen; Rogberg, Peter; Destouni, Georgia] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bring, Arvid] Univ New Hampshire, Water Syst Anal Grp, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Asokan, Shilpa M.; Prieto, Carmen; Destouni, Georgia] NEO, Messinia, Greece; [Levi, Lea] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Land & Water Resources Engn, Stockholm, Sweden; [Levi, Lea] Univ Split, Fac Civil Engn Architecture & Geodesy, Dept Appl Hydraul, Split, Croatia",Stockholm University; Stockholm University; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Royal Institute of Technology; University of Split,"Bring, A (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",arvid.bring@unh.edu,"Destouni, Georgia/AAS-5375-2020; Destouni, Georgia/M-9662-2016; Jaramillo, Fernando/T-4713-2017","Destouni, Georgia/0000-0001-9408-4425; Destouni, Georgia/0000-0001-9408-4425; Jaramillo, Fernando/0000-0002-6769-0136; Pietron, Jan/0000-0001-5059-0326; Muliyil Asokan, Shilpa/0000-0001-9842-0094",Swedish Research Council (VR) [2009-3221]; strategic environmental research project EkoKlim at Stockholm University; Nova RD project KLIV,Swedish Research Council (VR)(Swedish Research Council); strategic environmental research project EkoKlim at Stockholm University; Nova RD project KLIV,"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modeling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Table S1 of this paper) for producing and making available their model output.

Yet, ecosystem services-based policies and analyses are increasingly criticized for failing to connect with, or even for restricting, development outcomes. This article seeks to connect environmental analysis with development outcomes better by applying the capability approach of Amartya Sen and others. It demonstrates how scientific analysis of ecosystem services sometimes conflates pathways of ecosystem management with development outcomes, but that it can be reconfigured to include more diverse values and objectives. The article argues that ecosystem services should be identified more as functionings' (in the Senian sense of valued development outcomes) rather than functions' (in the sense of biophysical, apolitical ecosystem properties) in order to indicate that services' always reflect social values, and that values and scientific explanations of underlying biophysical properties evolve together. Environmental science for socially valued outcomes such as ecosystem services is therefore an important site of political inclusion and exclusion. The article illustrates this analysis with examples of ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change from the World Bank and government of Bangladesh, and in contrast to differing approaches from the field of sustainability science.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Dev, Environm & Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Forsyth, T (corresponding author), Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Dev, Environm & Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",t.j.forsyth@lse.ac.uk,"Forsyth, Tim/K-1044-2019","Forsyth, Tim/0000-0001-7227-9475",,,,,96,17,18,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-155X,1467-7660,,DEV CHANGE,Dev.

Operators increasingly take tourists to destinations threatened by climate change, with Antarctica and other polar regions as favourites and cruise ship and aircraft as main transport modes. The selling point is to see a destination before it disappears, a form of last chance tourism. This has been claimed to increase the environmental awareness of tourists and make them oambassadorso for conservation and the visited destination. Antarctic cruise ship passengers tripled from 2000 to 2007. The paper finds that high levels of greenhouse gas emissions are created by cruise ship tourists in general, and especially high levels for those visiting the Antarctic, up to approximately eight times higher per capita and per day than average international tourism trips. A survey found no evidence for the hypothesis that the trips develop greater environmental awareness, change attitudes or encourage more sustainable future travel choices. Of the Antarctic cruise passengers surveyed, 59% felt that their travel did not impact on climate change; fewer than 7% had or might offset their emissions. Alternative opportunities for visitation to glacial/polar destinations that comply with the desire to reduce future emissions are discussed.","[Eijgelaar, Eke; Thaper, Carla; Peeters, Paul] NHTV Breda Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Sustainable Tourism & Transport, Breda, Netherlands",Breda University of Applied Sciences,"Eijgelaar, E (corresponding author), NHTV Breda Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Sustainable Tourism & Transport, Breda, Netherlands.",eijgelaar.e@nhtv.nl,"Peeters, Paul/E-5705-2019","Peeters, Paul/0000-0002-2498-0635",,,,,111,164,174,6,86,CHANNEL VIEW PUBLICATIONS,CLEVEDON,"FRANKFURT LODGE, CLEVEDON HALL, VICTORIA ROAD, CLEVEDON, BS21 7HH, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

Seed fairs, organised by local communities with support from external NGOs, are found to be a more cost-effective mechanism for rapid seed distribution to the neediest sections of society than conventional, commercial channels. The latter wrongly assume that in periods of emergency local seed varieties are unavailable, when the key issue is of securing access.

Climate change adaptation activities predominantly require an understanding of the range of impacts on the water resource. In this study, we assessed climate change impacts on the Blue Nile River using 30-year in situ climate data (1981-2010) and five bias-corrected General Circulation Models (GCMs) for future (2026-2045) climate projections of RCP8.5. Both historical and GCM precipitation projections show inter-annual and spatial variability, with the most significant increases in the rainy season and a significant decrease in the dry season. The results suggest the probability of an increase in total precipitation. The intensity and frequency of future extreme rainfall events will also increase. Moreover, the hydrological model simulation results show a likely increase in total river flow, peak discharges, flood inundation, and evapotranspiration that will lead to a higher risk of floods and droughts in the future. These results suggest that the operation of water storage systems (e.g., the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam) should be optimized for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and irrigation management in addition to their intended purposes in the Nile basin.","[Tedla, Mihretab G.; Rasmy, Mohamed; Tamakawa, Katsunori; Selvarajah, Hemakanth; Koike, Toshio] UNESCO ICHARM, Int Ctr Water Hazard & Risk Management, 1-6 Minamihara, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058516, Japan; [Tedla, Mihretab G.; Rasmy, Mohamed; Tamakawa, Katsunori; Selvarajah, Hemakanth; Koike, Toshio] Publ Works Res Inst PWRI, 1-6 Minamihara, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058516, Japan; [Tedla, Mihretab G.; Rasmy, Mohamed; Selvarajah, Hemakanth; Koike, Toshio] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",PWRI: Public Works Research Institute; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Tedla, MG (corresponding author), UNESCO ICHARM, Int Ctr Water Hazard & Risk Management, 1-6 Minamihara, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058516, Japan.;Tedla, MG (corresponding author), Publ Works Res Inst PWRI, 1-6 Minamihara, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058516, Japan.;Tedla, MG (corresponding author), Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",mihretab@icharm.org,,"Tedla, Mihretab G./0000-0002-2471-795X","Public Work Research Institute (PWRI), Japan; MEXT, Japan; Ministry of Water and Energy; Nile Basin Initiative","Public Work Research Institute (PWRI), Japan; MEXT, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Ministry of Water and Energy; Nile Basin Initiative","This research is supported by the Public Work Research Institute (PWRI), Japan.

NBS seek to make use of local natural elements and processes in coastal ecosystems, as much as possible, to harness forces of nature for the benefit of society. We focus on soft sedimentary coasts, like beaches and dunes, salt marshes, seagrass beds and mangroves. By shifting coastal management from conventional 'Building in Nature' to 'Building with Nature', NBS can be seen as a valuable alternative to the traditional approach, which is based on hydraulic, civil engineered designs. NBS can be applied in diverse situations and at various scales, from small-scale (ecosystem elements, a small pond) to large-scale (entire coastal stretches). The practice of NBS is also valuable for climate change adaptation, when forces of nature will increase. NBS requires a governance setting that makes use of an integrated approach with disciplines of ecology, economy and society working together. But integration is not yet common practise in many countries. We conclude that NBS are a promising alternative to the traditional approach. Because the practise still is relatively young, more field and laboratory projects should be executed, in particular under extreme weather conditions.

Therefore, new tools are required to support adaptive reuse towards the conservation of industrial facilities, in order to leave testament of their cultural and industrial heritage once their production activities cease to exist. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) can help analyse complex interactions between industrial elements, society, culture and nature, providing key benefits when approaching heritage investigations. In this context, this research concerned the design of a Multi-Expert MCDA (ME-MCDA) methodology to support the selection of paramount heritage elements in power plants based on the collection and processing of the views of a panel of experts to result in consensus groups. This approach was tested using a case study in the As Pontes power plant (NW Spain), which will be dismantled in a near future. The results achieved pointed out to cooling towers, boilers, chimney and turbine hall as the fundamental elements to preserve due to their relevance across a set of technical, historical and sociocultural criteria.

In Greece-a homeland of important historical and cultural resources-archaeological sites are vulnerable to climate change-related flood events. In order to investigate the flood risk of the archaeological site of Ancient Messene under different climate change projections, a physically-based hydrological model was implemented and six climate change scenarios were examined. Additionally, the effectiveness of a soft structural nature-based solution adaption plan was evaluated. Based on the results, the archaeological site of Ancient Messene is shielded against small or larger flood events and only in case of extreme precipitation events is the area likely to be at risk. This flood risk can be further eliminated after implementing the soft structural nature-based solution adaptation plan proposed. Nature-based solutions provide a cost-effective alternative approach for flood risk reduction and climate change adaptation, with minimum possible disturbance, while hydrological modeling, even in case of data scarcity, constitute a valuable tool for flood risk estimation and adaptation plan management. Nature-based solutions seems to be most effective against small or medium precipitation events, and to limit the damages of extreme events. Their benefits for flood adaptation should not be underestimated.","[Mentzafou, Angeliki; Dimitriou, Elias] Hellen Ctr Marine Res HCMR, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Anavyssos 19013, Greece",Hellenic Centre for Marine Research,"Mentzafou, A (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res HCMR, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Anavyssos 19013, Greece.",angment@hcmr.gr; elias@hcmr.gr,"Dimitriou, Elias/H-4237-2011","Dimitriou, Elias/0000-0001-6669-6897; Mentzafou, Angeliki/0000-0002-1427-2299", [LIFE17 IPC/GR/000006],,"This study was conducted under the project LIFE-IP AdaptInGR-Boosting the implementation of adaptation policy across Greece LIFE17 IPC/GR/000006, deliverable Sub-Action C.4.2: Development of pilot assessments and adaptation guidelines for cultural heritage.

Overall, SIDS were considered unsustainable if they failed at least two of three sectors. Projected water sustainability for 2050 was based on population growth and climate change effects on precipitation and per capita water availability. All SIDS failed the food sector, and four failed the energy sector. Water was considered the ultimate control for long-term sustainability. Five SIDS currently fail the water sector, but all but the largest two SIDS are likely to fail this sector by 2050.

Worldwide, the national coastal strategies mainly focusing on the three coastal adaptation approaches issued by the International Panel of Climate Change (retreat, accommodation, and protection). The developed and developing countries are being made serious efforts to adapt to the SLR. This paper investigates the Egyptian efforts, best practices, and experiences in dealing with coastal erosion, flooding, and inundation-based SLR. The Egyptian national strategy for coastal adaptation mainly adopted the protection approach. Along the Nile Delta coast of Egypt, various national projects contain coastal adaptation measures were detected, such as seawalls, revetments, sand dunes, nourishment, and artificial sand dunes based on a geotextile sand-tube core using natural reed mats for sand trapping. In addition, different actions such as constructing modern fish farming, regular dredging for coastal lakes and lagoons, and enforcing the coastal road were observed. All provide defense systems. Most of these promising adaptation technologies, efforts, and actions show favorable responses to guarantee adequate protection against SLR hazards.","[Sharaan, Mahmoud] Egypt Japan Univ Sci & Technol, Environm Engn Dept, Alexandria 21934, Egypt; [Sharaan, Mahmoud] Suez Canal Univ, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Ismailia, Egypt; [Iskander, Moheb] Coastal Res Inst, Hydrodynam Dept, Alexandria, Egypt; [Udo, Keiko] Tohoku Univ, Int Res Inst Disaster Sci, Sendai, Japan",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Egypt-Japan University of Science & Technology; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Suez Canal University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); National Water Research Center; Coastal Research Institute; Tohoku University,"Sharaan, M (corresponding author), Egypt Japan Univ Sci & Technol, Environm Engn Dept, Alexandria 21934, Egypt.",mahmoud.sharaan@ejust.edu.eg; coastal_alex@yahoo.com; Keiko.udo.c1@tohoku.ac.jp,"Sharaan, Mahmoud/V-8550-2019; Udo, Keiko/AAN-1610-2021","Sharaan, Mahmoud/0000-0002-9643-449X; Udo, Keiko/0000-0003-0293-1354","Coastal Research Institute, National Water Research Center, Egypt","Coastal Research Institute, National Water Research Center, Egypt","Acknowledgments Thanks to Coastal Research Institute, National Water Research Center, Egypt, for technical support.

In the EU, regulation of these is governed by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Floods Directive, but national implementation varies and is often supplemented with local non-legislative guidelines. By reviewing trends and discrepancies in the Danish regulation practice for separated stormwater discharges, this article investigates how the directives are put into effect. A legislative gap for separate stormwater discharges introduces uncertainty in the discharge permit conditions, which especially affect conditions targeting water quality. We point to several topics to be addressed, e.g., the level at which the regulation of separate stormwater discharges takes place, opportunities for coordination with flood risk and climate change adaptation initiatives, as well as uncertainties regarding the application of Best Available Techniques. Working with these issues would elevate the regulation practice and aid regulators in reaching a more holistic and consistent approach, thus improving chances of reaching the desired recipient status before or after the WFD deadline in 2027. This could be undertaken at river basin, river basin district or national level, but there is also potential for harvesting mutual benefits by addressing these challenges internationally.","[Jensen, Ditte M.

This study intends to explore the livelihood resilience of vulnerable char dwellers by employing Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis (RIMA) model. Survey data were obtained from 374 char households using semi-structured questionnaire to know their resilience capacities (adaptive, absorptive and transformative capacity). This study reveals that char dwellers have a poor level of resilience which made them unable to withstand against any adverse effect of natural disasters. Char dwellers however, residing near to the mainland area displayed relatively more resilience (0.353) than that of the distant char areas (0.347). The major limiting factors of livelihood resilience in the char areas include access to food, income and health facilities, agricultural and non-agricultural assets, and adoption of technology which need to be improved for the survival of the char dwellers.

The aim is to investigate the potential for integrating community perspectives into policy and project development and implementation. Data collected through mixed-methods (policy analysis, semi-structured interviews, participatory site visits and focus groups) are analysed using thematic analysis. We find that while the projects investigated have potential to deliver triple wins, siloed approaches presently hinder effective implementation. In particular, project focus on job creation hampers the achievement of longer-term mitigation and adaptation benefits. Operational flexibility, long-term goals, multi-sectoral cooperation and enabling frameworks are imperative to the achievement of triple wins. Findings provide valuable lessons that can be applied across sub-Saharan Africa towards achieving triple wins in climate and development policy and practice, especially those developed with job creation and ecological restoration aims.","[Favretto, Nicola; Dougill, Andrew J.; Stringer, Lindsay C.; Quinn, Claire H.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Afionis, Stavros] Keele Univ, Sch Polit Philosophy Int Relat & Environm, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England",University of Leeds; Keele University,"Favretto, N (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",n.favretto@leeds.ac.uk; a.j.dougill@leeds.ac.uk; l.stringer@leeds.ac.uk; s.afionis@keele.ac.uk; c.h.quinn@leeds.ac.uk,"Quinn, Claire/AAU-8184-2020; Afionis, Stavros/AES-5062-2022","Favretto, Nicola/0000-0002-2100-6706; Afionis, Stavros/0000-0002-0434-5108; Quinn, Claire/0000-0002-2085-0446",Economic and Social Research Council's Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP) [ES/K006576/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council's Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council's Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP), Grant number: ES/K006576/1.

Through an iterative process, traditionally distinct top-down and bottom-up approaches to decision-making are merged to improve resilience and sustainability of adaptation plans. The approach helps to broaden the understanding of both scientists and community members on the implications of climate change at the local level. Methods are highlighted within one pilot community, Huai Kang Pla, Thailand, with the primary goal of exemplifying the process, and, secondarily, to evaluate its validity in the context particular to this site. The results indicate that community members initially were most concerned with shorter term, atypical events such as irregular rainfall pattern during the growing season and/or periods of extreme temperature that intensify the annual drought. They were less troubled by other parameters that scientists had identified as additionally important, such as the more progressive, longer term shifts in average temperature and rainfall totals. Scientists defined key climate-related terms such as drought and irregular rainfall differently from community members; the distinctions around these differences were important to identify early in the process so that integration of information from the two groups could be more effective.","[Gustafson, Shelley; Hartman, Paul] DAI, 7600 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 200, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Cadena, Angela Joehl] IUCN, Asia Reg Off, 63 Sukhumvit Soi 39, Bangkok 10110, Thailand",,"Gustafson, S (corresponding author), DAI, 7600 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 200, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",gustafsonshelley@gmail.com,,,United States Agency for International Development [AID-486-C-11-00004],United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),This work was supported by the United States Agency for International Development [AID-486-C-11-00004].,,23,7,7,1,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Useful practical and theoretical work is being undertaken to better understand the role of reflexive learning in bringing together different knowledge to address complex problems like climate change. Through a review of practical cases and learning theories commonly used in the areas of resilience, climate change adaptation and environmental management, this article: (i) reviews the theories that have shaped approaches to reflexive learning in large, highly-distributed climate change and resilience-building programmes for development; and (ii) conducts a comparative learning review of key challenges and lessons emerging from early efforts to promote and integrate reflexive learning processes in programmes of this nature. Using a case study approach, the authors focus on early efforts made in four large, inter-related (or nested) programmes to establish, integrate and sustain learning processes and systems. Eight themes emerged from the review and are considered from the perspective of learning programmes as emergent communities of practice. By investigating how these themes play out in the nested programming, the paper contributes to the limited existing body of evidence on learning in large climate change programmes and identifies areas where future efforts might focus.","[Harvey, Blane; Pasanen, Tiina] Overseas Dev Inst, London SE1 8NJ, England; [Pollard, Alison] United Kingdom Dept Int Dev DFID, London SW1A 2EG, England; [Raybould, Julia] United Kingdom Dept Business Energy & Ind Strateg, London SW1A 2AW, England; [Harvey, Blane] McGill Univ, Dept Integrated Studies Educ, Montreal, PQ H3A 1Y2, Canada",McGill University,"Harvey, B (corresponding author), Overseas Dev Inst, London SE1 8NJ, England.;Harvey, B (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Integrated Studies Educ, Montreal, PQ H3A 1Y2, Canada.",b.harvey@odi.org.uk; t.pasanen@odi.org.uk; Alison-Pollard@dfid.gov.uk; julia.raybould@beis.gov.uk,,"Harvey, Blane/0000-0002-6626-4290; Pasanen, Tiina/0000-0002-5502-9930",Overseas Development Institute's Research and Innovation Fund; Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia,Overseas Development Institute's Research and Innovation Fund; Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia,"Funding for Blane Harvey and Tiina Pasanen's contributions to this paper was provided through the Overseas Development Institute's Research and Innovation Fund.

There has been little work done to reconcile these drivers of water stress in the Himalayas. This paper evaluates how climate change may affect water availability in two Nepalese mountain communities, Panglin and Tallo Lorpa, and assesses whether these changes drive vulnerability to water stress. First, estimates of hydrological change are made based on climate model output and hydroclimatological theory. Household surveys, focus group discussions and participatory rural appraisal techniques are used to assess vulnerability and adaptive capacity in each community. Finally, the expected effects of climate change on water availability are linked to findings on the communities' vulnerability to these changes. The results show that both communities are vulnerable to changes in water availability under climate change, but this vulnerability is small in comparison to adaptation opportunities. However, the ability to appropriate benefits from these opportunities is constrained, and it is the extent of this inhibition that determines vulnerability. These findings demonstrate that Malthusian interpretations may be inappropriate in the Himalayas, and highlight the importance of the constraints to climate change adaptation.","[Gawith, David] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [Hill, Douglas; Kingston, Daniel] Univ Otago, Dept Geog, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Cambridge; University of Otago,"Gawith, D (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England.",dwdg2@cam.ac.uk,"Kingston, Daniel/ABC-2010-2021",,University of Otago; Ron Lister Trust; Department of Geography at the University of Otago,University of Otago; Ron Lister Trust; Department of Geography at the University of Otago,The research was funded by the University of Otago through a University of Otago Masters Research Award.

They also contain important stores of information in their sediments which are increasingly being used to improve conservation and environmental management outcomes. We describe how palaeoecology can inform understanding of longer-term processes in wetland environments and examples of where it has contributed directly to site-based conservation decisions for wetlands in the UK. Palaeoecological science is being used in partnerships between some scientists and wetland managers, yet there is scope for broadening its use to support more integrated, inclusive forms ofmanagement. We discuss this potential of palaeoecology to informmore holistic approaches to conservation through: landscape-scale conservation; a focus on ecosystem services and natural capital; and the interdisciplinary approach of social-ecological systems that frames conservation as being for 'people and nature'. Realising this potential requires enhanced communication and engagement between scientists and research users about palaeoecological data, their scope for application, and limitations. The need for climate change adaptation, the use of narratives about past environmental changes and future management scenarios, and the need for improved approaches to conservation provide opportunities for bridging the science-policy-practitioner gap and advancing wetland conservation and management.","[Clarke, Stewart J.] Westley Bottom, Natl Trust, Bury St Edmunds IP33 3WD, Suffolk, England; [Lynch, A.

As a spatial scale of the assessment, Moldova's administrative-territorial units (ATUs) were selected. The exposure assessment was based on the climatic analysis of baseline (1971-2000) temperature and precipitation and projections of their changes in 2021-2050, separately for cold and warm periods. The sensitivity assessment included physiographical and socioeconomic characteristics, described by a set of specific indicators. The adaptive capacity was expressed by general economic and agricultural indicators, taking into consideration the medical provision and housing conditions. Through a ranking approach, the relative vulnerability of each ATU was calculated by summing its sensitivity and adaptive capacity ranks; the latter were obtained as combinations of their primary indicator ranks, arranged in an increasing and decreasing order, respectively. Due to lack of sound knowledge on these components' importance in overall assessment of vulnerability, their weights were taken as conventionally equal. Mapping of vulnerability revealed that ATUs neighboring to municipalities are the most vulnerable and need special attention in climate change adaptation. The basin's hotspots were discussed with public participation.","[Corobov, Roman] EcoTIRAS Int Environm Assoc, Kishinev 2012, Moldova; [Sirodoev, Igor] Univ Bucharest, Interdisciplinary Ctr Adv Res Territorial Dynam, Bucharest 030018, Romania; [Sirodoev, Igor; Sirodoev, Ghennadi] Moldavian Acad Sci, Inst Ecol & Geog, Kishinev 2028, Moldova; [Koeppel, Sonja] United Nations Econ Commiss Europe, CH-1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland; [Denisov, Nickolai] ZOI Environm Network, CH-1219 Geneva, Switzerland",University of Bucharest; Academy of Sciences of Moldova,"Corobov, R (corresponding author), EcoTIRAS Int Environm Assoc, 11A Teatrala St, Kishinev 2012, Moldova.",rcorobov@gmail.com,"Sirodoev, Igor/C-7020-2010","Sirodoev, Igor/0000-0003-3637-1893",,,,,27,16,17,1,17,HINDAWI PUBLISHING CORPORATION,NEW YORK,"410 PARK AVENUE, 15TH FLOOR, #287 PMB, NEW YORK, NY 10022 USA",1537-744X,,,SCI WORLD J,Sci.

This tool has been used successfully in several sectors and contexts such as coastal and river adaptation, urban heat waves, floods and rural livelihoods but its use in natural resource management, has faced several challenges and limitations. In the sector of agroforestry its use has seldom been done or documented and one of the reasons for this may due to some of its specific challenges. In this study, these challenges were addressed when using the Adaptation Pathways for the adaptation planning of three case studies in the semi-arid Alentejo region, a Mediterranean dryland of southern Portugal. This tool was integrated in a participatory approach combined with the Scenario Workshop method, to plan the adaptation of the agriculture and forestry sector of one municipality (Me?rtola) and two agroforestry farms (221 ha and 1000 ha). The methodology included, for each case study, 20 interviews, two workshops, literature review, expert analysis and the use of indicators of efficacy of adaptation measures, to define tipping points. The adaptation process and the resulting adaptation plans were evaluated by questionnaire and expert review. This combination of methods has supported the choice of effective adaptation measures for the case studies and when combined with several adaptation pathways and a landscape approach it supported the creation of integrated climate change adaptation plans that are now in implementation. We discuss how this combination of methods deals with limitation to Adaptation Pathways identified in the literature, conclude that the method was able to create adaptation plans that are now under implementation and present avenues for future research.","[Vizinho, Andre; Avelar, David; Fonseca, Ana Lucia; Carvalho, Silvia; Sucena-Paiva, Leonor; Pinho, Pedro; Nunes, Alice; Branquinho, Cristina; Vasconcelos, Ana Catia; Santos, Filipe Duarte; Penha-Lopes, Gil] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes Ce3c, Bloco C2,Piso 5, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Roxo, Maria Jose] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias Sociais & Humans, Ave Berna,26-C, P-1069061 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Vizinho, A (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes Ce3c, Bloco C2,Piso 5, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",afvizinho@fc.ul.pt; dnavelar@fc.ul.pt; alfonseca@fc.ul.pt; sccarvalho@fc.ul.pt; mlpaiva@fc.ul.pt; paplopes@fc.ul.pt; amanunes@fc.ul.pt; cmbranquinho@fc.ul.pt; hrace3c@fc.ul.pt; fdsantos@fc.ul.pt; mj.roxo@fcsh.unl.pt; gppenha-lopes@fc.ul.pt,"Branquinho, Cristina/B-3670-2008; Nunes, Alice M.R./B-4817-2014; Penha-Lopes, Gil/N-1475-2015; Pinho, Pedro/D-1232-2010","Branquinho, Cristina/0000-0001-8294-7924; Nunes, Alice M.R./0000-0002-6900-3838; Penha-Lopes, Gil/0000-0002-1024-1954; Carvalho, Silvia/0000-0002-8414-6503; Sucena-Paiva, Leonor/0000-0003-3138-5428; Pinho, Pedro/0000-0001-5571-9619; Vizinho, Andre/0000-0002-0503-3624",Eu FP7 Programme [308337]; EEA Grants/Programa AdaPT project AdaptForChange; EU LIFE Programme [LIFE15 CCA/PT/000043]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [FCT] [PD/BD/113929/2015]; FCT Investigator contract [IF/00940/2015]; FCT [UIDB/00329/2020]; H2020 [BiodivERsA32015104]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PD/BD/113929/2015] Funding Source: FCT,Eu FP7 Programme(European Commission); EEA Grants/Programa AdaPT project AdaptForChange; EU LIFE Programme; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [FCT](Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT Investigator contract(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); H2020; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,"This work was supported by Eu FP7 Programme, project BASE Bottom Up Adaptation for a Sustainable Europe [Grant Agreement No. 308337], EEA Grants/Programa AdaPT project AdaptForChange (2015-2016) and EU LIFE Programme with project LIFE Montado-Adapt [LIFE15 CCA/PT/000043] (2016-2021).

However, social conflict, laws, political incentives, governance structures, and other political factors have played pivotal roles in determining the fate of government-led coastal flood risk reduction efforts. Here, we review the ways in which politics has enabled or hindered the conception, design, and implementation of coastal risk reduction projects in the U.S. We draw from the literature in natural hazards, infrastructure, political science, and climate adaptation and give supporting examples. Overall, we find that (1) multiple floods are often needed to elicit earnest planning; (2) strong and continuous leadership from elected officials is necessary to advance projects; (3) stakeholder participation during the design stage has improved outcomes; (4) legal challenges to procedural and substantive shortcomings under environmental protection statutes present an enduring obstacle to implementing megastructure proposals.","[Rasmussen, D.

This paper analyses the effects of environmental, economic, and scientific-technological factors. The influence of each factor on scallop production in Chile was reviewed for the period between the 1980s and 2020. The evaluation of the effects allows the visualisation of the industry's productive evolution and reveals the current challenges. The occurrence of abrupt environmental disturbances, commercialisation under imperfect market configurations, and public and private efforts in scientific and technological advances have acted favourably on scallop production. However, an industry mainly focused on prices and high production volumes did not devote much effort to develop low-cost climate-resilient technologies. Today, economic challenges must be addressed by helping to reduce production costs and add economic value to products and by-products.

The main goal of this experiment was to assess the effect of urease inhibitors on N use efficiency, N losses, and their economic impact in a maize-wheat field experiment. In this study, 10 treatments were compared, combining the urea fertilizer with or without urease inhibitor, applied in one or two dressings, and under optimal or sub-optimal irrigation. A single application of urease inhibitor (IN1d), coupled with the conventional urea, helped to reduce the nitrate leaching risk both during the maize period (even when compared to the two dressing treatment) and after harvest. In addition, this improvement was achieved together with an increase in economic benefit, even when compared with the application of the same amount of regular urea split into two dressings. Under low water availability systems, the benefits of applying urease inhibitors increased with respect to the application of regular urea, making this technique a very promising strategy for adaptation to climate change in arid and semiarid regions.","[Allende-Montalban, Raul; Martin-Lammerding, Diana; del Mar Delgado, Maria; Porcel, Miguel A.; Gabriel, Jose L.] Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria INIA, Environm & Agron Dept, CSIC, Ctra Coruna Km 7,5, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Allende-Montalban, Raul] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Agr Chem & Food Sci, Av Francisco Tomas y Valiente 7, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Gabriel, Jose L.] Ctr Estudios & Invest Gest Riesgos Agr & Medioamb, Paseo Senda Rey 13, Madrid 28040, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Centro de Estudios e Investigacion para la Gestion de Riesgos Agrarios Medioambientales CEIGRAM,"Gabriel, JL (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria INIA, Environm & Agron Dept, CSIC, Ctra Coruna Km 7,5, Madrid 28040, Spain.;Gabriel, JL (corresponding author), Ctr Estudios & Invest Gest Riesgos Agr & Medioamb, Paseo Senda Rey 13, Madrid 28040, Spain.",raul.allende@inia.es; lammerding@inia.es; delgado@inia.es; porcel@inia.es; gabriel.jose@inia.es,"Martin-Lammerding, Diana/AAT-9693-2020; Gabriel, Jose Luis/B-9605-2013","Martin-Lammerding, Diana/0000-0002-9498-7904; Gabriel, Jose Luis/0000-0002-5508-4120",Ministry of Science and Innovation [AGL2017-83283-C2-1/2-R]; Community of Madrid [AGRISOST-CM S2018/BAA-4330]; European Structural funding 2014-2020 (ERDF); European Structural funding 2014-2020 (ESF),"Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Community of Madrid(Comunidad de Madrid); European Structural funding 2014-2020 (ERDF); European Structural funding 2014-2020 (ESF)","This work was funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation (AGL2017-83283-C2-1/2-R), the Community of Madrid (AGRISOST-CM S2018/BAA-4330), and European Structural funding 2014-2020 (ERDF y ESF).",,39,7,7,11,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,JUL,2021,11,7,,,,,,,684,10.3390/agriculture11070684,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11070684,,,17,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,TN1KB,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000676000700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lessons learned about coastal environment/earthquake interactions are useful in transforming our approach to adapting to climate change in coastal settlements. This paper reviews highlights of the temporary and lasting effects of the recent ANZ 'coastal quake' events in sand beach, mixed sand and gravel beach, estuary, delta and lagoon settings. Key topics include sediment budgets and beach states, estuary stability, ecosystem translation and squeeze, liquefaction, and effects of relative sea level change. Findings include the potential robustness of open coast beach systems to both uplift and subsidence, the relative sensitivity of estuarine and delta city hydraulics and ecosystem resilience once built environment boundaries and interactions are considered, and the potential for coastal hazard interactions and cascades with both negative and positive consequences. Analysis of these earthquake events can be used, not only to 'build back better', but also to underpin a shift in approaches to coastal hazards and climate change challenges, via a multi-hazards perspective.","[Hart, Deirdre E.; Pitman, Sebastian J.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Earth & Environm, Kura Aronukurangi, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Byun, Do-Seong] Korea Hydrog & Oceanog Agcy, Ocean Res Div, Busan, South Korea",University of Canterbury,"Hart, DE (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Earth & Environm, Kura Aronukurangi, Christchurch, New Zealand.",deirdre.hart@canterbury.ac.nz,"Byun, Do-Seong/AAK-7132-2021",,,,,,28,1,1,3,15,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,COCONUT CREEK,"5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA",0749-0208,1551-5036,,J COASTAL RES,J.

However, in much of this literature, present climate change is often presented as a new phenomenon, one creating new issues and challenges for researchers and for the tourism industry. But this conceptual paper reminds us that climate change has been a constant through the pre history and history of humanity, and as far as is known, of tourism as well. The paper briefly surveys the history of tourism, linking developments to changes in climate and considering the interactions between the two. Several themes are identified and a number of conclusions presented. The first conclusion is that there may be a confusion about climate change being a 'new' issue, perhaps due to a mistaken perception that climate change = anthropogenic (or human induced) climate change. Secondly, and related to this, is a perceived lack of understanding that climate and climate change has had significant impacts on travel and tourism throughout history. Thirdly, that perhaps current research and teaching in the climate change/tourism arena could benefit from lessons learned from examining past experience in tourism adaptation to climate change.

A simple theoretical model that captures the relationship between adaptive performance, decision structure, and prediction accuracy at different temporal scales is developed, and its implications deduced. It is shown that users who face high adjustment costs (i.e. are inflexible) depend more heavily on accurate long-term predictions than those who are able to adjust their adaptation strategies at low cost. However, the constraints on the accuracy of long-term predictions in order for them to be 'accurate enough' to be recommended unreservedly are strongest for precisely those users who desire them most. There are thus intrinsic structural limitations to the utility of long-term predictions for adaptive decision making. In addition, the heterogeneous dependence of adaptive performance on predictions at different temporal scales gives rise to a resource allocation problem for investments aimed at improving predictions so as to maximize their social benefits. It is suggested that an explicit distributional framework that matches users' needs with scientific feasibility is needed in order to guide such investments, and key issues any such framework will need to address are discussed.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Millner, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",a.millner@berkeley.edu,,,Ciriacy-Wantrup postdoctoral research fellowship; Commonwealth Scholarship; NRF,Ciriacy-Wantrup postdoctoral research fellowship; Commonwealth Scholarship; NRF,"I thank Ana Lopez, Cameron Hepburn, Sam Fankhauser, Simon Dietz, Gerard Roe, and three anonymous referees for helpful comments.

With respect to climate change, EK is important because it serves as the basis for locally grounded, and place-sensitive adaptation and mitigation measures. However, despite the rapid urbanization, depletion of vegetative cover, and noticeable changes in the local climate of Sunyani, a mid-sized city in Ghana, limited empirical studies have focused on the experiential knowledge of the population on climatic changes in the city as a way of informing adaptation and mitigation responses. Employing in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, this study examines the experiential knowledge of the people of Sunyani on climatic changes. The study finds that although the residents of Sunyani have no in-depth knowledge of the scientific fundamentals of climate change, they appreciate the rapidly changing climate due to their long-lived experiences and interactions with the natural environment.

Thus, this study aimed to examine the resilience of three (homegardens, woodlots, and parkland) traditional agroforestry systems (TAFS) on the basis of biomass carbon accumulation and socio-economic characteristics in Silite district, Southern Ethiopia. Systematic random sampling was employed to collect social and biological data. Height and diameter at breast height (DBH) were measured to determine the biomass carbon stock and a questionnaire was performed for the socio-economic data. The mean differences across the system were analyzed using a post hoc test. Socioeconomic data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the chi-square test. Climate change awareness was perceived almost by half of the respondents, thus the contribution of TAFS to climate change adaptation and mitigation was revealed socio-economically and ecologically.

One of the pillars of the strategies is the adoption and diffusion of various climate smart agricultural practices for improving crop and livestock production and farmer income while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The effects of these innovations on household nutritional security, including gender-differentiated nutritional status, have hardly been analyzed. We examine the determinants of adoption of combinations of multiple climate smart agricultural innovations and their impact on different nutrition outcomes. We find that adoption of climate smart innovations increases dietary diversity and improves calorie and protein availability. These benefits increase with adoption of combinations of innovations, relative to adopting an innovation in isolation. Gender-disaggregation results suggest nutritional outcome differentials between male and female headed households due to both differences in household characteristics, including household resources, and differences in returns to resources. The study provides insight into the interaction between climate change adaptation and nutrition security among male and female headed households, with implication for the Sustainable Development Goals of ending hunger, achieving gender equality, and taking action on climate change.

J,"Matthew, R",,,,"Matthew, Richard",,,Integrating climate change into peacebuilding,CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PEACE,"Peacebuilding countries are concentrated in areas of heightened vulnerability to climate change impacts, and almost certainly lack the capacity to manage these impacts. In spite of this overlap, climate change adaptation and mitigation projects are typically excluded from peacebuilding activities. This is particularly alarming given that many analysts believe climate change will trigger, amplify or perpetuate humanitarian crises, population displacement, political extremism and violent conflict in the regions in which most peacebuilding operations take place. This paper investigates opportunities for integrating climate change into peacebuilding. It identifies three obstacles to this integration-the lack of climate change tools and policies that can be easily introduced into typical peacebuilding programming; the skepticism and complacency of the donor community; and tensions between the objectives and timeframes of peacebuilding and those of climate change response. The paper then examines opportunities to integrate climate change into four principal programmatic areas of peacebuilding-socio-economic recovery, politics and governance, security and rule of law, and human rights-and concludes that more attention needs to be given to these opportunities in order to build resilience and reduce the likelihood of more daunting and costly challenges in the future.","Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Unconvent Secur Affairs, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Matthew, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Unconvent Secur Affairs, 5546 SBSG, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",rmatthew@uci.edu,,,,,,,42,23,23,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Furthermore, the main focus has been on technological adaptations, with less attention paid to the process of climate change adaptation. In this article, we present and analyze findings from recent studies on climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation in Norway, with the aim of identifying the wider social impacts of climate change. Three main lessons can be drawn. First, the potential thresholds and indirect effects may be more important than the direct, sectoral effects. Second, highly sensitive sectors, regions, and communities combine with differential social vulnerability to create both winners and losers. Third, high national levels of adaptive capacity mask the barriers and constraints to adaptation, particularly among those who are most vulnerable to climate change. Based on these results, we question complacency in Norway and other European countries regarding climate change impacts and adaptation. We argue that greater attention needs to be placed on the social context of climate change impacts and on the processes shaping vulnerability and adaptation.","Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; CICERO, N-0318 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"O'Brien, K (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, POB 1096 Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",karen.obrien@sgeo.uio.no; siri.eriksen@sgeo.uio.no; linda.sygna@cicero.uio.no; l.o.naess@cicero.uio.no,,,,,,,65,132,135,2,35,ROYAL SWEDISH ACAD SCIENCES,STOCKHOLM,"PUBL DEPT BOX 50005, S-104 05 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN",0044-7447,,,AMBIO,Ambio,MAR,2006,35,2,,,,,50,56,,10.1579/0044-7447(2006)35[50:QCCCIV]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1579/0044-7447(2006)35[50:QCCCIV]2.0.CO;2,,,7,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,035WM,16722249,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000237032400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The consequences of climate action should be considered at the design and maintenance planning stage, with the objective of promoting the overall durability of constructions. Portugal, being part of the Mediterranean region, Southern Europe, and the Iberian Peninsula, and sometimes highlighted in projections as a critical area, is an example of a country considerably vulnerable to climate change impacts. The climate is expected to become warmer and drier, with a substantial rise in temperature and fall in precipitation by the end of the century. What implications will these changes have on the degradation of facades? Climate agents, such as temperature, solar radiation, humidity, precipitation, and wind, directly influence the performance of external claddings that protect internal building components. Cement render is the prevalent facade cladding in Portugal and Europe. Research to assess the risks of future climate-induced degradation on rendered facades is relevant in the context of buildings' durability and adaptation to climate change. The objective of the present research was to define expectations about the impact of a progressively warmer and drier climate on the degradation of exterior cement renders, based on an analysis of related literature. Generally, less staining and more cracking are expected. Expectations about salt weathering and loss of adhesion are more uncertain and need further research.","[Barrelas, Joana; Silva, Ana; de Brito, Jorge] Univ Lisbon, CERIS, Inst Super Tecn IST, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [de Brito, Jorge] Univ Lisbon, IST, Dept Civil Engn Architecture & Georesources, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Tadeu, Antonio] Univ Coimbra, Dept Civil Engn, ADAI LAETA, Polo II,Rua Luis Reis Santos, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal; [Tadeu, Antonio] Itecons Inst Res & Technol Dev Construct Energy En, Rua Pedro Hispano, P-3030289 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade de Coimbra,"Barrelas, J (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, CERIS, Inst Super Tecn IST, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",joana.barrelas@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Silva, Ana/G-3199-2013","Silva, Ana/0000-0001-6715-474X",,,,,114,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,FEB,2023,13,2,,,,,,,352,10.3390/buildings13020352,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings13020352,,,26,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,9G7RH,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000938345000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Faster phenological development of crops due to climate warming is one of the main drivers for potential future yield reductions. To counter the effect of faster maturity, adapted varieties would require more heat units to regain the previous growing period length. In this study, we investigate the effects of variety adaptation on global caloric production under four different future climate change scenarios for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat. Thereby, we empirically identify areas that could require new varieties and areas where variety adaptation could be achieved by shifting existing varieties into new regions. The study uses an ensemble of seven global gridded crop models and five CMIP6 climate models. We found that 39% (SSP5-8.5) of global cropland could require new crop varieties to avoid yield loss from climate change by the end of the century. At low levels of warming (SSP1-2.6), 85% of currently cultivated land can draw from existing varieties to shift within an agro-ecological zone for adaptation. The assumptions on available varieties for adaptation have major impacts on the effectiveness of variety adaptation, which could more than half in SSP5-8.5. The results highlight that region-specific breeding efforts are required to allow for a successful adaptation to climate change.","[Zabel, Florian; Schneider, Julia M.; Mauser, Wolfram; Hank, Tobias] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany; [Mueller, Christoph; Minoli, Sara; Jagermeyr, Jonas] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Climate Resilience, Potsdam, Germany; [Elliott, Joshua; Jagermeyr, Jonas] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY USA; [Jagermeyr, Jonas; Ruane, Alex C.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Franke, James A.; Moyer, Elisabeth] Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Franke, James A.; Moyer, Elisabeth] Univ Chicago, Ctr Robust Decis Making Climate & Energy Policy R, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Dury, Marie; Francois, Louis] Univ Liege, Liege, Belgium; [Folberth, Christian] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Liu, Wenfeng] China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pugh, Thomas A.

When states share a water resource, adaptation to climate change proves to be more burdensome, especially if the resource in question is governed by a transboundary water agreement that fails to incorporate flexibility. The focus of this paper is on transboundary water basins with more than two riparian states, where only part of the co-riparian states are party to a transboundary water agreement. The paper discusses whether the recognition of the principle of equitable and reasonable use of water as a principle of customary international law creates an obligation for the party states to such agreements to adapt the terms of their arrangement to climate change. It argues that the principle of equitable and reasonable use of water establishes an obligation of conduct for the states to respect non-parties' riparian rights to a fair share of beneficial uses of water and protect the environment. Therefore, the nature of disruptions caused by climate change may make it imperative for the party states to take all possible measures that allow them to modify their water practices under an agreement to the implications of climate change in order to comply with the principle of equitable and reasonable use of water.","[Jafroudi, Maryam] Tilburg Univ, Dept Publ Law & Governance, Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Jafroudi, M (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Dept Publ Law & Governance, Tilburg, Netherlands.",mjafrudi@uvt.nl,,,,,,,52,3,3,0,7,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1366-7017,1996-9759,,WATER POLICY,Water Policy,OCT,2020,22,5,,,,,717,732,,10.2166/wp.2020.212,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wp.2020.212,,,16,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Water Resources,OU7RL,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000591722200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their complementary efforts in adaptation to climate change are sternly important for farm productivity and income. This study evaluates factors explaining individual and multiple adoption of climate change management strategies and their differential impacts on productivity and income using a sample of 1172 smallholder farmers from Malawi and Zimbabwe. The study employs multinomial logistic regression to evaluate factors of individual and multiple adoption and regression adjustment with inverse probability weighting to evaluate impacts of the different adoption regimes on farm productivity and income. The results show that multiple adoption of innovations is mostly explained by access to key resources (credit, income and information), level of education and size of land owned by the farmer. More so, the concurrent adoption of conservation agriculture, stress adapted legume varieties and drought tolerant maize has far greater dividends on productivity and income than when considered individually. However, impacts of multiple adoption of the practices are not entirely uniform across different geographic regions and gender. Results suggest that effective institutional and policy efforts targeted towards reducing resource constraints that inhibit farmers' capacity to adopt complementary climate-smart agriculture packages such as conservation agriculture, drought tolerant maize and improved legume varieties must be gender sensitive and context specific.","[Makate, Clifton] Haramaya Univ, Africa Ctr Excellence ACE Climate Smart Agr & Bio, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Makate, Marshall] Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Syst & Hlth Econ, Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Mango, Nelson] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, POB MP 228, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Siziba, Shephard] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, POB MP 167, Harare, Zimbabwe",Haramaya University; Curtin University; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University of Zimbabwe,"Makate, C (corresponding author), Haramaya Univ, Africa Ctr Excellence ACE Climate Smart Agr & Bio, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.",ruumakate@live.com; marshall.makate@curtin.edu.au; n.mango@cgiar.org; s.siziba@hotmail.com,"Makate, Clifton/ACV-8483-2022; Makate, Clifton/GWV-1821-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Makate, Clifton/0000-0002-6061-6638; Makate, Marshall/0000-0002-2005-2970",International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT),International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT),We gratefully acknowledge research funding from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) that was used in carrying out this study.,,63,86,90,7,80,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

The withdrawal undercuts the foundation of global climate governance and upsets the process of climate cooperation, and the impacts are manifold. The withdrawal undermines the universality of the Paris Agreement and impairs states' confidence in climate cooperation; it aggravates the leadership deficit in addressing global climate issues and sets a bad precedent for international climate cooperation. The withdrawal reduces other countries' emission space and raises their emission costs, and refusal to contribute to climate aid makes it more difficult for developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Cutting climate research funding will compromise the quality of future IPCC reports and ultimately undermine the scientific authority of future climate negotiations. China faces mounting pressure from the international community to assume global climate leadership after the U.S. withdraws, and this article proposes that China should reach the high ends of its domestic climate targets under the current Nationally Determined Contributions; internationally, China should facilitate the rebuilding of shared climate leadership, replacing the G2 with C5.

To develop efficient strategies on how to manage commercial orchards under deficit water supply, we need to know the effects of water-stress on crop production. However, when the water supply is abundant apple growers often think that over-irrigation gives higher marketable fruit yield than potential evapotranspiration-based or sensor-based (e.g. tensiometer, dendrometer) irrigation. We therefore aimed to evaluate the effects of three water regimes, namely well-watered (100% of crop evapotranspiration - ETc, WW), 25% of ETc water deficit over the season (water-stressed, WS), and twofold of WW (200% of ETc, 2xWW), on midday stem water potential (SWP), crop yield and fruit quality of Pink LadyTM 'Rosy Glow' apples. As expected, SWP was lower in WS than in the others, but both WS and 2xWW decreased fruit yield, although 2xWW tended to increase yield in the >70% color class and ensured quite a constant amount of yield at each picking time. Soluble solid content (SSC) in fruit was higher in WS. As a whole, our results suggest that over-irrigation that is sometimes recommended to keep a safety margin should be considered with caution. Rather, a mild water-stress, between WS and WW in our experiment, may represent a good compromise for a good quality yield.","[Atay, Ersin] TAGEM, Fruit Res Inst, TR-32500 Isparta, Turkey; [Hucbourg, Bruno; Drevet, Aurore] GRCETA Basse Durance, Extens Serv, Route Molleges, F-13210 St Remy De Provence, France; [Atay, Ersin; Lauri, Pierre-Eric] INRA, UMR Syst, 2 Pl Pierre Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France",INRAE,"Atay, E (corresponding author), TAGEM, Fruit Res Inst, TR-32500 Isparta, Turkey.;Atay, E (corresponding author), INRA, UMR Syst, 2 Pl Pierre Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",atayersin@yahoo.com,"lauri, pierre-eric/B-5724-2008; Atay, Ersin/K-2375-2019","lauri, pierre-eric/0000-0002-7549-0484; Atay, Ersin/0000-0003-0810-3779",ARIMNET (Coordination of the Agricultural Research in the Mediterranean Area) research program APMed (Apple and Peach in Mediterranean orchards - Integrating tree water status and irrigation management for coping with water scarcity and aphid control); TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey),ARIMNET (Coordination of the Agricultural Research in the Mediterranean Area) research program APMed (Apple and Peach in Mediterranean orchards - Integrating tree water status and irrigation management for coping with water scarcity and aphid control); TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),This work has been partly funded by the ARIMNET (Coordination of the Agricultural Research in the Mediterranean Area) research program APMed (Apple and Peach in Mediterranean orchards - Integrating tree water status and irrigation management for coping with water scarcity and aphid control).

We estimated the effects of climate change and possible future scenarios of agricultural changes on the phosphorus and nitrogen loading to the Baltic Sea from Finnish catchments. In the agricultural scenarios we assumed that the prices of agricultural products are among the primary drivers in the adaptation to climate change, as they affect the level of fertilization and the production intensity and volume and, hence, the modeled changes in gross nutrient loading from agricultural land. Optimal adaptation may increase production while supporting appropriate use of fertilization, resulting in low nutrient balance in the fields. However, a less optimal adaptation may result in higher nutrient balance and increased leaching. The changes in nutrient loading to the Baltic Sea were predicted by taking into account the agricultural scenarios in a nutrient loading model for Finnish catchments (VEMALA), which simulates runoff, nutrient processes, leaching and transport on land, in rivers and in lakes. We thus integrated the effects of climate change in the agricultural sector, nutrient loading in fields, natural background loading, hydrology and nutrient transport and retention processes.

This study seeks to determine individual and joint effects of climate variation, water supply and sanitation on the occurrence of diarrhea among children under five in SSA using multilevel mixed-effect Poisson regression including cross-level interaction. We merged 57 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from 25 SSA countries covering the period 2000-2019 with climatic data from the DHS geolocation databases. The results of the research indicate that 77.7% of the variation in the occurrence of diarrhea in Sub-Saharan households is due to climatic differences between clusters. Also, a household residing in a cluster with a high incidence of diarrhea is 1.567 times more likely to have diarrhea cases than a household from a cluster with a low incidence. In addition, when average temperature and rainfall increase, households using unimproved sanitation or unimproved water have more cases of diarrhea. For SSA, the results of the multilevel analysis suggest the adoption at both levels; macro (national) and micro (household), of climate change adaption measures in the water sector to reduce the prevalence of diarrhea.","[Kemajou, Donald Njatang] Univ Yaounde II, IFORD, Yaounde, Cameroon",,"Kemajou, DN (corresponding author), Univ Yaounde II, IFORD, Yaounde, Cameroon.",njatangkemajou@yahoo.fr,,"donald, kemajou/0000-0002-5792-1826",,,,,71,0,0,1,4,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1477-8920,1996-7829,,J WATER HEALTH,J.

Nevertheless, in years to come, Greek mining enterprises may face economic losses due to climate change. This study aimed, for the first time, to explore the perceptions and attitudes of Greek mining practitioners towards climate change, and to investigate existing and planned climate-change adaptation and mitigation actions. To this end, a bottom-up survey based on face-to-face interviews of key practitioners from all of the operational mines in the Cyclades region of Greece was conducted. According to the results, mining enterprises are already experiencing negative impacts of extreme weather events. The major vulnerabilities of these enterprises relate to the management of excess rainwater, strong winds, and unusually high or low temperatures. However, the adaptation actions implemented by the companies are not systematic or are not always labeled as such, while most of their mitigation actions are performed to improve energy efficiency and achieve better economic outcomes. Even though the mining sector perceives climate change to be a threat to its activities, it has not invested the resources required to adapt to the future climate. Further, scientific knowledge of this phenomenon is limited among mining practitioners. To this end, governments and institutional stakeholders should promote climate-change awareness and disseminate successful adaptative actions to increase the future resilience of the mining sector.","[Mavrommatis, E.; Damigos, D.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Min & Met Engn, Zografou Campus,9 Heroon Polytech Str, Athens 15780, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Mavrommatis, E (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Min & Met Engn, Zografou Campus,9 Heroon Polytech Str, Athens 15780, Greece.",emavro@metal.ntua.gr; damigos@metal.ntua.gr,"Damigos, Dimitris/A-1806-2016","Damigos, Dimitris/0000-0003-0142-7156; /0000-0002-0548-1304",,,,,44,0,0,1,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2365-6433,2365-7448,,EURO-MEDITERR J ENVI,Euro-Mediterr.

In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution of shade provision of street trees in Boston, Massachusetts. The sky view factor (SVF), which influences the solar radiation to the ground and affects human thermal comfort, was used to indicate the contribution of street trees on shade provision. Google Street View (GSV) panoramas were used to calculate the photographic method based SVF (SVFP), with the consideration of all kinds of obstructions within street canyons. A building height model was used to calculate the simulation based SVF (SVFs), with consideration of obstruction of building blocks only. Considering the fact that street trees and building blocks are the two major obstructions of radiation within street canyons, therefore, the difference between the two SVF estimation results can be considered as the shade provision of street trees. The results show that street trees help to decrease the SVF by 24.61% in Boston, Massachusetts. The shading level varies spatially in the study area. Generally, the southwestern area has much higher shading level than the north and the east. We further explored the shading variation among different socioeconomic groups in the study area. Result shows that Hispanics tend to live in neighborhoods with lower shading level. This study can help to provide a reference for future urban greening projects for global climate change adaption.","[Li, Xiaojiang; Ratti, Carlo] MIT, MIT Senseable City Lab, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Room 9-250,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Li, XJ (corresponding author), MIT, MIT Senseable City Lab, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Room 9-250,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",xiaojian@mit.edu,,,,,,,40,43,47,12,70,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1618-8667,1610-8167,,URBAN FOR URBAN GREE,Urban For.

Part one describes important domestic drivers within China providing motives for the AIIB initiative. These include domestic overinvestment in infrastructure and construction, combined with environmental stresses compelling the shift towards a more sustainable economy. Part two examines regional networks and linkages that the AIIB is becoming part of. These include China's 'one belt, one road' initiative, and various collective initiatives based around ASEAN. In part three, this article explores the AIIB's appearance on the development finance scene as an example of 'contested multilateralism'-where a new multilateral institution emerges to challenge the rules and practices of existing institutions. The AIIB has entered into co-financing agreements with many of its multilateral development bank peers. Its standards and procedures are strongly influenced by existing ones, even while it begins to influence the practices of its partner multilateral development banks. Part four examines the potential influence of a future alliance between the AIIB and the UNCCC's Green Climate Fund. Such an alliance would require an even greater degree of compliance by the AIIB with global standards of transparency and good governance, as well as expanding the scope for the AIIB to influence regional climate change adaptation and mitigation infrastructure initiatives.","[De Jonge, Alice] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"De Jonge, A (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,"de Jonge, Alice/I-3709-2013","de Jonge, Alice/0000-0001-6219-7054",,,,,56,37,37,6,99,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0020-5850,1468-2346,,INT AFF,Int.

This is especially true for seaport stakeholders. Ports serve as access points to goods and services from around the world, promoting a higher and more robust quality of life. However, with the increased likelihood of intense storms, rising sea levels, and resource scarcity facing coastal communities, stakeholders will need to adapt coastal infrastructure to ensure long-term viability. Solving such problems requires leadership and participation from government across jurisdictional boundaries and/or the private sector. Using the case of Port of Providence (Rhode Island, United States), this study finds stakeholder perceptions of leadership responsibility contribute to an institutional void, in which it is unclear who is responsible and who should pay for resilience investment.

These shocks are likely to be more unpredictable as the effects of climate change continue to mount. Yet how households adapt to these changing climatic conditions especially in the context of rapidly changing market conditions in most areas of the world, is poorly understood. These interactions have wide implications for both smallholder livelihoods and sustainable use of natural resources. In this paper, we examine the relationship between environmental shocks and stocking rates in livestock herds in the Inner Mongolian grasslands of northern China. We uniquely examine three types of shocks and how households adapt livestock production strategies in response to each. Separately and in aggregate, we look at three common shocks in Inner Mongolia: droughts, snowstorms, and locust outbreaks. We use a difference-in-differences approach to estimate changes in stocking rates among households that experience shocks versus those that do not with a panel dataset from 2009 to 2014 of 597 households. While we find no clear impact from locusts, our results suggest droughts and snowstorms have opposite effects: droughts are associated with increases in herd sizes, but snowstorms result in decreased herds. We suggest these differences are due to interactions between shocks, emerging options to borrow on credit, and livestock markets. Household adaptation to climate change will be strategic and take advantage of both available resources as well as market conditions.","[Crook, David R.; Robinson, Brian E.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Li, Ping] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Grassland Res Inst, Hohhot 010010, Peoples R China","McGill University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Grassland Research, CAAS","Li, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Grassland Res Inst, Hohhot 010010, Peoples R China.",lipingcau@126.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of CAAS [CAAS-ASTIP-2020-IGR-05]; Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia [2018MS07007]; U.S. National Science Foundation [DEB-1313693]; Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture [2015-NP-182013]; McGill Sustainability Systems Initiative,Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of CAAS; Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia; U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture; McGill Sustainability Systems Initiative,"This work was funded by Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of CAAS(No. CAAS-ASTIP-2020-IGR-05),the Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia (2018MS07007), the U.S. National Science Foundation (DEB-1313693), Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture (2015-NP-182013), and the McGill Sustainability Systems Initiative.",,60,7,7,10,56,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Conservation farming (CF) has been actively promoted in seven of Zambia's nine provinces since the 1980s. CF has the technical potential to contribute to food security and adaptation to climate change; however, rigorous analyses of the determinants of adoption/dis-adoption of these practices, are still scarce. This paper fills this gap by combining rich panel data with historical rainfall data to understand the determinants of adoption and intensity of two CF practices: minimum soil disturbance and crop rotations. Controlling for the confounding effects of household level unobservables, we find that extension services and rainfall variability are the strongest determinants of adoption, suggesting that farmers use these practices as an adaptation strategy to mitigate the negative effects of variable and delayed rainfall. Furthermore, our findings highlight the role of agro-ecological and socio-economic constraints in explaining adoption, as well as the potential role and effectiveness of interventions to support it. Eastern province shows a significantly different trend in terms of both adoption and the intensity of adoption, indicating that the long-established CF activities in the province have had some impact - though high dis-adoption rates are observed even in this province.

However, there is presently no commonly recognised method to assess accurately how sea level rise will modify coastal processes in the coming decades. Therefore, many assessments of the physical component of coastal vulnerability are presently based on a combined use of data (e.g. digital elevation models, historical shoreline and coastal geomorphology datasets), simple models and expert opinion. In this study, we assess the applicability and usefulness of a multi-criteria decision-mapping method (the analytical hierarchy process, AHP) to map physical coastal vulnerability to erosion and flooding in a structured way. We apply the method in two regions of France: the coastal zones of Languedoc-Roussillon (north-western Mediterranean, France) and the island of La Reunion (south-western Indian Ocean), notably using the regional geological maps. As expected, the results show not only the greater vulnerability of sand spits, estuaries and low-lying areas near to coastal lagoons in both regions, but also that of a thin strip of erodible cliffs exposed to waves in La Reunion. Despite gaps in knowledge and data, the method is found to provide a flexible and transportable framework to represent and aggregate existing knowledge and to support long-term coastal zone planning through the integration of such studies into existing adaptation schemes.","[Le Cozannet, G.; Garcin, M.; Bulteau, T.; Mirgon, C.; Yates, M.

Drawing on the growing body of scientific evidence on the increasing frequency and severity of climate-related natural disasters, we argue that climate change is already taking place. The mounting and highly unpredictable losses from natural disasters make the traditional disaster-funding approaches obsolete, as even large economies have problems financing economic recovery from their own budget revenues or special government disaster funds. This is particularly the case in low-income developing countries, where limited tax bases and high indebtedness prevent them from relying on debt financing of reconstruction efforts. Using OECD and World Bank statistics, we demonstrate that despite the commonly held belief, disaster-related external donor aid to developing countries accounts for only a small fraction of the total economic loss caused by catastrophic events. According to our estimate, on average over 90% of the economic loss from natural disasters is borne by households, business and government. This suggests a need for insurance-based climate risk financing mechanisms at the country level. By paying a fixed insurance premium that can be a small fraction of the potential economic loss, countries can cap the amount of their fiscal loss, greatly reduce the uncertainty of national budgetary outcomes due to natural disasters, and increase the speed of their post-disaster economic recovery.","Munich Re, Munich, Germany; World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Munich RE Group; The World Bank,"Hoeppe, P (corresponding author), Munich Re, Munich, Germany.",phoeppe@munichre.com,,,,,,,11,21,23,2,23,JAMES & JAMES SCIENCE PUBLISHERS LTD/EARTHSCAN,LONDON,"8-12 CAMDEN HIGH STREET, NW1 0JH LONDON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Changes in climate, increasing urbanization and industrialization are creating immense pressure on the coastal environment. Coastal erosion, sea level rise, changing morphology of the coastal areas and extreme weather events are some of the threats that coastal regions are experiencing globally. While various studies have assessed the vulnerability of coastal regions quantitatively and spatially, there is a need to supplement these findings with qualitative insights based on human experiences. Thus, the present study carried out a coastal vulnerability assessment along the coastline of Dakshina Kannada district in Karnataka, India using Shannon's Entropy by including eight parameters i.e., slope, elevation, geomorphology, bathymetry, sea level rise, mean tidal range, mean significant wave height and shoreline change. The study also explored the experiences and perceptions of stakeholders regarding adaptation barriers to climate change vulnerabilities for understanding the ground complexities. Coastal vulnerability index (CVI) revealed that nearly 39.7 km of the coastline is vulnerable including areas along Sasihtlu beach, Munda, New Mangalore Port Batapady beach, Uchilla, Kotekar, Ullal beach, Netravati River Area and Mukka beach. Rainfall induced coastal erosion, lack of coordination among the various stakeholders, policy makers and practitioners regarding a common framework for climate change adaptation strategies were identified adaptation barriers. The findings of CVI and adaptation barriers may be used by practitioners and policy makers for framing the adaptation measures for mitigating the implications of the coastal region.

However, there is still an insufficient understanding of the possible effects of climate change on crop yields in Africa. In this study, a previously calibrated Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model was used to assess the effects of future climate change on maize (Zea mays L.) yield in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The study aimed to compare maize yields obtained from EPIC simulations using baseline (1980-2010) weather data with maize yields obtained from EPIC using statistically downscaled future climate data sets for two future periods (mid-century (2040-2069) and late century (2070-2099)). We used three general circulation models (GCMs): BCC-CSM1.1, GFDL-ESM2M and MIROC-ES under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, to drive the future maize yield simulations. Simulation results showed that for all three GCMs and for both future periods, a decrease in maize production was projected. Maize yield was projected to decrease by as much as 23.8% for MIROC, RCP 8.5, (2070-2099). The temperature was projected to rise by over 50% in winter under RCP 8.5 for both future periods. For both future scenarios, rainfall was projected to decrease in the summer months while increasing in the winter months. Overall, this study provides preliminary evidence that local farmers and the Eastern Cape government can utilise to develop local climate change adaptation strategies.","[Choruma, Dennis Junior] Rhodes Univ, African Studies Ctr, POB 94, ZA-6139 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Choruma, Dennis Junior; Akamagwuna, Frank Chukwuzuoke; Odume, Nelson Oghenekaro] Rhodes Univ, Inst Water Res, POB 94, ZA-6139 Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University; Rhodes University,"Choruma, DJ (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, African Studies Ctr, POB 94, ZA-6139 Grahamstown, South Africa.;Choruma, DJ (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Inst Water Res, POB 94, ZA-6139 Grahamstown, South Africa.",d.choruma@ru.ac.za; f.akamagwuna@ru.ac.za; n.odume@ru.ac.za,,"Choruma, Dennis Junior/0000-0002-0727-8473; Odume, Oghenekaro Nelson/0000-0001-5220-3254","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany is Excellence Strategy [EXC 2052/1-390713894]; National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa under the Southern African Systems Analysis Centre (SASAC) initiative","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany is Excellence Strategy(German Research Foundation (DFG)); National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa under the Southern African Systems Analysis Centre (SASAC) initiative","This article is the outcome of research conducted within the Rhodes University African Studies Centre (RASC), funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany is Excellence Strategy-EXC 2052/1-390713894 and the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa under the Southern African Systems Analysis Centre (SASAC) initiative.",,88,2,2,5,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,JUN,2022,12,6,,,,,,,794,10.3390/agriculture12060794,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12060794,,,24,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,2M0XD,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000817432800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Through inter-plant hydrogen integration (IPHI), the overall hydrogen consumption and purged gases could be further reduced by exchanging hydrogen gases among multiple plants which could reduce the climate change effect. In this work, a P-graph methodology is proposed for the optimal design of IPHI with regeneration-reuse/recycle via a centralised utility hub. Green hydrogen is incorporated in this work in the call for climate change adaption. A case study involving green hydrogen sourced from solar energy, palm oil mill effluent, and wastewater was used to demonstrate the proposed methodology. Four integration schemes were analysed using game theory-based approach for decision making. In IPHI, each participating plant may seek to maximise its own benefits due to rational self-interest. Hence, a game theory-based approach was used to analyse the interaction of participating plants in developing the IPHI schemes. With the implementation of carbon tax, it is potential for motivating collaborations as additional gains can be achieved through collaboration compared to short-sighted self-interest decision. The proposed methodology indicates that collective welfare can be maximised through cooperation among all networks to pursue Pareto optimality and in line with the commitment to tackle climate change and reaching sustainainability agenda.

Our empirical findings suggest that the current extension framework reproduces existing inequalities in that access to institutional knowledge and its uptake is linked to one's social location, that is, caste, gender, class, and geographic location, and information shared is neither timely nor contextually relevant. Employing accessibility and localization as lenses of inquiry, we argue from empirical evidence that smallholder farmers in a rain-fed context are especially vulnerable to the risks posed by climatic change and hence agricultural extension (with climate-informed knowledge) should be to be seen as a critical enabler of adaptation; ensuring accessibility and localisation, we argue, strengthens climate services, and by extension, enables adaptation to climatic risks. The issues that encumber effective extension, we contend, can be mitigated by a re-imagination of agricultural extension, one that privileges public field level functionaries as conduits between state departments and farmers over other modes, and enables structured involvement of community collectives as vehicles to address local needs and ensure access. Drawing on interventions in our study sites, we make a case for promoting knowledge systems that ensure access to climate-specific agricultural information and contextual embeddedness.","[Kaur, Harpreet; Srinivas, Arjun; Bazaz, Amir] Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bangalore City Campus 197-36,2nd Main Rd, Bangalore 560080, Karnataka, India",Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS),"Kaur, H (corresponding author), Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bangalore City Campus 197-36,2nd Main Rd, Bangalore 560080, Karnataka, India.",hkaur@iihs.ac.in,,,"UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada","UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada(CGIAR)","This work was carried out under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA), with financial support from the UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada.

Broad-scale climate conditions can directly shape tree mortality patterns, but mortality rates respond non-linearly to climate when local-scale forest characteristics influence the behavior of tree-killing bark beetles (e.g., WPB). To test for these cross-scale interactions, we conduct aerial drone surveys at 32 sites along a gradient of climatic water deficit (CWD) spanning 350km of latitude and 1000m of elevation in WPB-impacted Sierra Nevada forests. We map, measure, and classify over 450,000 trees within 9 km(2), validating measurements with coincident field plots. We find greater size, proportion, and density of ponderosa pine (the WPB host) increase host mortality rates, as does greater CWD. Critically, we find a CWD/host size interaction such that larger trees amplify host mortality rates in hot/dry sites. Management strategies for climate change adaptation should consider how bark beetle disturbances can depend on cross-scale interactions, which challenge our ability to predict and understand patterns of tree mortality. The 2012-2016 drought and western pine beetle outbreaks caused unprecedented mortality of ponderosa pine in the Sierra Nevada, California. Here, the authors analyse drone-based data from almost half a million trees and find an interaction between host size and climatic water deficit, with higher mortality for large trees in dry, warm conditions but not in cooler or wetter conditions.","[Koontz, Michael J.; Latimer, Andrew M.; North, Malcolm P.] Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Koontz, Michael J.; Latimer, Andrew M.; North, Malcolm P.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Koontz, Michael J.] Univ Colorado, Earth Lab, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Mortenson, Leif A.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Placerville, CA USA; [Fettig, Christopher J.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Davis, CA USA; [North, Malcolm P.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Mammoth Lakes, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Koontz, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Koontz, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Koontz, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Earth Lab, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",michael.koontz@colorado.edu,,"Koontz, Michael/0000-0002-8276-210X; North, Malcolm/0000-0002-9090-784X","USDA Forest Service Western Wildlands Environmental Threat Assessment Center (WWETAC); Pacific Southwest Research Station Climate Change Competitive Grant Program; University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Open Access Fund; University of California, Davis Library Open Access Fund","USDA Forest Service Western Wildlands Environmental Threat Assessment Center (WWETAC); Pacific Southwest Research Station Climate Change Competitive Grant Program; University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Open Access Fund; University of California, Davis Library Open Access Fund","We gratefully acknowledge funding from the USDA Forest Service Western Wildlands Environmental Threat Assessment Center (WWETAC) and the Pacific Southwest Research Station Climate Change Competitive Grant Program.

The aim of this study was to investigate the factors that can potentially affect the adaptation process against climate change. This study focused on wheat farmers and farming systems in the rainfed agroecological zone of Pakistan. Farmers' data related to climate change fatalism, the availability of climate-specific extension services, socioeconomic and institutional variables, and farm characteristics were collected. A logit model to assess farmers' decisions to adopt an adaptation measure and a multinomial logit model to assess their choice of various adaptation measures were used. The results showed that fatalistic farmers were unlikely to implement climate change adaptation measures. The variables related to the climate-specific extension services, including farmers' participation in training on climate-resilient crop farming and the availability of mobile communication-based advisory services, had highly significant and positive impacts on farmers' decisions and their choice of adaptation measures. Input market access and tractor ownership also had positive and significant impacts on farmers' decisions to adapt and their choice of adaptation measures. This study highlights the need to improve rainfed-wheat farmers' education levels to change their fatalistic attitudes towards climate change. Furthermore, government action is needed to provide climate-specific extension services to ensure sustainable production levels that will ultimately lead to food and livelihood security under a changing climate.","[Mahmood, Nasir; Arshad, Muhammad; Kaechele, Harald; Ullah, Ayat; Mueller, Klaus] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, SusLAND Land Use Developing Countries, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Mahmood, Nasir] PMAS Arid Agr Univ, Dept Econ & Agr Econ, Rawalpindi 46000, Pakistan; [Kaechele, Harald] Eberswalde Univ Sustainable Dev, Dept Environm Econ, Schickler Str 5, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany; [Mahmood, Nasir; Arshad, Muhammad; Mueller, Klaus] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Shahzad, Muhammad Faisal] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Johanna Mestorf Str 5, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Arid Agriculture University; Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Kiel,"Mahmood, N (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, SusLAND Land Use Developing Countries, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.;Mahmood, N (corresponding author), PMAS Arid Agr Univ, Dept Econ & Agr Econ, Rawalpindi 46000, Pakistan.;Mahmood, N (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",nasir.mahmood@zalf.de; muhammad.arshad@zalf.de; harald.kaechele@zalf.de; fshahzad@food-econ.uni-kiel.de; Ayat.Ullah@zalf.de; kmueller@zalf.de,"Shahzad, Muhammad Faisal/ABE-5537-2020; Mahmood, Nasir/AAJ-1147-2021","Shahzad, Muhammad Faisal/0000-0003-3855-6859; Mueller, Klaus/0000-0002-4249-047X","Punjab Higher Education Commission (PHEC), Pakistan [PHEC/HRD/FS/1-19/2016/]; Fritz Thyssen Foundation [40.18.0.009]; Fiat Panis, Germany","Punjab Higher Education Commission (PHEC), Pakistan; Fritz Thyssen Foundation; Fiat Panis, Germany","The authors acknowledge financial support from Punjab Higher Education Commission (PHEC), Pakistan (Ref.

In this regard, this study aims to contribute to studies that make gender critical to understanding the way that climate change is experienced. Socially constructed gender differences have a bearing on the extent of exposure to climatic shocks, leading to various patterns of vulnerability to these shocks. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to collect data. Findings - The study finds that there is an inherent potential within the study area for equal opportunities for both men and women to address levels of vulnerability to climatic shocks and, by implication, potential to challenge patriarchal structures that tend to characterize these study areas. The contextualization of gender analysis remains elusive in the face of increasingly shifting gender roles that traditionally defined women as victims to everyday vulnerability and more recently in conjunction with climatic shocks. Originality/value - In this regard, this research contributes to emerging perspectives on the potential role of 'woman as heroine' and challenges the perception of 'woman as victim' in environmental management. Considerations for mainstreaming adaptation responses to climate change do not necessarily have to consider women as a special social group in isolation but, rather, implications for both men and women and caution that embeddedness remains key for gender considerations in any rural context.","[Mubaya, C.

As a result of climate change risks, the temporal migration strategy has been employed as an insurance strategy to cope with its impacts. This study analyses whether climate variability is a driving factor for temporal migration among agricultural households and whether such migration shields farmers from agricultural shocks. The study used three waves of the Tanzania National Panel Survey data and employed various descriptive and panel-data econometric techniques in the analyses. Results indicated that climate variability has no effect on overall agricultural production but has a significant effect on maize production, a staple food crop in Tanzania. Moreover, high market value from production was associated with a lower chance that climate variability forced a household member to migrate. In cases where climate change leads to temporal migration, the migrants may shield the household from large welfare losses by bringing back their earned income with new skills. More investments in adaptation to climate change can reduce temporal migration. This will facilitate retaining productive forces, thus boosting the rural economy where agriculture is commonly practiced.","[Chegere, Martin Julius; Mrosso, Theresia Livinus] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Sch Econ, POB 35045, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",University of Dar es Salaam,"Chegere, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Dar Es Salaam, Sch Econ, POB 35045, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.",chegeremartin@gmail.com; theresia.mrosso09@gmail.com,"Chegere, Martin/ABE-7888-2020","Chegere, Martin/0000-0003-2798-5199",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) under the Programme Grants for AERC-NORAD Collaborative Research Project on Climate Change and Economic Development in Africa [RC21594]; AERC,African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) under the Programme Grants for AERC-NORAD Collaborative Research Project on Climate Change and Economic Development in Africa; AERC,"This research was funded by African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) under the Programme Grants for AERC-NORAD Collaborative Research Project on Climate Change and Economic Development in Africa, grant number RC21594.

The purposive sample of stakeholders involved in several links of the sunflower supply chain is selected in Nouvelle Aquitaine and Occitanie. the two regions leading the French sunflower production. Results show the embeddedness of farmers' decisions in economic, social, and environmental constraints. Moreover, perceptions and concerns diverge between farmers, distributors, and seed companies. Particularly, seed companies' optimistic vision about the future of sunflower production is not shared by farmers and distributors. On the one hand, farmers expect genetics to remedy their technical issues, while distributors are concerned by their economic viability. On the other hand, seed companies focus on the Central and Eastern European markets and capitalize on the quality of the French environment for research and development. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The use and threat to use nuclear weapons, the aerial bombardment of civilians, wars of aggression, torture, the failure to mitigate global warming and adapt to climate change ecocide, along with myriad other state-corporate crimes, fill the world with death and devastation, misery and want. This article argues that criminologists have a responsibility to act as public criminologists by speaking in the prophetic voice concerning these crimes and their victims, and then acting in the political arena in an attempt to control and prevent these harms. The paper briefly describes three approaches to engaging in what Belknap (Criminology 53:1-23, 2015) calls criminology activism on these issues. The first approach is for criminologists to counter the cultures of denial and normalization that usually cover state crimes. The second involves contesting the global corporate capitalist system and the power of the American capitalist state in an effort to achieve specific progressive policy reforms and structural changes in the global political economy. Finally, criminologists can work to enhance the democratization of the international political community and strengthen the ability of specific international legal institutions to control state crimes.","[Kramer, Ronald C.] Western Michigan Univ, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA",Western Michigan University,"Kramer, RC (corresponding author), Western Michigan Univ, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.",ronald.kramer@wmich.edu,,,,,,,83,8,8,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1205-8629,1572-9877,,CRIT CRIMINOL-NETH,Crit.

In this letter we examine thermal inequity associated with climate change impacts and changes to urban form in a comparatively socio-economically disadvantaged Australian suburb. Local urban densification policies designed to counteract sprawl have reduced block sizes, increased height limits, and diminished urban tree canopy cover (UTC). Little attention has been given to the combined effects of lower UTC and increased heat on disadvantaged residents. Such impacts include rising energy expenditure to maintain thermal comfort (i.e. cooling dwellings). We used a survey of residents (n = 230) to determine their perceptions of climate change impacts; household energy costs; household thermal comfort practices; and dispositions towards using green infrastructure to combat heat. Results suggest that while comparatively disadvantaged residents spend more on energy as a proportion of their income, they appear to have reduced capacity to adapt to climate change at the household scale. We found most residents favoured more urban greening and supported tree planting in local parks and streets. Findings have implications for policy responses aimed at achieving urban climate justice.","[Byrne, Jason] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia; [Byrne, Jason] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia; [Ambrey, Christopher; Matthews, Tony] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Ctr, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia; [Portanger, Chloe] Informat Analyt Specialist Climate Planning, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Lo, Alex] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Baker, Douglas] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Davison, Aidan] Univ Tasmania, Discipline Geog & Spatial Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University; University of Hong Kong; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Tasmania,"Byrne, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia.;Byrne, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia.",jason.byrne@griffith.edu.au; c.ambrey@griffith.edu.au; chloe@climateplanning.com.au; alexloyh@hku.hk; t.matthews@griffith.edu.au; d2.baker@qut.edu.au; aidan.davison@utas.edu.au,"Lo, Alex/B-7948-2008; Byrne, Jason A/L-7140-2013; Byrne, Jason/AAC-6344-2019; Baker, Douglas C/J-1007-2012; Davison, Aidan GM/N-3863-2013","Lo, Alex/0000-0002-5953-4176; Byrne, Jason A/0000-0001-8733-0333; Baker, Douglas C/0000-0001-8812-8567; Davison, Aidan GM/0000-0002-5618-7068; Matthews, Tony/0000-0003-0838-5462",City of Gold Coast Council,City of Gold Coast Council,We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the City of Gold Coast Council in funding survey printing and mailing.

The current measures used to adapt to climate change involve avoiding crops yield decrease, however, the limitations of such measures due to water and other resources scarcity have not been well understood. Here, we quantify how the sensitivity of maize to water availability has increased because of the shift toward longer-maturing varieties during last three decades in the Chinese Maize Belt (CMB). We report that modern, longer-maturing varieties have extended the growing period by an average of 8 days and have significantly offset the negative impacts of climate change on yield. However, the sensitivity of maize production to water has increased: maize yield across the CMB was 5% lower with rainfed than with irrigated maize in the 1980s and was 10% lower (and even >20% lower in some areas) in the 2000s because of both warming and the increased requirement for water by the longer-maturing varieties. Of the maize area in China, 40% now fails to receive the precipitation required to attain the full yield potential. Opportunities for water saving in maize systems exist, but water scarcity in China remains a serious problem.","[Meng, Qingfeng; Chen, Xinping; Cui, Zhenling; Zhang, Fusuo] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Meng, Qingfeng; Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Meng, Qingfeng; Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Meng, Qingfeng] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Crop Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Meng, Qingfeng] Minist Agr, Key Lab Crop Physiol & Ecol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yi] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yang, Haishun] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA","China Agricultural University; Stanford University; Stanford University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Crop Sciences, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln","Chen, XP (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",chenxp@cau.edu.cn,"Zhang, Fusuo/AAV-4517-2021","Lobell, David/0000-0002-5969-3476; Meng, Qingfeng/0000-0003-0047-3089","Chinese National Basic research Program [2015CB150402, 2015CB150401]; National Maize Production System in China [CARS-02-24]; Innovative Group Grant of the Natural Science Foundation of China [31421092]",Chinese National Basic research Program(National Basic Research Program of China); National Maize Production System in China; Innovative Group Grant of the Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was financially supported by the Chinese National Basic research Program (2015CB150402 and 2015CB150401), the National Maize Production System in China (CARS-02-24), and the Innovative Group Grant of the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 31421092).",,37,79,84,10,127,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JAN 25,2016,6,,,,,,,,19605,10.1038/srep19605,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep19605,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,DB9DD,26804136,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000368815600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we present a method that uses remote sensing, GIS modeling and stakeholder engagement to produce a decision support tool that communicates the availability and need for green infrastructure benefits. The case study presented is the City of Tshwane, South Africa, a Global South city facing rapid urbanization. We found that this method of mapping green infrastructure benefits can provide simultaneous oversight on multiple objectives for green infrastructure, including climate change adaptation, biodiversity, and equitable distribution of urban green space. We found that low-scoring benefit areas occur in dense urban areas where small-scale nature-based solutions or rehabilitation activities are required. Moderate benefit scores occurred in parts of the city that are vulnerable to urban expansion and densification activities, warranting the careful planning of green infrastructure provision, and that moderate-to-high-scoring areas can be protected as conservation areas. The results are discussed in terms of the role of decision support tools for urban planning practice.

In parallel to this trend, a growing number of international organizations that do not have climate as their core mandates link adaptation to various issue areas, such as energy, health, and conflict resolution. Yet we still know little about how and why international organizations respond to adaptation challenges. This article develops an innovative theoretical framework to understand the factors that influence the governance responses of international organizations to adaptation challenges in the context of their respective issue areas. Our analysis reveals that there are three main and interrelated factors influencing international governance responses: problem complexity, institutional fragmentation, and fiscal pressures. We examine our framework by drawing on of two sources of data: first, a yearly large-n dataset at the level of fourteen international organizations from 2007 to 2017 created on the basis of official documents; and second, in-depth case studies of three UN agencies central in addressing three prominent issue linkages: climate-conflict, climate-health, and climate-migration.

In India, though this is an issue with major payoffs for health, livelihoods, climate change and domestic production, it often tends to be pitched exclusively as a women's issue' even as women's needs do not seem to be adequately addressed in energy policies and programs. In India, though the rationale for cooking fuel policies has moved from saving forests to empowering women, the policy thrust itself seems to be moving backwards from a focus on renewables (with the national biogas programs in the 1980s) to one on nonrenewables (with national Liquid Petroleum Gas programs today). This paper argues that in the long run, energy poverty cannot be solved only on the back of nonrenewable energy sources and exclusive cooking fuel policies while ignoring the huge potential of renewable energy sources which will enable better climate change adaptation and has the potential for building new livelihoods. It makes a case for sustainable and gender-sensitive interventions and makes feasible suggestions drawing from the learning of past policies and programs.","[Bhallamudi, Isha] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Sociol, Irvine, CA USA; [Lingam, Lakshmi] Tata Inst Social Sci, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Tata Institute of Social Sciences,"Lingam, L (corresponding author), Tata Inst Social Sci, Sch Media & Cultural Studies, VN Purav Marg, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",lakshmil@tiss.edu,,"Bhallamudi, Isha/0000-0002-5487-8308",,,,,51,6,6,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0971-8524,0973-0656,,GEND TECHNOL DEV,Gend.

After examining both sets of data, we studied the total needs of air conditioningalso referred to in the current paper as climatization needsfor Andalusia as a whole. The results indicate an increase in air conditioning needs, and we also noted that the areas adversely affected by this increase were more numerous than those which benefited, at the end of the century. It should be noted that climate change will also necessitate the gradual replacement of heating with cooling, which will require profound changes in the energy, land planning, and housing policies of the region. The true magnitude of the challenge becomes clear when the climatization degree days are related to the population which they affect; the majority of the population is located in areas where the climatization needs will increase over the course of the century.

However, concerns over the accuracies of land-cover products remain, due to the issue of validation data uncertainty. The volunteer-based Degree Confluence Project (DCP) was created in 1996, and it has been used to provide useful ground-reference information. This study aims to investigate the impact of DCP-based validation data uncertainty and the thematic issues on map accuracies. We built a reference dataset based on the DCP-interpreted dataset and applied a comparison for three existing global land-cover maps and DCP dataset-based probability maps under different classification schemes. The results of the obtained confusion matrices indicate that the uncertainty, including the number of classes and the confusion in mosaic classes, leads to a decrease in map accuracy. This paper proposes an informative classification scheme that uses a matrix structure of unaggregated land-cover and land-use classes, and has the potential to assist in the land-cover interpretation and validation processes. The findings of this study can potentially serve as a guide to select reference data and choose/define appropriate classification schemes.","[Qian, Tana; Fujii, Minoru] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Kinoshita, Tsuguki] Ibaraki Univ, Coll Agr, Ami, Ibaraki 3000393, Japan; [Bao, Yuhai] Inner Mongolia Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Hohhot 010022, Peoples R China",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Ibaraki University; Inner Mongolia Normal University,"Qian, TN (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",qian.tana@nies.go.jp; tsuguki.kinoshita.00@vc.ibaraki.ac.jp; m-fujii@nies.go.jp; baoyuhai@imnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,47,3,3,2,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2020,12,16,,,,,,,2589,10.3390/rs12162589,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12162589,,,25,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,NI6HK,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000565451800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Urban climate services require multi-disciplinary and multi-sectorial approaches and new paradigms in urban climate modelling. This paper classifies the required urban input data for both mesoscale state-of-the-art Urban Canopy Models (UCMs) and microscale Obstacle Resolving Models (ORM) into five categories and reviews the ways in which they can be obtained. The first two categories are (1) land cover, and (2) building morphology. These govern the main interactions between the city and the urban climate and the Urban Heat Island. Interdependence between morphological parameters and UCM geometric hypotheses are discussed. Building height, plan and wall area densities are recommended as the main input variables for UCMs, whereas ORMs require 3D building data. Recently, three other categories of urban data became relevant for finer urban studies and adaptation to climate change: (3) building design and architecture, (4) building use, anthropogenic heat and socio-economic data, and (5) urban vegetation data. Several methods for acquiring spatial information are reviewed, including remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) processing from administrative cadasters, expert knowledge and crowdsourcing. Data availability, data harmonization, costs/efficiency tradeoffs and future challenges are then discussed.","[Masson, Valery; de Munck, Cecile; Lemonsu, Aude; Schoetter, Robert] Univ Toulouse, Meteo France, CNRS, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Heldens, Wieke; Esch, Thomas; Zeidler, Julian] German Remote Sensing Data Ctr Land Surface, DLR, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Bocher, Erwan; Petit, Gwendall] CNRS, Lab STICC, Vannes, France; [Bonhomme, Marion; Tornay, Nathalie] Res Lab Architecture, Toulouse, France; [Bucher, Benedicte] Univ Paris Est, LaSTIG, IGN, St Mande, France; [Burmeister, Cornelia; Pavlik, Dirk] GEO NET Umweltconsulting GmbH, Dresden, Germany; [Hidalgo, Julia] Natl Ctr Sci Res CNRS, LISST Lab, Toulouse, France; [Kanani-Suehring, Farah; Maronga, Bjoern] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany; [Kwok, Yu-Ting] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Levy, Jean-Pierre] LATTS, Paris, France; [See, Linda] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Votsis, Athanasios] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Leibniz University Hannover; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Masson, V (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, Meteo France, CNRS, CNRM, Toulouse, France.",valery.masson@meteo.fr,"Bonhomme, Marion/HPC-5866-2023; Votsis, Athanasios/AAB-1817-2021; Kwok, Yu Ting/ABD-7450-2020","Kwok, Yu Ting/0000-0002-3612-748X; Votsis, Athanasios/0000-0001-5878-7684; Hidalgo, Julia/0000-0002-1764-0536",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LP1601]; FP7 [617754]; French National Agency of Research through the project applied Modelling and urbAn Planning laws: Urban Climate and Energy (MApUCE) [ANR-13-VBDU-0004]; European Union [690462],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); FP7; French National Agency of Research through the project applied Modelling and urbAn Planning laws: Urban Climate and Energy (MApUCE); European Union(European Commission),"Coauthors Burmeister, Esch, Heldens, Kanani-Suhring, Maronga, Pavlik and Zeidler express their gratitude to the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for funding grant 01LP1601 within the framework of Research for Sustainable Development (FONA; www.fona.de).Coauthor See would like to acknowledge the support of the FP7-funded ERC project CrowdLand (Grant no 617754).

However, the quality degradation of rice caused by the influence of climate change is a prevailing problem. Although there is extensive elucidation of the mechanism of the occurrence of white immature grain because of high temperatures resulting in quality degradation, there are fewer studies that incorporate this into their prediction models. In this study, a statistical model to estimate the first-grade rice ratio was developed for three major rice cultivars in Japan. Parameters for a heat-dose index were estimated by employing the particle swarm optimization method and parameters for the statistical model were estimated with the maximum likelihood method. Parameters of the statistical model varied depending on the cultivar variety. It was observed that the statistical model showed varied prediction accuracy for the first-grade rice ratio based on the temperature that was incorporated into model, that is, daily mean, maximum, or minimum temperatures. Our result can generate more accurate predictions of the impact of climate change on rice production, incorporating the farmers' choice of adaptation to climate change, including the shift in transplanting day.","[Fukui, Shin; Nishihara, Yukinaga] Waseda Univ, Fac Human Sci, 2-579-15 Mikajima, Tokorozawa, Saitama 3591192, Japan; [Fukui, Shin] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Res Ctr Fisheries Resources, Stock Management Grp,Kanazawa Ku, 2-12-4 Fukuura, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan; [Nishihara, Yukinaga] Waseda Univ, Org Reg & Interreg Studies, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Tamaki, Emi] Waseda Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Shinjuku Ku, 3-4-1 Okubo, Tokyo 1698555, Japan; [Takahashi, Daisuke] Takushoku Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 3-4-14 Kohinata, Tokyo 1128585, Japan; [Ishigooka, Yasushi] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, 3-1-3 Karmondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Yoshida, Ryuhei] Fukushima Univ, Fac Symbiot Syst Sci, 1 Kanayagawa, Fukushima, Fukushima 9601296, Japan",Waseda University; Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Waseda University; Waseda University; National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan; Fukushima University,"Fukui, S (corresponding author), Waseda Univ, Fac Human Sci, 2-579-15 Mikajima, Tokorozawa, Saitama 3591192, Japan.;Fukui, S (corresponding author), Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Res Ctr Fisheries Resources, Stock Management Grp,Kanazawa Ku, 2-12-4 Fukuura, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan.",fshin3.aoni@gmail.com,,"Fukui, Shin/0000-0003-4452-2559",Waseda University,Waseda University,We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on the manuscript.

Climate change threats to tourism include sudden damages from natural disasters, and more gradual changes in temperature, precipitation amount and seasonality, sunshine hours and humidity. Tourism Climatic Indices (TCI) consider the latter, classifying the contemporary suitability of destinations for tourism, and projecting changes in suitability under climate change. Scores are seldom compared to tourists' objective experiences of climate during vacations, or tourists' sensitivity to climate. This study assesses 5898 TripAdvisor reviews to determine the frequency of climate mentions in unstructured reviews, and the distribution of climate mentions relative to the TCI. These findings are compared to TCI results for 19 destinations in South Africa. A total of 464 TripAdvisor reviews, accounting for 7.9% of the sample, mentioned climatic conditions, highlighting the climatic suitability of South Africa for tourism. The distribution of climatic conditions mentioned in these reviews largely aligns with the TCI, but slight modifications particularly for wind speed are suggested for an improved modelling in the South African context.

We address these questions raised by CSAwithin three areas: conceptualization, implementation, and implications for policy and decision-makers. We also draw up scenarios on the future of the CSA concept in relation to the 4 per 1000 Initiative (Soils for Food Security and Climate) launched at UNFCCC 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21). Our analysis shows that there is still a need for further interdisciplinary research on the theoretical foundation of the CSA concept and on the necessary transformations of agriculture and land use systems. Contrasting views about implementation indicate that CSA focus on the triple win (adaptation, mitigation, food security) needs to be assessed in terms of science-based practices.

However, causes of continental dryness changes remain uncertain because various climate parameters control dryness. Here, we verify dominant climate variables determining dryness trends over continental eastern Asia, which is characterized by diverse hydroclimate regimes ranging from arid to humid, by quantifying the relative effects of changes in precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, surface air temperature, and relative humidity on trends in the aridity index based on observed data from 189 weather stations for the period of 1961-2010. Before the early 1980s (1961-1983), change in precipitation is a primary condition for determining aridity trends. In the later period (1984-2010), the dominant climate parameter for aridity trends varies according to the hydroclimate regime. Drying trends in arid regions are mostly explained by reduced precipitation. In contrast, the increase in potential evapotranspiration due to increased atmospheric water-holding capacity, a secondary impact of warming, works to increase aridity over the humid monsoon region despite an enhanced water supply and relatively less warming. Our results show significant drying effects of warming over the humid monsoon region in recent decades; this also supports the drying trends over warm and water-sufficient regions in future climate.","[Park, Chang-Eui; Jeong, Su-Jong] South Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Ho, Chang-Hoi; Park, Hoonyoung] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Earth Sci, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Kim, Jinwon] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Feng, Song] Univ Arkansas, Dept Geosci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Southern University of Science & Technology; Seoul National University (SNU); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville","Jeong, SJ (corresponding author), South Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",waterbell77@gmail.com,"Ho, Chang-Hoi/H-8354-2015","Park, Hoonyoung/0000-0002-7856-5218; Park, Chang-Eui/0000-0001-8792-6778; Ho, Chang-Hoi/0000-0002-1372-0037",South University of Science and Technology of China; Korea Ministry of Environment,"South University of Science and Technology of China; Korea Ministry of Environment(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)",Su-Jong Jeong and Chang-Eui Park were supported by the startup funding of the South University of Science and Technology of China.

To this end, farmers' perception and adaptation strategies for climate change have been analyzed. The data were collected from 205 respondents by means of the Focus Groups method, and they were evaluated using a framework analysis. The main reported threats related to the implementation of farming activities are the high cost of inputs and the lack of technical support, which are followed by diseases, insects, and climate variations (scarcity of rains, strong winds, and high temperature). We find that most farmers have a strong perception of changes in climatic conditions. Their perceived impacts on the local environment through evidences like the disappearance of certain farming practices, occurrence of new insects, and the disruption of key time reference periods. Farmers mainly attempt to adapt by adjusting their agricultural calendar, adopting new short-season varieties, and using mixed cropping. We find that the most influential factors for farmers' adaptation behavior is lack of contact with extension services and the scarcity of rainfall. Our suggestions for future agricultural policies for better adaptation to climate change are to take into account farmers' perception, to provide suitable climate forecast, and to improve local technical support.","[Comoe, Hermann; Barjolle, Dominique] ETH, IED, Agri Food & Agri Environm Econ Grp, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Finger, Robert] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Wageningen University & Research,"Comoe, H (corresponding author), ETH, IED, Agri Food & Agri Environm Econ Grp, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",hecomoe@ethz.ch; robert.finger@wur.nl; barjolle@ethz.ch,"Finger, Robert/A-6248-2011","Finger, Robert/0000-0002-0634-5742; Barjolle, Dominique/0000-0001-5125-9686",ETH Global,ETH Global,"The authors would like to acknowledge the North-south Centre of ETH Zurich (now ETH Global) in providing a fellowship to the first author for doctoral study at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, Switzerland.",,38,10,10,2,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

The measurement of Thunderstorm days (Td) was one of the first tools used to monitor storms. The advent of automatic detection networks on the surface has allowed us to advance in the understanding and characterization of the electrical activity in the atmosphere, locating in real-time electrical discharges and providing information over previously unrecorded regions. This work focuses on the integration of human observations at conventional meteorological stations and the data provided by the WWLLN surface discharge detection network in Argentina. The calibration methodology applied determined a mean human thunderstorm detection radius of 21 km which allowed the elaboration of isokeraunic maps for the period 2008-2017 for the region of interest. The spatial distribution of storms yielded the highest values of Td in the Argentine Northwest region with values above 100 Td center dot year(-1) followed by a relative maximum in the Argentine Northeast with 80 Td center dot year(-1) and the Sierras de Cordoba with 50 Td center dot year(-1).","[Bertone, Fiorela] Serv Meteorol Nacl, Direcc Serv Sectoriales, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Nicora, Gabriela] CITEDEF, DEILAP, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Vidal, Luciano] Serv Meteorol Nacl, Direcc Prod Modelac Ambiental & Sensores Remotos, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Bertone, F (corresponding author), Serv Meteorol Nacl, Direcc Serv Sectoriales, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",fiorebertone@gmail.com,,"Bertone, Fiorela/0000-0002-7181-9713; Nicora, M.

However, this traditional form of agriculture, with direct implications in food security at a local scale, has been suffering from abandonment or degradation worldwide. In light of this, the need to fully comprehend the complex linkage of their abandonment with different driving forces is essential. The identification of these dynamics makes possible an appropriate intervention with local initiatives and policies on a larger scale. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to introduce a comprehensive multidisciplinary framework that maps the dynamics of the investigated TAS's abandonment, by defining cause-effect relationships on a hydrogeological, ecological and social level, through tools from System Dynamics studies. This methodology is implemented in the case of Assaragh TAS, a traditional oasis agroecosystem in the Moroccan Anti-Atlas, characterized by data scarcity. Through field studies, interviews, questionnaires and freely accessible databases, the TAS's abandonment, leading to a loss in agrobiodiversity, is linked to social rather than climatic drives. Additionally, measures that can counteract the phenomenon and strengthen the awareness of the risks associated with climate change and food security are proposed.","[Boselli, Vladimiro] Univ Brescia, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Architettura Terr Ambien, Via Branze 43, I-25123 Brescia, Italy; [Ouallali, Abdessalam] Abdelmalek Essaadi Univ, Dept Geol, Ave Sebta, Tetouan 93002, Morocco; [Briak, Hamza] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Ctr Soil & Fertilizer Res Africa CESFRA, Lot 660, Hay Moulay Rachid 43150, Ben Guerir, Morocco; [Houssni, Mhammad; Kassout, Jalal; El Ouahrani, Abdeltif] Abdelmalek Essaadi Univ, Dept Biol, Ave Sebta, Tetouan 93002, Morocco; [Michailidi, Eleni Maria] Reg Veneto, Direz Difesa Suolo, Calle Priuli 99, I-30121 Venice, Italy",University of Brescia; Abdelmalek Essaadi University of Tetouan; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; Abdelmalek Essaadi University of Tetouan,"Boselli, V (corresponding author), Univ Brescia, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Architettura Terr Ambien, Via Branze 43, I-25123 Brescia, Italy.",v.boselli@unibs.it; abdessalamouallali@gmail.com; hamza.briak@um6p.ma; mhammadhoussni@gmail.com; jalalkassout@gmail.com; elouahrani@gmail.com; elenimaria.michailidi@regione.veneto.it,"Kassout, Jalal/GPC-7656-2022; Boselli, Vladimiro Andrea/GYA-1175-2022; Ouallali, Abdessalam/ABG-9555-2021; kassout, Jalal/W-5893-2018","Kassout, Jalal/0000-0002-3702-2751; Boselli, Vladimiro Andrea/0000-0003-2985-6358; Houssni, Mhammad/0000-0003-0930-5794; El Ouahrani, Abdeltif/0000-0003-1948-0836; OUALLALI, Abdessalam/0000-0003-4351-0142; BRIAK, Hamza/0000-0001-6088-5785; Michailidi, Eleni Maria/0000-0003-0754-0264",Universita degli Studi di Brescia,Universita degli Studi di Brescia,This study has been funded by V.B. with his Ph.D. research fund from the Universita degli Studi di Brescia and with his personal resources.,,108,5,5,0,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2020,12,6,,,,,,,1693,10.3390/w12061693,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12061693,,,34,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,ML4QH,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000549452000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the context of climate change adaptation strategies, a reliable and accurate assessment of the physical vulnerability to SLR is crucial. This study is a contribution to the implementation of flooding standards imposed by the European Directive 2007/60/EC, which requires each member state to assess the risk associated to SLR and floods caused by extreme events. Therefore, coastal hazard on the Atlantic Coast of Portugal's mainland was evaluated for 2025, 2050, and 2100 over the whole extension due to SLR, with different sea level scenarios for different extreme event return periods. A coastal probabilistic flooding map was produced based on the developed probabilistic cartography methodology using geographic information system (GIS) technology. The Extreme Flood Hazard Index (EFHI) was determined on probabilistic flood bases using five probability intervals of 20% amplitude. For a given SLR scenario, the EFHI is expressed, on the probabilistic flooding maps for an extreme tidal maximum level, by five hazard classes ranging from 1 (Very Low) to 5 (Extreme).","[Antunes, Carlos; Catita, Cristina] Univ Lisbon, Inst Dom Luiz, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Antunes, Carlos; Rocha, Carolina; Catita, Cristina] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Antunes, C (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Dom Luiz, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.;Antunes, C (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",cmantunes@fc.ul.pt; csirocha@fc.ul.pt; cmcatita@fc.ul.pt,"Antunes, Carlos/A-1557-2013; Rocha, Carolina/HNS-3983-2023; Catita, Cristina/K-8449-2012","Antunes, Carlos/0000-0003-1855-0425; Rocha, Carolina/0000-0001-6422-3789; catita, cristina/0000-0002-6974-1128",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [UID/GEO/50019/2019],Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This work was done under the framework of Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) project UID/GEO/50019/2019-Instituto Dom Luiz.,,23,7,7,1,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,MAY,2019,9,5,,,,,,,239,10.3390/geosciences9050239,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences9050239,,,17,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,IC4VV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000470966100048,View Full Record in Web of Science

The threshold for the entry in force of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change was achieved exactly 5 days after the unveiling of Botswana's Vision 2036 document. This development framework envisages sustainable economic development and climate change adaptation. This article uses exploratory research methodology of systematic document analysis to analyze these principles in the context of Botswana. It investigates government's intentions in achieving the third pillar of the national vision. Botswana has declared its intensions to reduce carbon emissions by 15% by 2030 through the intended nationally determined contributions. While the country's ambitions are largely forward-looking and aligned with those of the Paris Agreement, the economic diversification plans of Botswana threaten to potentially contribute significantly to the emission of greenhouse gases. The article applies sustainability and/or sustainable development theory in examining the relationship between the Paris Agreement and Botswana's vision. It concludes that there is link between the two documents, both of which are anchored of the development which is environmentally sustainable. It further concludes that developing nations should make international commitments which are aligned to their developmental plans.","[Mogomotsi, Patricia K.; Hambira, Wame L.] Univ Botswana, Okavango Res Inst, Maun, Botswana; [Mogomotsi, Goemeone E.

This paper presents a monitoring study of overheating in 122 London dwellings during the summers of 2009 and 2010. Dry Bulb Temperature and Relative Humidity in the main living and sleeping area were monitored at 10 min intervals. The ASHRAE Standard 55 adaptive thermal comfort method was applied, which uses outdoor temperature to derive the optimum indoor comfort temperature. It was found that 29% of all living rooms and 31% of all bedrooms monitored during 2009 had more than 1% of summertime occupied hours outside the comfort zone recommended by the standard to achieve 90% acceptability. In 2010, 37% of monitored living rooms and 49% of monitored bedrooms had more than 1% of summertime occupied hours outside this comfort zone. The findings of this study indicate that London dwellings face a significant risk of overheating under the current climate. Occupant exposure to excess indoor temperatures is likely to be exacerbated in the future if climate change adaptation strategies are not incorporated in Building Regulations, building design and retrofit.

Island spatiality encourages renewable energy and sustainability initiatives that emphasise iconicity and are undertaken in order to gain competitive advantage, strengthen sustainable tourism or ecotourism, claim undue credit, distract from failures of governance or obviate the need for more comprehensive policy action. Without necessarily contributing significantly to climate change mitigation, the pursuit of eco-island status can raise costs without raising income, distract from more pressing social and environmental problems, lead to competitive sustainability and provide green cover behind which communities can maintain unsustainable practices. We argue that eco-islands do not successfully encourage wider sustainable development and climate change mitigation. Instead, island communities may place themselves in eco-island traps. Islands may invest in inefficient or ineffective renewable energy and sustainability initiatives in order to maintain illusory eco-island status for the benefit of ecotourism, thereby becoming trapped by the eco-label. Islands may also chase the diminishing returns of ever-more comprehensive and difficult to achieve sustainability, becoming trapped into serving as eco-island exemplars. We conclude by arguing that island communities should pursue locally contextualised development, potentially focused on climate change adaptation, rather than focus on an eco-island status that is oriented toward place branding and ecotourism.","[Grydehoj, Adam] Isl Dynam, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark; [Grydehoj, Adam] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Inst Isl Studies, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada; [Kelman, Ilan] UCL, Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kelman, Ilan] UCL, Inst Global Hlth, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kelman, Ilan] Norwegian Inst Int Affairs, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",University of Prince Edward Island; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Grydehoj, A (corresponding author), Isl Dynam, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark.;Grydehoj, A (corresponding author), Univ Prince Edward Isl, Inst Isl Studies, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada.",agrydehoj@islanddynamics.org,"Grydehoj, Adam/GXM-9917-2022","Grydehoj, Adam/0000-0002-9149-9497; Kelman, Ilan/0000-0002-4191-6969",,,,,44,57,57,1,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-0894,1475-4762,,AREA,Area,MAR,2017,49,1,,,,,106,113,,10.1111/area.12300,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/area.12300,,,8,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,EN9VW,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000396348700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) is one such model that continues to be applied and adapted to this challenging research agenda. From its inception twenty years ago, APSIM has evolved into a framework containing many of the key models required to explore changes in agricultural landscapes with capability ranging from simulation of gene expression through to multi-field farms and beyond. Keating et al. (2003) described many of the fundamental attributes of APSIM in detail. Much has changed in the last decade, and the APSIM community has been exploring novel scientific domains and utilising software developments in social media, web and mobile applications to provide simulation tools adapted to new demands. This paper updates the earlier work by Keating et al. (2003) and chronicles the changing external challenges and opportunities being placed on APSIM during the last decade. It also explores and discusses how APSIM has been evolving to a next generation framework with improved features and capabilities that allow its use in many diverse topics.
