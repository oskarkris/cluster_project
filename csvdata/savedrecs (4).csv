Consequently, those experiences might translate into the adoption of pro-environmental behaviours. Understanding this relationship is fundamental for the successful design of policies aimed towards promoting the adoption of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. This work contributes to the literature by showing that there is in fact a positive relation between experiencing an extreme weather event and willingness to take pro-environmental actions. The prevailing available evidence is for developed countries. Our empirical analysis is based on a nationally representative sample of households from Mexico, a developing country that is highly vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather events.","[Lopez-Feldman, Alejandro] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Vasagatan 1, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Lopez-Feldman, Alejandro] Ctr Invest & Docencia Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Gonzalez, Emilio] Banco Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",University of Gothenburg; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Stakeholder analysis was performed to identify and characterize stakeholders based on their power and interest criteria and to assess their linkages and roles in quality coffee production. Additionally, a household survey with coffee farmers (stratified into quality coffee farmers and conventional coffee farmers) was conducted to assess coffee farmers' level of satisfaction of with various forms of support provided to them by the stakeholders. The stakeholders analysis revealed that stakeholders possessed different degrees of power and interest in quality coffee production. While government agencies were more powerful in decisions and actions related to quality coffee production, coffee farmers (key actors) were less powerful. The household survey revealed that quality coffee farmers tended to have stronger linkages with stakeholders than conventional coffee farmers. The authors conclude that quality coffee production was the result of efforts from multiple stakeholders, and they suggest that policy interventions to enhance collaborative quality coffee production through empowering stakeholders in decision-making processes in the coffee value chain are important to make the coffee-based livelihoods sustainable and resilient to climate change.","[Adane, Asnake] Wollo Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Dessi, Ethiopia; [Bewket, Woldeamlak] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Adane, A (corresponding author), Wollo Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Dessi, Ethiopia.",asnake.adane@wu.edu.et,,"Adane, Asnake/0000-0002-2510-4629",Research Council of Norway [255664],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"The Research Council of Norway is thanked for funding the project `The Role of Global Value Chains in Transitions to Sustainability' (Project number 255664) and the University of Oslo is thanked for hosting the first author as a guest researcher for six months.

The discourse on climate change and adaptation has also included the awareness that adaptation must take place at all levels of government, particularly local government. Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on the physical, social, environmental and economic environments of coastal cities and towns, and in particular on the poor and vulnerable communities within these cities and towns. The crucial role that local government can play in climate protection and building cities' and communities' resilience to climate change is widely recognised at the global level. This paper explores the legal and policy connexion between ICM, local government and climate change in Mozambique and South Africa, two developing countries in Africa. The state of institutionalisation of coastal management at national through to local government is also examined. The authors contend that the state, character and maturity of the ICM policy domain can create an enabling environment within which local government agencies can prepare for future impacts of climate change. Conversely it can also limit, delay and hinder climate change adaptation. The paper concludes with the identification of some key success factors for assessing the effectiveness of the existing policy and legal frameworks to respond to the challenges of climate change. It also identifies some key principles to be included in future legislative reform to promote ICM, cooperative governance and greater preparedness for climate change at local government level.

Excessive wetness is known to cause substantial damage to maize yields, but the heterogeneous impacts on yields based on growing stage, regional climate, and management practices are not well researched; additionally, it is uncertain how well state-of-the-art process-based crop models reproduce those responses. This study evaluated the impacts of excessive wetness on statistical and crop-model-simulated maize yields in China, with a special focus on the differences among growing stages, mean climatology, and irrigation, fertilization regimes and soil properties. Statistical maize yields exhibited negative responses to excessive wetness, with yield damage of 6%. Maize yield was most sensitive to excessive wetness in the flowering-tomaturity stage. Maize yields in wetter or colder counties, or places with a greater proportion of irrigation, nitrogen application rates and soil organic carbon, tended to be affected more severely. Multiple crop model ensemble simulations tended to over optimistically report positive maize yield responses to excessive wetness. Research on heterogeneous impacts of excessive wetness on maize yields could benefit agricultural risk management and improve process-based models.","[Liu, Weihang; Li, Zitong; Ye, Tao; Chen, Shuo; Liu, Yiqing] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Weihang; Li, Zitong; Ye, Tao; Chen, Shuo; Liu, Yiqing] Beijing Normal Univ, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disasters, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Li, Yan] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Land Surface Syst & Sustainable Dev, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Weihang; Li, Zitong; Ye, Tao; Chen, Shuo; Liu, Yiqing] Minist Educ Minist Emergency Management, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Weihang; Li, Zitong; Li, Yan; Ye, Tao; Chen, Shuo; Liu, Yiqing] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Ye, Tao] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol E, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Ye, T (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol E, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",yetao@bnu.edu.cn,,"Liu, Weihang/0000-0002-0732-4898",National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171075]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology of China [2022-ZD-06]; Program of Introducing Talent to Universities (111 Project) [BP0820003],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology of China; Program of Introducing Talent to Universities (111 Project),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42171075), State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology of China (2022-ZD-06), and the Program of Introducing Talent to Universities (111 Project, Grant No. BP0820003).",,51,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1923,1873-2240,,AGR FOREST METEOROL,Agric.

This presents a challenge to decision makers when trying to identify robust measures. This paper presents an integrated uncertainty analysis to quantify not only the overall uncertainty of individual adaptation scenarios, but also the net uncertainty between adaptation alternatives for a direct comparison of their efficiency. Further, a sensitivity analysis is used to assess the relative contribution of inherent uncertainties in the assessment. A Danish case study shows that the uncertainties in relation to assessing the present hazards and vulnerabilities (e.g., input runoff volume, threshold for damage, and costing of floods) are important to the overall uncertainty, thus contributing substantially to the overall uncertainty in relation to decisions on action or in-action. Once a decision of action has been taken, the uncertainty of the hazards under the current climate, and also the magnitude of future climate change, are less important than other uncertainties such as discount rate and the cost of implementing the adaptation measures. The proposed methodology is an important tool for achieving an explicit uncertainty description of climate adaptation strategies and provides a guide for further efforts (e.g., field data collection) to improve decision-making in relation to climate change.","[Zhou, Qianqian] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Transportat Engn, Waihuan Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Qianqian; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Urban Water Syst Sect, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Guangdong University of Technology; Technical University of Denmark,"Arnbjerg-Nielsen, K (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Urban Water Syst Sect, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",qiaz@foxmail.com; karn@env.dtu.dk,"Zhou, Qianqian/GXG-4345-2022; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/J-7792-2012","Zhou, Qianqian/0000-0003-3692-9498; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/0000-0002-6221-9505",,,,,43,2,2,2,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,DEC,2018,10,12,,,,,,,1877,10.3390/w10121877,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10121877,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HG9GB,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000455314300172,View Full Record in Web of Science

Without due attention, to maintain existing progress on Sustainable Development Goal 6's target 6.2 and to increase it to meet ambitions for 2030 will be difficult. City governments need new forms of evidence to respond, as well as approaches to enable them to consider sufficient breadth of strategies to adapt effectively. This paper describes a co-production research process which engaged local governments in four cities in Indonesia experiencing different climate hazards. Local government engagement took place across three stages of (i) inception and design, (ii) participation as key informants and (iii) joint analysis and engagement on the findings. We adapted and simplified a risk prioritisation process based on current literature and employed a novel framework of a 'climate resilient sanitation system' to prompt articulation of current and proposed climate change adaptation response actions. In contrast to many current framings of climate resilience in sanitation that focus narrowly on technical responses, the results paint a rich picture of efforts needed by city governments across all domains, including planning, institutions, financing, infrastructure and management options, user awareness, water cycle management and monitoring and evaluation. Local government commitment and improved comprehension on the implications of climate change for sanitation service delivery were key outcomes arising from the co-production process. With strengthened policy and capacity building initiatives from national level, this foundation can be supported, and Indonesian city governments will be equipped to move forward with adaptation actions that protect on-going access to sanitation services, public health and the environment.","[Willetts, Juliet; Kohlitz, Jeremy; Mills, Freya] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Priadi, Cindy; Ombasta, Osha; Wulandari, Dwica; Imtiyaz, Inas] Univ Indonesia, Fac Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Depok, Indonesia; [Ombasta, Osha] Kajian Ufuk Indonesia Fdn, Depok, Indonesia; [Sudhiastiningsih, Ni Nyoman Sri Natih] Univ Indonesia, Dept Anthropol, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Depok, Indonesia; [Listyasari, Maraita] UNICEF, Jakarta, Indonesia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Indonesia; University of Indonesia,"Willetts, J (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",Juliet.Willetts@uts.edu.au,,"Priadi, Cindy Rianti/0000-0002-5423-3446; Willetts, Juliet/0000-0002-3975-9642; Wulandari, Dwica/0000-0002-7612-286X",UNICEF Indonesia [LRPS-2019-9153605],UNICEF Indonesia,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by UNICEF Indonesia [LRPS-2019-9153605].",,55,1,1,6,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2399-8083,2399-8091,,ENVIRON PLAN B-URBAN,Env.

Concerned that climate hazards will threaten settlement viability and provoke widespread, unplanned migration, global discourse overwhelmingly characterizes relocation as a voluntary, last resort effort to resettle and rebuild communities in safer areas. Over the past decade, scholars have investigated where and why climate-related relocation materializes and how it functions as an adaptation (or otherwise). This article systematically reviews the scientific literature, concluding that climate-related relocation is a more diverse and complex process than recognized within dominant research efforts and policy narratives. While climate-related relocation is sometimes a function of environmental migration pressures and adaptation imperatives, recent critical scholarship shows that climate-related relocation processes are embedded in historical responses to environment and development problems and unfold through political negotiation, discourse, and the social construction of risk and response. In practice, adaptive relocation frequently involves population redistribution (villagization and sedentarization) as well as resettlement, is often proactive and involuntary, and risks (re)producing maladaptive outcomes. Based on this analysis, I argue for an expanded research and policy agenda centered around a pluralistic conceptual framework that respects the diversity of relocation efforts undertaken as adaptation.","[Marter-Kenyon, Jessica] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30605 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Marter-Kenyon, J (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30605 USA.",jsmk@uga.edu,,"Marter-Kenyon, Jessica/0000-0001-5145-8714",,,,,137,4,4,4,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-0196,2053-020X,,ANTHROPOCENE REV,Anthr.

The aim is to: (i) identify the state-of-the-art scientific approaches of adaptation of urban drainage networks to climate change; (ii) assess whether or not these approaches incorporated monetization of the adaptation practices and the assodated costs/benefits; and ( iii) define a novel approach (Blueprint) for the future development and assessment of urban drainage network adaptation to climate change and other drivers. First, the motivation is provided that makes urban drainage adaptation a globally relevant issue. Second, the main impacts of climate change on precipitation, flooding and urban drainage systems are discussed. Then, current practices are described. Finally, a blueprint for an integrated urban adaptation framework to climate change and other drivers is proposed. Our research indicated that future quantity and quality of urban runoff is not widely addressed in the scientific literature. The Storm Water Management Model is the most widely used software in modeling adaptation options. Solutions such as plans of maintenance and rehabilitation, public awareness, flood forecasting and warning, mobility measures and insurance measures are not widely reflected in the literature. Uncertainties of climate projections and bias correction methods are still significant, and uncertainties of socio-economic scenarios, hydrologic and hydrodynamic models, and adaptation options are not fully addressed. Finally, environmental cost and benefits associated with the ecosystem services provided by the adaptation options are not fully addressed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Earlier research on natural hazards and climate change adaptation has found that demographic and socioeconomic factors influence the way individuals prepare for and are affected by natural hazards. However, research often focuses on areas with high exposure and vulnerability and research on low exposure and vulnerability areas is scarcer. To address this gap, we ask: do socioeconomic and demographic factors matter in how individuals prepare for and are affected by storms in Finland? Our data consist of an internet survey (n = 1014) conducted after a severe winter storm hit Finland in the beginning of 2019, and we analyze the data with Chi-squared tests and logistic regressions. Our results show that respondents? education level or employment status are not connected to whether they took preparedness measures or whether they experienced harm. Instead, the type of residential property does play a part. In addition, respondents who had experienced storm-related harm during recent years are more likely to prepare than those who have not. In conclusion, socio-demographic factors seem to have only marginal influence on storm preparedness or experienced impacts in Finland, which contradicts earlier research. This may stem from the relatively equal distribution of well-being among the population.","[Nikkanen, Maija; Rasanen, Aleksi; Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Nikkanen, Maija; Rasanen, Aleksi; Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Nikkanen, M (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",maija.nikkanen@helsinki.fi,"Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282; Nikkanen, Maija/0000-0002-4970-3116; Rasanen, Aleksi/0000-0002-3629-1837",Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation,Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation,This work was supported by the Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation.,,61,4,4,4,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Governments must also be careful to design institutions that encourage efficiency or they could inadvertently increase the damages from climate change.

This study examined farmers' adaptation behavior with respect to subjective, socio-demographic, institutional, and physical variables. Focus group discussions with 205 farmers and large-scale surveys involving 800 farmers' households were conducted in both study areas for data collection. The data were analyzed using a categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA), reliability analyses, and binary logistic regression models to determine relevant influences on farmers' adaptation behavior. The results revealed that 77% of farmers perceived high increases in temperature and 75% perceived strong decreases in rainfall over the last 10 years. Farmers in Toumodi perceived more climate change than their colleagues in Korhogo. In addition, farmers from Korhogo perceived more new pests (81%) and new weeds (87%), while those from Toumodi agreed that there were strong changes in flowering and fruiting times (54%). Furthermore, two main adaptation groups were identified: changes in the sowing management and the technical itinerary. The levels of implemented strategies differed significantly across regions. Factors such as the perceived occurrence of new pests and insects and support from national and international organizations were relevant to farmers' decision to adapt to climate change. Moreover, the agro-ecological specificities, the types of food crops, and the owners of livestock had also an influence on farmers' adaptation choices. The appropriate policy response should henceforth integrate these factors to support efficient adaptation processes in response to climate change in Cote d'Ivoire.","[Comoe, Hermann] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Agr Econ AGECON, Inst Environm Decis, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Siegrist, Michael] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Comoe, H (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Agr Econ AGECON, Inst Environm Decis, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",hecomoe@ethz.ch; msiegrist@ethz.ch,,,,,,,55,34,35,0,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

The game design builds on the key goals in Education for Sustainable Development combining comprehensive views, action competence, learner engagement and pluralism. This study draws on game sessions and surveys with high school students in Sweden, and aims to assess to what extent different aspects of the game can support an increased understanding of the needs and benefits of adaptation actions. The results of this study indicate that the game can engage players to reflect upon challenges related to climate adaptation decision making, but also point towards the challenge of including a high degree of complexity which can make it difficult to grasp consequences of individual measures, as well as to link these to the natural variability of the occurrence of extreme climatic events.","[Neset, Tina-Simone; Navarra, Carlo] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Andersson, Lotta] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Uhrqvist, Ola] Linkoping Univ, Dept Behav Sci & Learning, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Linkoping University,"Neset, TS (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",tina.neset@liu.se; lotta.andersson@smhi.se; ola.uhrqvist@liu.se; carlo.navarra@liu.se,"Uhrqvist, Ola/ABG-8360-2020","Neset, Tina-Simone/0000-0003-1151-9943; Navarra, Carlo/0000-0001-9892-8875","Swedish National Knowledge Centre for Climate Change Adaptation, based at SMHI","Swedish National Knowledge Centre for Climate Change Adaptation, based at SMHI","This research was funded by the Swedish National Knowledge Centre for Climate Change Adaptation, based at SMHI.",,52,14,14,5,33,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR 1,2020,12,5,,,,,,,1789,10.3390/su12051789,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12051789,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KY3KU,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000522470900090,View Full Record in Web of Science

We also outline future endeavors that we see as next steps toward uncovering quantitative signatures of stress, including new advances in both VOC data collection and analysis of big data.","[Kravitz, Ben] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, POB 999,MSIN K9-30, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Guenther, Alex B.; Seco, Roger] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, 3200 Croul Hall St, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Gu, Lianhong] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Karl, Thomas] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Atmospher & Crysopher Sci, Innrain 52f, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Kaser, Lisa] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Pallardy, Stephen G.] Univ Missouri, Dept Forestry, 203 Anheuser Busch Nat Resources Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Penuelas, Josep] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Penuelas, Josep] CSIC, Global Ecol Unit CREAF CSIC UAB, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Potosnak, Mark J.] Depaul Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Studies, McGowan South,Suite 203, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Irvine; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of Innsbruck; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); DePaul University,"Kravitz, B (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, POB 999,MSIN K9-30, Richland, WA 99352 USA.",ben.kravitz@pnnl.gov,"Karl, Thomas/D-1891-2009; Seco, Roger/F-7124-2011; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Guenther, Alex B/B-1617-2008; Gu, Lianhong/H-8241-2014","Karl, Thomas/0000-0003-2869-9426; Seco, Roger/0000-0002-2078-9956; Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Guenther, Alex B/0000-0001-6283-8288; Gu, Lianhong/0000-0001-5756-8738; Potosnak, Mark/0000-0003-2927-3806","EMSL, a DOE Office of Science user facility - Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC05-76RL01830]; National Science Foundation; European Research Council [SyG-2013-610028 IMBALANCE-P]","EMSL, a DOE Office of Science user facility - Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission)","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

Considering this, the study seeks to comprehend the factors influencing farmers' adaptation strategies to cope with climate change in coastal Bangladesh (Koyra Upazila, Khulna). In order to achieve the objectives, descriptive, multivariate, and binary logistic regressions were used to analyze the data. Findings demonstrate that the most often used adaptation strategies were crop, water, and infrastructure management. Regression result shows that factors such as gender, labor in the family, farming experience, and the damaged sector are important factors in determining how well adaption methods are implemented. Binary logistic regression analysis explains that age (p= <= 0.041), income (p = <= 0.037), and farm size (p <= 0.005) are significant factors in deciding on a new adaption option. The outcomes of this research can be used to reevaluate current frameworks and strategies for coping with climate change and to identify the factors that influence policy formulation. In order to improve the water management system for agriculture, policies such as Cash-for-Work (CFW) and Employment Generation Programme for the Poorest (EGPP) may be used to boost local agriculture.","[Ahmed, Shabbir; Fatema, Nuzhat] Khulna Univ Bangladesh, Dev Studies, Khulna, Bangladesh; [Ahmed, Shabbir] Power & Participat Res Ctr PPRC, Dhaka, Bangladesh",,"Ahmed, S (corresponding author), Khulna Univ Bangladesh, Dev Studies, Khulna, Bangladesh.;Ahmed, S (corresponding author), Power & Participat Res Ctr PPRC, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",shabbiribnshahidullah@gmail.com,"Fatema, Nuzhat/ACE-1783-2022","Fatema, Nuzhat/0000-0001-9780-4301; Ahmed, Shabbir/0000-0003-0756-3239",,,,,84,0,0,9,9,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",2040-2244,2408-9354,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

The Paris Agreement highlighted the exigency of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. At present, however, the world's most effort is devoted to the means of carbon emission reduction, while neglecting adaptation, the other half that cannot be neglected in the climate equation. A series of studies have proven the huge potential of nature-based and nature-adapted approaches in building a climate-resilient living environment. In recent years, nature-based green infrastructures and climate-adaptive sponge cities are receiving unprecedented attention.

Objective: To assess New York State Local Health Department officials' perceptions and preparedness related to climate-sensitive health areas, and compare these with a national sample. Design: Online survey instrument, originally used in a national survey of local health department (LHD) officials. Setting: New York State. Participants: Eligible participants included all New York State city and county LHD officials, 1 respondent per LHD. Main Outcome Measures: LHD officials' perceptions of (1) local climate-related public health effects, (2) preparation status and programming areas of LHDs, and (3) necessary resources to better address climate-related health risks. Results: Survey participants, representing a 54% response rate (with 93% of respondents completing more than 90% of the questions), perceived climate change as relevant to public health, and most noted that some of their existing programs already use or are planning to use climate adaptation strategies. Overall, fewer New York State respondents identified concerns or related expertise compared with the previous national survey. Many respondents expressed uncertainty regarding necessary additional resources. Conclusions: This type of assessment makes clear the high variability in perceived impacts and capacity at the level of LHD jurisdictions, and underscores the importance of sustained support for local climate-change preparedness programming. The implications of these findings are germane to other states with similar decentralized jurisdiction of public health. Findings from such surveys can bolster existing LHD programs, as well as inform long-term and emergency planning for climate change.","[Carr, Jessie L.; Kinney, Patrick L.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, New York, NY USA; [Sheffield, Perry E.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Pediat, New York, NY USA; [Sheffield, Perry E.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"Carr, JL (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",jlcarr@pitt.edu,"Kinney, Patrick L/H-7914-2012",,NICHD NIH HHS [T32 HD049311] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,22,16,17,0,12,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1078-4659,1550-5022,,J PUBLIC HEALTH MAN,J.

Consequently, the effect of different and interconnected physical, technical and economic factors must be modeled in order to estimate the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity. Such modeling commonly makes use of indicators that summarize the among environmental factors that are considered when farmers plan their activities. This study uses net evapotranspiration (ETN), estimated using EPIC, as a proxy index for the physical factors considered by farmers when managing irrigation. Recent trends suggest that the probability distribution function of ETN may continue to change in the near future due to changes in the irrigation needs of crops. Also, water availability may continue to vary due to changes in the rainfall regime. The impacts of the uncertainties related to these changes on costs are evaluated using a Discrete Stochastic Programming model representing an irrigable Mediterranean area where limited water is supplied from a reservoir. In this context, adaptation to climate change can be best supported by improvements to the collective irrigation systems, rather than by measures aimed at individual farms such as those contained within the rural development policy.","[Dono, Gabriele; Cortignani, Raffaele; Giraldo, Luca] Univ Tuscia, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Agr Foreste Nat & Energ, Viterbo, Italy; [Doro, Luca; Ledda, Luigi; Roggero, Pier Paolo] Univ Sassari, Nucleo Ric Desertificaz, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Ledda, Luigi; Roggero, Pier Paolo] Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Agr, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Pasqui, Massimiliano] CNR, Ist Biometerol IBIMET, Florence, Italy",Tuscia University; University of Sassari; University of Sassari; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Biometeorologia (IBIMET-CNR),"Dono, G (corresponding author), Univ Tuscia, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Agr Foreste Nat & Energ, Viterbo, Italy.",dono@unitus.it,"Roggero, Pier Paolo/D-2580-2012; Doro, Luca/AAA-5596-2021; Cortignani, Raffaele/ABF-9897-2021; Pasqui, Massimiliano/F-8259-2010; Ledda, Luigi/E-2649-2012; Ledda, Luigi/AAY-6332-2021; Pasqui, Massimiliano/M-9971-2019","Roggero, Pier Paolo/0000-0002-7269-4334; Cortignani, Raffaele/0000-0002-2685-9783; Pasqui, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0926-362X; Ledda, Luigi/0000-0001-5337-5701; Pasqui, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0926-362X; DORO, Luca/0000-0003-1404-2255; Dono, Gabriele/0000-0002-0272-178X",Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali),Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali),This study was carried out under the Agroscenari project (www.agroscenari.it) funded by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali).,,33,21,21,3,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Adaptive Pathways (AP) planning is receiving increased attention as a method to guide adaptation planning in the face of uncertainties. The approach has been most extensively developed and applied in large, well-funded contexts such as the Thames Barrier and Dutch Delta program. However, the development of AP planning has focused much less on the parallel need for engaging with the challenge of ambiguity-that there are diverse, sometimes contending, knowledges, values, and stakes involved. A more nascent body of work has been exploring ways of engaging with both the uncertainties and ambiguities of adaptation through various participatory approaches to AP planning. This paper sought to synthesise insights from this emerging work. Examining the peer-reviewed and grey literature identified eight cases from four countries across five different policy issues that provided details of how they approached diverse participation. Analysis of this small suite of cases provided some key insights for those seeking to use participatory approaches to AP planning to engage with the inherent uncertainties and (arguably necessary) ambiguities of adaptation. The paper concludes with a call for greater publication of details regarding how participatory approaches to methods such as AP planning have been undertaken not just what was undertaken.","[Bosomworth, K.] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Climate Change Transformat Grp, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Gaillard, E.] RMIT Univ, Climate Change & Resilience Grp, Ctr Urban Res, Res 4, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Bosomworth, K (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Climate Change Transformat Grp, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",karyn.bosomworth@rmit.edu.au,"Bosomworth, Karyn/A-6435-2016","Bosomworth, Karyn/0000-0001-9907-0858; Gaillard, Estelle/0000-0002-7294-7047","RMIT University, Melbourne Australia","RMIT University, Melbourne Australia","The research from which this paper draws was funded by RMIT University, Melbourne Australia.",,102,21,22,3,22,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

In many countries, coastlines are a key contested territory for planning for climate change, and also locations where development and conservation conflicts play out. As a test bed for climate change adaptation, coastal regions provide valuable, but highly diverse experiences and lessons. This paper sets out to explore the lessons of coastal planning and development for the implementation of proactive adaptation, and the possibility to move from adaptation visions to actual adaptation governance and planning. Using qualitative analysis of interviews and workshops, we first examine what the barriers are to proactive adaptation at the coast, and how current policy and practice frames are leading to avoidable lock-ins and other maladaptive decisions that are narrowing our adaptation options. Using examples from UK, we then identify adaptation windows that can be opened, reframed or transformed to set the course for proactive adaptation which links high level top-down legislative requirements with local bottom-up actions. We explore how these windows can be harnessed so that space for proactive adaptation increases and maladaptive decisions are reduced.","[Brown, Katrina; Quinn, Tara] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Geog, Amory Bldg Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Naylor, Larissa A.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Exeter; University of Glasgow,"Brown, K (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Geog, Amory Bldg Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",katrina.brown@exeter.ac.uk; Larissa.Naylor@glasgow.ac.uk; T.Quinn@exeter.ac.uk,"Naylor, Larissa/E-7301-2014","Naylor, Larissa/0000-0002-4065-2674; Brown, Katrina/0000-0002-5426-5288; Quinn, Tara/0000-0002-5375-6085","Belmont Forum by the Natural Environment Research Council [NE/L008807/1, NE/M010546/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/M010546/1, NE/K010484/1, NE/L008807/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/K010484/1, NE/M010546/1, NE/L008807/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Belmont Forum by the Natural Environment Research Council; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was supported through the Belmont Forum by the Natural Environment Research Council Multi-scale adaptations to global change in coasts, project number NE/L008807/1; and Developing a sustainable, ecosystem-based coastal climate change adaptation routemap for policymakers and practitioners, project number NE/M010546/1.

The impacts of climate change are especially tangible in dense urban areas due to the inherent characteristics of urban structure and materiality. To assess impacts of densification on urban climate and potential adaptation strategies a densely populated Viennese district was modeled as a typical sample area for the city of Vienna. The case study analyzed the large-scale densification potential and its potential effects on microclimate, air flow, comfort, and energy demand by developing 3D models of the area showing the base case and densification scenarios. Three methods were deployed to assess the impact of urban densification: Micro-climate analysis (1) explored urban heat island phenomena, wind pattern analysis (2) investigated ventilation and wind comfort at street level, and energy and indoor climate comfort analysis (3) compared construction types and greening scenarios and analyzed their impact on the energy demand and indoor temperatures. Densification has negative impacts on urban microclimates because of reducing wind speeds and thus weakening ventilation of street canyons, as well as accelerating heat island effects and associated impact on the buildings. However, densification also has daytime cooling effects because of larger shaded areas. On buildings, densification may have negative effects especially in the new upper, sun-exposed floors. Construction material has less impact than glazing area and rooftop greening. Regarding adaptation to climate change, the impacts of street greening, green facades, and green roofs were simulated: The 24-h average mean radiant temperature (MRT) at street level can be reduced by up to 15 K during daytime. At night there is only a slight reduction by a few tenths of 1 K MRT. Green facades have a similar effect on MRT reduction, while green roofs show only a slight reduction by a few tenths of 1 K MRT on street level. The results show that if appropriate measures were applied, negative effects of densification could be reduced, and positive effects could be achieved.","[Loibl, Wolfgang; Etminan, Ghazal] AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Giefinggasse 6, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Vuckovic, Milena] VRVis Zentrum Virtual Real & Visualisierung Forsc, Donau City Str 11, A-1220 Vienna, Austria; [Ratheiser, Matthias; Tschannett, Simon] Gardegasse 3,Weatherpark GmbH, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Oesterreicher, Doris] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Spatial Planning Environm Planning & Land Re, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Loibl, W (corresponding author), AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Giefinggasse 6, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",wolfgang.loibl@ait.ac.at; vuckovic@vrvis.at; ghazal.etminan@ait.ac.at; matthias.ratheiser@weatherpark.com; simon.tschannett@weatherpark.com; doris.oesterreicher@boku.ac.at,,"Vuckovic, Milena/0000-0002-5825-8237; Osterreicher, Doris/0000-0003-3988-4889","Austrian Climate and Energy Fund [KR17AC0K13790, B769976]",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund,"This research was funded within the project CLUDEX-Climate Change and urban densification impact exploration-heat exposure reduction through roof scape adaptation-a large scale case study under the 10th Call of the Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP) by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund, Grant number KR17AC0K13790, Project Number B769976.",,53,9,9,6,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,APR,2021,12,4,,,,,,,511,10.3390/atmos12040511,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12040511,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,RQ9ME,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000642734900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The international development community plays an important role in supporting SIDS adapt to climatic changes, and calls for increased international commitment have been made. However, how the vulnerability of SIDS to climate change is being conceptualised and, subsequently, how adaptation programmes are conceived and designed by the international development community are yet to be critically explored. Using Timor-Leste as a case study, this study examines the conceptual trends underpinning 32 donor-led adaptation programmes implemented from 2010 to the present date. Results show that donor-led adaptation programmes continue to conceptualise climate change vulnerability as a biophysical issue rather than a consequence of the dynamic interactions between political, institutional, economic and social structures. Adaptation policy responses therefore have limited ability to target more nuanced and broader-scale structures affecting SIDS and may be falling short in their efforts to reduce the vulnerability of SIDS. We argue that it is critical that the international development community re-conceptualise its approach to vulnerability reduction in SIDS. We conclude by highlighting how the Paris Agreement, with its expanding understanding of vulnerability, can act as a useful instrument to promote such changes.","[Barrowman, Hannah Maree] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 48 Linnaeus Way, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Kumar, Mahendra] Australian Natl Univ, Climate Change Inst, 48 Linnaeus Way, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University,"Barrowman, HM (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 48 Linnaeus Way, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",hannah.barrowman@anu.edu.au; mahendra.kumar@anu.edu.au,,,Australian Government under the Research Training Programme (RTP) Scholarship,Australian Government under the Research Training Programme (RTP) Scholarship,This study received financial support from the Australian Government under the Research Training Programme (RTP) Scholarship.,,66,10,10,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The increasing variations in heavy monsoon rains in South Asia have been primarily linked to this human-induced phenomenon. Torrential rains in the monsoon season cause regular flash flooding in many urban areas of Pakistan. Poor infrastructure, weak governance, and lack of corrective disaster risk reduction have exacerbated climate risk and vulnerabilities. Thus, it is pertinent to undertake preparedness and adaptation measures to safeguard lives and reduce economic damages. Numerous methodologies have been developed to identify factors affecting such actions. This study proposes a novel methodology by integrating the statistical and artificial intelligence techniques to identify determinants of disaster preparedness and climate change adaptation, i.e., the three-step neural approach. The methodology was tested in two monsoon-affected areas of Lahore metropolitan, Pakistan. Using the Yamane sampling method, 400 samples were collected through household questionnaires. Data regarding monsoon flood risk perception, psychological distance to climate change, preparedness, and adaptation measures were collected. Regression analysis was used to shortlist the influential socioeconomic indicators. A multi-layer perceptron neural network was then used to reconfirm the influence of these indicators. The prediction testing shows the high accuracy of this approach. The proposed methodology was found robust and operational for successfully predicting the socioeconomic determinants. It can be easily modified and streamlined for testing in the context of other natural hazards and regions.","[Rana, Irfan Ahmad; Lodhi, Rida Hameed; Zia, Azka] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn SCEE, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Jamshed, Ali] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning IREUS, Stuttgart, Germany; [Nawaz, Adnan] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Civil Engn, Wah Campus, Rawalpindi, Pakistan",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; University of Stuttgart; COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),"Rana, IA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn SCEE, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",irfanrana90@hotmail.com; ali.jamshed@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; adnan.nawaz@ciitwah.edu.pk,"Rana, Irfan Ahmad/C-2560-2017","Rana, Irfan Ahmad/0000-0002-3157-1186",,,,,110,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,SEP,2022,45,,,,,,,,101266,10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101266,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101266,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,7Y0FJ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000914566200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

A Rankine cycle, an organic Rankine cycle, and a reverse osmosis desalination unit are fully integrated for clean power, cooling, and freshwater production employing. The thermo-mathematical model was evaluated considering thermodynamic efficiencies, annual costs, exergorisk, and global warming potential in a stand-alone and comparative framework. The water utilization of the hot utility was compared with two traditional fossil fuels by conducting a waterexergy nexus analysis. The analytical results showed that most of the total exergy destruction (73%) occurred in the solar collectors. The proposed system had 0.0171 $.MWh-1 cost of energy and an exergy efficiency of 57.29 % by employing R11. Compared to a natural gas-fired utility, the proposed solar-powered system reduced freshwater withdrawal, and consumption by 16 and 13 times, respectively. The system could achieve the exergetic efficiency of 74.37 % with the cost of energy of 0.013 $.MW-1 in a parametric model. Finally, R365mfc emerged as the optimal fluid for the proposed system by satisfying all performance criteria.","[Tariq, Shahzeb; Safder, Usman; Nguyen, Hai Tra; Ifaei, Pouya; Heo, SungKu; Yoo, ChangKyoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Appl Environm Sci, Coll Engn, Integrated Engn, 1732 Deogyeong Daero, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Yoo, C (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Appl Environm Sci, Coll Engn, Integrated Engn, 1732 Deogyeong Daero, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",ckyoo@khu.ac.kr,"Safder, Usman/AAC-6881-2021","Safder, Usman/0000-0002-2380-8112; Yoo, ChangKyoo/0000-0002-9406-7649; Ifaei, Pouya/0000-0002-6898-8583; Tariq, Shahzeb/0000-0002-0598-4243",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2021R1A2C2007838]; Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE),National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2021R1A2C2007838) and the Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as a Graduate School specialized in Climate Change.,,62,4,4,2,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1359-4311,1873-5606,,APPL THERM ENG,Appl.

In the Cagayan Valley (CV), rice production provides employment to more than half of the region's population and any climate variability and change can cause negative impacts on crop production and people's livelihoods. This paper attempts to understand projected climate changes in seasonal rainfall and mean temperature (2011-2040) to inform climate change adaptation planning in CV. The climate change projections were provided to crop and water resource modeling, agricultural market modeling, food insecurity vulnerability analysis, community-based climate change adaptation planning, and policy simulation. The results are presented for the Provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, and Quirino based on the statistical downscaling of three global climate models (BCM2, CNCM3, and MPEH5) and two emission scenarios (A1B and A2). A spatial interpolation technique was utilized in interpolating downscaled climate projections at weather stations to grids, and subsequently aggregated to administrative provinces. Results obtained in the downscaling showed anticipated significant climate changes from 2011 to 2040 in terms of rainfall and temperatures relative to 1971-2000. Consistent signals of climate change were found in many seasons and variables, whereas conflicting signs of changes were found in a few cases. A larger warming effect is projected for a daily minimum temperature than that for the maximum temperature, thus reducing diurnal temperature range. Precipitation is projected to increase in general in the Valley. Regarding seasonality, dry months (March-April-May) will continue to remain dry but during the rainy season, July and November are likely to become more notable wet months. There are also indications of an increasing frequency of heavy rainfall events, prolonged dry spell events and extreme daytime temperatures (especially in Aparri).","[Basconcillo, Joseph; Lucero, Anthony; Solis, Analiza] Philippine Atmospher Geophys & Astron Serv Adm, Climatol & Agrometeorol Div, Quezon City 1100, Philippines; [Sandoval, Robert, Jr.; Bautista, Eulito] Food & Agr Org UN, AMICAF Philippines, Quezon City, Philippines; [Koizumi, Tatsuji; Kanamaru, Hideki] Food & Agr Org UN, Rome, Italy",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Basconcillo, J (corresponding author), Philippine Atmospher Geophys & Astron Serv Adm, Climatol & Agrometeorol Div, Quezon City 1100, Philippines.",jbasconcillo@pagasa.dost.gov.ph,,,SOUSEI Project in Japan,SOUSEI Project in Japan,"The authors would like to acknowledge the support and assistance of FAO through its AMICAF Project and PAGASA in the realization of this study.

In this paper, the Trade-off Analysis, Minimum Data Model Approach (TOA-MD) was used to assess the adoption potential of these technologies by resource poor farmers under climate change in Uganda. The model was calibrated and validated using household survey data collected in 2009 from Kabale district. To simulate adoption potential, the base system data was generated from household data and adjusted to reflect impact of climate change on crop yields and prices by 2050. The percentage increase in yields resulting from the use of climate resilient sweet potato technologies were used to estimate yields for alternative systems based on the results from sweet potato trials by the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO), Uganda. Adoption potential of sweet potato technologies varied across altitudes. Compared with the high and lower altitudes, adoption potential is lowest at moderate altitude despite higher yields and lower costs of production. Paying farmers to adopt new sweet potato technologies is economically rational at the higher and moderate altitudes but not at the lower altitudes. The provision of free planting material (subsidy) for the evaluated technologies resulted in a modest increase of 2 % in adoption potential. Therefore, providing this as a way of increasing adoption of sweet potato technologies to reduce vulnerability of poor farm households to climate change will have a very small impact. Instead, climate change adaptation policy should focus on creating enabling environments for farmers to market their produce so as to raise returns and reduce the opportunity costs of climate change adaptation strategies.","[Ilukor, John] Makerere Univ, Sch Business, Kampala, Uganda; [Bagamba, Fredrick; Bashaasha, Bernard] Makerere Univ, Coll Agr Sci, Dept Agribusiness & Nat Resource Econ, Kampala, Uganda; [Ilukor, John] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop, Stuttgart, Germany",Makerere University; Makerere University; University Hohenheim,"Ilukor, J (corresponding author), Makerere Univ, Sch Business, Kampala, Uganda.",john.ilukor@gmail.com,,,GIZ,GIZ,This work was part of a research project on participatory development and testing of strategies to reduce climate vulnerability of poor farm households in East Africa through innovations in potato and sweet potato technologies and enabling policies.

The participants were characterized by membership in local groups, an active learning attitude, and confidence in their farming. Compared to non-participants, the participants produced crops with higher yield and had more knowledge about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) message and advanced farming technologies. Both groups had similar reactions to past climatic damage experiences, but the participants tended to have a more positive attitude about adaptation to climate change and mitigation by refraining from residual straw burning than the non-participants. The farmers' attitude about adaptation to climate change was positively associated with their active learning and close relationship with researchers. There was a large yield gap between the bottom 10 percentile farmers (0.63 t/ha) and the top 10 percentile farmers (4.05 t/ha), with an average yield of 2.18 t/ha. Yield was associated with the level of market orientation, with the market-oriented farmers attaining higher yield, including yield from broadcast seeding (2.71 t/ha), than the subsistence farmers (1.66 t/ha). Our findings suggest that technical improvement of rice production in the region by using the participatory approach could be enhanced by selecting participants who are linked with local groups, tend to be market orientated, and are willing to learn with researchers.","[Suwanmontri, Pichayanun; Kamoshita, Akihiko] Univ Tokyo, Asian Nat Environm Sci Ctr, Nishitokyo, Japan; [Suwanmontri, Pichayanun; Kishino, Hirohisa] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Jongdee, Boonrat] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Agr, Grad Educ Level, Khon Kaen, Thailand; [Fukai, Shu] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; Khon Kaen University; University of Queensland,"Kamoshita, A (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Asian Nat Environm Sci Ctr, Nishitokyo, Japan.",akamoshita@anesc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kishino, Hirohisa/U-9311-2019","FUKAI, Shu/0000-0002-1015-9395",,,,,50,2,2,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1343-943X,1349-1008,,PLANT PROD SCI,Plant.

Proceeding from a 'hybrid' model recently advanced by Simon Caney, an analytical framework for determining responsibility, which is based on a distinction between causal and remedial responsibility as well as one between well-off and badly-off agents, is constructed and applied. It is concluded that whether the burdens are envisioned as ones of mitigation or adaptation makes a difference for how responsibility is assigned to various agents within this framework, suggesting that theorists need to be clear about which kind of burden their distributive principles concern. As the analysis is based upon some important substantive assumptions, the paper concludes with a critical discussion of our conclusions and an invitation for additional research into the largely unexamined distinction between adaptation and mitigation.","[Jagers, Sverker C.; Duus-Otterstrom, Goran] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Jagers, SC (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.",sverker.jagers@pol.gu.se,,"Duus-Otterstrom, Goran/0000-0001-9133-7300",,,,,24,45,45,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

Based on the entropy method and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), this study proposes a weight correction system to correct the weights from China?s Assessment Standard for Green Retrofitting of Existing Building. By comparing the corrected weights to the original weights, recommendations for building green retrofitting measures in seven climate zones were put forward. The results indicate that priority should be given to the selection of materials and building envelopes and that site design is the basis for the building climate adaptability. It is imperative that equipment transformation is carried out in cold area and severe cold area. Comprehensive energy and non-traditional water sources can be used in hot-summer and cold-winter area, hotsummer and warm-winter area and mild area. Our research findings can improve the climate adaptability of building retrofit according to regional characteristics while circumventing low-efficiency measures.

Vulnerability studies aim at differentiating impacts and losses by using fine-grained information from demographic, social, and personal characteristics of humans. With ongoing digital development, these characteristics will transform and result in new traits, which need to be identified and integrated. Digital transformations will produce new social groups, partly human, semi-human, or non-human-some of which already exist, and some which can be foreseen by extrapolating from recent developments in the field of brain wearables, robotics, and software engineering. Though involved in the process of digital transformation, many researchers and practitioners in the field of Disaster Risk Reduction or Climate Change Adaptation are not yet aware of the repercussions for disaster and vulnerability assessments. Emerging vulnerabilities are due to a growing dependency on digital services and tools in the case of a severe emergency or crisis. This article depicts the different implications for future theoretical frameworks when identifying novel semi-human groups and their vulnerabilities to disaster risks. Findings include assumed changes within common indicators of social vulnerability, new indicators, a typology of humans, and human interrelations with digital extensions and two different perspectives on these groups and their dependencies with critical infrastructure.","[Fekete, Alexander] TH Koln Univ Appl Sci, Inst Rescue Engn & Civil Protect, D-50679 Cologne, Germany; [Rhyner, Jakob] Univ Bonn, ICB, Bonn Alliance Sustainabil Res, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Fekete, A (corresponding author), TH Koln Univ Appl Sci, Inst Rescue Engn & Civil Protect, D-50679 Cologne, Germany.",alexander.fekete@th-koeln.de; rhyner@uni-bonn.de,"Rhyner, Jakob/AAH-8787-2021; Fekete, Alexander/C-4071-2017","Fekete, Alexander/0000-0002-8029-6774",German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF),German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"For Jakob Rhyner, support through the project digitainable, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), is gratefully acknowledged.",,104,10,10,5,35,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,22,,,,,,,9324,10.3390/su12229324,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12229324,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OY9KH,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000594557100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Simultaneously, their aggregated emission of greenhouse gases from land use and fuelwood consumption is substantial. Synergies between adaptation to climate change and mitigation should therefore be actively promoted. In the context of poverty, such synergies should ideally be designed specifically for the poorest of the poor who are notoriously difficult to reach by policies and projects. In this experimental case on subsistence farming in western Kenya we assume that only the poorest inhabit the most degraded lands and use the simplest form of cooking over open fire. As the study location is typical of sub-Saharan areas affected by drought, flooding, land degradation, diseases and persistent poverty, findings can be scaled up, transferred to and tested in similar settings. Seeking multiple synergies of adaptation, mitigation, and social change while using sustainability science in intervention research, we reframed peasant farmers from vulnerable victims into agents fighting livelihood stressors and climate change impacts. In collaboration with them we performed small-scale experiments on agricultural production practices and domestic energy efficiency resulting in multiple synergies. Findings show that the 'smokeless kitchen' and carbon sequestration from improved land management can mitigate climate change while increasing energy efficiency, health standards, food security, and community-based adaptive capacity. Preferably, climate policy should therefore explicitly address synergies and support peasant farmers' efforts to create synergies when the 'food imperative' limits their agency to fight climate change alone.

But how do cities actually perform in terms of climate change response? This study sheds light on the state of urban climate change adaptation and mitigation planning across Europe. Europe is an excellent test case given its advanced environmental policies and high urbanization. We performed a detailed analysis of 200 large and medium-sized cities across 11 European countries and analysed the cities' climate change adaptation and mitigation plans. We investigate the regional distribution of plans, adaptation and mitigation foci and the extent to which planned greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions contribute to national and international climate objectives. To our knowledge, it is the first study of its kind as it does not rely on self-assessment (questionnaires or social surveys). Our results show that 35 % of European cities studied have no dedicated mitigation plan and 72 % have no adaptation plan. No city has an adaptation plan without a mitigation plan. One quarter of the cities have both an adaptation and a mitigation plan and set quantitative GHG reduction targets, but those vary extensively in scope and ambition. Furthermore, we show that if the planned actions within cities are nationally representative the 11 countries investigated would achieve a 37 % reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, translating into a 27 % reduction in GHG emissions for the EU as a whole. However, the actions would often be insufficient to reach national targets and fall short of the 80 % reduction in GHG emissions recommended to avoid global mean temperature rising by 2 A degrees C above pre-industrial levels.","[Reckien, D.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Res Environm Decis, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Flacke, J.] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Dawson, R.

Climate change-oriented actions often pose an extra challenge to cooperative members in time-poverty, that is, to those who have no choice but to work long hours yet remain consumption poor. Tackling climate change requires future-oriented action toward unpredictable events, whereas time-poverty requires people to deal with the bare necessities of the present. Through a qualitative inductive study of Rwandan smallholder farmers in agricultural cooperatives, we observe that climate change increases time-poverty, especially for women, and that smallholder farmers are hesitant to invest their time in making climate change adaptations. We find that smallholder farmers can overcome these challenges through membership of agricultural cooperatives, which can help in pacing climate change actions.","[Vermeire, Jacob; Crucke, Saskia; Vinck, Annelies] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; [Mutesi, Josephine] Univ Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda",Ghent University; University of Rwanda,"Vermeire, J (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Mkt Innovat & Org, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",jacob.vermeire@ugent.be,"Mutesi, Josephine/GZK-5785-2022","Vermeire, Jacob/0000-0002-2927-1803; Crucke, Saskia/0000-0001-8847-7396",Global Minds Fund; Faculty of Economics and Business Administration at Ghent University; Research Foundation Flanders [153646/12U0119N],Global Minds Fund; Faculty of Economics and Business Administration at Ghent University; Research Foundation Flanders(FWO),"Global Minds Fund and the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration at Ghent University; Research Foundation Flanders, Grant/Award Number: 153646/12U0119N",,61,0,0,11,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0968-0802,1099-1719,,SUSTAIN DEV,Sustain.

This paper explores this challenge in the case of Chennai, India, a city which, in recent years, has faced several climate related disasters, including floods. Building on an innovative combination of research methods (policy documents analysis, stakeholder interviews, and a community workshop), the study analyses the barriers and explores potentials for operationalising socio-ecological resilience in Chennai in the face of an ongoing conflict between rapid urbanisation and the natural water system, compromising the region's hydrological capacity and resilience to flooding. In particular, drawing on the notion of evolutionary resilience and multi-level approach, the paper investigates (1) the scope for developing an integrated vision for resilience of the Chennai region (macro level); (2) the presence and the capacity of institutions to connect the different stakeholders and mediate their interests (meso level); and (3) the barriers and potentials developing local adaptation strategies in a bottom-up manner (micro level). The study sheds light on the under-researched issue of socio-ecological resilience in Chennai, while identifying potentials for implementing it through a combination of top down and bottom-up approaches, which in turn provides useful lessons for planning for resilience in other cities in the Global South.","[Dabrowski, Marcin] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Urbanism, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Dabrowski, M (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Urbanism, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",nilofer.afza@gmail.com; m.m.dabrowski@tudelft.nl,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Tajuddin, Nilofer/0000-0002-0569-5417",,,,,63,3,3,1,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2021,13,19,,,,,,,10522,10.3390/su131910522,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su131910522,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WH1YN,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000707482500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The increasing pace of environmental and social change demands adaptive conservation instruments. To examine the adaptive potential of CEs, we surveyed 269 CEs and interviewed 73 conservation organization employees. Although only 2% of CEs mentioned climate change, the majority of employees were concerned about climate change impacts. CEs share the fixed-boundary limits typical of protected areas with additional adaptation constraints due to permanent terms on private lands. CEs often have multiple, potentially conflicting purposes that protect against termination but complicate decisions about principled, conservation-oriented adaptation. Monitoring is critical for shaping adaptive responses, but only 35% of CEs allowed organizations to conduct ecological monitoring. In addition, CEs provided few requirements or incentives for active stewardship of private lands. We found four primary options for changing land use restrictions, each with advantages and risks: CE amendment, management plan revisions, approval of changes through discretionary consent, and updating laws or policies codified in the CE. Conservation organizations, funders, and the Internal Revenue Service should promote processes for principled adaptation in CE terms, provide more active stewardship of CE lands, and consider alternatives to the CE tool.","[Rissman, Adena R.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Owley, Jessica] SUNY Buffalo, Law Sch, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Shaw, M.

Based on the analysis of recurring patterns of social adaptation dilemmas (caused by the inter-dependencies between adaptation providers and beneficiaries), associated actor constellations, policy approaches, and gaps, this paper presents principles for supporting city citizen commoning for climate adaptation (Le. joint actions needed to create systems to manage 'shared' adaptation resources). The presented principles can assist in facilitating the management of public goods for adaptation, including privately-provided adaptation goods, and relate to four strategic aims: i) the effective management of collective and individual resources; ii) comprehensive risk reduction; iii) sustained local institutional linkages (mainstreaming); and iv) matching different actors' views, efforts and capacities. The principles synthesise and extend the literature by considering, and providing space for, a comprehensive understanding of risk and its root causes, and for alternative rationalities or Cnonrationall behaviours intended to address them. The latter takes account of the subjectivities (e.g. emotional attachments to resources and seascapes), which are as important as power structures with respect to how climate adaptation is managed. In fact, subjectivities are central to the operation of city administrations as they are an integral part of how people understand their relationship to others. In an adaptation context, this means focusing on practices and interactions that are required for taking adaptation actions, and how they can both promote and frustrate attempts to collaborate. We conclude that the developed principles can support more sustainable climate adaptation and transformation by holistically addressing existing adaptation dilemmas, actor constellations, and the associated policy gaps that make current approaches ineffective.","[Wamsler, Christine; Raggers, Sanne] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden.",christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,,,Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2011-901],Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"This research was carried out in the context of the Sustainable Urban Transformation for Climate Change Adaptation project financed by the Swedish Research Council FORMAS (no. 2011-901).

Sustaining cotton production under declining groundwater availability in the underlying Ogallala Aquifer and changing climate remains a key challenge for stakeholders in this region. The objectives of this study were to assess climate change impacts on cotton yield and irrigation water use, and evaluate six ideotypes for adaptation. In this study, we used the DSSAT-CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model for simulating cotton production under 18 projected future climate scenarios and with six potential adaptation ideotypes at Bushland, Halfway and Lamesa in the northern, central, and southern parts of the THP region, respectively. Seed cotton yield and irrigation water use between baseline (1976-2005) and future periods (mid-century:2036-2065 and late-century: 2066-2095) were compared. The irrigated seed cotton yield is expected to increase by 12-21 % at cooler northern sites, and decrease by 2% at the warmer southern site, in the mid-century compared to the baseline. For the same period, seasonal irrigation water use is expected to increase by 6-11 % and dryland seed cotton yield is expected to change by +6 % to -11 % across the locations. The increases in irrigated seed cotton yield were attributed to increased vegetative growth under elevated CO2, while the decline in dryland seed cotton yield was due to poor boll retention at high growing season temperatures. Six potential climate change adaptive ideotypes with greater drought and heat tolerances, higher yield potential, and longer maturity were designed and compared to the reference cultivar. For irrigated conditions, increasing area of full leaf and enhancing partitioning of assimilates to reproductive growth (high yield potential) were preferred, because these characteristics increased seed cotton yield substantially (by 3-9 %) with a marginal change in irrigation water use (by -1 to 3 %). For dryland production, a long maturity ideotype with longer boll filling duration was the most effective ideotype with a substantial increase in seed cotton yield by 11-45 %. The results from this study will be useful to THP cotton producers and water managers in making appropriate decisions for adapting cotton production to projected changes in future climate and groundwater availability.","[Kothari, Kritika; Ale, Srinivasulu; Bordovsky, James P.; Munster, Clyde L.; Singh, Vijay P.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Kothari, Kritika] Univ Kentucky, Plant & Soil Sci Dept, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; [Ale, Srinivasulu] Texas A&M Univ Syst, Texas A&M AgriLife Res, Vernon, TX 76385 USA; [Bordovsky, James P.] Texas A&M Univ Syst, Texas A&M AgriLife Res, Plainview, TX 79072 USA; [Nielsen-Gammon, John] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Hoogenboom, Gerrit] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Hoogenboom, Gerrit] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Kentucky; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M AgriLife Research; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M AgriLife Research; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ale, S (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Syst, Texas A&M AgriLife Res, Vernon, TX 76385 USA.",sriniale@ag.tamu.edu,"Hoogenboom, Gerrit/F-3946-2010; Nielsen-Gammon, John W/G-9771-2012","Hoogenboom, Gerrit/0000-0002-1555-0537; Nielsen-Gammon, John W/0000-0001-5336-2409; Kothari, Kritika/0000-0002-6130-0950","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (COALS), Texas AM University; USDA Agricultural Research Service, Kansas State University; Texas AgriLife Research, Texas AgriLife Extension Service, Texas Tech University; West Texas AM University; Cotton Incorporated","College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (COALS), Texas AM University; USDA Agricultural Research Service, Kansas State University; Texas AgriLife Research, Texas AgriLife Extension Service, Texas Tech University; West Texas AM University; Cotton Incorporated(Cotton R&D Corp)","Funding support for this research was provided by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (COALS) , Texas A&M University, and the Ogallala Aquifer Program (OAP) , a consortium between USDA Agri-cultural Research Service, Kansas State University, Texas AgriLife Research, Texas AgriLife Extension Service, Texas Tech University, and West Texas A&M University.

As a way of responding to both adaptation and mitigation challenges within the industry, this article examines how community-based climate change adaptation initiatives might provide mitigation outcomes in the agriculture sector in Timor-Leste. Beginning with an exploration of nation-wide institutional responses to climate change, the study utilises interviews, field observations and document analysis to examine an extensive community-based adaptation program in two districts in Timor-Leste focused on increasing the resilience of the agriculture sector and the livelihoods of poor rural farmers. Analysis of this program reveals a largely synergistic relationship between adaptation measures focused on land and water management and agriculture and their corresponding greenhouse gas mitigation potential, including co-benefits such as soil/atmospheric carbon sequestration, reduced emissions, soil nitrification and reduced use of inorganic fertilisers. Community-based adaptation programs in the agriculture sector have a significant influence on mitigation outcomes, which is often overlooked in community-based programs. The adaptation program in Timor-Leste has provided useful insights into the inter-relationships between adaptation and mitigation at the community level, which could be further supported and scaled-up in other Southeast Asia countries and elsewhere.","[Chandra, Alvin; Dargusch, Paul; McNamara, Karen E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Chandra, A (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",a.chandra@business.uq.edu.au,"Chandra, Alvin/AAU-8641-2020; McNamara, Karen/D-7322-2013","Chandra, Alvin/0000-0002-2421-4412; McNamara, Karen/0000-0002-4511-8403; DARGUSCH, Paul/0000-0001-9255-2803",Australian Aid,Australian Aid(CGIAR),"The authors would like to thank the Oxfam Timor-Leste Community-based Climate Change Program team (funded by Australian Aid), especially Julia Kalmirah, whose incisive advice has helped guide this study.

Under this theme, Congress Question 58 'How do Irrigation and Drainage Play an Important Role in Climate Change Adaptation?' was raised. This paper summarizes the discussions and results of 48 papers and 27 posters accepted under this question. This overview confirms the role of irrigation and drainage management as intervention to mitigate the impacts of climate change, and consequent extreme climate events have to be factored into all decision-making processes. It also highlights that particular attention should be paid to the uncertainty in climate change assessment and that the assessment is expected to be more dependable with the development of better analysis methods and a greater availability of reliable climate data and future scenarios. At this stage, it is very hard to do an integrated impact assessment, which covers the whole agricultural and hydrological process, including all scales and aspects such as on-farm to basin, crop growth to farming system, production to environment, etc. Therefore, each sub-process is to be evaluated and accumulation of its outcomes and cases promoted.

Previous studies indicate that beach width positively affects coastal property values, but these studies ignore the dynamic features of beaches and the feedback that nourishment has on shoreline retreat. We correct for the resulting attenuation and endogeneity bias in a hedonic property value model by instrumenting for beach width using spatially varying coastal geological features. We find that the beach width coefficient is nearly five times larger than the OLS estimate, suggesting that beach width is a much larger portion of property value than previously thought. We use the empirical results to parameterize a dynamic optimization model of beach nourishment decisions and show that the predicted interval between nourishment projects is closer to what we observe in the data when we use the estimate from the instrumental variables model rather than OLS. As coastal communities adapt to climate change, we find that the long-term net value of coastal residential property can fall by as much as 52% when erosion rate triples and cost of nourishment sand quadruples.

When such participation is limited, climate mitigation and adaptation polices may miss key opportunities to support vulnerable communities, and thus inadvertently reinforce the vulnerability of marginalized groups. This paper reports rich qualitative data from women leaders in conservation, development and climate adaptation projects to support local communities across seven Pacific Island nations. The results indicate the following priorities to support climate adaptation policies in the Pacific: (1) increased recognition for the importance of traditional knowledge; (2) greater support for local women's groups, including strategic planning and training to access climate finance mechanisms; and (3) climate policies that consider alternative metrics for women's empowerment and inclusion, formalize women's land rights, and provide land for climate refugees. Existing evidence is discussed which supports the importance of these priorities in the Pacific. Their input identifies research gaps in climate adaptation and provides important guidance for governments, non-governmental organizations, and development agencies leading climate adaptation efforts.","[Mcleod, Elizabeth] Nature Conservancy, 7707 Vail Valley Dr, Austin, TX 78749 USA; [Arora-Jonsson, Seema] Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Div Rural Dev, Box 7012, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Masuda, Yuta J.] Nature Conservancy, 4245 Fairfax Dr 100, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Bruton-Adams, Mae] Nature Conservancy, Pohnpei Field Off, 204 Moylans Insurance Bldg,POB 216, Ponape 96941, Micronesia; [Emaurois, Carol O.] Palau EU PacTVET, POB 1106, Koror 96940, Palau; [Gorong, Berna] Nature Conservancy, POB 639, Yap 96943, Yap State, Micronesia; [Hudlow, C.

The impact of these changes may affect populations differently depending on a range of factors, including geography, socioeconomics and culture. This study reviewed current evidence on the health risks of climate change for Australian Aboriginal populations and linked Aboriginal demographic data to historical and projected climate data to describe the distribution of climate-related exposures in Aboriginal compared to non-Aboriginal populations in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The study showed Aboriginal populations were disproportionately exposed to a range of climate extremes in heat, rainfall and drought, and this disproportionate exposure was predicted to increase with climate change over the coming decades. Aboriginal people currently experience higher rates of climate-sensitive health conditions and socioeconomic disadvantages, which will impact their capacity to adapt to climate change. Climate change may also adversely affect cultural practices. These factors will likely impact the health and well-being of Aboriginal people in NSW and inhibit measures to close the gap in health between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations. Climate change, health and equity need to be key considerations in all policies at all levels of government. Effective Aboriginal community engagement is urgently needed to develop and implement climate adaptation responses to improve health and social service preparedness and secure environmental health infrastructure such as drinking water supplies and suitably managed social housing. Further Aboriginal-led research is required to identify the cultural impacts of climate change on health, including adaptive responses based on Aboriginal knowledges.","[Standen, Jeffrey C.; Spencer, Jessica; Lee, Grace W.] Hlth Protect NSW, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia; [Standen, Jeffrey C.; Lee, Grace W.; Van Buskirk, Joe; Hanigan, Ivan; Boylan, Sinead; Jegasothy, Edward; Breth-Petersen, Matilde; Morgan, Geoffrey G.] Univ Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia; [Matthews, Veronica; Jegasothy, Edward; Morgan, Geoffrey G.] Univ Sydney, Univ Ctr Rural Hlth, Fac Med & Hlth, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Standen, JC (corresponding author), Hlth Protect NSW, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia.;Standen, JC (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.",jeff.standen@health.nsw.gov.au; jessica.spencer@health.nsw.gov.au; g.lee@sydney.edu.au; joseph.vanbuskirk@sydney.edu.au; veronica.matthews@sydney.edu.au; ivan.hanigan@sydney.edu.au; sinead.boylan@csiro.au; edward.jegasothy@sydney.edu.au; matilde.petersen@sydney.edu.au; geoffrey.morgan@sydney.edu.au,,"Lee, Grace/0009-0008-5816-950X; Van Buskirk, Joe/0000-0003-0313-3784; Standen, Jeffrey/0000-0002-4026-2035; Breth Petersen, Matilde/0000-0002-1300-1091; Morgan, Geoffrey/0000-0003-4046-2405; Boylan, Sinead/0000-0002-3491-5845",Human Health and Social Impacts Research,Human Health and Social Impacts Research,"This project was supported by the Human Health and Social Impacts Research Node-a partnership between the University of Sydney, the NSW Department for Planning and Environment and NSW Health.",,79,3,3,7,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

But, the question remains 'to what extent can breeding gains be achieved under a changing climate, at a pace sufficient to usefully contribute to climate adaptation, mitigation and food security?'. Here, we address this question by critically reviewing how model-based approaches can be used to assist breeding activities, with particular focus on all CGIAR (formerly the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research but now known simply as CGIAR) breeding programs. Crop modeling can underpin breeding efforts in many different ways, including assessing genotypic adaptability and stability, characterizing and identifying target breeding environments, identifying tradeoffs among traits for such environments, and making predictions of the likely breeding value of the genotypes. Crop modeling science within the CGIAR has contributed to all of these. However, much progress remains to be done if modeling is to effectively contribute to more targeted and impactful breeding programs under changing climates. In a period in which CGIAR breeding programs are undergoing a major modernization process, crop modelers will need to be part of crop improvement teams, with a common understanding of breeding pipelines and model capabilities and limitations, and common data standards and protocols, to ensure they follow and deliver according to clearly defined breeding products. This will, in turn, enable more rapid and better-targeted crop modeling activities, thus directly contributing to accelerated and more impactful breeding efforts.","[Ramirez-Villegas, Julian; Grenier, Cecile; Rebolledo, Maria C.] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira, Cali 763537, Colombia; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] CIAT, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira, Cali 763537, Colombia; [Molero Milan, Anabel; Crossa, Jose; Juliana, Philomin; Pequeno, Diego; Sukumaran, Sivakumar; Reynolds, Matthew] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, El Batan, Texcoco, Mexico; [Alexandrov, Nickolai] Int Rice Res Inst IRRI, Los Banos, Philippines; [Asseng, Senthold] Univ Florida, Agr & Biol Engn Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Challinor, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [van Eeuwijk, Fred] Wageningen Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ghanem, Michel Edmond; Kehel, Zakaria] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Biodivers & Crop Improvement Program BCIP, Ave Hafiane Cherkaoui, Rabat, Morocco; [Ghanem, Michel Edmond] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, AgroBioSci AgBS, Lot 660 Hay Moulay Rachid, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco; [Grenier, Cecile; Rebolledo, Maria C.] CIRAD, UMR AGAP, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Grenier, Cecile; Rebolledo, Maria C.] Univ Montpellier, AGAP, Montpellier SupAgro, CIRAD,INRA, Montpellier, France; [Heinemann, Alexandre B.] Embrapa Arroz & Feijao Rodovia, GO-462 Km 12 Zona Rural, BR-75375000 Santo Antonio De Goias, Go, Brazil; [Wang, Jiankang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Crop Sci, Natl Key Facil Crop Gene Resources & Genet Improv, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Kholova, Jana; Vadez, Vincent] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Patancheru 502324, Telangana, India; [Koo, Jawoo] Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI, Washington, DC USA; [Quiroz, Roberto] Int Potato Ctr CIP, Lima, Peru; [Quiroz, Roberto] Trop Agr Res & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Turrialba 30501, Costa Rica; [White, Jeffrey W.] USDA ARS, ALARC, 21881 North Cardon Lane, Maricopa, AZ 85138 USA","Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Leeds; Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Crop Sciences, CAAS; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP); CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)","Ramirez-Villegas, J (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira, Cali 763537, Colombia.",j.r.villegas@cgiar.org,"Challinor, Andrew J/C-4992-2008; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/AAY-8073-2020; White, Jeffrey/AAN-4296-2021; Koo, Jawoo/HNR-9802-2023; Vadez, Vincent/GLU-8981-2022; sukumaran, sivakumar/AFO-2409-2022; Heinemann, Alexandre/ABH-4914-2020; Sukumaran, Sivakumar/AFO-2436-2022; rebolledo, maria/AAQ-4981-2021; Koo, Jawoo/F-9397-2010","Challinor, Andrew J/0000-0002-8551-6617; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/0000-0002-8044-583X; Heinemann, Alexandre/0000-0002-7037-488X; Sukumaran, Sivakumar/0000-0003-4088-4624; Juliana, Philomin/0000-0001-6922-0173; Ghanem, Michel Edmond/0000-0003-0626-7622; Koo, Jawoo/0000-0003-3424-9229; Crossa, Jose/0000-0001-9429-5855","CGIAR research programs (CRPs) on Grain Legumes, RICE, MAIZE, and WHEAT agri-food systems; CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture, and Excellence in Breeding; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Trust Fund Donors","CGIAR research programs (CRPs) on Grain Legumes, RICE, MAIZE, and WHEAT agri-food systems(CGIAR); CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture, and Excellence in Breeding(CGIAR); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Trust Fund Donors(CGIAR)","The authors would like to express their gratitude to USAID and to the donors to the CGIAR System Council.

A systematic analysis of 63 Adaptation Fund projects,REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change adaptation; Climate finance; Participation; Devolution; Community; Adaptation Fund,CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; DECENTRALIZATION; FINANCE; PARTICIPATION; VULNERABILITY; CHALLENGES; GOVERNANCE,"Recent literature suggests that direct national access to multilateral climate funds could promote climate change adaptation investment that focuses more on the needs of vulnerable local communities when compared to indirect access through multilateral agencies. However, there has been no systematic comparative assessment of the level of community focus of direct-access and indirect-access projects. The lack of a standardized methodology to assess the level of community-focused adaptation has also constrained such comparison. To address this gap, this paper proposes a new framework to assess the level of community focus in adaptation projects, using a combination of financial, participatory, devolutionary, and design for policy adoption and replicability criteria. Using the Adaptation Fund (AF) as a case study, we apply the framework to systematically assess 63 projects approved by the Fund as of May 2017, comprising 22 direct-access and 41 indirect-access projects. We find that direct-access projects are more community-focused than indirect-access projects because they exhibit higher community-oriented financial, participatory, and devolutionary characteristics. We find no difference between the direct-access and indirect-access projects with regard to how they are designed to promote policy adoption and replicability of AF project-financed adaptation actions through policy and geographical mainstreaming. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of the pattern of adaptation investment that takes place in developing countries with the support of international adaptation finance under both access modalities. The proposed assessment framework could also inform the development of a standardized methodology to track the delivery of international adaptation finance to the community level.","[Manuamorn, Ornsaran Pomme; Biesbroek, Robbert] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Manuamorn, Ornsaran Pomme] Maastricht Univ, UNU MERIT, Maastricht Grad Sch Governance MGSoG, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Maastricht University,"Manuamorn, OP (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Manuamorn, OP (corresponding author), Maastricht Univ, UNU MERIT, Maastricht Grad Sch Governance MGSoG, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands.",o.manuamorn@student.maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022; Biesbroek, Robbert/ABE-3686-2021","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Manuamorn, Ornsaran/0000-0002-7433-7330",,,,,86,5,5,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Methodology: The ex-post facto research design was selected for the study. The study was conducted in East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya by interviewing 120 potato growers using interview schedule. The level of adaptation of each farmer to climate change was analyzed based on the total score of adaptation of each respondent farmer. The rank of each adaptation practice adopted by respondent farmers was analyzed using Weighted Mean Score. The constraints faced by potato growers to adoption of adaptation practices was identified by asking the respondents and simultaneously recording their responses. Results: The findings revealed that there were twelve major adaptation practices followed by majority of potato growers. It also revealed that majority of the respondents had medium level of adaptation to climate change. The major constraints in adoption of adaptation practices were lack of quality seeds, price fluctuation in the market, low technical knowledge about improved potato cultivation, lack of efficient transport and marketing facilities, non-availability of production inputs and lack of information about weather and climate. Interpretation: The study recommended that the farm level adaptation practices followed by famers need to be properly identified, documented, refined and validated before disseminating and integrating them into packages of practices for adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, these practices and adaptation constraints faced by farmers should be taken into account while developing future climate change strategies.","[Kharumnuid, P.] Cent Potato Res Inst, Div Social Sci, Shimla 171001, India; [Rao, I.

I draw from the case study of an agrarian village in Madagascar that was struck by a destructive category 3 cyclone. In the weeks following the storm, oral history knowledge occupied an increasingly visible role within the community, as younger farmers interacted with elders to hear tales of past storms. Through these shared accounts, people discussed specific techniques on how to cope with environmental uncertainty. They also created a sense of shared history, which provided individuals across generations an entry point into the local historical record. Overall, the process of sharing oral history accounts can contribute to community resilience, with resiliency encompassing not only technical or ecological factors, but also the more affective realms of shared legacies, hope and belonging.","[Osterhoudt, Sarah] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Osterhoudt, S (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",srosterh@indiana.edu,,,Wenner-Gren Foundation; Fulbright-Hays fellowship,Wenner-Gren Foundation; Fulbright-Hays fellowship,I thank the members of the community of Imorona for the long-standing collaboration of this research.

Paleoclimate research, however, tends to focus on continental, hemispheric or global scales, making it difficult for archaeologists and paleoecologists to study local effects. Here we introduce a method for high-frequency, local climate-field reconstruction from tree-rings. We reconstruct the rain-fed maize agricultural niche in two regions of the southwestern United States with dense populations of prehispanic farmers. Niche size and stability are highly variable within and between the regions. Prehispanic rain-fed maize farmers tended to live in agricultural refugia-areas most reliably in the niche. The timing and trajectory of the famous thirteenth century Pueblo migration can be understood in terms of relative niche size and stability. Local reconstructions like these illuminate the spectrum of strategies past humans used to adapt to climate change by recasting climate into the distributions of resources on which they depended.","[Bocinsky, R.

Adaptation measures in forestry have particularly long lead times. A timely implementation is thus crucial for reducing the considerable climate vulnerability of forest ecosystems. However, since future environmental conditions as well as future societal demands on forests are inherently uncertain, a core requirement for adaptation is robustness to a wide variety of possible futures. Here we explicitly address the roles of climatic and social uncertainty in forest management, and tackle the question of robustness of adaptation measures in the context of multi-objective sustainable forest management (SFM). We used the Austrian Federal Forests (AFF) as a case study, and employed a comprehensive vulnerability assessment framework based on ecosystem modeling, multi-criteria decision analysis, and practitioner participation. We explicitly considered climate uncertainty by means of three climate change scenarios, and accounted for uncertainty in future social demands by means of three societal preference scenarios regarding SFM indicators. We found that the effects of climatic and social uncertainty on the projected performance of management were in the same order of magnitude, underlining the notion that climate change adaptation requires an integrated social-ecological perspective. Furthermore, our analysis of adaptation measures revealed considerable trade-offs between reducing adverse impacts of climate change and facilitating adaptive capacity. This finding implies that prioritization between these two general aims of adaptation is necessary in management planning, which we suggest can draw on uncertainty analysis: Where the variation induced by social-ecological uncertainty renders measures aiming to reduce climate change impacts statistically insignificant (i.e., for approximately one third of the investigated management units of the AFF case study), fostering adaptive capacity is suggested as the preferred pathway for adaptation. We conclude that climate change adaptation needs to balance between anticipating expected future conditions and building the capacity to address unknowns and surprises. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Objectives: To investigate high temperature-EDVs relationship in various regions with different climatic characteristics, to explore the regional differences, to identify vulnerable populations, and to provide scientific evidence for climate change adaptation strategies in China. Methods: Daily data on weather, air pollution and EDVs were collected from 18 sites in China from June to August during 2014-2017. A quasi-Poisson generalized additive regression model was applied to examine the high temperature-EDVs relationship in each site. Site-specific risks of EDVs were pooled using a random effect meta-analysis model. Stratified analyses were performed by gender, age-groups, cause-specific EDVs and regions. Attributable fractions of EDVs due to high temperatures were calculated in different regions. Results: 1 degrees C increase in daily mean temperature was associated with 1.07% (95% CI, 0.46-1.67%) increase in EDVs across all study regions. The negative health effects from high temperatures were worse for the people living in southern China, in subtropical monsoon climate zone or in counties, with percentage change of 1.96% (95% CI, 0.92-3.02%), 1.35% (95% CI, 0.95-1.76%) and 1.41% (95% CI, 0.48-2.34%), respectively. People under 18 were more vulnerable to high temperatures. Exposure to high temperatures increased EDVs risks from endocrine, respiratory, and digestive diseases and injury. The attributable fraction due to high temperatures was 8.64% for overall EDVs, 11.70% for the people living in southern China, 10.80% for people living in subtropical monsoon climate zone and 12.65% for the county population. Conclusions: Exposure to high temperatures resulted in extra burden to China's already overloaded hospital emergency departments. More resources are needed to meet increasing demands and effective preventative measurements are warranted to tackle such a challenge.

The index may sensitise public and political decision-makers towards the important topic of disaster risk and climate change adaptation. This article aims to explore the feasibility and usefulness of such a national risk index that considers both natural hazard phenomena and social vulnerability. The exposure to natural hazards was assessed by using four indicators that describe the exposure of people towards landslides, floods, droughts and sea level rise. Whereas vulnerability dimension consists of susceptibility, coping capacity and adaptive capacity was calculated on the basis of 32 indicators which comprise social, economic and environmental conditions of a society. The county comparison provides an initial ranking of exposure and vulnerability. Specific analysis of coping and adaptation capacities also indicates that risk or vulnerability are not pre-defined conditions, but rather are constructed by societies exposed to natural hazards. The results of the DRIB Index were mapped and classified by means of a GIS system to show different patterns of exposure, vulnerability and risk on global scale. The national perspective of risk clearly shows that the vulnerability of a society or a country is not the same as exposure to natural hazards. The information provided by the DRIB Index highlights the need for preventive measures towards Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation in the country as a whole, but also at regional and local scales. The results showed that the risk is strongly interwoven with social-economic and cultural conditions and normal everyday life, as well as with the performance of state institutions dealing with Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), in other words, vulnerability. Spatial trends of disaster risk and vulnerability, products of this research, also have stressed the serious social inequalities between and within regions of the country, which result in barriers to the development of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)in Brazil as a whole.

This study examines not only the progressive processes and spatial distribution of the 1849 severe flood in Nanjing City but also subsequent countermeasures based on historical documents, maps, and digital elevation model (DEM) data. As an adaptation to extreme floods, a project that connects Xuanwu Lake to the Yangtze River was deeply debated to relieve the flood risk. Local elites and ordinary people of Nanjing City worried that the project may destroy the Feng Shui of the city, which may bring misfortune to local candidates in the Imperial Examinations, their future promotion, the prosperity of their families, and the development of the local society in the city. This indicates that, in the complicated traditional Chinese society, such traditional cultures may play an important role in determining social adaptations to climate change. However, these traditional cultural concepts may not lead to a consensus without specific institutional culture. Hence, in the complicated social background, the institutional culture was also fundamental to build social adaptations to climate change. The project that connects Xuanwu Lake to the Yangtze River was eventually completed in 1931, which shows that the cultural concepts are dynamic in a complicated traditional society and are continuously changed along with the influence of institutional changes, educational development, and the guidance of the media guidance.","[Xu, Zhengrong; Yang, Yuda; Sun, Tao] Fudan Univ, Ctr Hist Geog Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Yang, YD (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Ctr Hist Geog Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",ydyang@fudan.edu.cn,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0605602]; Key Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities & Social Science of the Chinese Ministry of Education [16JJD770009],National Key R&D Program of China; Key Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities & Social Science of the Chinese Ministry of Education,This work was supported by grants from the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFA0605602) and the Key Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities & Social Science of the Chinese Ministry of Education (Grant No. 16JJD770009).,,49,1,1,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Design/methodology/approach-In Isiolo County, Kenya, 270 households were surveyed in seven communities, six focus group discussions were held and a document review was conducted. Findings-The major livelihood practiced in Isiolo is pastoralism (71 per cent), but agriculture and non-agro-pastoral activities also play an important role, with 53 per cent of the respondents practicing more than one type of livelihood. In Isiolo, floods have a large impact on agriculture (193 respondents out of 270), while droughts impact both agriculture (104 respondents) and livestock (120 respondents), and more specifically, cattle-keeping (70 respondents). Research limitations/implications-The research may have implications for the importance of using local perceptions of the effects of climate change on livelihoods for larger-scale interventions. It also provides a case study of local perceptions of the effects of floods and droughts on livelihoods in an arid area with natural resource-dependent livelihoods. Practical implications-To understand local perceptions and use local perceptions for larger-scale adaptation interventions and policy.

For this purpose, ensembles consisting of stepwise coupled models are generally used [emission scenario global circulation model downscaling approach (DA) bias correction impact model (hydrological model)], in which every item is affected by considerable uncertainty. The aim of the current study is (1) to analyse the uncertainty related to the choice of the DA as well as the hydrological model and its parameterization and (2) to evaluate the vulnerability of the studied catchment, a subcatchment of the highly anthropogenically impacted Spree River catchment, to hydrological change. Four different DAs are used to drive four different model configurations of two conceptually different hydrological models (Water Balance Simulation Model developed at ETH Zurich and HBV-light). In total, 452 simulations are carried out. The results show that all simulations compute an increase in air temperature and potential evapotranspiration. For precipitation, runoff and actual evapotranspiration, opposing trends are computed depending on the DA used to drive the hydrological models. Overall, the largest source of uncertainty can be attributed to the choice of the DA, especially regarding whether it is statistical or dynamical. The choice of the hydrological model and its parameterization is of less importance when long-term mean annual changes are compared. The large bandwidth at the end of the modelling chain may exacerbate the formulation of suitable climate change adaption strategies on the regional scale.

The article asks the following question: what is the full range of determinants of delivery by non-state actor focused on adaptation to climate change and disaster risk reduction? Drawing on data collected through interviews with, and a survey of, core partners in a selection of non-state actor actions, the article puts forward a taxonomy that can help gauge the likelihood that a non-state actor action may be able to deliver on its intended objectives. The findings presented in the article reveal that several of the determinants of delivery by non-state actors are outside of the sphere of influence of the core partners in these actions. The article makes the case for using this kind of taxonomies to conducting ex ante assessments of non-state actor actions, with a view to reflecting the results of the assessments in the design of the action, thus increasing the quality of non-state actor action.","[Puig, Daniel; Bakhtiari, Fatemeh] Tech Univ Denmark, Marmorvej 51, Copenhagen O, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Puig, D (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Marmorvej 51, Copenhagen O, Denmark.",dapu@dtu.dk; fatebak@dtu.dk,"Puig, Daniel/HHM-4500-2022","Puig, Daniel/0000-0001-9165-6838; Bakhtiari, Fatemeh/0000-0002-9123-4173",,,,,22,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This paper aims to evaluate how prepared are donors and recipients to spend this money well by analyzing institutional and organizational capabilities for climate change adaptation in least developed country (LDC) administrations using the case of Nepal, a country which can be considered to be an archetypal LDC. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted over 100 in-depth structured qualitative interviews with government officials from across the organizational chain in the ministries concerned with climate change, ranging from the lowest-ranked employee to just under the ministerial ranks. This was supplemented with detailed surveys of three representative communities from different ecological zones in Nepal. Data were analyzed using Ostrom's IAD framework. Findings - Local administrations are more motivated and capable than are given credit for by donors but nevertheless face critical barriers in being able to function autonomously and confront climate change challenges. These barriers create three interrelated challenges: An organizational challenge to create intrinsic incentives which empower and grant autonomy to front line agents, an institutional challenge to go beyond accountability-focused process validation and a policy-choice challenge which avoids the temptation to write aspirational policies without clear and feasible strategies to obtain the resources necessary for their implementation. Practical implications - The findings point to ways climate assistance can be restructured for more reach and effectiveness.

This calls for both adaptation of rural functions and climate-proof and water-resilient design of the rural area, often implying improvement of water retention and flood protection. Implementation of such climate change-related goals in spatial planning often involves adaptations in water management, perhaps even leading to land consolidation. Water management and land consolidation thus form important tools for spatial adaptation. Land consolidation is also a tool to support the integration of other claims that need room, such as agriculture, nature, landscape and tourism functions. This paper investigates the history of and approaches to land consolidation and water management in Poland and the Netherlands, and illustrates the integration of land consolidation and water management to realize a multi-functional climate resilient rural area by two examples in each country. We qualitatively compared the extent to which the planned activities in water retention and flood protection were realized and planned results were achieved for other functions. We found that the two adaptation measures, water retention and flood protection, were more effective in the Netherlands, stemming from ample attention for the impact of climate change and the incorporation of climate change adaptation goals in water policy. Furthermore, the water retention and flood protection measures in the Netherlands better serve multiple functions: agriculture, nature, recreation, landscape and infrastructure. Reasons for this are the multidisciplinary and participatory approach, attention to public awareness and communication and promotion of the process. On the other hand, the Dutch have much to learn from Poland's vast, undisturbed natural areas, which contribute to a climate resilient landscape. Both Poland and the Netherlands could therefore benefit from bringing together ideas and experiences regarding climate proofing the rural area.","[Stanczuk-Galwiaczek, Malgorzata; Sobolewska-Mikulska, Katarzyna] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Geodesy & Cartog, Pl Politech 1 Pok 312, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland; [Ritzema, Henk] Wageningen Univ, Water Resource Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Loon-Steensma, Jantsje M.] Wageningen Univ, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Loon-Steensma, Jantsje M.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Dept Hydraul Engn, Stevinweg 1, Cn Delft, Netherlands",Warsaw University of Technology; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Delft University of Technology,"Stanczuk-Galwiaczek, M (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Geodesy & Cartog, Pl Politech 1 Pok 312, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland.",m.stanczuk@gik.pw.edu.pl,,"Stanczuk-Galwiaczek, Malgorzata/0000-0002-9595-9155; Sobolewska-Mikulska, Katarzyna/0000-0003-1685-1486; van Loon-Steensma, Jantsje M./0000-0002-6181-7829",,,,,65,33,36,9,84,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,SEP,2018,77,,,,,,498,511,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.06.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.06.005,,,14,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GQ9DW,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000442067100047,View Full Record in Web of Science

A comparative survey was used to collect data from 410 farmers and 114 advisors in Germany. The majority of both farmers and advisors reported perceivable effects of climatic change on plant production. The increase in droughts and hot spells, the increased incidence of torrential rain, and mild winters were mentioned as the main effects of climate change. For climate change adaptation, the farmers and advisors mostly relied on a locally-adapted cultivar selection. It is estimated that eco-stability, grain yield, resistance to lodging and drought tolerance are important cultivar properties. In the study, farmers and advisors equally pointed out the need for additional cultivar evaluation according to eco-stability. Finally, only minor differences regarding farmers' and advisors' assessments were found within the study. The outcome of this research points to the need of implementing farmers' demands in cultivar recommendations. For example, an impartial assessment of cultivars' eco-stability could help support the choice of cultivars and reduce the growing risks in cereal production with regard to climate change.","[Macholdt, Janna; Honermeier, Bernd] Univ Giessen, Dept Agron, Inst Agron & Plant Breeding 1, D-35392 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Macholdt, J (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Dept Agron, Inst Agron & Plant Breeding 1, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.",janna.c.macholdt@agrar.uni-giessen.de,"Macholdt, Janna/AAF-3540-2021; Macholdt, Janna/AAK-5953-2020; Honermeier, Bernd/AAN-3032-2020","Macholdt, Janna/0000-0001-9703-8109; ",Justus-Liebig-University Giessen,Justus-Liebig-University Giessen,We acknowledge funding for covering the costs of publishing with open access by the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen.

In these regions the adaptation challenge is complicated by the fact that elevation contrasts and dissected topography produce diverse climatic conditions that are often accompanied by significant ecological and agricultural diversity within a relatively small region. Such is the case for the Choke Mountain watersheds, in the Blue Nile Highlands of Ethiopia. These watersheds extend from tropical alpine environments at over 4000 m elevation to the hot and dry Blue Nile gorge that includes areas below 1000 m elevation, and contain a diversity of slope forms and soil types. This physical diversity and accompanying socio-economic contrasts demand diverse strategies for enhanced climate resilience and adaptation to climate change. To support development of locally appropriate climate resilience strategies across the Blue Nile Highlands, we present here an agroecosystem analysis of Choke Mountain, under the premise that the agroecosystem-the intersection of climatic and physiographic conditions with agricultural practices-is the most appropriate unit for defining adaptation strategies in these primarily subsistence agriculture communities. To this end, we present two approaches to agroecosystem analysis that can be applied to climate resilience studies in the Choke Mountain watersheds and, as appropriate, to other agroecologically diverse regions attempting to design climate adaptation strategies. First, a full agroecoystem analysis was implemented in collaboration with local communities. It identified six distinct agroecosystems that differ systematically in constraints and adaptation potential. This analysis was then paired with an objective landscape classification trained to identify agroecosystems based on climate and physiographic setting alone. It was found that the distribution of Choke Mountain watershed agroecosystems can, to first order, be explained as a function of prevailing climate. This suggests that the conditions that define current agroecosystems are likely to migrate under a changing climate, requiring adaptive management strategies. These agroecosystems show a remarkable degree of differentiation in terms of production orientation and socio-economic characteristics of the farming communities suggesting different options and interventions towards building resilience to climate change.","[Simane, Belay] Univ Addis Ababa, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Zaitchik, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Ozdogan, Mutlu] Univ Wisconsin, Forest &Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Addis Ababa University; Johns Hopkins University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Simane, B (corresponding author), Univ Addis Ababa, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",simaneb@yahoo.com; zaitchik@jhu.edu; ozdogan@wisc.edu,"Zaitchik, Benjamin/AAB-3298-2020","Zaitchik, Benjamin/0000-0002-0698-0658; Ozdogan, Mutlu/0000-0002-1707-3375",Addis Ababa University; NSF-CNH [GEO-1211235]; Directorate For Geosciences [1211235] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Addis Ababa University; NSF-CNH; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),The authors thank three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments that improved the manuscript.

We collected qualitative data on farmers' ILK through semi-structured interviews, which we supplemented with climatological trend analysis in four Colca Valley districts. We found that shifts in the rainy season together with warmer weather affected farmers' ILK, which was less effective for informing crop planting and irrigation practices in the context of climate uncertainty and unpredictability.

By analysing organizations' different, strategic constructions of climate change, this malleability becomes clear. Our paper focuses on two Australian wine companies' approaches to climate change. Using an analysis of interviews with 18 company staff we uncovered two divergent business logics underlying the same climate change responses. Our analysis extends beyond simply identifying dominant frames of climate change to examining what motivates different organizations to create different frames. This has implications for the climate change responses that organizations might implement (or not) and more broadly, for how climate change 'adaptation' (and 'mitigation') is understood and applied.

In this study, we aimed to examine fishers' decisions to adapt to climate change and their expectations for their children to pursue the same profession. Data were obtained from fisher households covering 8 districts and 22 sub-districts in the coastal area of Chumphon Province, Thailand, using participatory observation, focus group discussion, and in-person field surveys. A binary logistic regression model was used to determine factors influencing the fishers' decisions and their expectations for their children to inherit their occupation. Results showed that the fishers are aware of the increasing trends in air temperature, sea water temperature, inland precipitation, offshore precipitation, and storms. Increased fishing experience and fishing income increased the likelihood of the fishers applying adaptations to climate change. Looking to the future, fishers with high fishing incomes expect their children to pursue the occupation, whereas increased fishing experience, non-fishing incomes, and perceptions of storms likely discourage them from expecting their children to be fishers. Of the fishers interviewed, 58.06% decided to apply adaptations in response to climate change by incorporating climate-smart agriculture, particularly by cultivating rubber, oil palm, and orchards as a second income source. The adoption of climate-smart fisheries should be considered in relation to the body of local knowledge, as well as the needs and priorities of the fisher community. To cope with the impacts of current and future climate change on coastal communities, the national focal point of adaptation should be climate change, and related governmental agencies should pay more attention to these key factors for adaptation.","[Sereenonchai, Sukanya; Arunrat, Noppol] Mahidol Univ, Fac Environm & Resource Studies, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand",Mahidol University,"Arunrat, N (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Fac Environm & Resource Studies, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.",ssereenonchai@gmail.com; noppol.aru@mahidol.ac.th,"Arunrat, Noppol/AAU-7870-2021",,Mahidol University [860150013000],Mahidol University,"This research project was supported by Mahidol University for the fiscal year of 2017, grant number 860150013000.",,57,9,9,0,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2225-1154,,,CLIMATE,Climate,FEB,2019,7,2,,,,,,,34,10.3390/cli7020034,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7020034,,,16,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,HO1XK,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000460705300017,View Full Record in Web of Science

We conducted a survey of 60 U.S. municipalities followed by six in-depth case studies in the intermountain west states of Colorado, Wyoming and Utah that regularly experience weather and climate extreme events. Our analysis shows that perception of risk and external factors such as planning requirements and availability of funding stand out as important drivers.

The focus of this article is to highlight the potential presented by participatory rural appraisal techniques in the process of data collection, with an aim of enhancing collaborative learning and improving community knowledge for climate change adaptation.","[Omondi, Lilian A.] Maseno Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Kisumu, Kenya",Maseno University,"Omondi, LA (corresponding author), Maseno Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Kisumu, Kenya.",lilomondi@gmail.com,,"Omondi, Lilian/0000-0002-6590-4268",,,,,27,1,1,2,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1476-7503,1741-2617,,ACTION RES-LONDON,Action Res.,,,,,,,,,,,1476750320905901,10.1177/1476750320905901,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1476750320905901,,FEB 2020,13,"Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,KN3YR,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000514776700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a risk perspective to analyze these issues, preferential strategies emerge related to choices of being proactive, reactive, or emphasizing risk management as opposed to the precautionary principle.

The empirical focus is on Central Vietnam, but the argument is relevant in a broader context. The article specifically questions approaches to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation that see local community knowledge as a vital means to achieving resilience in socio-ecological systems. We argue that rural villages in Central Vietnam are characterised by highly dynamic local actors who eagerly exploit new income opportunities arising both from internal and external sources. Although a wide range of knowledge is available about how to cope with adverse climate and environmental conditions, this knowledge is hardly resilience and equilibrium oriented. Rather, it is found to be anthropocentric, externally oriented, sometimes opportunistic, and ultimately oriented towards an urban lifestyle-traits that are strongly rewarded by the Vietnamese state. We conclude that, at present, local aspirations may not necessarily be part of the solution, but may form part of a social and political complex that exacerbates risk, particularly for weaker population segments. Instead, new and non-state actors should play a larger role.","[Bruun, Ole; Olwig, Mette Fog] Roskilde Univ, Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Bruun, O (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Roskilde, Denmark.",obruun@ruc.dk; mettefo@ruc.dk,"Olwig, Mette Fog/Y-4322-2018","Olwig, Mette Fog/0000-0001-5081-6671",,,,,54,11,11,0,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1568-4849,1568-5314,,ASIAN J SOC SCI,Asian J.

However, comparable information concerning the performance of different UGI types to moderate such impacts is mostly lacking. This creates serious challenges for urban planners who need to decide on the most effective measures while considering spatial and administrative constraints. This study investigates how different types and quantities of UGI, i.e. trees, green roofs, and green facades, affect pedestrian thermal comfort. The study was applied to high-density residential areas under current and future climatic conditions. Climate change will on average increase afternoon Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) values by 2.4 K; however, this could be vastly reduced by different UGI scenarios. Planting trees had the strongest impact with an average PET reduction of 13% compared with existing vegetation. Trees shade open spaces and provide evapotranspirative cooling. Another valuable adaptation option is green facades, which have mitigating effects of 5%-10%. In contrast, the effects of green roofs were negligible. Our results indicate that increasing the share of green cover did not directly correspond to the magnitude of the PET reduction. Placing vegetation strategically in heat-exposed areas is more effective than just aiming at a high percentage of green cover. We conclude that our extensive comparative analysis provides empirical evidence to support UGI on the micro-scale and assists planners and decision-makers to effectively select and prioritise concrete measures to adapt to climate change.

Pakistan is facing severe crises of changing climate and it is ranked one of the most vulnerable countries due to climate change. Adaptation to climate change is the main strategy of Pakistan to deal with climatic impacts. Implementing the GBI plays a key role in urban areas for promoting adaptive governance towards climate change. Many efforts have been initiated to manage the issue of climate change by the national, provincial, and local governments in Pakistan. The latest and notable strategy by Pakistani government was devised in the form of the Clean Green Pakistan Strategy (CGPS) to promote the GBI as adaptation strategy to address climate change. However, there are multiple challenges and hurdles for effective implementation of the CGPS. On the heels of Paris Agreement 2015, the CSOs have growing role to overcome such challenges and to prepare the local communities in collaboration with local institutions especially in cities for advancing the GBI and tackling climate change effectively. This study is conducted to understand and uncover the role of the CSOs for promoting the GBI as adaptive strategy in dealing with climate change in Islamabad city of Pakistan. The study focuses to investigate and dig out the prominent initiatives of the CSOs towards the GBI in Pakistani governance system. It also identifies the hurdles and challenges for the CSOs in relation to promote the GBI in Pakistan. A case study approach as research methodology is employed where semistructured interviews were conducted with relevant actors in Islamabad city. The study finds that the CSOs are actively involved in promotion of the GBI in collaboration with Islamabad administration through plantation drive, educating school students on the GBI, arranging training programs for the local community, providing advocacy assistance and helping the city government for establishing policies and action plans for the GBI. The CSOs act as representative of the local community in devising the GBI policies and implementation actions at local scale through consistent engagements with the local administration and the local community in the city. The CSOs have emerged as a mediator in aligning intergovernmental relations for implementing the GBI as the CSOs are closely working with local, provincial, and federal institutions, thus they are key for all tiers of the government. The major challenges faced by the CSOs are identified: weak linkage and cooperation among local and international organizations, limited financial resources, and weak capacity of local organizations. The role of the CSOs appears in an infancy stages but it is emerging with a reasonable pace for effective adaptive governance in relation with the GBI in Pakistan.","[Mumtaz, Muhammad] Univ Haripur, Dept Management Sci, Hattar Rd, Haripur, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan",,"Mumtaz, M (corresponding author), Univ Haripur, Dept Management Sci, Hattar Rd, Haripur, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan.",mumtaz86@hotmail.com,,"Mumtaz, Muhammad/0000-0001-6754-8941",,,,,51,3,3,1,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

However, the sector itself is vulnerable to the impacts of global warming. Extreme weather events and gradual changes in climate variables can affect the reliability, cost, and environmental impacts of the energy supply. This paper analyzed the interplay between CO2 mitigation attempts and adaptations to climate change in the power sector using the Long-range Energy Alternative Planning System (LEAP) model. This paper presented a novel methodology to integrate both CO2 mitigation goals and the impacts of climate change into simulations of a power system expansion. The impacts on electricity supply and demand were quantified, based on historical climate-related impacts revealed during fieldwork and existing literature. The quantified effects, together with climate mitigation targets, were then integrated into the LEAP modeling architecture. The results showed a substantial alteration in technology composition and an increase in installed capacities driven by the joint climate mitigation-adaptation efforts when compared with the scenario without mitigation and adaptation (reference). Furthermore, an increase in CO2 emissions was observed under the mitigation-adaptation scenario compared with the mitigation only scenario, indicating that the power sector's adaptations for climate change are likely to hinder CO2 mitigation efforts. Therefore, a nexus between mitigation and adaptation should be exploited in the policy development for a low-carbon and climate-resilient power system.","[Handayani, Kamia; Filatova, Tatiana; Krozer, Yoram] Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands; [Handayani, Kamia] PT PLN Persero, Jl Trunojoyo Blok M1-135, Kebayoran Baru, Jakarta Selatan, Indonesia; [Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & IT, Sch Informat Syst & Modeling, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Krozer, Yoram] Sustainable Innovat Acad, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Anugrah, Pinto] Univ Negeri Padang, Dept Elect Engn, Jalan Prof Dr Hamka, Air Tawar Padang, Sumatera Barat, Indonesia",University of Twente; Perusahaan Listrik Negara; University of Technology Sydney; Universitas Negeri Padang,"Handayani, K (corresponding author), Room RA 1161,Ravelijn Bldg,POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",k.handayani@utwente.nl,"; Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","Anugrah, Pinto/0000-0002-1486-9458; Handayani, Kamia/0000-0001-5253-5056; Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930",Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) [PRJ-2570/LPDP/2015]; Stockholm Environmental Institute,Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP); Stockholm Environmental Institute,"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) under the Grant number PRJ-2570/LPDP/2015.

This study is to investigate the adaptive implications for energy-intensive industries of China in response to climate change impacts. For this purpose, a deep and comprehensive analysis on the change of CO2 emission for 6 energy-intensive sectors is explored over the period of 2000-2007. A Log-Mean Divisia Index based on time series is also introduced in our study to identify the key factors toward the change of CO2 emission. It is shown that there were 146.1 million metric tons carbon increased in energy-intensive industries from 2000 to 2007. And the excessive growth of industrial output and increasingly fossil-intensive energy consumption structure were the main driving forces for the increased CO2 emission. Nevertheless, energy intensity change and declining emission coefficient of electricity played negative role in the growing trend of CO2 emission. On the basis of these four determinants (namely industrial output, energy intensity, fuel mix effect, and emission coefficient), it is suggested that both economic motives and technologically feasible approaches should be implemented to control the scale of excessive productions and improve energy efficiency toward the energy-intensive industries. And more importantly, strengthening energy-intensive sectors' awareness of climate change adaptation should be given stronger emphasis as long-term work with the help of some propaganda campaigns for instance.","[Wang, Zhaohua; Zhang, Bin] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhaohua; Zhang, Bin] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yin, Jianhua] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Business, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; University of International Business & Economics,"Wang, ZH (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",wangzhaohua@bit.edu.cn,"Wang, Zhaohua/AAP-5489-2021",,"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-10-0048]; Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation [121079]; National Nature Science Foundation of China [71173017, 71172106, 70773008]; Ministry of Education of China [20101101110034]; State Key Development Program of Basic Research of China [2012CB95570003, 2012CB95570004]; Nature Science Foundation of Beijing [9112013, 9092015]","Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation(Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation); National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); State Key Development Program of Basic Research of China(State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China); Nature Science Foundation of Beijing","This study is supported by the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (Reference no.

However, they are also affected by climate change and various other phenomena, for example, the low growth of coniferous forests currently reported globally, including in the Republic of Korea. In response to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the Korean government has proposed 2030 greenhouse gas roadmap to achieve a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), and the forest sector set a sequestration target of 26 million tons by 2030. In this study, the Korean forest growth model (KO-G-Dynamic model) was used to analyze various climate change and forest management scenarios and their capacity to address the NDC targets. A 2050 climate change adaptation strategy is suggested based on forest growth and CO2 sequestration. Results Forest growth was predicted to gradually decline, and CO2 sequestration was predicted to reach 23 million tons per year in 2050 if current climate and conditions are maintained. According to the model, sequestrations of 33 million tCO(2) year(-1) in 2030 and 27 million tCO(2) year(-1) in 2050 can be achieved if ideal forest management is implemented. It was also estimated that the current forest management budget of 317 billion KRW (264 million USD) should be twice as large at 722 billion KRW (602 million USD) in the 2030s and 618 billion KRW (516 million USD) in the 2050s to achieve NDC targets. Conclusions The growth trend in Korea's forests transitions from young-matured stands to over-mature forests. The presented model-based forest management plans are an appropriate response and can increase the capacity of Korea to achieve its NDC targets. Such a modeling can help the forestry sector develop plans and policies for climate change adaptation.","[Hong, Mina; Kim, Jiwon; Cho, Kijong; Son, Yowhan; Lee, Woo-Kyun] Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Song, Cholho] Korea Univ, OJEong Resilience Inst OJERI, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Kim, Moonil] Pyeongtaek Univ, Dept ICT Integrated Environm, Pyeongtaek 17869, South Korea; [Lee, Sle-gee] Chonnam Natl Univ, Forest Resource Res Ctr, Gwangju 61186, South Korea; [Lim, Chul-Hee] Kookmin Univ, Coll Gen Educ, Seoul 02707, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University; Pyeongtaek University; Chonnam National University; Kookmin University,"Lee, WK (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",leewk@korea.ac.kr,,"Kim, Jiwon/0000-0003-1856-4114","Korea Ministry of Environment under the Climate Change Correspondence Program [2014001310008]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2018R1A2B6005682]; R&D Program for Forest Science Technology by Korea Forest Service (Korea Forestry Promotion Institute) [2018110C10-2020-BB01, 2021329A002122-AA03]","Korea Ministry of Environment under the Climate Change Correspondence Program(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); R&D Program for Forest Science Technology by Korea Forest Service (Korea Forestry Promotion Institute)(Korea Forest ServiceKorea Forestry Promotion Institute (KOFPI))",This study was supported by the Korea Ministry of Environment under the Climate Change Correspondence Program (Project Number: 2014001310008) and National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2018R1A2B6005682).

This study uses a frame analysis to examine the disputed Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme in Cork, Ireland. This analysis reveals a multi-party and multi-perspective dispute that is more complex than the two sided conflict it may appear to be at first glance. However despite this diversity of views, many of the stakeholders involved share similar assumptions about flood risk and its management, reflecting the role of a dominant discourse in setting the boundaries of debate. Place attachment emerges as a key cross cutting theme, of importance to both opponents and proponents of the proposed scheme. Place attachment can act as either a barrier to transformative adaptation or as a motivator for action. While highlighting areas of disagreement between local stakeholders, conflicts such as the Cork dispute can also represent new opportunities to engage wider constituencies with hazards management and to bring new perspectives into the decision-making process. The emergence of place attachment as a cross cutting theme illustrates that using place as a boundary concept around which to centre the decision-making process may allow for the testing of new approaches to hazards management and climate change adaptation. These would incorporate both a wider range of stakeholders including those not directly impacted by hazards, and a broader range of issues, situating hazards management within a wider context.","[Jeffers, James M.] Bath Spa Univ, Sch Sci & Social Sci, Hazard Risk & Disaster Res Grp, Bath, Avon, England",Bath Spa University,"Jeffers, JM (corresponding author), Bath Spa Univ, Sch Sci & Social Sci, Hazard Risk & Disaster Res Grp, Bath, Avon, England.",j.jeffers@bathspa.ac.uk,,"Jeffers, James/0000-0001-6315-9949","College of Liberal Arts, Bath Spa University","College of Liberal Arts, Bath Spa University","Fieldwork research for this project was funded by the College of Liberal Arts, Bath Spa University.",,63,7,7,1,20,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,JUL,2019,103,,,,,,26,35,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2019.02.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2019.02.003,,,10,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,IH4ZA,,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000474499400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we use variation in greenspaces to test the effectiveness of climate adaptation policy across climate impacts and vulnerability dimensions. Using satellite imagery and logistic regression, we analyze spatiotemporal correlation between greenspace and climate vulnerability in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, an area comprising similar to 70 million people and 11 cities, making it a useful natural experiment for our study. We find that while greenspace increases proportionally with climate exposure and sensitivity, many cities exhibit discrepancies between greenspace variation and climate vulnerability. Green adaptation funnels into wealthier, less vulnerable areas while bypassing more vulnerable ones, increasing their climate vulnerability and undermining the benefits of urban agglomeration. The results suggest that centrally-planned climate adaptation policy must accommodate local heterogeneity to improve urban sustainability.

This inability is particularly deep in the Italian context, where the integration of climate adaptation strategies within urban planning is very limited; thus, one of the planner's overriding needs is to determine where NBS can be most effective. The objective of this paper is to identify key drivers and tools for the introduction of hydrological resilience assessments and sustainable storm water management in urban planning practices, as a contribution to climate adaptation strategies. Through a case study in the city of Bari, the paper proposes a method for identifying the most suitable urban areas for implementing NBS, i.e., areas where NBS are able to intercept runoff. On the other hand, the same approach allows one to evaluate in advance the impact of urban planning choices, or rather of the planned land use change. Finally, the planning tools that may favor the adoption of a NBS approach in urban planning are analyzed, with particular reference to the territorial landscape plan of the Apulia region and urban regeneration plans.","[Leone, Antonio] Univ Salento, Dept Innovat Engn, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Grassini, Laura; Balena, Pasquale] Polytech Univ Bari, Dept Civil Environm Land Bldg Engn & Chem DICATEC, I-70125 Bari, Italy",University of Salento; Politecnico di Bari,"Grassini, L (corresponding author), Polytech Univ Bari, Dept Civil Environm Land Bldg Engn & Chem DICATEC, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",laura.grassini@poliba.it,,"LEONE, Antonio/0000-0002-6314-5878",,,,,38,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2022,14,24,,,,,,,16870,10.3390/su142416870,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142416870,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7G8AA,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000902738600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, studies of the effect of temperature change on total mortality have been conducted in numerous countries. However, few of those studies focused on temperature-related mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) or considered future population changes and adaptation to climate change. We present herein a projection of temperature-related mortality due to CVD under different climate change, population, and adaptation scenarios in Beijing, a megacity in China. To this end, 19 global circulation models (GCMs), 3 representative concentration pathways (RCPs), 3 socioeconomic pathways, together with generalized linear models and distributed lag non-linear models, were used to project future temperature-related CVD mortality during periods centered around the years 2050 and 2070. The number of temperature-related CVD deaths in Beijing is projected to increase by 3.5-10.2% under different RCP scenarios compared with that during the baseline period. Using the same GCM, the future daily maximum temperatures projected using the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios showed a gradually increasing trend. When population change is considered, the annual rate of increase in temperature-related CVD deaths was up to fivefold greater than that under no-population-change scenarios. The decrease in the number of cold-related deaths did not compensate for the increase in that of heat-related deaths, leading to a general increase in the number of temperature-related deaths due to CVD in Beijing. In addition, adaptation to climate change may enhance rather than ameliorate the effect of climate change, as the increase in cold-related CVD mortality greater than the decrease in heat-related CVD mortality in the adaptation scenarios will result in an increase in the total number of temperature-related CVD mortalities.","[Zhang, Boya; Li, Guoxing; Pan, Xiaochuan] Peking Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Occupat & Environm Hlth, 38 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yue] Depauw Univ, Greencastle, IN 46135 USA; [Zhang, Boya] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University; DePauw University; Peking University,"Li, GX (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Occupat & Environm Hlth, 38 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",doriszhang0115@163.com; liguoxing@bjmu.edu.cn; mayue601@163.com; xcpan@bjmu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81372950],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 81372950).,,38,32,34,0,50,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

Rethinking the material arrangements of expertise in the Anthropocene, I track the work of a group of technoscientific experts participating in the Guyana Mangrove Restoration Project (GMRP). In an attempt to redesign sea defense around mangrove ecosystems, GMRP participants recognize that climate adaptation is not solely dependent on their well-intentioned efforts. As research objects, mangroves are not only forms of evidence but also tools that guide expert action and distinctions in day-to-day labor. Moreover, mangroves draw out the explicit contingencies of modeling, placing expert groups in tension with one another as each seeks to advance their own ideas for mangrove protection, management, or change. I show that this relational ontology is emblematic of climate-adaptation policy's broader operative logics, or what I call inverse performativity. This is a process whereby an unruly world forces one expert group to seek help from others, building a new ecology of expertise to adapt to a changing climate. Impermanent and wondrous, mangroves urge us to think more creatively about vulnerability to climate change and the kinds of practices that inspire knowledge about it.","[Vaughn, Sarah E.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Vaughn, Sarah E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Yale University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Vaughn, SE (corresponding author), Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Vaughn, SE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Vaughn, Sarah/0000-0001-7127-0575",Mellon Mays-Social Science Research Council; American Council of Learned Societies,Mellon Mays-Social Science Research Council; American Council of Learned Societies,"I am indebted to all those who worked for the GMRP and welcomed me into their professional and personal lives.

At the same time, prioritization of the most vulnerable countries is a key goal within this emerging architecture. The paper analyses whether the Green Climate Fund (GCF), by far the largest climate change fund, has so far delivered on its promise to prioritize the most vulnerable countries. For our analysis, we consider the USD 2.5 billion GCF funding allocated until the end of the first mobilization phase and disaggregate it project-by-project into its mitigation and adaptation related amounts. We then analyze the adaptation flows in terms of the recipient country's level of vulnerability and institutional capacity. We further analyze whether funds are being accessed through independent national entities or international intermediaries and whether recipient countries have developing country priority status. The results show that funds-based adaptation finance creates an ambiguous picture: On the one hand, the GCF is on track in allocating its funds largely to country groups which its statutes aim to prioritize, particularly LDCs, African countries and SIDS. At the same time, the proposal process results in the fact that many countries with the highest climate vulnerability but weak government institutions and fragile state-bureaucracies have missed out and not been able to access project funding, mostly LDCs in Africa and conflict-ridden countries. Further, most countries have not yet been able to access project funds independently through their national entities, limiting direct access and country ownership - the strengthening of which is a major goal of the fund. The findings suggest that simplified approval tracks need to be strengthened in the emerging climate finance architecture so that populations in countries with the lowest institutional capacity but highest vulnerability are not being left behind in the long-run.","[Garschagen, Matthias; Doshi, Deepal] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Garschagen, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",m.garschagen@lmu.de,,"Doshi, Deepal/0000-0002-9606-2809",,,,,107,10,10,9,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

This study applied Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) to understand residents' anxieties about potential incidents caused by climate change in Amami islands, Japan. Through an interview with stakeholders, we selected five potential incidents for our BWS attributes: damage caused by typhoon and heavy rain (typhoon), damage caused by flood and a landslide (flood), damage from a drought (drought), damage from ciguatera fish poisoning (ciguatera), and incident caused by jellyfish (jellyfish). Changes in frequencies of the abovementioned incidents have already been observed in Japan. In 2016, we conducted a questionnaire survey of residents in Amami islands and received over 700 valid responses to BWS questions. Results showed that the average respondent was most anxious about the risk of typhoon, followed by flood, drought, ciguatera, and jellyfish. Furthermore, a comparative analysis did not find large variations among the islands in the residents' anxiety ranking concerning the incidents, but the degrees of their anxieties were different. The Amami-Oshima residents, for example, had relatively higher anxieties about flood, whereas the Okinoerabujima residents showed higher anxiety about drought. These findings support that their risk perceptions are determined by their experience and surrounding environments. Understanding the sensitivity of residents to climate change risk will encourage stakeholders to communicate and enhance climate change adaptation in local communities.","[Kubo, Takahiro; Abe, Hiroya; Yamano, Hiroya] NIES, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosyst Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058502, Japan; [Tsuge, Takahiro] Konan Univ, Fac Econ, Higashinada Ku, 8-9-1 Okamoto, Kobe, Hyogo 6588501, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Konan University,"Kubo, T (corresponding author), NIES, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosyst Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058502, Japan.",kubo.takahiro@nies.go.jp,"Kubo, Takahiro/E-1243-2012; Abe, Hiroya/AAM-8143-2021","Kubo, Takahiro/0000-0002-4832-5539; Yamano, Hiroya/0000-0002-1549-2429; Abe, Hiroya/0000-0003-2777-5570","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K00697]; Ministry of the Environmental, Japan [Economics and Policy Study; ERTDF (S-15: Predicting and Assessing Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services (PANCES)]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K00697] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Ministry of the Environmental, Japan [Economics and Policy Study; ERTDF (S-15: Predicting and Assessing Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services (PANCES)]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We acknowledge financial support from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (no. 16K00697), and the Ministry of the Environmental, Japan [Economics and Policy Study; ERTDF (S-15: Predicting and Assessing Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services (PANCES)].

Subsequently, context-specific considerations are in order, since limited research employing mixed Q-methodology has previously been conducted in rural South Africa. Thereby, we hope to provide some guidance for conducting mixed methodological research in this context.

However, its application faces challenges given the projected scale of climate-induced displacement and the difficulties of resettlement. We evaluate the drivers, barriers and outcomes of 27 recent cases of managed retreat that have resettled approximately 1.3 million people. A conceptual model based on two key factors-who benefits from retreat and who initiates it-organizes the diverse set of cases into four quadrants. Different sociopolitical dimensions emerge as particularly influential in each quadrant. The model establishes a foundation for understanding and anticipating case-specific complexities.

In this paper, we explore the connections between media framing of disasters, and risk communication and preparedness. Through the case of media coverage of eleven newspapers (international and national publications) around the event of Cyclone Amphan in South Asia, we portray a strong media framing around the event. Our findings are three-fold. Firstly, the response system in India and Bangladesh could not follow pre-determined disaster action plans and protocols for a coordinated response, due to the risks and restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. Secondly, the journalistic response to cyclone Amphan framed the disaster event as 'natural', thus reinforcing the reliance on a short-term Response & Recovery centric approach (evacuation, rescue, and relief), over long-term approaches such as disaster preparedness and prevention (adaptation, mitigation, and resilience). Finally, we find that media framing focused on personal stories of individuals helps advance the needs of vulnerable groups; yet at the same time concretizes a relief-centric approach that ignores questions around disaster infrastructure, resilience, and climate change adaptation. We contend that an integrated risk communication approach that is adaptive, takes into account multiple risks and complexities while allowing coordinated efforts between actors and institutions is necessary to develop an effective response policy for disasters and climate-induced extreme events in the future.","[Parida, Debadutta] Univ Alberta, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Moses, Sandra] BMS Sch Architecture, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Rahaman, Khan Rubayet] St Marys Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada",University of Alberta; Saint Marys University - Canada,"Rahaman, KR (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",dparida@ualberta.ca; sandra.moses2712@gmail.com; khan.rahaman@smu.ca,,"Rahaman, Khan/0000-0002-8018-2355",,,,,105,8,8,6,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Climate change-induced changing weather patterns and more extreme weather events are only part of the explanation for this situation, as large segments of the urban population in West Africa are not offered the public services, infrastructure and protective regulations needed in order to respond to floods. Through an empirically grounded approach, the article shows that the ability to respond to floods is formed largely outside the realm of the state in a poor peri-urban municipality of Pikine, Dakar. The authors show how the organization of collective services pertaining to flood response and climate change adaptation is maintained through co-production among service users and providers entailing a mixture of diverse governance modes. The article concludes that weak state capacity is not equivalent to non-existent or ungoverned collective services linked to floods. While flood response service delivery through co-production may constitute the best available options in a context of poor resources, because of the negotiated character of public service delivery, it also creates an environment favourable for brokers to take ownership of central processes of service delivery and for structural inequalities to be reinforced locally.","[Schaer, Caroline] UNEP DTU Partnership UDP, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Hanonou, Eric Komlavi] Roskilde Univ, Dept Soc & Globalisat, Roskilde, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Roskilde University,"Schaer, C (corresponding author), UNEP DTU Partnership UDP, Copenhagen, Denmark.",,,,,,,,61,12,12,2,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-9934,1477-027X,,PROG DEV STUD,Prog.

Decision-makers must balance competing public and private interests and short-and long-term concerns against a background of considerable uncertainty and complexity. One of the classic challenges of environmental governance is to establish laws and other institutions which support long-term decision-making in the public interest and this is equally a challenge for adaptation planning. This article explores Australian approaches to such policy trade-offs in the context of spatial planning for bushfire and coastal hazards. These examples illustrate the difficulties of considering cumulative, longer term environmental impacts of adaptation measures in the face of immediate and known risks to existing private property and infrastructure, and the way in which current decision-making downplays these public values.

Based on calibration and evaluation, the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model was employed to determine the response of soil water and winter wheat to rainfall and temperature changing over the last 30 years in different regions. Results showed that (1) the EPIC model simulated soil water content well in 0-2 m soil, with a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) value of 6.0-14.0%, and the mean value of R-2 was 0.824, which was similar to the value of ME (0.815); (2) rainfall decreased 13.6-24.9% more from 2001 to 2010 than it did during 1961-2000, while its minimum and maximum temperature increased 1.00-1.55 degrees C and 0.30-0.84 degrees C respectively, in comparison with 1961-2000; (3) both the increase of maximum temperature and the decrease of rainfall were harmful to the production of winter wheat. Contrarily, the increase of minimum temperature was beneficial to the production of winter wheat on the Loess Plateau of China. Furthermore, due to rainfall decreasing, the winter wheat yield of Luochuan, Changwu, Yuncheng, and Yan'an decreased by 8.5%, 7.6%, 11.7%, and 12.3%, respectively. Because of the rising of the maximum temperature, winter wheat yield decreased 6.4%, 6.8%, 7.2%, and -3.0%, respectively. On the other hand, the increase of the minimum temperature raised the winter wheat yield of 8.8%, 10.2%, 1.5%, and 12.0%, respectively. Climate change, either precipitation reduction or temperature increase, decreased soil water in the dry land winter wheat field. Therefore, more water-saving technologies are needed to adapt to climate change, to store and use water sources more effectively in semi-arid regions. Though precipitation reduction and maximum temperature increase produced negative impacts on winter wheat yield, the uptrend in minimum temperature is better for increasing the winter wheat yield, which can be used by farmers and governments to adapt to climate change, by adjusting planting time properly.","[Wang, Xuechun; Qadir, Muslim; Yang, Guotao; Hu, Yungao] Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci & Engn, Mianyang 621000, Peoples R China; [Qadir, Muslim] Lasbela Univ Agr Water & Marine Sci Uthal, Fac Agr, Balochistan 74200, Pakistan; [Rasul, Fahd] Washington State Univ, Agweathernet, Prosser, WA 99350 USA; [Rasul, Fahd] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Agron, AgroClimatol Lab, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan",Southwest University of Science & Technology - China; Washington State University; University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Hu, YG (corresponding author), Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci & Engn, Mianyang 621000, Peoples R China.",xuechunwang@swust.edu.cn; msmirwani22@gmail.com; drfahdrasul@gmail.com; langzi0509@sina.com; hongni2005@sohu.com,"Rasul, Fahd/H-6016-2011","Rasul, Fahd/0000-0002-7813-2981",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0300210]; international cooperation projects of Sichuan Province [2018HH0039]; Foundation of Southwest University of Science and Technology University [11zx7140],National Key Research and Development Program of China; international cooperation projects of Sichuan Province; Foundation of Southwest University of Science and Technology University,This study was sponsored by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFD0300210) the international cooperation projects of Sichuan Province (No. 2018HH0039) and the Foundation of Southwest University of Science and Technology University for new teachers with doctoral degrees (No. 11zx7140).,,38,9,12,5,33,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,JUL,2018,8,7,,,,,,,101,10.3390/agronomy8070101,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy8070101,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,GO6ZL,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000440203900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is based on analysis of data collected from 734 randomly selected farm householdheads substantiated with Focus Group Discussions and field observations. Methods: The study employed descriptive methods to assess farmers' perception of climate change, localindicators of climate change and types of adaptation measures exercised to cop up with the risk of the change in climate. The study also employed the Heckman sample selection model to analyze the two-stepprocess of adaptation to climate change which initially requires farmers' perception that climate is changingprior to responding to the changes through adaptation measures. Results: Based on the model result educational attainment, the age of the head of the household, thenumber of crop failures in the past, changes in temperature and precipitation significantly influencedfarmers' perception of climate change in wet lowland parts of the study area. In dry lowland condition,farming experience, climate information, duration of food shortage, and the number of crop failuresexperienced determined farmers' perception of climate change. Farmers' adaptation decision in both the wet and dry lowland conditions is influenced by household size, the gender of household head, cultivatedland size, education, farm experience, non-farm income, income from livestock, climate information, extension advice, farm-home distance and number of parcels. However, the direction of influence and significance level of most of the explanatory variables vary between the two parts of the study area. Conclusions: In line with the results, any intervention that promotes the use of adaptation measures toclimate change may account for location-specific factors that determine farmers' perception of climate change and adaptive responses thereof.","[Asrat, Paulos; Simane, And Belay] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Environm & Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Asrat, P (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Environm & Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",paulosasrat63@gmail.com,"Asrat, Paulos/AAI-3344-2020","Asrat, Paulos/0000-0003-2058-9935",Addis Ababa University (AAU); DireDawa University (DDU),Addis Ababa University (AAU); DireDawa University (DDU),The authors would like to thank Addis Ababa University (AAU) and DireDawa University (DDU) for providing financial support for the data collection and write-up of the manuscript.,,45,94,97,5,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,2192-1709,,ECOL PROCESS,Ecol.

Adaptation projects can be developed through a combination of participatory, bottom-up needs assessments and top-down analyses. Climate change impact chains can help to display the causal chain of climate signals and resulting impacts and thereby establish a system map as a basis for stakeholder discussions. This article aims to develop specific climate change impact chains for the water management sector in rural coastal India that combine bottom-up and top-down perspectives. Case studies from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, India, provide a basis for the impact chains developed. Bottom-up data were gathered through a vulnerability and needs assessment in 18 villages complemented with top-down research data.

This paper evaluates experiences from the application of a CCA planning methodology that leverages social learning as the main approach for local communities to plan and design their CCA strategies in Burkina Faso, Chile and Senegal. In each case, the paper analyses the key features of the emerging social learning processes during the application of the methodology, presents and analyses participants' feedback and impressions of the process, as well as facilitators' feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology. An engaging social learning process was demonstrated through observing varying levels of occurrence of seven features - the pooling of different fields and forms of knowledge amongst the participants; creation of joint language; reshaping of perceptions and preconceptions; transformation of attitudes and patterns of communications; redefining of roles in the learning process; establishment of common values and mutual trust building. The methodology was referred to as being simple, inclusive, helping create ownership and highly interactive, by facilitators who used it. While this research demonstrated the immediate and short-term impacts of social learning to be positive for the CCA planning process, longer term monitoring is needed to fully understand the opportunities and limitations of social learning for CCA planning. In doing so, it is important to recognise the project driven modalities of CCA for rural communities is a limitation in itself in truly benefiting from the long-term benefits of social learning.","[Murti, Radhika; Mathez-Stiefel, Sarah-Lan; Rist, Stephan] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm CDE, Mittelstr 43, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Murti, Radhika] Int Union Conservat Nat IUCN, Rue Mauverney 28, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Murti, R (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm CDE, Mittelstr 43, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.;Murti, R (corresponding author), Int Union Conservat Nat IUCN, Rue Mauverney 28, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland.",radhika.murti@cde.unibe.ch,,,,,,,45,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1094-429X,1573-9295,,SYST PRACT ACT RES,Syst.

Migration has long been touted as a strategy for adapting to climate change, but there is limited understanding of which aspects of climate change will have greatest influence on peoples' decision to move somewhere they consider safer or stay somewhere safe. Here, we present results from two online surveys about mobility decisions from one low (Philippines) and one high (Australia) income country within the Asia-Pacific region with similar vulnerabilities to natural hazards. Online surveys with about 1100 respondents each were conducted in both countries. Results showed that natural hazards played a strong role in the mix of reasons for mobility, particularly in the Philippines. Sudden onset hazards had the greatest influence. Results of ordered probit models showed that the perception of personal damage from hazards was strongly positively associated with mobility decisions of respondents in both countries. Mobility decisions of people in Australia were further influenced by their experience with the specific hazards: those with greater experience of slow onset hazards were more likely, and those who had experience with sudden hazards less likely, to consider these when moving or staying somewhere. People in Australia might only react to sudden onset hazards with temporary relocation since experience had shown that they can adapt to them. This suggests that slow onset climate change related impacts such as heat waves and sea level rise, as well as environmental degradation and pollution, may have more sustained effects on long-term mobility than sudden events. In the Philippines, personal characteristics such as gender, income, and health had the greatest impact while experience with hazards had almost none.","[Zander, Kerstin K.] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Zander, Kerstin K.] German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany; [Garnett, Stephen] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihood, Darwin, NT, Australia",Charles Darwin University; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Charles Darwin University,"Zander, KK (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT, Australia.;Zander, KK (corresponding author), German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany.",kerstin.zander@cdu.edu.au,"Zander, Kerstin/M-2888-2013","Zander, Kerstin/0000-0002-2237-1801",,,,,73,8,8,4,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In addition, many older people leave their familiar homes and live in nursing homes. The person-centred care pursues creating spaces of high living quality for these people in nursing homes, to which plants and greenery can contribute. Greening is also considered an effective climate change adaptation measure. To create healthy conditions for this vulnerable group of elderly, both technical and social factors must be considered, and accordingly, a successful solution can only be achieved in an interdisciplinary way. The research and development of the project Green: Cool & Care dealt with this outset from a building physics, social, and nursing science perspective, and concepts to integrate greening measures in nursing homes were developed jointly by researchers, planners, staff, volunteers, and residents. For this purpose, measurement campaigns of air quality parameters, individual interviews and focus groups, as well as co-creative workshops were conducted aiming to include the objective building conditions as well as the subjective needs in developing and, in a further step, implementing greening measures.","[Halbmayer, Katharina; Hollands, Jutta; Alasu, Sara; Korjenic, Azra] Vienna Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Inst Mat Technol Bldg Phys & Bldg Ecol, Res Unit Ecol Bldg Technol, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Pichler, Barbara; Reitinger, Elisabeth] Univ Vienna, Fac Social Sci, Dept Nursing Sci, A-1080 Vienna, Austria; [Zojer, Eva] Hlth Agcy Lower Austria, Dept Res & Innovat, A-3100 St Polten, Austria; [Knoll, Bente; Renkin, Agnes] BNK GmbH Buro Nachhaltige Kompetenz, Schoenbrunner Str 59-61-10, A-1050 Vienna, Austria; [Dopheide, Ralf] Dipl Ing Ralf Dopheide eU, Schoenbrunner Str 59-61-10, A-1050 Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien; University of Vienna,"Hollands, J (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Inst Mat Technol Bldg Phys & Bldg Ecol, Res Unit Ecol Bldg Technol, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",katharina.halbmayer@tuwien.ac.at; jutta.hollands@tuwien.ac.at; sara.alasu@tuwien.ac.at; azra.korjenic@tuwien.ac.at; barbara.pichler@univie.ac.at; elisabeth.reitinger@univie.ac.at; Eva.Zojer@noe-lga.at; bente.knoll@b-nk.at; renkin@b-nk.at; ralf@dopheide.at,"Knoll, Bente/GPT-0390-2022","Korjenic, Azra/0000-0002-2904-9532; Pichler, Barbara/0000-0003-3268-3611; Alasu, Sara/0000-0001-9279-7173","Austrian Climate and Energy Fund [878155]; Office of the Lower Austrian Federal Government, Department of Hospitals and Care Centres; Health Agency of Lower Austria, Department of Research and Innovation; TU Wien","Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; Office of the Lower Austrian Federal Government, Department of Hospitals and Care Centres; Health Agency of Lower Austria, Department of Research and Innovation; TU Wien","This research was funded by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund, grant number 878155.

The objective of this study is to create a framework for assessing institutional preconditions that enable or constrain climate change adaptation measures in agriculture and to apply the framework to a case study in agriculture. We adopted and modified the Procedure for Institutional Compatibility Assessment (PICA). Institutions in our framework are characterized by a set of crucial institutional preconditions (CIPs) and indicators linked to each CIP. CIPs refer to both institutional incentives and constraints for implementation of adaptation measures (here to climate change). We applied a combination of ranking and scoring techniques based on information from workshops, interviews and a literature review to assess institutional incentives and constraints for adaptation measures, together indicating the institutional feasibility of implementation of adaptation measures. We selected and assessed three adaptation measures relevant to agriculture in Flevoland, a province in the Netherlands: (1) improvement of water management and irrigation facilities; (2) relocation of farms; and (3) development of new crop varieties. The two main constraining CIPs for the implementation of the measures were found to be (1) heterogeneity of actors' interests and (2) availability of resources. Based on the institutional feasibility analysis, the implementation of water management and improvement of irrigation facilities will potentially face fewer institutional constraints compared to the other two measures. We conclude that our approach proves applicable for institutional analyses of adaptation measures for current and future (climate) challenges at different levels of implementation, but that more applications are needed to test its validity and robustness.

Appropriate and sufficient community adaptation responses are required to maintain habitats and sustain livelihoods. Adaptation responses are mediated through often competing subjective discourses. We used Q-method to reveal discourses within a subsistence community in Vanuatu and amongst associated stakeholders. We revealed three discourses, which we called Strong Kastom, Kastom + Health and Tentative Modernity. When we compared stakeholder socio-demographic attributes we found a statistically significant gender difference between membership of Strong Kastom, which was skewed towards men and Tentative Modernity, which was skewed towards women. We also found that external practitioners were weighted away from Tentative Modernity. Our results suggest ecosystem based adaptations to climate change will likely resonate with the community if they support customary natural resource knowledge and management, and provide opportunities for generating income, and promoting gender equity in decision-making. Our results also suggest external practitioners may not consider income generation to be sufficiently important to community resilience.","[Buckwell, Andrew; Fleming, Christopher] Griffith Business Sch, N72,Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Muurmans, Maggie; Ware, Dan] Griffith Univ, SmartWater Ctr, Ctr Coastal Management, Gold Coast Campus,Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Smart, James C.

In collectively managed common pool resource systems, there is often a tension between behavior that benefits the individual and actions that benefit a larger group. Resource users in sustainable systems must therefore work together to ensure outcomes that are beneficial to the group as a whole. However, in the face of changing social, political, and environmental conditions, community norms may change, leading to the emerging of new behavioral patterns. Understanding when and why people decide to act in ways that benefit the group as a whole can help policy makers better target policies or change incentives to promote desired outcomes. This research seeks to build on research in common pool resource management and multilevel selection to understand how and why collective pressures shape individual adaptation behavior. Using qualitative data from in-depth interviews of farmers in Sri Lanka, this study confirms that collective management practices in Sri Lankan irrigation systems significantly influence farmer's potential adaption behaviors. Based on farmer's explanations of their own behavior, we hypothesize that farmer's belief in the ecological necessity of cooperation and explicit government support for collective action are important drivers of collective action.

From this perspective the politics of climate adaptation cannot be understood without considering their intersection, in particular contexts, with politics of development and transformation. These three types of politics differ in the pattern of socio-ecological change that each one promotes. We discuss the operations of power associated with each pattern of change, including the forms of authority and subjectivities that each one entails. Developmental authority achieves consent (or consensus) on a trajectory of improvement, and promotes subjectivities based on individuals' positions and their progress along that trajectory. Adaptation authority sets clearcut boundaries between the adapting systems and their changing environments, and promotes subjectivities of belonging (or not) to the system's identity. Transformational authority seeks to transgress established authority, be it developmental or adaptive, and promotes emancipatory subjectivities. We analyze life-story narratives of local tourism entrepreneurs and workers in Akumal, a coastal enclave in Mexico doubly exposed to hurricanes and tourism globalization. This analysis shows how the operations of power in this enclave are variously linked to discourses and practices of development, adaptation, and transformation. The case of Akumal illustrates the complex interplay between risk and inequality in coastal communities exposed to growing climatic variability. Our analysis of deliberate transformations takes adaptation to climate change, and its transformative and emancipatory potential, into development. Understanding how authority and subjectivities evolve in particular locales, and the types of politics of change that they entail, is key for simultaneously reducing inequalities and risk.

Climate change phenomenon compel urban planners to devise comprehensive measures to adapt for more frequent and intense hazards. The paper argues for mainstreaming disaster resilience attributes in local development plans as an overarching adaptive measure. The aim of this paper is to assess the extent to which the local development planning system in Malaysia has responded to the vulnerability reduction and resilience improvement needs of the civil society in order to adapt to climate change induced flooding. It is based on a social survey involving a purposive sample of 250 households to identify the adaptation needs of the civil society, and an analysis of the contents of Shah Alam Local Development Plan to verify the response of the planners to those needs. The findings indicate that the planners have been fairly sensitive to the flood risks faced by people and incorporated policies and strategies in the local development plan to minimize exposure of the people and property to flood hazard and improve the adaptive capacity of the urban settlements. However, the sector based organization of the plan prepared by the federal level planners was found to be not adequately incorporating the indigenous knowledge of coping strategies. Therefore, the paper calls for strengthening the participatory planning and development capacity of the local authorities for more resolute mainstreaming of disaster resilience in local development plans.

Changes in land management are one way to adapt to future climatic conditions, including land-use changes and local adjustments of agricultural practices. In previous studies, options for adaptation have mostly been explored by testing alternative scenarios. Systematic explorations of land management possibilities using optimization approaches were so far mainly restricted to studies of land and resource management under constant climatic conditions. In this study, we bridge this gap and exploit the benefits of multi-objective regional optimization for identifying optimum land management adaptations to climate change. We design a multi-objective optimization routine that integrates a generic crop model and considers two climate scenarios for 2050 in a meso-scale catchment on the Swiss Central Plateau with already limited water resources. The results indicate that adaptation will be necessary in the study area to cope with a decrease in productivity by 0-10 %, an increase in soil loss by 25-35 %, and an increase in N-leaching by 30-45 %. Adaptation options identified here exhibit conflicts between productivity and environmental goals, but compromises are possible. Necessary management changes include (i) adjustments of crop shares, i.e. increasing the proportion of early harvested winter cereals at the expense of irrigated spring crops, (ii) widespread use of reduced tillage, (iii) allocation of irrigated areas to soils with low water-retention capacity at lower elevations, and (iv) conversion of some pre-alpine grasslands to croplands.","[Klein, Tommy; Holzkaemper, Annelie; Calanca, Pierluigi; Fuhrer, Juerg] Air Pollut & Climate Grp, Agroscope Res Stn Reckenholz Tanikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Klein, Tommy; Holzkaemper, Annelie; Calanca, Pierluigi; Fuhrer, Juerg] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Klein, Tommy] Climate Corp, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA; [Seppelt, Ralf] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Bern; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Klein, T (corresponding author), Air Pollut & Climate Grp, Agroscope Res Stn Reckenholz Tanikon ART, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",tommy.klein@alumni.ulg.ac.be,"Seppelt, Ralf/E-6056-2010","Seppelt, Ralf/0000-0002-2723-7150; Calanca, Pierluigi/0000-0003-3113-2885",Swiss National Foundation [406140_125957/1],Swiss National Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This work is part of the AGWAM project (No. 406140_125957/1) financed by the Swiss National Foundation in the framework of the National Research Program 61.,,91,50,53,4,83,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

Adaptation to climate change is receiving increasing attention, given, now, the inevitability of further climate change and its diverse impacts. However, with increased international funding for adaptation comes challenges such as ensuring supportive national policy environments for developing and implementing effective adaptation activities. Adaptation at community and population levels is underpinned by governance processes, such as the nature by which decisions are taken and implemented by government, community and private organizations. Thus an understanding of the policy context is necessary to identify the factors that enable or inhibit adaptation policy and programmes. This article examines to what degree there exist enabling factors to support the development of adaptation policy and activities, with relevance to the health sector. Results of a policy analysis are presented, which used stakeholder participation to investigate the context in which adaptation decisions were made within organizations across different sectors in Cambodia. Five factors were identified as critical components of the governance environment: (1) policy development processes; (2) the existence of a political recognition of climate change and (3-5) the organizational barriers relating to coordination, funding and lack of information. Without achieving a supportive policy environment, future adaptation actions are likely to have limited effect.","[Bowen, Kathryn J.; McMichael, Anthony J.; Friel, Sharon] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Bowen, Kathryn J.; Miller, Fiona] Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia; [Miller, Fiona] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Dany, Va] Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Dept Environm Sci, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Dany, Va] Bond Univ, Gold Coast, Qld 4227, Australia",Australian National University; University of Melbourne; Macquarie University; Bond University,"Bowen, KJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",kathryn.bowen@anu.edu.au,,"Bowen, Kathryn/0000-0002-2125-1963; Friel, Sharon/0000-0002-8345-5435; Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4427-6466",,,,,34,12,12,1,45,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

However, the main reason for the increasing uptake of this type of solution is their many benefits for the local inhabitants, including recreational value. Previous studies on recreational value focus on studies of existing nature sites that are often much larger than what is considered as new NBS for flood adaptation studies in urban areas. We thus prioritized studies with smaller areas and nature types suitable for urban flood adap-tation and divided them into four common nature types for urban flood adaptation: sustainable urban drainage systems, city parks, nature areas and rivers. We identified 23 primary valuation studies, including both stated and revealed preference studies, and derived two value transfer functions based on meta-regression analysis on existing areas. We investigated trends between values and variables and found that for the purpose of planning of new NBS the size of NBS and population density were determining factors of recreational value. For existing NBS the maximum travelling distance may be included as well. We find that existing state-of-the-art studies over-estimate the recreational with more than a factor of 4 for NBS sizes below 5 ha.

The paper also explores the practical impact and manifestation of these drivers in current FCRM planning and delivery frameworks, and suggests several critical pathways for a deeper embedding of the approach.","[Nye, M.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Tapsell, S.] Middlesex Univ, Flood Hazard Res Ctr, London N17 8HR, England; [Twigger-Ross, C.] The Chandlery, Collingwood Environm Planning, London, England",University of East Anglia; Middlesex University,"Nye, M (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",m.nye@uea.ac.uk,"McLean, Laurence JA/C-7367-2014; Twigger-Ross, Clare/AFT-1062-2022",,Environment Agency; DEFRA,"Environment Agency; DEFRA(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA))","The authors would like to thank the researchers and colleagues on the Improving Institutional and Social Responses to Flooding project (SC060019): Lindsey Colbourne (Lindsey Colbourne Associates), Nigel Watson, Gordon Walker, Elham Kashefi, Hugh Deeming (Lancaster University), Amalia Fernandez-Bilbao (ScottWilson) and Paula Orr (CEP) where many of the ideas expressed in this paper were discussed and developed.

The total value of crop for all selected crops is US$4,549.20 M, while the economic value of insect pollination is US$1,235.06 M, accounting for 8.52% of the total value of the agricultural GDP, and the ratio of vulnerability is 27.15%.

We examine this question in the United States, where major increases in productivity have fueled most of agricultural production growth over the past half-century. To quantify the evolving climate sensitivity of the sector and identify its sources, we combine state-level measures of agricultural productivity with detailed climate data for 1960-2004. We find that agriculture is growing more sensitive to climate in Midwestern states for two distinct but compounding reasons: a rising climatic sensitivity of nonirrigated cereal and oilseed crops and a growing specialization in crop production. In contrast, other regions specialize in less climate-sensitive production such as irrigated specialty crops or livestock. Results suggest that reducing vulnerability to climate change should consider the role of policies in inducing regional specialization.","[Ortiz-Bobea, Ariel] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Knippenberg, Erwin] Cooper Smith, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Chambers, Robert G.] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Cornell University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Ortiz-Bobea, A (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ao332@cornell.edu,"Ortiz-Bobea, Ariel/V-5938-2019","Ortiz-Bobea, Ariel/0000-0003-4482-6843","NSF [1360424]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch/Multi State project [1011555]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [1009569]; NIFA [913364, 1009569] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch/Multi State project; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","A.O.-B. was supported by NSF grant 1360424 and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch/Multi State project 1011555.

The river is only navigable during the summer and early fall, when clear of ice. However, the river's water conditions have changed significantly in recent years, and are expected to continue to do so, resulting in increased uncertainty for waterway transport. This paper presents a model for providing guidance to shipping companies, customers, and government on how shipping patterns may need to evolve to effectively adapt to changing climate conditions. Future freight volumes are forecasted using time series analysis. Then, logistics cost optimization is used to incorporate predicted water flow profile changes in shipping companies' future delivery schedule planning. Results indicate that future waterway freight delivery capacities in September and October may be insufficient to transport forecasted volumes, and shipping companies may be advised to arrange for increased delivery activities in June and July. If delivery capacities are constrained by equipment and crew availability rather than water conditions in the first half of the shipping season, shipping companies may also need to take advantage of earlier anticipated ice breakup to begin the delivery season earlier. Incorporating this method for climate change adaptation in freight schedule planning may aid both shipping companies and government agencies in rethinking current practices. The method is particularly suitable for a region where harsh environmental conditions, climate change, and extreme remoteness have an overwhelming impact on operations, and logistical delays are considered quite differently from supply chains further south.

This paper explores the theoretical debates of community-based adaptation approach and failure of such approach to address urban extreme poor. The empirical evidence of these theoretical debates will be drawn from two informal settlements of Dhaka city, where a targeted asset transfer project has been implementing since 2009. This paper explains that urban extreme poor usually work as unskilled labour and lack different livelihood capitals; and climate change is an increasingly important influence exacerbating an already vulnerable livelihood context. There is growing recognition in the literature that poor urban people and communities are adapting to climate change in physical and behavioural terms. But, in the case of urban extreme poor these adaptation approaches are delivering short-term survival strategies disregarding the notion of wellbeing in the medium to long-term perspectives. It is also evident that community level initiatives structurally reproduce the exclusion of the urban extreme poor. However, poverty literatures acknowledge that poverty-centred approaches could help to reduce vulnerability. As urban extreme poor are significantly more resource constrained, it is reasonable to assert that targeted asset transfers could be a poverty-centred adaptation approach in a changing climate. Targeted asset transfers approaches are the outcomes of recent social protection revolution that especially consider accumulation of physical, financial, human, and social capital in order to build adaptive capacity of the urban extreme poor. This adaptive capacity of the extreme poor may facilitate adjustments in assets, livelihoods, behaviours, and technologies in order to reduce future climate vulnerability. In this context, this paper seeks to answer whether targeted asset transfer approaches can be considered as effective poverty-centred adaptation approaches for the urban extreme poor or not.","[Hossain, Md.

Climate change adaptation is complex due to climate-stressor interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales. This leaves decision makers worldwide faced with local, regional, and global-scale threats to ecosystem processes and services, occurring over time frames that require both near-term and long-term planning. Thus there is a need for structured approaches to adaptation planning that integrate existing methods for vulnerability assessment with design and evaluation of effective adaptation responses. The Corals and Climate Adaptation Planning project of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force seeks to develop guidance for improving coral reef management through tailored application of a climate-smart approach. This approach is based on principles from a recently-published guide which provides a framework for adopting forward-looking goals, based on assessing vulnerabilities to climate change and applying a structured process to design effective adaptation strategies. Work presented in this paper includes: (1) examination of the climate-smart management cycle as it relates to coral reefs; (2) a compilation of adaptation strategies for coral reefs drawn from a comprehensive review of the literature; (3) in-depth demonstration of climate-smart design for place-based crafting of robust adaptation actions; and (4) feedback from stakeholders on the perceived usefulness of the approach. We conclude with a discussion of lessons-learned on integrating climate-smart design into real-world management planning processes and a call from stakeholders for an adaptation design tool that is now under development.","[West, Jordan M.; Julius, Susan H.] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, 1200 Penn Ave NW,8601P, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Courtney, Catherine A.] Tetra Tech Inc, 737 Bishop St,Suite 2340, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; [Hamilton, Anna T.] Tetra Tech Inc, Ctr Ecol Sci, 502 W Cordova Rd,Suite C, Santa Fe, NM 87505 USA; [Parker, Britt A.] Baldwin Grp Inc, NOAA Coral Reef Conservat Program, SSMC4,N-OCM6,Rm 10329,1305 East West Hwy, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Hoffman, Jennie] 4755 Northeast Lambs Lane, Poulsbo, WA 98370 USA; [Koltes, Karen H.] US Dept Interior, Off Insular Affairs, MS 2429,1849 C St NW, Washington, DC 20240 USA; [MacGowan, Petra] Nature Conservancy, 74 Wall St, Seattle, WA 98121 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of the Interior; Nature Conservancy,"West, JM (corresponding author), US EPA, Off Res & Dev, 1200 Penn Ave NW,8601P, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",west.jordan@epa.gov,"Parker, Britt/E-7925-2011","Parker, Britt/0000-0003-2429-5854",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EP-C-12-060],U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"This research was funded by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Contract EP-C-12-060, with travel and workshop contributions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coral Reef Conservation Program and the Department of the Interior's Office of Insular Affairs.

Capacity development is a common disaster risk reduction (DRR) action and a climate change adaptation. There is a knowledge gap on what is involved in and what works in practice of bottom-up approaches to develop DRR capacity that incorporates local ownership, local knowledge and learning. The participatory research described in this paper applied Wenger's conceptual framework for social learning systems to establish a community of practice (CoP) for DRR between 2016 and 2017 in Maruleng Local Municipality, South Africa. Planning documents, event and reflection notes, office reports and artefacts were initially coded based on key concepts of the framework and further coded based on emerging sub-themes. The results showed that the framework provided a useful structure for designing capacity development that emphasises learning and organically integrates local knowledge. Structuring capacity development as a social learning system has the potential to make the CoP's learning effort self-sustaining and shift the focus of capacity development from a specific task to a long-term common interest shared by CoP members. The framework, however, did not provide adequate consideration for institutional challenges such as high leadership turnover and limited political power of the CoP, which impacted alignment, mutuality and membership - all of which are important to sustaining the CoP for capacity development.","[Kong, Taryn M.; de Villiers, Ancois Carien; Pollard, Sharon] Assoc Water & Rural Dev, POB 1919, ZA-1380 Hoedspruit, South Africa; [Ntloana, Maowane Bernard] Maruleng Local Municipal, 64 Springbok St, ZA-1380 Hoedspruit, Limpopo, South Africa; [Vogel, Coleen] Univ Witwatersrand, Global Change Inst, 1 Jan Smuts Ave, ZA-2000 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Kong, TM (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",tarynmkong@gmail.com,"De Villiers, Ancois/ABF-8765-2021","De Villiers, Ancois/0000-0001-5905-8651",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [AID-674-A-1300008]; Maruleng Local Municipality; Mopani Disaster Management Centre; Kruger to Canyons Biosphere Region (K2C),United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIAR); Maruleng Local Municipality; Mopani Disaster Management Centre; Kruger to Canyons Biosphere Region (K2C),"This participatory research was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as a project activity under the Resilience in the Limpopo Basin Program Olifants River Catchment (RESILIM-O) program under the Cooperative Agreement, AID-674-A-1300008.

It is now being increasingly used in the fields of disaster and climate change. There is a need to identify similarities and differences in both research domains to identify characteristics and linkages for potential integration. Using the Web of Science database, this study has conducted bibliometric analyses based on three categories, i.e. disaster resilience, climate change resilience and disaster and climate change resilience. Historical development, keyword, citation and co-citation, institutions, and country-wise analyses were performed. The study identified 4264 and 8164 research articles on disaster resilience and climate change resilience, respectively. Moreover, a total of 927 publications have used both disaster and climate change resilience, which is termed as integrated resilience. The study has revealed an emerging and rapidly growing trend in both climate change and disaster resilience. Comparatively, the number of publications on climate change resilience outweighed disaster resilience. The studies were published by various disciplines, but the majority were in environmental sciences and studies categories. Interestingly, disaster resilience has been studied by more disciplines than climate change resilience. Vulnerability and adaptation were key concepts linking integrated research on resilience. It is recommended to develop a shared understanding of resilience thinking under disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation philosophy. It is argued that resilience can be used as a bridging concept between the fields to truly recognize its potential. The results of this study can help and guide future research on integrating climate change and disaster resilience.","[Rana, Irfan Ahmad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn SCEE, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Islamabad, Pakistan",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Rana, IA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn SCEE, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Islamabad, Pakistan.",irfanrana90@hotmail.com,"Rana, Irfan Ahmad/C-2560-2017","Rana, Irfan Ahmad/0000-0002-3157-1186",,,,,86,33,34,40,121,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

A special feature of the model is the inclusion of realized volatility for natural resource assets that are available at multiple frequencies as well as being sensitive to sudden changes in climatic conditions. Natural resource portfolios under climate change are simulated from bootstrapping schemes as well as being derived from global climate model projections. Both approaches are applied to a multiasset water portfolio model consisting of reservoir inflows, rainwater harvesting, and desalinated water. The empirical results show that while reservoirs remain the dominant water asset, adaptation to climate change involves increased contributions from rainwater harvesting and more frequent use of desalinated water. It is estimated that climate change increases annual water supply costs by between 7% and 44% over a 20-year forecast horizon.","[Leroux, Anke D.] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Martin, Vance L.; St John, Kathryn A.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Monash University; University of Melbourne,"Leroux, AD (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",anke.leroux@monash.edu; vance@unimelb.edu.au; stjohnka@gmail.com,,"Leroux, Anke/0000-0002-5572-8459",,,,,38,1,1,8,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

This raises the question: Do our institutions allow and encourage society to continuously adapt to climate change? This paper uses the Adaptive Capacity Wheel (ACW) to assess the adaptive capacity of formal and informal institutions in four sectors in the Netherlands: spatial planning, water, agriculture and nature. Formal institutions are examined through an assessment of 11 key policy documents and informal institutions are analysed through four case studies covering each sector. Based on these ACW analyses, both sector-specific and more general strengths and weaknesses of the adaptive capacity of institutions in the Netherlands are identified. The paper concludes that the most important challenge for increasing institutional adaptive capacity lies in combining decentralized, participatory approaches with more top-down methods that generate leadership (visions, goals) standards, instruments, resources and monitoring.","[Gupta, J.; Bergsma, E.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Termeer, C.

It considers infectious disease risks for different climate-related migration pathways, including: forced displacement, slow-onset migration particularly to urban-poor areas, planned resettlement, and labor migration associated with climate change adaptation initiatives.

At the same time, urbanization has been high on the agenda, given the pressing need for substantial additional housing, particularly in southeast England. These twin policy objectives were brought together in the UK government's 'eco-town' initiative for England launched in 2007, which has since resulted in four eco-town projects currently under development. We critically analyze the eco-town initiative's policy evolution and early planning phase from a multilevel governance perspective by focusing on the following two interrelated aspects: (1) the evolving governance structures and resulting dynamics arising from the development of the eco-town initiative at UK governmental level, and the subsequent partial devolution to local stakeholders, including local authorities and nongovernmental actors, under the new 'localism' agenda; and (2) the effect of these governance dynamics on the conceptual and practical approach to adaptation through the emerging eco-town projects. As such, we problematize the impact of multilevel governance relations, and competing governance strategies and leadership, on shaping eco-town and related adaptation strategies and practice.","[Tomozeiu, Daniel; Joss, Simon] Univ Westminster, London W1R 8AL, England",University of Westminster,"Tomozeiu, D (corresponding author), Univ Westminster, London W1R 8AL, England.",,,"Joss, Simon/0000-0003-2856-4695",,,,,43,15,15,1,24,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

In this context, many of cities struggle to develop evidence-based approaches to assess their current and future capacity to deal with climate impacts and inform the design of policies to respond in the short/long term. Based both on extensive field research carried out in Brazilian cities and on urban adaptation literature, we develop and test the Urban Adaptation Index (UAI) that cities can use to assess their current adaptive capacity in a realistic/achievable way. The index includes 26 indicators and focuses on a set of public policies to support interventions connected to adaptation: housing, urban mobility, sustainable agriculture, environmental management, and climate impact response. To make the UAI more usable/accessible, we use empirical data that is publicly available, and develop an approach that can be implemented with resources already available in many Brazilian cities. We illustrate the UAI usability by applying the index to the 645 municipalities of the state of Sao Paulo. Results show that more than half of the municipalities present low UAI ratings; however, municipalities located in metropolitan regions, where the majority of the population live, tend to have higher ratings. Practitioners agreed on the value of the UAI as a tool to monitor the current situation and changes regarding local potential capacity to adapt to climate change.","[Neder, Eduardo Alves; Moreira, Fabiano de Araujo; Dalla Fontana, Michele; Costa Vasconcellos, Maria da Penha; Barbieri Bedran-Martins, Ana Maria; Philippi Jr, Arlindo; Di Giulio, Gabriela Marques] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Publ Hlth, Av Dr Arnaldo 715, BR-01246904 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Torres, Roger Rodrigues] Univ Fed Itajuba, Nat Resources Inst, BR-37500903 Itajuba, MG, Brazil; [Lapola, David Montenegro] Univ Estadual Campinas, Ctr Meteorol & Climat Res Appl Agr, BR-13083886 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Lemos, Maria Carmen] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal de Itajuba; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Di Giulio, GM (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Publ Hlth, Av Dr Arnaldo 715, BR-01246904 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",eaneder@gmail.com; fabiano.moreira@usp.br; mdallafontana@usp.br; roger.torres@unifei.edu.br; dmlapola@unicamp.br; mpvascon@usp.br; bedran.ana@gmail.com; aphij@usp.br; lemos@umich.cdu; ggiulio@usp.br,"Torres, Roger Rodrigues/G-1043-2012; de Araujo Moreira, Fabiano/D-4402-2019","Torres, Roger Rodrigues/0000-0002-5684-3125; Dalla Fontana, Michele/0000-0002-0700-1554; Lapola, David/0000-0002-2654-7835; Philippi Jr, Arlindo/0000-0003-0420-7749; Marques Di Giulio, Gabriela/0000-0003-1396-9788; Vasconcellos, Maria da Penha/0000-0003-2666-9485; Lemos, Maria Carmen/0000-0001-6686-730X; de Araujo Moreira, Fabiano/0000-0002-7148-3842","FAPESP [2018/21362-1, 2018/21249-0, Fapesp 2017/50423-6]; Brazil's National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq [446032/2015-8]",FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Brazil's National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This study is part of the CiAdapta project funded by Brazil's National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq (Proc. 446032/2015-8).

The dedicated approach, based on direct political commitment to climate adaptation, implies political agenda setting, resource allocation, and clear policy objectives which are expected to facilitate rapid implementation due to political pressure and new structures. The mainstreaming approach is based on indirect political commitment: climate adaptation 'piggybacks' on the established commitment of policy domains in which it is integrated, and institutional entrepreneurs and framing are considered necessary to establish policy synergies and to mobilise actors and resources. An implication is that implementation may be erratic, as entrepreneurs have to pioneer within existing structures. The cases of two Dutch cities - Amsterdam and Rotterdam - help to illustrate and refine our propositions on the nature and implications of political commitment.","[Uittenbroek, Caroline J.; Spit, Tejo J.

Previous analyses of climate change impacts in Copenhagen, Denmark, were supplemented by 2 high-end scenario simulations. These include a regional climate model projection forced to a global temperature increase of 6 degrees C in 2100 as well as a projection based on a high radiative forcing scenario (RCP8.5). With these scenarios, projected impacts of extreme precipitation increase significantly. For extreme sea surges, the impacts do not seem to change substantially compared to currently applied projections. The flood risk (in terms of expected annual damage, EAD) from sea surge is likely to increase by more than 2 orders of magnitude in 2100 compared to the present cost. The risk from pluvial flooding in 2000 is likely to increase by almost 4 and 8 times the current EAD for the RCP8.5 and 6 degrees C scenario, respectively. For both hazards, business-as-usual is not a possible scenario, since even in the absence of policy-driven changes, significant autonomous adaptation is likely to occur. Copenhagen has developed an adaptation plan to pluvial flooding that makes the urban areas more robust and reduces the risk of flooding under the current climate to a very low level. The reduction in flood risk for the A1B scenario is substantial (corresponding to 0.2-0.3 times the current EAD in 2100), and even in the high-end scenarios, the risk is significantly reduced (corresponding to 0.6-1.0 and 1.2-2.1 times the current EAD for the RCP8.5 and 6 degrees C scenario, respectively).","[Arnbjerg-Nielsen, K.] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Leonardsen, L.] Copenhagen Municipal, DK-1505 Copenhagen V, Denmark; [Madsen, H.] DHI, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI),"Arnbjerg-Nielsen, K (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Bldg 113, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",karn@env.dtu.dk,"Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/J-7792-2012","Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/0000-0002-6221-9505","Danish Council for Strategic Research [09-066868, 0603-00390B]",Danish Council for Strategic Research(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)),"This work was carried out with the support of the Danish Council for Strategic Research as part of the projects 'Centre for Regional Change in the Earth System', contract no. 09-066868 and 'Risk Based Design in a Changing Climate (RiskChange)', contract no. 0603-00390B.",,39,31,31,0,33,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

We evaluate IWRM in 125 cities with 48 mostly quantitative indicators collected for each city by performing a cluster analysis of 6000 indicator scores following the City Blueprint Approach. We distinguish five clusters of cities which show a pattern of problem -shifting, i.e., the shifting of largely preventable water resources problems often in the following sequence: drinking water insecurity, pollution caused by inadequate wastewater treatment, inadequate solid waste man-agement, inaction on climate change adaptation, and resource depletion. A city that can address and solve all these problems can be classified as water-wise. Based on the cluster analysis, seven principles are defined to enable urban areas to become water-wise. Because water takes a central position in the United Nations sus-tainable development goals (SDGs), and is linked, directly or indirectly, to nearly all SDGs, success in IWRM is an important enabler for the other SDGs.","[Koop, Stef H.

One main cause for the decline has been attributed to climate change. The simulation and evaluation of the potentially negative effects of climate change and formation of adaption measures are essential to saving the lake. An integrated modeling framework is required to allow linkage and integration of climate models with basin and field scale models. The present study applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) framework (1994) for definition and assessment of climate change adaptation strategies. Siminehrud catchment is a major sub-basin of LU basin and was selected to explore the methodology. The results of simulations show that the catchment inflow into the lake could decrease up to 30% and agriculture production up to 50%. A number of adaptation strategies were examined and it was found that revision of cropping patterns is the best measure to mitigate the negative effect of climate change; however, none of the strategies proposed thus far will maintain the long-term average inflow into the lake at the current fig. of 570 MCM. The results demonstrated the ability of SWAT to link with the OECD framework and perform the required simulations and estimations of relevant indicators. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines the factors influencing climate change adaptation strategies and the impacts on household income and food security in rural Niger. For this purpose, we collected data from 1783 valid rural households in four main agricultural regions of Niger. The results showed that crop diversification (72.74%), income diversification (67.97%) and changing planting times (55%) are the main adaptation strategies adopted by households. The majority of respondents had noticed changes in rain patterns (93.21%), in the amount of rain (91.25%) and in the intensity of rain (81.82%) during the last five years. We categorized these adaptation strategies into six major groups namely climate-resilient crop varieties, improved agronomic practices, irrigation and water conservation practices, crop diversification, income diversification, and agroforestry. We ran logit regression to identify the determinants of each individual group. The results show mixed effects of independent variables on these categories of adaptation strategies. Using matching techniques, we found adaptation strategies have positive and significant impact on both household income and food security. The farmers who adopt climate change adaptation strategies are more likely to increase household income by 7721.526 FCFA compared to those households with zero adaptation strategies. Similarly, the adapters have 7% to 9% more chance to be food secure compared to those who did not adopt strategies. These results suggest that strengthening the awareness of the effects of climate change on farmers and the choice of appropriate adaptation strategies are necessary to enhance household resilience. Strengthening institutional factors such as access to credit and market, extension services, and using drought-resilient crop varieties would surely improve agricultural production.","[Zakari, Seydou; Abdoulaye, Tahirou] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, Bamako, Mali; [Ibro, Germaine] Inst Natl Rech Agron Niger INRAN, BP 429, Niamey, Niger; [Moussa, Bokar] Inst Natl Rech Agron Niger INRAN, BP 612, Zinder, Niger",,"Zakari, S (corresponding author), Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, Bamako, Mali.",geribro@yahoo.fr; S.Zakari@cgiar.org; S.Zakari@cgiar.org; S.Zakari@cgiar.org,,"zakari, seydou/0000-0001-5546-0280","Royal Norwegian Embassy in Mali [MLI-17-0008, NER-17-0005]",Royal Norwegian Embassy in Mali,This work provides baseline information for two projects funded by the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Mali for `Climate-smart Agricultural Technologies for Improved Rural Livelihoods and Food Security' in Mali (Grant MLI-17-0008) and Niger (Grant NER-17-0005).,,62,3,3,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2022,14,5,,,,,,,2847,10.3390/su14052847,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14052847,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW4SC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000771203800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper applies a power-mapping technique, Multilevel Stakeholder Influence Mapping (MSIM), to stakeholders in Ghana's agricultural adaptation policy regime. The method provides a quantitative influence score and visual map for actor groups active-in or affected-by the policy process, from the differentiated perspectives of national, regional, and local-level respondents. MSIM, as applied here, seeks to determine the underlying power structure of the adaptation regime and provides insight in to two key power-laden themes: stakeholder participation and multilevel institutional design. Results indicate that when taken collectively (the views of national, regional and local respondents combined) Ghana's adaptation regime is considered bipolar and elite-centred in its power distribution. A distinguishable adaptation establishment' or dominant group of power holders made up of technical government and international agencies can be identified. Meanwhile, political groups, the private sector, civil society, and universities are considered to wield substantially less power in the regime. Differentiated perspectives (i.e. national, regional or local respondents alone) reveal that several potential cross-level bridging institutions are not considered influential at all operational levels. Farmers, traditional authorities, and the District Assembly, for example, are all considered highly influential from the perspective of local-level respondents, but their counterpart agencies at the national level are not considered influential by policymakers there. Contrary to the hyper-politicized nature of climate change adaptation at international levels, Ghana's policy regime would benefit from increased participation from political agents, as well as from traditional authorities and farmers. These actor groups can help reverse the a-political nature of the adaptation regime, improve power pluralism across actor groups and levels, and facilitate cross-level cooperation between formal and informal institutions crucial to adaptation success.","[Sova, Chase A.; Zougmore, Robert; Helfgott, Ariella; Chaudhury, Abrar S.] Agr & Food Secur CCAFS, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Sova, Chase A.] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Cali, Colombia; [Sova, Chase A.; Thornton, Thomas F.; Helfgott, Ariella; Chaudhury, Abrar S.] Univ Oxford, ECI, Oxford, England; [Zougmore, Robert] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Bamako, Mali; [Helfgott, Ariella] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia",CGIAR; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University of Oxford; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); University of Adelaide,"Sova, CA (corresponding author), Agr & Food Secur CCAFS, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change, Copenhagen, Denmark.;Sova, CA (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr, Cali, Colombia.;Sova, CA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, ECI, Oxford, England.",chase.sova@gtc.ox.ac.uk,"Thornton, Tom/AAJ-5105-2020","Chaudhury, Abrar/0000-0002-3094-7639; Zougmore, Robert/0000-0002-6215-4852",Environmental Change Institute (University of Oxford); Environment Institute (University of Adelaide),Environmental Change Institute (University of Oxford); Environment Institute (University of Adelaide)(CGIAR),"This research was conducted under the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is a strategic partnership of CGIAR and Future Earth.

It blooms earlier than other deciduous fruit trees, but different regions have different blooming periods. The time of anthesis is related to the dormancy period, and a certain amount of chilling promotes bud break and blooming. To identify the relationship between blooming time and the climatic adaptation of P. mume cultivars in China, the nuclear and chloroplast genomes of 19 cultivars from the main cultivation areas of P. mume in China were resequenced. The average depth of coverage was 34X-76X, and a total of 388,134 single nucleotide polymorphisms were located within the coding regions of the gene (CDs). Additionally, the 19 cultivar accessions were divided into three groups based on their blooming time: early, mid, and late. Associated with the blooming time groups, 21 selective sweep regions were identified, which could provide evidence supporting the possible model of P. mume domestication originating due to natural selection. Furthermore, we identified a flowering gene, FRIGIDA-LIKE 3 (FRL3), seems to affect the blooming time and the climatic adaptation of P. mume cultivars. This study is a major step toward understanding the climatic adaptation of P. mume cultivars in China.","[Shi, Ting; Luo, Wenjie; Li, Hantao; Huang, Xiao; Ni, Zhaojun; Iqbal, Shahid; Gao, Zhihong] Nanjing Agr Univ, 1 Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shi, Ting] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Life Sci & Oceanog, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Plant Epigenet, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gao, Haidong] Genepioneer Biotechnol Co Ltd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University; Shenzhen University,"Gao, ZH (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, 1 Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",gaozhihong@njau.edu.cn,"Iqbal, Shahid/O-2764-2019","Iqbal, Shahid/0000-0003-4321-8598; Huang, Xiao/0000-0002-9247-7732","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31772282, 31971703]; Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System [CARS-19]; National Key Research and development Program of China [2018YFD1000107]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M640497]; Project for Crop Germplasm conservation, the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions [PAPD]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System; National Key Research and development Program of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Project for Crop Germplasm conservation, the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31772282 and 31971703; Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System, Grant/Award Number: CARS-19; National Key Research and development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2018YFD1000107; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 2018M640497; Project for Crop Germplasm conservation, the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, Grant/Award Number: PAPD",,81,15,15,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The potential impact on the agriculture sector is of particular concern, given its vital role in the economy and for vulnerable households. This study proposes a new approach for adaptation strategies by exploring policy reform in agriculture as a transformative way to help economic agents adapt to climate change. We specifically explore the current rice reform policy currently pursued by the government through the abolishment of rice quota program. We found this reform could help transform the agricultural and economic system by allowing scarce resources move from low to high productivity sector thus increase country's adaptive capacity. However, the process entails a welfare loss to certain agents, but adding government intervention could act as the second-best policy and become a transition pathway before the whole system transform to reach the optimal efficiency point when the intervention program is eventually phased out.","[Pradesha, Angga; Robinson, Sherman; Rosegrant, Mark W.; Perez, Nicostrato; Thomas, Timothy S.] Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Pradesha, A (corresponding author), Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",A.pradesha@cgiar.org; s.robinson@cgiar.org; m.rosegrant@cgiar.org,,"Pradesha, Angga/0000-0002-7969-7335","CGIAR Research Programs on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Trust Fund","CGIAR Research Programs on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)(CGIAR); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR)","Funding was received from the CGIAR Research Programs on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM) and the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Trust Fund and through bilateral funding agreements.",,48,0,0,2,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1876-4517,1876-4525,,FOOD SECUR,Food Secur.,DEC,2022,14,6,,,,,1435,1447,,10.1007/s12571-022-01299-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-022-01299-4,,JUN 2022,13,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology,6M3BV,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000814044700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The income per capita positively and significantly influences carbon emissions in sub-Saharan Africa but was statistically insignificant in the Southeast Asian countries. The population growth decreases CO2 emissions in the sub-Saharan African countries while not statically significant in the Southeast Asian countries. Besides, the estimation results showed a lower level of CO2 emissions in the sub-Saharan African countries relative to the Southeast Asian countries.

To do this, data were collected from a random sample of 200 maize farmers in the municipality of Ze, Benin. Results indicated that almost all the maize farmers perceived change in climate variables. The adaptation strategies used by maize farmers in the municipality of Ze included adjustment in sowing time, use of improved crop varieties, crop and livestock integration and tree planting. Estimates of the multivariate probit model revealed that farmers' capacity to choose a specific adaptation strategy is affected by age, gender, marital status, education, experience in maize production, credit, distance to market, ownership of TV and agricultural training.

We investigate how local adaptive strategies are socially organised through a study of Oystre Slidre, a Norwegian mountain farming community operating close to the climatic margins. Farmers actively use informal social relations in accessing equipment and labour in order to secure production and quality of life. The importance of such relations in managing climate variability persists even with a dramatic shift towards larger scale production, increasing formalisation and economic diversification. Despite social innovations and adaptations such as the re-forming of social relationships and institutions, the concurrent reduction in the number of people involved in farming may be putting the flexibility of social networks and practices of collaboration under pressure, potentially undermining adaptive capacity to climate change. Future research and policy need to focus on ensuring social innovation in the social organisation of adaptation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

While for some groups, under certain circumstances migration can be an effective form of adaptation, for others it leads to increased vulnerabilities and a poverty spiral, reducing their adaptive capacities. Non-economic losses connected to a change of place further challenge the notion of successful adaptation. Even when migration improves the situation of a household, it may conceal the lack of action on climate change adaptation from national governments or the international community.

Applied ethnobiology emphasizes the practical importance of local and traditional knowledge in tackling these issues but thereby also raises complex theoretical questions about the integration of heterogeneous knowledge systems. The aim of this article is to develop a framework for addressing questions of integration through four core domains of philosophy-epistemology, ontology, value theory, and political theory. In each of these dimensions, we argue for a model of partial overlaps that acknowledges both substantial similarities and differences between knowledge systems. While overlaps can ground successful collaboration, their partiality requires reflectivity about the limitations of collaboration and co-creation. By outlining such a general and programmatic framework, the article aims to contribute to developing philosophy of ethnobiology as a field of interdisciplinary exchange that provides new resources for addressing foundational issues in ethnobiology and also expands the agenda of philosophy of biology.","[Ludwig, David] Wageningen Univ & Res, Knowledge Technol & Innovat Grp, Hollandseweg 1,Bldg 201, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [El-Hani, Charbel N.] Fed Univ Bahia UFBA, Inst Biol, Hist Philosophy & Biol Teaching Lab LEFFIBio, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [El-Hani, Charbel N.] Natl Inst Sci & Technol Interdisciplinary & Trans, Salvador, BA, Brazil",Wageningen University & Research; Universidade Federal da Bahia,"Ludwig, D (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Knowledge Technol & Innovat Grp, Hollandseweg 1,Bldg 201, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",david.ludwig@wur.nl,"Ludwig, David/ABF-3892-2020","Ludwig, David/0000-0002-2010-5120","CNPq [303011/2017-3, 465767/2014-1]; CAPES [23038.000776/2017-54]; ERC [851004 LOCAL KNOWLEDGE]; NWO Vidi Grant [V1.Vidi.195.026 ETHNOONTOLOGIES]",CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); NWO Vidi Grant(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"Charbel El-Hani is thankful to CNPq (grant number 465767/2014-1) and CAPES (grant number 23038.000776/2017-54) for their support of INCT IN-TREE, and to CNPq for support in the form of productivity in the research grant (grant number 303011/2017-3).

The combination of the results, obtained through the aggregation Dempster's rule, allows to identify the most critical areas on which it is necessary to intervene or through mitigation or urban regeneration.","[Bernetti, Iacopo; Barbierato, Elena; Capecchi, Irene] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, Florence, Italy; [Saragosa, Claudio] Univ Florence, Dept Architecture DIDA, Florence, Italy",University of Florence; University of Florence,"Barbierato, E (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, Florence, Italy.",iacopo.bernetti@unifi.it; elena.barbierato@unifi.it; irene.capecchi@unifi.it; claudio.saragosa@unifi.it,"Barbierato, Elena/GON-4609-2022",,,,,,58,0,0,2,8,FIRENZE UNIV PRESS,FIRENZE,"JOURNALS DIVISION, BORGO ALBIZI, 28, FIRENZE, 50122, ITALY",1592-6117,1724-2118,,AESTIMUM,Aestimum,,2020,,,,,SI,,57,80,,10.13128/aestim-8086,http://dx.doi.org/10.13128/aestim-8086,,,24,Economics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,XH7OU,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000725620100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Integrating climate information into forest management can help with climate change adaptation but doing so requires extensive engagement between scientists, practitioners, and decisionmakers. Forestry advisors are an important source of forest management information for many private landowners. However, little is known about forestry advisors' attitudes toward using and delivering climate and weather information. We surveyed state service foresters in the midwestern United States to assess their information needs and attitudes toward incorporating climate and weather forecasts into their practices. Most respondents (70%) indicated that they could find the short-term weather information they needed to advise landowners. Only 26% indicated that they could find the long-term climate information they needed. A majority of respondents indicated they would be interested in receiving long-term climate information. Results suggest that service foresters are open to using climate forecasts and information. Work needs to be done to ensure that the information presented is valuable to and usable by foresters.","[Carlton, J.

In particular, high-NOx, polluted regions are prominently distinguished by substantial climate penalties (up to 6.2 ppb/K in major urban areas) as a result of large temperature influences through increased biogenic emissions and nonnegative water vapor sensitivities. Temperature influences on ozone mortality, when integrated across the domain, result in 369 excess deaths/K in Canada and the U.

As such, we suggest that NOx control can be also regarded as a climate change adaptation strategy with regard to ozone air quality.","[Zhao, Shunliu; Pappin, Amanda J.; Mesbah, S. Morteza; Zhang, J.

Results of 28 semi-structured interviews carried out with producers in two Prairie provinces, Alberta and Manitoba, revealed that information regarding soil and water conservation practices comes from a variety of sources. These included industry, government, producer and conservation organizations, social sources of information and personal experience, and media. Producers were more open to new practices when they could learn them through observation, trials, and two-way dialogue. There appears to be a general lack of producer organization involvement, and dearth of government information, direction, and coordination for climate change adaptation.

However, successful integration, and thus the implementation of integrated planning measures, is difficult in practice. To understand and reduce the problems encountered, it is important to investigate systemic challenges. These challenges are rooted in the interaction between various stakeholders that affect DRM and the integration of CCA, directly or indirectly. This study explores the degree of integration in on-the-ground measures by studying systemic challenges, using the Nicaraguan DRM system as a case study. A theoretical framework for investigating systemic challenges in DRM systems was developed. It was then used in a retrospective analysis of the different functions of the systems in order to identify fragmentation in knowledge, information and coordination flows at local and national levels of governance. The results revealed several fragmented processes and functions in the Nicaraguan DRM system. These lead to difficulties in consolidating relevant information produced by multiple governmental authorities at different levels, and transferring this information to the local level. Fragmentation also leads, in turn, to little integration of CCA aspects into DRM in both local planning and practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate projections simulate the response to radiative forcing, but are subject to substantial uncertainties due to internal variability. Decadal climate predictions aim to reduce this uncertainty by initializing the simulations using observations, but are typically limited to the next 10 years. Here, we use decadal predictions to constrain climate projections beyond the next decade and demonstrate that accounting for climate variability improves regional projections of 20-year average temperatures. Applying this constraint to climate projections of the near future until 2035, summer temperatures over land regions in Asia and Africa tend to show stronger changes within the warming range simulated by the larger, unconstrained, ensemble-consistent with a warm phase in North Atlantic variability. This improved regional climate information can enable tailored adaptation to climate changes in the coming decades.","[Mahmood, Rashed; Donat, Markus G.; Ortega, Pablo; Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J.; Ruprich-Robert, Yohan] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J.] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); ICREA,"Mahmood, R (corresponding author), Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain.",rashed.mahmood@bsc.es,"Ortega, Pablo/ABE-7884-2020; Donat, Markus/J-8331-2012; Ruprich-Robert, Yohan/AAU-3208-2020; Doblas-Reyes, Francisco/C-1228-2016","Ortega, Pablo/0000-0002-4135-9621; Donat, Markus/0000-0002-0608-7288; Ruprich-Robert, Yohan/0000-0002-4008-2026; Doblas-Reyes, Francisco/0000-0002-6622-4280; Mahmood, Rashed/0000-0002-3583-2232","Horizon 2020 EUCP EUropean Climate Prediction system [776613]; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades as part of the CLINSA project [CGL2017-85791-R]; Spanish Ministry for the Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [RYC-2017-22964, RYC-2017-22772]; EUnion's H2020 Programme [800154]","Horizon 2020 EUCP EUropean Climate Prediction system; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades as part of the CLINSA project; Spanish Ministry for the Economy, Industry and Competitiveness; EUnion's H2020 Programme","This research was funded by the Horizon 2020 EUCP EUropean Climate Prediction system (Grant No. 776613) and the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades as part of the CLINSA project (funding reference CGL2017-85791-R).

Here, we examine indigenous knowledge forecasting systems used by smallholder farmers in Maondo Agriculture Camp (MAC) of Sesheke District in the Western Province of Zambia to increase their climate change adaptive capacity at the farm level. We adopted a qualitative approach that uses an exploratory-descriptive design. We then used purposive sampling, a non-probability methodological approach, to choose respondents. We applied semi-structured interviews and questionnaires as data collection tools and examined the data using thematic content analysis. We found that > 50% of small-scale farmers receive forecasts produced by the Zambia Meteorological Department (ZMD) through stakeholders' meetings. Farmers who do not receive ZMD forecasts depend on indigenous knowledge systems. Results further indicate that farmers in the MAC combine several indicators to predict rainfall. Prominent among them include plants, weather-related parameters, and astrological indicators. A cursory inspection of these rainfall predictors revealed several points specifically highlighting three salient thematic contents, i.e. biological, meteorological, and astrological. Results further showed that both conventional science and indigenous knowledge used to forecast rainfall have strengths and weaknesses. We, therefore, conclude that the integration of the two methods has the potential to significantly improve rainfall forecasts and ultimately agricultural productivity at the farm level.","[Mushimbei, Matakala] Meteorol Dept, Haile Selassie Ave, Lusaka 30200, Zambia; [Libanda, Brigadier] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3FF, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Libanda, B (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3FF, Scotland.",brigadierlibanda@rocketmail.com,,,United Nations Development Programme (UNDP);  [00086729],United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); ,"This research was carried out as part of the Strengthening Climate Information and Early Warning Systems project (CIEWS; Project Number 00086729; https://www.adaptation-undp.org/proje cts/ldcf-ews-zambia) funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

Recent Findings A review of adaptation for food security and nutrition FSN in West Africa concluded that food security and nutrition and climate adaptation are not independent goals, but often go under different sectors. The Summary Most of the adaptation categories identified here are highly effective in reducing climate risks to food security and malnutrition, and the implementation is moderately or highly feasible. Categories include improved access to (1) sustainable, affordable, and healthy diets from climate-resilient, nutrition-sensitive agroecological food systems; (ii) health care (including child, maternal, and reproductive), nutrition services, water and sanitation; (iii) anticipatory actions, adoption of the IPC classification, EW-EA systems; and (iv) nutrition-sensitive adaptive social protection. Risk reduction, such as weather-related insurance, and risk management are moderately effective and feasible due to economic and institutional barriers. Women and girls' empowerment, enhanced education, rights-based approaches, and peace building are highly relevant enablers for implementation of the adaptation options.","[Tirado, M.

Yet few studies have considered the role of political institutions at the national level. Comparative political institutional theory argues that a country's party system, executive-legislative arrangement, and electoral rules affect elected officials' incentives and behaviour. This study utilizes this theory to explain how Chile's national elected officials responded to the country's extreme drought in 2010-2015. Results indicate that ideologically distinct alliances, a strong president, and legislators' competing incentives to cater to different interests resulted in adaptive policy solutions that only partially addressed the shortcomings that drought exposed. The findings of this study show how politics can underlie technical decision-making on climate change, help to account for the continued inadequacies of Chilean water reform even in the face of new climate extremes, and demonstrate the utility of the comparative political institutional lens for explaining national strategies for climate adaptation. Applying this lens to other country cases and climatic events will advance knowledge on how differences in electoral incentives and policy processes systematically shape climate adaption policy.","[Struthers, Cory L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Polit Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Struthers, Cory L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Struthers, CL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Polit Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Struthers, CL (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",cstruth@umn.edu,,"Struthers, Cory/0000-0001-9931-9211","Hemispheric Institute on the Americas at the University of California, Davis through the Tinker Foundation","Hemispheric Institute on the Americas at the University of California, Davis through the Tinker Foundation","This work was supported by the Hemispheric Institute on the Americas at the University of California, Davis through the Tinker Foundation.",,97,2,2,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Communities have developed knowledge systems around climate-mediated environmental changes since time immemorial. Some social groups have capacity to cope with stress better. They have homeostatic advantage due to either accumulated surplus (Burton, 2001, Vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in the drylands, United Nations Environment Programme) or access to institutions, technology and social networks (Adger, 2003, Social capital, collective action, and adaptation to climate change. Economic Geography, 79(4), 387-404). However, these knowledge systems often remain limited as isolated islands of expertise or small local networks resulting into asymmetries of knowledge at inter- or intra-community level. Intermediary organisations/platforms become important to bridge the gap that exists among communities within the informal sector and also between the formal and informal sectors. The platforms like the Honey Bee Network (henceforth, the Network) have been able to facilitate both horizontal exchanges, people-to-people learning and sharing, and vertical exchanges, connecting the informal actors with the formal system. The variation in different components of an Open Innovation System is studied in this article through their degree of openness in sharing, self-governance and self-regulation. We explore different activities and institutions of the Network to study the degree of openness and how they contribute to make the 26-year-old ecosystem more sustainable. We draw lessons for other institutions, organisations, communities who strive towards an autopoietic system, that is, a self-designed, self-organised and self-governed system with a feedback system from within and outside. This may make the whole innovation and knowledge ecosystem resilient in dealing with changing climatic conditions and fluctuating environment.","[Dey, Anamika] Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Dey, Anamika] Indian Sch Mines, Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India; [Gupta, Anil] Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, CMA, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Singh, Gurdeep] Vinoba Bhave Univ, Jharkhand, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad; Vinoba Bhave University,"Dey, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.;Dey, A (corresponding author), Indian Sch Mines, Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India.",anamikad@iima.ac.in,,,,,,,60,3,3,3,57,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD,NEW DELHI,"B-1-I-1 MOHAN CO-OPERATIVE INDUSTRIAL AREA, MATHURA RD, POST BAG NO 7, NEW DELHI 110 044, INDIA",0971-7218,0973-0796,,SCI TECHNOL SOC,Sci.

Then it has advanced and used in several disciplines such as urban and reginal planning and landscape architecture. This diversity has promoted a range of planning initiatives and widespread its usage while make it difficult to define and operationalize GI planning. However, this is a planning strategy that has the potential to promote urban landscape planning by providing a holistic understanding of the dynamics of socio-ecological systems. GI planning, by producing a variety of ecosystem services, and having proactive multi-function and multi-discipline approach in planning, enhances our ability to deal with climate change in urban scale. Significant advances in GI planning have recently been made in integrating adaptation objectives in plans. However, in incorporating urban GI planning strategy to urban adaptive planning to cope with disasters, many challenges remained linked to integrate these two strategic planning in urban ecological planning with opportunistic response, more than only simple unintegrated defensive strategy. This research tries to take a step in this direction and seeks to investigate what constitutes GI as a strategy, and through this strategy how it can be possible to offer an integrated approach in urban planning practice. Then it investigates what are the key concepts and principles of urban adaptive planning, and how urban adaptive planning can be made operational in urban GI planning practice. In this essay, a transdisciplinary framework for adaptive urban GI planning is proposed to integrate science and professional practice. It includes adaptive strategies from climate change adaptation and ecological planning in a structured form to simultaneously support different type of responses in planning and improve transformability and flexibility in planning and practice.","[Ramyar, Reza; Ackerman, Aiden; Johnston, Douglas M.] SUNY Albany, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Albany, NY 12222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry,"Ramyar, R (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",rramyar@esf.edu,,,,,,,145,13,14,17,56,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,OCT,2021,117,,,,,,,,103316,10.1016/j.cities.2021.103316,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2021.103316,,JUN 2021,14,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,UI4OM,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000690588600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adapting to climate change is becoming an important strategy for watershed management. The goal of this study was to quantify the impacts of climate change on watershed hydrological processes and water quality, to evaluate the efficiency of Best Management Practices (BMPs) and the possible effects of a changing climate, and to configure cost-effective BMPs at sub-basin scale using a multi objective optimization method to mitigate climate effects on water resource. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to simulate the possible effects of changing climate on watershed hydrological and water-quality processes and adaptation options in the Miyun Reservoir Watershed (MRW). Climate change had significant impacts on water balance components such as precipitation, runoff, and evapotranspiration (ET) and on water-quality components such as sediment and nutrient loads. A substantial decreasing trend of runoff indicated that the Miyun Reservoir faced a more acute challenge of insufficient water-supply capacity. Compared with baseline climate, climate change represented by precipitation and temperature regimes resulted in substantial increases in sediment load (12.95%) and nutrient losses (7.26% for TN and 9.56% for TP) on average all sub-basins. Climate variability had significant effects on BMP efficiency through effects on watershed hydrology, soil erosion, and nutrient losses. Results highlight the importance of optimal configuration of site-specific BMPs at sub-basin scale for adaptation to climate change. The methods and findings presented here hold promise to enhance the resilience of the watershed system to current and future climate change.","[Qiu, Jiali; Shen, Zhenyao; Xie, Hui; Hou, Xiaoshu; Wei, Guoyuan] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Leng, Guoyong] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",Beijing Normal University; University of Oxford,"Shen, ZY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zyshen@bnu.edu.cn,"Chen, Lei/AAD-3766-2019","Chen, Lei/0000-0001-8415-3896; Shen, Zhenyao/0000-0002-6620-1943",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51579011]; fund for Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51721093],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); fund for Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This project was supported by the funds from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51579011) and the fund for Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51721093).,,57,28,28,16,115,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

The impacts of such climate change on Amazonian land-use dynamics, agricultural production, and deforestation rates are still to be determined. In this study, the authors make a first attempt to assess these impacts through a systemic approach, using a spatially explicit modeling framework to project crop yield and land-use/land-cover changes in the Brazilian Amazon by 2050. The results show that, without any adaptation, climate change may exert a critical impact on the yields of crops commonly cultivated in the Amazon (e. g., soybean yields are reduced by 44% in the worst-case scenario). Therefore, following baseline projections on crop and livestock production, a scenario of severe regional climate change would cause additional deforestation of 181 000 km(2) (+20%) in the Amazon and 240 000 km(2) (+273%) in the Cerrado compared to a scenario of moderate climate change. Putting an end to deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon forest by 2020 (and of the Cerrado by 2025) would require either a reduction of 26%-40% in livestock production until 2050 or a doubling of average livestock density from 0.74 to 1.46 head per hectare. These results suggest that (i) climate change can affect land use in ways not previously explored, such as the reduction of yields entailing further deforestation, and (ii) there is a need for an integrated/multidisciplinary plan for adaptation to climate change in the Amazon.","[Lapola, David Montenegro; Schaldach, Ruediger; Alcamo, Joseph] Univ Kassel, Ctr Environm Syst Res, Kassel, Germany; [Bondeau, Alberte] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Msangi, Siwa] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Priess, Joerg A.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Leipzig, Germany; [Silvestrini, Rafaella; Soares-Filho, Britaldo Silveira] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Ctr Sensoriamento Remoto, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universitat Kassel; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Lapola, DM (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Ecol, Inst Biociencias, Av 24-A, BR-13500900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil.",dmlapola@yahoo.com.br,"Priess, Joerg A./G-1697-2012; Lapola, David M/N-4954-2017; Bondeau, Alberte/E-9909-2012","Priess, Joerg A./0000-0002-0384-9240; Bondeau, Alberte/0000-0002-8729-5061","International Max Planck Research School on Earth System Modelling, Hamburg, Germany; Brazil's Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Climate and Land Use Alliance","International Max Planck Research School on Earth System Modelling, Hamburg, Germany; Brazil's Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); Climate and Land Use Alliance","We are grateful to C.

In western North America, there has been a shift toward earlier spring runoff and more winter precipitation as rain. This raises questions about the need for increased water storage to mitigate both floods and droughts. Some water managers have identified natural storage structures as valuable tools for increasing resiliency to these climate change impacts. However, identifying adequate sites and quantifying the storage potential of natural structures is a key challenge. This study addresses the need for a method for identifying and estimating floodplain water storage capacity in a manner that can be used by water planners through the development of a model that uses open-source geospatial data. This model was used to identify and estimate the storage capacity of a 0.33 km(2) floodplain segment in eastern Montana, USA. The result is a range of storage capacities under eight natural water storage conditions, ranging from 900 m(3) for small floods to 321,300 m(3) for large floods. Incorporating additional hydraulic inputs, stakeholder needs, and stakeholder perceptions of natural storage into this process can help address more complex questions about using natural storage structures as ecosystem-based climate change adaptation strategies.","[Holmes, Danika; McEvoy, Jamie; Dixon, Jean L.] Montana State Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Bozeman, MT 59718 USA; [Payne, Scott] KirK Engn, 136 Tuke Lane, Sheridan, MT 59749 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Holmes, D (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Bozeman, MT 59718 USA.",danika.l.holmes@gmail.com; jamie.mcevoy@montana.edu; jean.dixon@montana.edu; scottmpayne@gmail.com,"Dixon, Jean/B-2099-2012","Dixon, Jean/0000-0002-7763-4939",Montana EPSCoR; Institute on Ecosystems; U.S. Geological Survey; Montana Water Center; Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation,Montana EPSCoR; Institute on Ecosystems; U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); Montana Water Center; Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation,"This study received financial support from the Montana EPSCoR and the Institute on Ecosystems, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Montana Water Center, and the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation.

Economic assessment of adaptation options needs to explicitly incorporate the uncertainty of future climate conditions and should recognise that uncertainties may diminish over time as a result of improved understanding and learning. Real options analysis (ROA) is an appraisal tool developed to incorporate concepts of flexibility and learning that relies on probabilistic data to characterise uncertainties. It is also a relatively resource-intensive decision support tool. We test whether, and to what extent, learning can result from the use of successive generations of real life climate scenarios, and how non-probabilistic uncertainties can be handled through adapting the principles of ROA in coastal economic adaptation decisions. Using a relatively simple form of ROA on a vulnerable piece of coastal rail infrastructure in the United Kingdom, and two successive UK climate assessments, we estimate the values associated with utilising up-dated information on sea-level rise. The value of learning can be compared to the capital cost of adaptation investment, and may be used to illustrate the potential scale of the value of learning in coastal protection, and other adaptation contexts.","[Dawson, David A.] Univ Leeds, Sch Civil Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Hunt, Alistair] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Shaw, Jon] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Gehrels, W.

Climate vulnerability is shaped by institutions and socioeconomic processes including land tenure arrangements and infrastructural development. This paper employs a participatory mixed-method approach including household questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews, oral narratives and focus group discussions to understand the dynamics of livelihood challenges in 6 dryland farming communities of different vulnerability status in Ghana. Acknowledging the importance of agronomic practices as well as economic and environmental processes in influencing climate vulnerability in dryland farming systems, this paper demonstrates how the complex land tenure system is implicitly involved in shaping the vulnerability of two groups of farmers (migrant farmers in the Ejura Selcyedumase district and female farmers in the Bongo district) by limiting the adaptation options available to these groups. Our results suggest that women's rights regarding land ownership should be formalized in land policy in order to reduce cultural discriminations against them. Opportunities for women to own and formalize land registration titles should be pursued by the Government of Ghana. This will help women to secure property rights over land and land use via mechanisms such as collateral to access credit, which could be used to implement climate adaptation practices. The rights of migrant workers should also be recognized in Ghana's land policy to provide them with opportunities for adaptation in a similar manner to non-migrants. Climate change adaptation policies should also consider the broader socioeconomic and environmental factors that hinder smallholder farmers' ability to implement adaptation measures.

Timmons",,,Adaptation and international climate policy,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE,,,English,Review,,,,,,,SUPPORT; VULNERABILITY; INDICATORS; GOVERNANCE; ECONOMICS,"Because of the failure of the world to agree an adequate regime to limit greenhouse gas emissions to a safe level, adaptation to climate change has risen rapidly in UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations since 2007. We closely review the development of policies, institutions, and financing of adaptation in international agreements from 1992 to the present. We conclude that the way the treaty has been builtfirst as a mitigation regime with adaptation added on only laterhas led to some profound problems for marrying the goals of economic development and building climate resilient societies. Particularly there are two problematic areas. First, following mitigation approaches, technical solutions are often the focus in adaptation projects, when social, political, and cultural problems lie at the roots of vulnerability and should be addressed directly. Second, early requirements that external funding would only come if the adaptation effort was clearly additional' to what would have been done without a changing climate have been extremely pernicious. By attempting to divide a development project from the additional' costs of adapting to climate change, the global policy has shaped adaptation efforts at the local level. To understand how we ended up with such quirky definitions of what counts as adaptation, we need to review the history of adaptation in the negotiated regimes. Finally, we trace the incomplete negotiations over who will pay for adaptation in developing countries, whether that funding will come as grants or loans, as private investment or public funds, and what say recipient countries will have.

However, relatively few studies have been conducted that investigate how the capacities of agricultural extension agents can be built to more effectively assist smallholder farmers in managing climate risks and impacts. As climate change is a key threat to smallholder food production, addressing this issue is increasingly important. This paper aims to identify how agricultural extension agents in Ghana can better support smallholder farmers in navigating and addressing the effects of climate change on food production. It asks: (i) what are the sources of information used by agricultural extension agents in Ghana's Upper East region? (ii) what are the capacity building needs of agricultural extension agents for effective communication of climate information for building resilient agricultural systems? (iii) what are the key barriers to successful extension outcomes for climate change adaptation? The paper uses a mixed methods approach including three regional stakeholder workshops, expert interviews and surveys with 32 agricultural extension agents in northeastern Ghana. Results addressing question (i) indicated that radios and television are the dominant sources of climate information for agricultural extension agents in the Upper East region. Findings targeting question (ii) identified capacity building needs such as developing extension agents' technical skills, improving communication skills, improving knowledge and use of climate smart agricultural interventions such as soil moisture conservation methods, and training on information communication technologies (ICT) to deliver extension advice on climate change. Other needs included developing skills in field demonstration and project monitoring and evaluation. Addressing question (iii), key barriers confronted by agricultural extension agents in the delivery of extension on climate change included lack of transportation facilities for extension agents, lack of appropriate extension materials, high agricultural extension agent to farmer ratios, and inadequate funds to implement adaptation practices. Wider barriers reducing the effectiveness of extension efforts included farmer resistance to change and complex land tenure arrangements that do not allow investment. Periodic workshops should be organised for agricultural extension agents on the use of ICT to deliver extension services, whilst encouraging the use of audio-visuals in extension delivery. These efforts should be supported by regular assessments of extension agents' capacity building needs.","[Antwi-Agyei, Philip] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Stringer, Lindsay C.] Univ York, Dept Geog & Environm, Wentworth Way, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of York - UK,"Antwi-Agyei, P (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana.",pantwi-agyei.sci@knust.edu.gh,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Antwi-Agyei, Philip/AAI-7392-2020","Antwi-Agyei, Philip/0000-0002-8599-474X",Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Postdoctoral Fellowship [CR4D-19-06]; African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA); United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme; African Academy of Sciences (AAS),Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Postdoctoral Fellowship; African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA); United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme; African Academy of Sciences (AAS),"This work was supported through the Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Postdoctoral Fellowship [CR4D19-06] , an initiative of the African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) in partnership with the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme and implemented by the African Academy of Sciences (AAS) .",,74,19,20,8,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Attempts to improve model representations are hampered by a shortage of systematic descriptions of adaptation processes and their relevance to models. This paper reviews the scientific literature to investigate conceptualisations and models of climate change adaptation, and the ways in which representation of adaptation in models can be improved. The review shows that real-world adaptive responses can be differentiated along a number of dimensions including intent or purpose, timescale, spatial scale, beneficiaries and providers, type of action, and sector. However, models of climate change consequences for land use and water management currently provide poor coverage of these dimensions, instead modelling adaptation in an artificial and subjective manner. While different modelling approaches do capture distinct aspects of the adaptive process, they have done so in relative isolation, without producing improved unified representations. Furthermore, adaptation is often assumed to be objective, effective and consistent through time, with only a minority of models taking account of the human decisions underpinning the choice of adaptation measures (14%), the triggers that motivate actions (38%) or the time-lags and constraints that may limit their uptake and effectiveness (14%). No models included adaptation to take advantage of beneficial opportunities of climate change. Based on these insights, transferable recommendations are made on directions for future model development that may enhance realism within models, while also advancing our understanding of the processes and effectiveness of adaptation to a changing climate.","[Holman, Ian P.] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Vincent Bldg, Bedford MK43 0AL, England; [Brown, Calum; Rounsevell, Mark] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Carter, Timothy R.] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland; [Harrison, Paula A.] Lancaster Environm Ctr, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Lancaster LA1 4AP, England",Cranfield University; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Finnish Environment Institute; Lancaster University; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Holman, IP (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Vincent Bldg, Bedford MK43 0AL, England.",i.holman@cranfield.ac.uk; calum.brown@kit.edu; tim.carter@ymparisto.fi; paulaharrison@ceh.ac.uk; mark.rounsevell@kit.edu,"Rounsevell, Mark D A/AAC-4498-2021; Brown, Calum/ABH-4673-2020; Harrison, Paula Ann/K-1519-2016; Carter, Timothy Robert/N-4411-2017; Holman, Ian/A-7108-2010","Rounsevell, Mark D A/0000-0001-7476-9398; Brown, Calum/0000-0001-9331-1008; Harrison, Paula Ann/0000-0002-9873-3338; Carter, Timothy Robert/0000-0002-4026-8859; Holman, Ian/0000-0002-5263-7746","IMPRESSIONS project - European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [603416]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (as part of the MACSUR knowledge hub within the FACCE Joint Programming Initiative for Agriculture, Climate Change, and Food Security) [BB/N00485X/1]; BBSRC [BB/N00485X/1] Funding Source: UKRI","IMPRESSIONS project - European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (as part of the MACSUR knowledge hub within the FACCE Joint Programming Initiative for Agriculture, Climate Change, and Food Security)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","The research was financially supported by the IMPRESSIONS project (funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under Grant Agreement Number 603416) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) grant no BB/N00485X/1 (as part of the MACSUR knowledge hub within the FACCE Joint Programming Initiative for Agriculture, Climate Change, and Food Security).",,88,36,36,0,33,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Governments and land managers around the world are developing sea-level rise adaptation strategies and physical plans. In this context, the urgency for climate services, meaning the provision of climate information to meet the decision-making needs of users is emerging as a priority. We used a constructivist grounded theory approach to develop an assessment framework and answer the question is there alignment between supplied climate service written guidance materials and the demands of local practitioners working to address sea-level rise in their communities. This framework is highly flexible and compares guidance resources with local actions. We applied this framework in three areas - adaptation barriers, planning processes, and sea-level rise actions - to written climate service materials in California to test its viability and develop policy and theory relevant insights. Through this work we found significant integration of the existing climate services in practice in coastal California. We gained important insights into how climate services can better meet the needs of local practitioners (e.g. by deepening their focus on policy relevant materials). We found that the strategic comparison of different climate change adaptation actions needs more guidance materials. We also found that more explicit support is needed to overcome key policy and legal barriers. We uncovered the fact that newer theories, such as those that create a typology to compare physical sea-level rise adaption strategies have not infiltrated current planning practice and more support is needed to help make the bridge possible. These additional services are essential to ensure the effectiveness of existing resources.","[Hirschfeld, Daniella] Utah State Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, 4005 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Hirschfeld, Daniella; Hill, Kristina E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Environm Design, 202 Wurster Hall 2000, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hirschfeld, D (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, 4005 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",Daniella.hirschfeld@usu.edu; kzhill@berkeley.edu,,,California's Ocean Protection Council (OPC),California's Ocean Protection Council (OPC),Some of the work for this manuscript was performed as part of Daniella Hirschfeld's Ph.D. thesis work.

However, the gains have come with disproportionate environmental, cultural, health and social costs. The agriculture in the 21(st) century will have to address crucial challenges including climate change, by maintaining and enhancing environmental & cultural services and safeguarding nutritional quality, diversity of food and farming systems. Often the problems in agriculture are not solely caused by a lack or failure of science & technology, but instead derive from social, economic or legal framework. It is therefore critical to define first, what problems are best solved by changing social, economic or legal frameworks and second, those which are best solved by using technology. Further, the green revolution era model of transfer of technology is no more valid, particularly, when it comes to complex issues such as natural resource and climate change. Instead, innovative institutional arrangements are essential to successful design and adoption of ecologically and socially suitable agricultural systems. The roles of NGOs should be seen in this context. The advantage of NGOs lies in their independence status, freedom of raising voice of the poor and involvement at the grass-root level. Nand Educational Foundation for Rural Development (NEFORD) is one such NGO committed to transforming quality of live for the rural poor and under-privileged. It is dedicated to achieve sustainable economic development and preserve environment with the focus on marginal communities. NEFORD is leading an initiative called PARIS (Poverty Alleviation through Rice Innovation Systems) to improve food security (increase yields and reduce input cost), enhance flexibility in response to monsoon and climate change and maintain profitability in the market economy. PARIS aims to build Partnership for Rice Innovation Platform and Communication Systems to improve information flow to farmers and feedback and facilitate communication through out the information supply chain. The project uses ICT to improve access to information on market, cropping choices, weather forecasts and technology options, for which an Information Hub has been developed via the internet and village computer centres, to facilitate information flow between farmers and project partners. The program is about taking Research Into Use (RIU). We know a lot about the potential uses of different technologies, but what we don't know is where it is fit for purpose. To understand this, we are trying to bring together (a) knowledge of how a technology works, (b) appreciation of different agro-ecological conditions, in which it might be the best applied and (c) knowledge of socio-economic domain, in which it could be used. Matching the bio-physical and socioeconomic characterizations with the technology profiles (options) enables us to test the usefulness of intervention. The paper highlights the concept of Rice Innovation Systems and describes the functional mechanism and provides examples from the fields on technologies for adaptation to climate change, the nature of trainings to improve farmers' skills and knowledge and innovative approaches for accelerating the pace of technology adoption to reach out larger number of people in a shortest possible time.","[Singh, R.

Despite this trend, Taiwan, home to many Indigenous communities, has received relatively little attention. To date, no comprehensive review of the literature on Taiwan's Indigenous peoples and global climate change has been conducted. Therefore, this article presents a bibliometric analysis and literature review of both domestic and international studies on Taiwan's Indigenous peoples in relation to resilience, climate change, and climate shocks in the 10-year period after Typhoon Morakot (2009). We identified 111 domestic and international peer-reviewed articles and analyzed their presentation of the current state of knowledge, geographical and temporal characteristics, and Indigenous representation. Most studies were discovered to focus on post-disaster recovery, particularly within the context of Typhoon Morakot, as well as Indigenous cultures, ecological wisdom, and community development. This study also discovered relatively few studies investigating how traditional ecological knowledge systems can be integrated into climate change adaptation. Most studies also adopted a somewhat narrow focus on Indigenous resilience. Large-scale quantitative and longitudinal studies are found to be in their infancy.

These examples show that jurisdictional and institutional scales shape the implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and tasks at the management scale, creating benefits of integrated solutions, but also challenges. Investigating the linkages between adaptation and mitigation through a scale framework provides new knowledge for urban climate change planning and decision-making.

However, many adaptation efforts fail to result in adaptation actions. This inaction has been linked to several constraining factors including a lack of actionable information for adaptation decision-making processes. We wonder if climate service producers face constraints as they try to create and deliver actionable information for adaptation decision-making efforts? This paper draws on semi-structured interviews and participant-observations across climate service production environments in Sweden to answer our research question and fords that climate service producers engage in research, coordination, and communication to varying degrees and experience constraints related to the production and dissemination of actionable information and stakeholder engagement, as well as funding, professional, and institutional constraints. Some constraints are experienced differently by climate service producers depending on their specific role, institutional affiliation, agency, and experience. Additionally, some climate service production constraints create or exacerbate additional constraints for adaptation decision-making stakeholders. Therefore, climate service production constraints limit the effectiveness of climate services, and overcoming them would help make progress towards more adaptation implementation in specific contexts. However, for adaptation actions to be widespread, the production and dissemination of climate services must be met with additional support and guidance for adaptation efforts beyond the provision of actionable information.","[Ernst, Kathleen M.] Univ Tennessee, Bredesen Ctr Interdisciplinary Grad Educ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Swartling, Asa Gerger; Andre, Karin; Klein, Richard J.

Ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation (EbAs) are considered highly efficient in enhancing sustainable resilience of cities; however, incorporation of EbA measures into the decision-making process has not been fully achieved at the individual city level. The study illustrates how to initiate strategical adaptation planning from the scratch and facilitate the implementation of an adaptation planning process based on examples of three pilot cities in the Czech Republic (Prague, Pilsen, and Brno), using the outputs and experiences gained from participatory workshops and gathered stakeholder and institutional evidence. We focus particularly on stakeholder's perception of climate change related risks as well as prioritization of specific EbA measures and the institutional context of the decision making processes concerning implementation of those measures in order to enhance adaptation planning. The results show that the prioritization and suitability of individual EbA measures substantially varies among the analysed cities, depending on the local setting and associated climate-related risks. While low awareness of the problem and the non-existence of the institutional framework can be severe barriers to EbA measures implementation, strong cooperation between the city, NGOs and academics creates a supportive environment for such innovative solutions. We aim to provide Central and Eastern European context of urban EbA adaptation planning using participatory approaches, stakeholder perception and institutional analysis, which is currently not much covered from the regional perspective.","[Lorencova, Eliska Krkoska; Emmer, Adam; Vackarova, Davina] CAS, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Slavikova, Lenka; Vejchodska, Eliska; Rybova, Kristyna] JE Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Inst Econ & Environm Policy, IEEP, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Lorencova, EK (corresponding author), CAS, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.",lorencova.e@czechglobe.cz,"Emmer, Adam/P-5500-2014; Vackarova, Davina/G-2128-2014; Slavikova, Lenka/A-4960-2018","Emmer, Adam/0000-0002-8268-990X; Vackarova, Davina/0000-0002-6185-200X; Slavikova, Lenka/0000-0002-4393-7835; Vejchodska, Eliska/0000-0002-2270-3589","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR [LO1415]; Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - UrbanAdapt project [EHP-CZ02-OV-1-036-2015]; Czech Technology Agency [TL01000238]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic); Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - UrbanAdapt project; Czech Technology Agency","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I), grant number LO1415, Supported by grant from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - UrbanAdapt project (EHP-CZ02-OV-1-036-2015) and by the Czech Technology Agency grant number TL01000238.

The adverse effects of policies that are helping to facilitate the energy transition, such as price spikes or job displacement, however, are not evenly spread across the population, and some individuals and communities are more vulnerable to possible adverse impacts than others. Here, we adapt a framework for conceptualizing vulnerability from the climate change adaptation literature to the energy context. We construct the dimensions of the framework, provide an illustration using the case of the renewable portfolio standard, generate a vulnerability score measure and map vulnerability across US counties. Our analysis shows that this framework can be used to identify geographical disparities, and should be further developed in future research to provide deeper insights about a just transition.","[Carley, Sanya; Graff, Michelle; Konisky, David M.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Evans, Tom P.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Carley, S (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",scarley@indiana.edu,"Konisky, David/S-2618-2019","Konisky, David/0000-0002-1146-3938; Evans, Tom/0000-0003-4591-1011",Indiana University's Office for the Vice Provost for Research through the IU Collaborative Research Grant,Indiana University's Office for the Vice Provost for Research through the IU Collaborative Research Grant,"The authors would like to acknowledge financial support for this project offered by the Indiana University's Office for the Vice Provost for Research through the IU Collaborative Research Grant.

Operating since 2016, Flood Re is an industry-government initiative, set up with the goal of reforming the flood insurance market in order to provide universal, affordable cover for UK households. Principally providing reinsurance services to insurers and including mutualisation arrangements, it aims to withdraw from the market in 2039, having paved the way for risk-reflective pricing without subsidy. Drawing on the theoretical work of Francois Ewald, and empirical data from interviews with 12 key stakeholders and documentary analysis, this paper traces a shift in Flood Re's insurantial imaginary, exemplified by the devel-opment of several solutions which go beyond its initial remit of providing reinsurance to private insurers. Findings show that this shift has been driven by the growing realisation that climate change is not merely a complicating factor for the ability to achieve a thriving insurance market, but demands a paradigmatic change in the governance of flood risk. We argue that Flood Re has an opportunity to adopt a leadership role in the governance of climate adaptation, but that it must be expanded to include a wider variety of stakeholders covering land-use planning, housing, consumer and community representatives. That a market for flood insur-ance that delivers on risk reduction and affordability for all can be brought about without structural reform to the industry nor a strong role for the state, is a delusion in light of climate change.","[Hampton, Sam; Curtis, James] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Hampton, Sam] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Hampton, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",samuel.hampton@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,"Hampton, Sam/0000-0003-0596-9710",,,,,102,0,0,26,26,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,NOV,2022,136,,,,,,80,91,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2022.08.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2022.08.008,,SEP 2022,12,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,4X9TZ,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000861179900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

While some projects can serve both types of purposes, the conventional benefits are often more clearly appreciated than the latter. But a clear identification of the climate change implications of a project is also important. Such distinction would help associate climate finance with climate benefits directly. However, at present, no established evaluation methods for adaptation benefits exist as it necessitates the representation of uncertainties of climate change effects in a specific project context, which is often difficult. Against this background, as a case study of the ex-ante evaluation of adaptation benefits under the uncertainty of climate change, we evaluate the robustness of the project performance of a Kenyan irrigation development project. Based on a simulation analysis carried out using the Robust Decision Making (RDM) approach, we assess the robustness of the positive expected outcomes of the project. We quantitatively identify that the development of irrigation facilities, especially when combined with the soft adaptation measures of farming practices, could bring about an increase of household income in the future under a large variety of conditions. These beneficial effects are partly a reflection of the reduced damage from climate change achieved by the project. We also discuss factors that could become relevant for the application of RDM-based project evaluation in the field of climate finance.","[Narita, Daiju] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Narita, Daiju] JICA Ogata Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Narita, Daiju] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Sato, Ichiro] Japan Int Cooperat Agcy JICA, Tokyo, Japan; [Ogawada, Daikichi; Matsumura, Akiko] Nippon Koei Co Ltd, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan","University of Tokyo; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Nippon Koei Co., Ltd.","Narita, D (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",daiju.narita@global.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Sato, Ichiro/HGU-7251-2022; Narita, Daiju/G-7125-2016","Sato, Ichiro/0000-0001-7253-2178; Narita, Daiju/0000-0001-5695-9913; Ogawada, Daikichi/0000-0003-1047-3816","JICA [17KT0066, 17K00677]; JICA Ogata Research Institute (JICA-RI); JSPS Kakenhi; Nippon Koei Co.","JICA; JICA Ogata Research Institute (JICA-RI); JSPS Kakenhi(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Nippon Koei Co.","& nbsp;The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing in-terests: This study is funded by JICA and the JICA Ogata Research Institute (JICA-RI) , which also provided various logistical support.

This study of the politics of water reforms in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) analyses contrasting discourses of water security during the Millennium Drought (1996-2010). The paper traces the historical evolution, mobilisation and effects of three discourses defined as 'drought-proofing', 'higher value use' and 'river restoration'. These are broadly aligned with engineering, economics and ecological perspectives, and while all discourses were integrated into government responses to the drought, the resurgence of drought-proofing significantly altered policy settings intended to shift MDB water management onto a more sustainable path. The paper illustrates the political and physical conditioning of water policy, placing drought responses in their historical context. The analysis demonstrates how policy actors used discourses of water security to define normative goals and legitimise policies, particularly when climatic extremes provide opportunities to influence policy outcomes. The paper provides three key insights for water governance and climate adaptation: first, drought responses can have far-reaching effects for water governance and policy trajectories; second, droughts pose challenges to positive climate adaptation when they revitalise heroic drought proofing initiatives; and third, understanding the historical roots of contemporary drought responses is vital for effective climate adaptation.","[Alexandra, Jason] Alexandra & Associates, Melbourne, Vic 3095, Australia; [Alexandra, Jason] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Rickards, Lauren] RMIT, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Alexandra, J (corresponding author), Alexandra & Associates, Melbourne, Vic 3095, Australia.;Alexandra, J (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",jason@alexandra-consulting.com; lauren.rickards@rmit.edu.au,,"Rickards, Lauren/0000-0001-6088-3448",,,,,143,7,7,3,8,WATER ALTERNATIVES ASSOC,MONTPELLIER,"VILLA D ASSAS, 457 AVENUE DU PERE SOULAS, MONTPELLIER, 34090, FRANCE",1965-0175,,,WATER ALTERN,Water Altern.,OCT,2021,14,3,,,,,773,794,,,,,,22,Environmental Studies; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,WE8EM,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000705852200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

A key step in planning and implementing effective adaptation actions is to identify what elements are driving vulnerability and resilience. Building on existing vulnerability and resilience conceptual models, we developed and applied a conceptual framework to identify drivers of vulnerability and resilience in social-ecological systems. By unifying the two concepts of vulnerability and resilience into a single framework, it is possible to better capture drivers of coping, adaptive and transformative capacities, and how they relate to specific climate hazards. The aim of the framework is to provide the conceptual basis from which the two concepts can be applied in conjunction, rather than prescribing specific indicators. The proposed framework was applied using a participatory action research approach to identify drivers of resilience and vulnerability in three coastal villages on a peripheral rural island in Fiji. Results from the framework's application show that these communities are currently contextualized within multiple layers of vulnerability and resilience, driven by: dependency on external support to implement activities, lack of knowledge about novel management actions for dealing with rapid environmental change, high levels of agency, increased access to support and services, high levels of awareness about climate change impacts, disposition to implement change and learn, and capacity to mobilize community resources and support. The development and application of the framework highlights aspects of vulnerability and resilience that have been overlooked or undervalued in the past when designing and implementing strategies for climate change adaptation in small island developing states (SIDS). The proposed framework has the potential to help overcome existing barriers in designing and implementing successful adaptation strategies, optimizing their effectiveness and sustainability in ways that are aligned with the unique situations of many SIDS.","[Hidalgo, Daniela Medina; Nunn, Patrick D.; Beazley, Harriot] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sunshine Coast, Australia; [Hidalgo, Daniela Medina] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Hidalgo, DM (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sunshine Coast, Australia.;Hidalgo, DM (corresponding author), Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Nunn, Patrick D./C-7864-2011; Hidalgo, Daniela Medina/AAP-6674-2020","Nunn, Patrick D./0000-0001-9295-5741; Hidalgo, Daniela Medina/0000-0002-7064-0455",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Postgraduate Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Postgraduate Scholarship",We thank the communities of Ono Island for their support and involvement in the study.

First, a lack of conventional funding sources or formalised regulatory framework allowed room for experimentation with existing mechanisms and flexible strategies. Second, project planners are currently ambivalent towards introducing new mechanisms as a means to overcome implementation challenges. The case provides evidence about the role of the governance process, not simply as a means of system coordination that exists in isolation from institutional norms and values, but rather as a space for innovation, which can contribute towards reducing the financial gap associated with climate adaptation.","[Root, Liz; van der Krabben, Erwin] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res Geog Planning & Environm, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Spit, Tejo] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Utrecht University,"Root, L (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res Geog Planning & Environm, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",e.root@fm.ru.nl,,,,,,,56,10,10,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

This paper focuses on the farming systems level at which many of the impacts of a changing climate will be felt. This is also the level where much of the activity relating to adaptation and mitigation can usefully be analysed and at which existing adaptive capacity provides a critical platform for further efforts. In this paper, we use a framework of nested hierarchies introduced by J. Passioura four decades ago to highlight the need for research, development and extension (RDE) on climate change at the farming systems level to build on more fundamental soil, plant, and animal sciences and to link into higher themes of rural sociology and landscape science. The many questions asked by those managing farming systems can be categorised under four broad headings: (1) climate projections at a local scale, (2) impacts of climate projections on existing farming systems, (3) adaptation options, and (4) risks and opportunities from policies to reduce emissions. These questions are used as a framework to identify emerging issues for RDE in Australian farming systems, including the complex balance in on-farm strategies between adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas concentrations. Climate is recognised as one of the defining features of different farming systems in Australia. It follows that if the climate changes, farming systems will have to shift, adapt, or be transformed into a different land use.

Communities depend on local policy tools to identify threats, determine goals, and implement strategies. Consequently, many cities around the world have developed climate adaptation plans to reduce climate impacts in the past decades. This study applied a plan evaluation framework to analyze and compare the plan quality of the latest climate adaptation plan in Taipei and Boston. The study examines key elements of adaptation plans to reveal strengths and weaknesses, and to compare and learn between adaptation plans internationally. Findings suggest that the framework provides comparable measures and analysis across international settings. We find that Taipei has a weak fact base and fails to address uncertainty, which importance in adaptation plans has been acknowledged only recently. We also identified shortfalls in public participation and implementation items in both cities. The study concludes by discussing results and giving recommendations to inform more effective approaches as practitioners develop or reevaluate climate adaptation plans.","[Tu, Shin; Yu, Siyu] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Yu, SY (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",syu@arch.tamu.edu,,,,,,,61,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2023,15,2,,,,,,,934,10.3390/su15020934,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15020934,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8Q4GH,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000927166900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As average annual temperatures increase, heat stress is expected to affect more people. While most research on heat stress has explored how exposure to heat affects functioning of the human organism, stress from heat can be manifest long before clinical symptoms are evident, with profound effects on behavior. Here we add to the little research conducted on these subclinical effects of environmental heat using results from an Australian-wide cross-sectional study of nearly 2000 respondents on their self-reported level of heat stress. Slightly less than half (47%) of the respondents perceived themselves as at least sometimes, often or very often stressed by heat during the previous 12 months. Health status and smoking behavior had the expected impact on self-reported perceived heat stress. There were also regional differences with people living in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales most likely to have reported to have felt heat stressed. People generally worried about climate change, who had been influenced by recent heat waves and who thought there was a relationship between climate change and health were also more likely to have been heat stressed. Surprisingly average maximum temperatures did not significantly explain heat stress but stress was greater among people who perceived the day of the survey as hotter than usual. Currently heat stress indices are largely based on monitoring the environment and physical limitations to people coping with heat. Our results suggest that psychological perceptions of heat need to be considered when predicting how people will be affected by heat under climate change and when developing heat relief and climate change adaptation plans, at work, at home or in public spaces. We further conclude that the perception of temperature and heat stress complements measures that assess heat exposure and heat strain.","[Zander, Kerstin K.] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Moss, Simon A.] Charles Darwin Univ, Sch Psychol & Clin Sci, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Garnett, Stephen T.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT, Australia",Charles Darwin University; Charles Darwin University; Charles Darwin University,"Zander, KK (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT, Australia.",kerstin.zander@cdu.edu.au,"Zander, Kerstin/M-2888-2013","Zander, Kerstin/0000-0002-2237-1801","Faculty of Law, Education, Business and Arts (LEBA) at Charles Darwin University","Faculty of Law, Education, Business and Arts (LEBA) at Charles Darwin University","The research was funded by two small grants by the Faculty of Law, Education, Business and Arts (LEBA) at Charles Darwin University.",,84,19,19,3,25,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

Climate change and its socioeconomic implications deteriorate different forms of cultural and natural heritage, including archaeological sites, historic buildings, and indigenous heritage in the polar regions. Climate adaptation of cultural and natural heritage of polar regions is challenged due to the barriers, constraints, and limitations of various factors such as lack of awareness of polar heritage, remoteness of the sites, and lack of tools and facilities. This paper first presents the general characteristics of 76 documents out of 218. It then analyzes the barriers derived from the content analysis of the publications. Despite growing interest in polar studies, incomplete and inaccurate data and inventories and facilities and tools as technological constraints negatively affect building climate adaptation of polar heritage. Following that, existing regulations and organizations are found to be ineffective and slow to address the issues of communication and collaboration for building climate adaptation of polar heritage. The findings will discuss the policy implications of understanding barriers and tackling them to facilitate the climate adaptation of polar heritage.","[Aktuerk, Guel] Delft Univ Tchnol T U Delft, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands",,"Aktuerk, G (corresponding author), Delft Univ Tchnol T U Delft, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",g.akturk@tudelft.nl,"akturk, gul/GRR-6475-2022; Aktürk, Gül/AAV-8037-2020","Aktürk, Gül/0000-0003-1555-8202",,,,,116,1,1,7,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

The analysis is framed within a social-institutional context, meaning the legal-regulatory environment is viewed from the perspective of the practices and norms that are created through existing laws and policies. Those norms and practices are then compared to current best practices for coastal climate adaptation to determine if and where divergence between recommended best practices and existing policy structures occurs. The results of this analysis suggest key policy instruments cumulatively act as barriers to adopting climate change assessment recommendations in coastal regions. The main causes for this disconnect between information and action seem to be historical path dependence, clear counter-incentives favoring coastal development, and multiple narratives of climate change, all of which diminish a unified public demand for coastal adaptation. Enumerated lessons presented from this analysis can be used as conceptual starting points when thinking about translating assessments of climate change into public action. In particular, the social-institutional framework provides an analytical construct for gaining insight into how existing legal and regulatory instruments influence adoption of proposed adaptation strategies, including highlighting when divergence between existing and proposed policies occurs.","[McGuire, Chad J.] Univ Dartmouth, Dept Publ Policy, 285 Old Westport Rd, N Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University Massachusetts Dartmouth,"McGuire, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Dartmouth, Dept Publ Policy, 285 Old Westport Rd, N Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA.",cmcguire@umassd.edu,,"McGuire, Chad/0000-0003-2480-4751",,,,,39,3,3,4,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1843,,,COGENT ENVIRON SCI,Cogent Environ.

This paper investigates the organizational values present in several municipal policy departments in order to explore their willingness to act upon climate adaptation and the implications for mainstreaming. Q methodology, supplemented by interviews and focus groups, applied in three major Dutch municipalities - Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam - reveals three value patterns: (1) start today; (2) not for us to lead; and (3) shared responsibility. These different value patterns indicate that there is a general agreement on the problem, impacts and solutions, but disagreement on the time frame for action and the allocation of resources. Although all three value patterns are present within departments in each municipality, different value patterns prevail in each municipality. Additionally, the analysis shows barriers as well as opportunities for mainstreaming. A lack of political commitment and leadership, and unsupportive organizational structures, create barriers. In spite of this, there is willingness to act and strategic framing is applied to gain acceptance for the mainstreaming of climate adaptation.","[Uittenbroek, Caroline J.; Spit, Tejo J.

I examine three case studies, one concerning a narrative of climate impacts, a second concerning the relationship between household wealth and vulnerability, and the third concerning the procedures and needs of policy-makers themselves. In each case, I find that the narrative that was needed to legitimize and continue the resource flow within an existing policy process continued, despite growing empirical and model-driven evidence to suggest that the narrative may not be correct.

As temperature increases under climate change, rainfall patterns will be different, and Chianti wine production in Tuscany therefore needs to adapt in the near future. We address the adaptation challenges and identify grape yield and quality loss as the main impact of climate change on wine production. Relocation of vineyards uphill and introducing drought-resistant varieties are considered as adaptation measures. We appraise these adaptation measures using an optimization framework, where regional wine producers maximize income subject to economic constraints including the climate change impacts on wine productivity and quality. Our simulation shows quantitatively to what extent a higher degree of climate change impact demands a higher degree of adaptation. We find that a combination of the two measures provides a better strategy because it leads to higher economic efficiency. However, uncertainty regarding the efficiency of the new variety discourages the use of this new drought-resistant variety, whereas a higher efficiency would make this choice more favourable. Sensitivity analysis for time horizon and discount rate confirms the theory of investment under uncertainty, showing a shorter time horizon (or more frequent investment) provides the possibility to postpone the decision to implement adaptation measures due to the value of flexibility, while a higher discount rate leads to a later adaptation decision, because uncertainty creates a value of waiting for new information.","[Zhu, Xueqin; van Ierland, Ekko C.] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Moriondo, Marco] CNR IBIMET, I-50145 Florence, Italy; [Trombi, Giacomo] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Bindi, Marco] Univ Florence, Dept Plant Soil & Environm Sci, Florence, Italy",Wageningen University & Research; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Biometeorologia (IBIMET-CNR); International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Florence,"Zhu, XQ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",xueqin.zhu@wur.nl; marco.moriondo@cnr.it; ekko.vanierland@wur.nl; trombi@iiasa.ac.at; marco.bindi@unifi.it,"Moriondo, Marco/H-5279-2019; bindi, marco/M-6415-2014; Zhu, Xueqin/K-9471-2013","Moriondo, Marco/0000-0002-8356-7517; bindi, marco/0000-0002-8968-954X; Zhu, Xueqin/0000-0002-5772-1090; Trombi, Giacomo/0000-0002-3775-272X",EU [244012],EU(European Commission),"This study is supported by the EU FP7 Mediation project under contract no. 244012.

Smaller climate change nevertheless poses risks of significant impacts, dislocation and adaptation costs in particularly exposed and vulnerable places. Climate change will also vary across space, and smaller, slower average change will likely still result in larger, rapid change for some systems and places (e.g. the Arctic and oceanic islands). Furthermore, non-linearities and power-law relationships among components of the earth's climate system mean that the potential for passing thresholds where parts of the system exhibit extreme behavior cannot be confidently excluded from a 1.5 degrees scenario. The potential for overshoot in a climate that eventually equilibrates at 1.5 degrees C or less above pre-industrial also means that anticipatory adaptation planning efforts should not be relaxed. Yet, taken together, the literature suggests that reactive adaptation has a better chance of keeping pace with the lower range of warming in many places and production systems (although not necessarily all), and could reduce though not eliminate the risk of large damages and adaptation costs in exposed and vulnerable places. Anticipatory adaptation investments, however, can be justified even for low levels of climate change and appear less sensitive to the projected magnitude of change in climate, and driven more by uncertainty in future emission and climate trajectories.","[Travis, William R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, 260 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Smith, Joel B.] Abt Associates Inc, 1881 9th St 201, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Yohe, Gary W.] Wesleyan Univ, Econ & Environm Studies, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; ABT Associates; Wesleyan University,"Travis, WR (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, 260 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",william.travis@colorado.edu,,"Travis, William/0000-0002-9197-1317",,,,,53,6,6,1,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

Yet, adaptation requires identifying and prioritizing among the diverse aspects of a site's significance, as not all sites can be simultaneously adapted due to financial and human capital constraints. Developing a measurement framework that can ascertain the relative significance between sites necessitates the collaboration of multiple perspectives, including experts who set policy and on-the-ground managers who must translate policy into practice while accounting for the management preferences of associated communities. This paper explores if a values-based process enables co-production of knowledge related to the significance of archeological sites. Specifically, this paper examines the influences of a workshop-conducted with diverse archaeological experts working for the U.S. National Park Service-on knowledge co-production and documents the extent of changes in experts' opinions using a pre-post survey design. Findings suggest that the values-based approach applied during the workshop can have a positive impact on knowledge co-production among experts. Changes were found in experts' perceptions of the importance of various considerations influencing archaeological site prioritization, as well as of the extent to which uncertainties challenge archaeological preservation. This paper presents novel findings about the importance of knowledge co-production in relation to coastal archaeological site preservation and climate adaptation in the U.S. Prioritization considerations and challenges of various uncertainties assessed in this study can provide valuable insights for progress in climate change policy for cultural heritage both in the U.S and globally.","[Fatoric, Sandra] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Seekamp, Erin] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",Delft University of Technology; North Carolina State University,"Fatoric, S (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",s.fatoric@tudelft.nl; elseekam@ncsu.edu,,"Seekamp, Erin/0000-0001-5082-1921; Fatoric, Sandra/0000-0002-3712-0749","United States Department of Interior, National Park Service [P13AC00443, P17AC00794]; NC State University [P13AC00443, P17AC00794]","United States Department of Interior, National Park Service; NC State University","Funding for this research was provided under Cooperative Agreement P13AC00443 between the United States Department of Interior, National Park Service and NC State University, Task Agreement Number P17AC00794: Assessing the Transferability of a Historic Resources Decision Support Model to Optimize Budget Allocation for Adaptation Planning.

Due to its geographical position, The Netherlands is vulnerable to sea level rise, increasing river discharges and increasing salt intrusion. This paper deals with the question of to what extent the historically developed Dutch water safety institutions have the capacity to cope with the 'new' challenges of climate change. The Adaptive Capacity Wheel provides the methodological framework. The analysis focuses on three recent and major planning practices in the Dutch water safety domain: the development and implementation of the Room for the River project, the introduction of the flood risk approach and the introduction of the Second Delta Plan. The results show that Dutch water safety institutions enable climate change adaptation, but to a limited extent. They face five institutional weaknesses that may cause risks in particular in the long term. The paper concludes that for The Netherlands to be prepared for climate change, it is necessary to build capacity to improvise, to invest in and create room for collaborative leaders, and to find ways to generate financial resources for long-term innovative measures.","[van den Brink, Margo] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Termeer, Catrien] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Meijerink, Sander] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Wageningen University & Research; Radboud University Nijmegen,"van den Brink, M (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.a.van.den.brink@rug.nl,"Termeer, Katrien/C-6057-2015; Meijerink, Sander V/D-6490-2012","Meijerink, Sander V/0000-0002-4249-6230; van den Brink, Margo/0000-0001-8247-3044",Netherlands BSIK-Programme Climate changes Spatial Planning (CcSP),Netherlands BSIK-Programme Climate changes Spatial Planning (CcSP),"This paper has been written within the project entitled: 'IC12: Institutions for Adaptation: The Capacity and Ability of the Dutch Institutional Framework to Adapt to Climate Change', funded by The Netherlands BSIK-Programme Climate changes Spatial Planning (CcSP).",,57,38,38,1,36,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",2040-2244,,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

Governments are seeking to establish adaptive measures for minimizing the effects of climate change on vulnerable citizen groups, economic sectors and critical infrastructure (Adger et al. in Global Environ Change 15(2):77-86, 2005. doi:10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2004.12.005; Smit and Wandel in Global Environ Change 16(3):282-292, 2006. doi:10.1016/j.gloenvcha. 2006.03.008). Coastal areas are particularly vulnerable to changing conditions due to rising sea levels and storm event intensification that produce new flood exposures (Richards and Daigle in Government of Prince Edward Island, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 2011 http://www.gov.pe.ca/ photos/original/ccscenarios.pdf). However, communities oftentimes lack access to locally-relevant climate change information that can support adaptation planning. This research introduces the use of a Geo-web tool for supporting local climate change adaptation efforts in coastal Canadian communities. The Geoweb tool (called AdaptNS'') is a web-based visualization tool that displays interactive flood exposure maps generated using local climate change projections of sea level rise and storm surge impacts between the years 2000 and 2100. AdaptNS includes participatory features that allow users to identify and share specific locations to protect against present and future coastal flood events. By soliciting feedback from community members, AdaptNS is shown to support local adaptation through the provision of flood exposure visuals, as a platform for identifying adaptation priorities, and as an avenue to communicate local risks to external entities that could facilitate local adaptation initiatives (e.g. upper levels of government). Future Geoweb research directions include improving the visualization of climate change projection uncertainties, the expansion of informational and participation capabilities, and understanding the potential for long-term adoption of Geoweb tools in adaptation decision-making.","[Minano, Andrea; Johnson, Peter A.; Wandel, Johanna] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Johnson, PA (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",peter.johnson@uwaterloo.ca,,"Johnson, Peter/0000-0003-4572-2915",Canadian International Development Research Centre via the Partnership for Canadian-Caribbean Community Climate Change Adaptation (ParCA); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Canadian International Development Research Centre via the Partnership for Canadian-Caribbean Community Climate Change Adaptation (ParCA); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),The authors would like to thank the Canadian International Development Research Centre for support via the Partnership for Canadian-Caribbean Community Climate Change Adaptation (ParCA) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for its support via the Geothink.ca Partnership Grant and the Insight Development Grants program.,,49,10,10,3,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0343-2521,1572-9893,,GEOJOURNAL,GeoJournal,JUN,2018,83,3,,,,,413,425,,10.1007/s10708-017-9777-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-017-9777-8,,,13,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,GF9UM,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000432324400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The dry zone of Myanmar occupies two-thirds of the agricultural lands and it has higher temperatures than elsewhere in the country. Climate change has severe impacts on agricultural production in this region. Moreover, changes in the precipitation patterns increase the likelihood of crop failures in the short-run and production declines in the long run. Therefore, an assessment of the economic impacts of climate change on crop production in the dry zone of Myanmar is very relevant. This paper examines the interactions between agriculture and climate and assesses the economic impact of climate change while using a Ricardian model. A cross-sectional survey covering three regions in the central dry zone: (Magwe, Mandalay, and Sagaing regions) was conducted, yielding a sample of 425 farmers. A non-linear relationship between climate indicators (temperature and precipitation) and revenue of land was found. The marginal effects were calculated by selecting economic and socio-demographic variables. The estimated marginal impacts suggest that the projected changes in temperature will affect the crop productivity of the region. The results also show that the temperature and rainfall components of global warming are both important. Predictions from three global circulation models all confirm that temperature is predicted to increase in all seasons. A significant marginal impact of increasing temperature on the net revenue of farm households was observed in the region. These findings call for policy makers and development planners to articulate the necessary climate change adaptation measures and mitigation options for reducing the negative impacts of climate change. Improved management and conservation of the available water resources could generate water for irrigation purposes and the dissemination of climate smart agricultural practices could lessen the negative impacts of climate change effects on agriculture in the dry zone of Myanmar.","[Tun Oo, Aung; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido; Speelman, Stijn] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Oo, AT (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",aunghtunoo717.yau@gmail.com; Guido.VanHuylenbroeck@UGent.be; stijn.speelman@ugent.be,"; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido/L-9251-2017","speelman, stijn/0000-0001-7692-3459; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido/0000-0002-9654-0727; Tun Oo, Aung/0000-0003-2203-5549",World Wildlife Fund for nature (WWF)_Russell E.

Currently, the greenhouse sector faces major challenges in reducing its energy demand while increasing crop quality and quantity. One route to improve the performance of industrial greenhouses could be based on using climate adaptive shells. These shells are capable of changing their thermal and optical properties on an hourly, daily, or seasonal basis to optimize performance. The climate adaptive shell concept shows considerable potential for performance improvement in the building sector. However, its potential for the greenhouse sector is yet unknown. This paper quantifies this potential by predicting the energy savings and the increase in net profit using a new framework based on numerical simulation and optimization techniques. The simulation results show that climate adaptive greenhouse shells increase net profit between 7% and 20% for tomato producing Dutch greenhouses. Monthly and hourly adaptation resulted in considerable primary energy savings of 23% and 37%, respectively. It is expected that the predicted net profit increase and energy savings will drive the attention of the greenhouse industry towards the development of climate adaptive greenhouse shells.

Specifically, a gravity modelling framework is first used to identify climate variables that have statistically significant associations with internal migration. The gravity model is then embedded within a population projection model to evaluate the effect of climate scenarios on regional populations. Of the climate variables, only surface radiation in the origin exhibits a significant association with internal migration. Including this variable in the population projection model makes a small difference to the regional population distribution, and the difference between different climate scenarios is negligible. Overall, the results suggest that, while statistically significant, climate change in the form of changes in the distribution of the weather will have a negligible effect on the population distribution of New Zealand at the regional level. These null results probably reflect the high capacity for adaptation to climate change available to a developed country.","[Cameron, Michael P.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Cameron, Michael P.] Univ Waikato, Natl Inst Demog & Econ Anal, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",University of Waikato; University of Waikato,"Cameron, MP (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.;Cameron, MP (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Natl Inst Demog & Econ Anal, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",mcam@waikato.ac.nz,,"Cameron, Michael/0000-0002-4296-3775","Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment as part of the Climate Change Impacts and Implications project [C01X1225]; New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE) [C01X1225] Funding Source: New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)","Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment as part of the Climate Change Impacts and Implications project(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)); New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE))","This research was funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment as part of the Climate Change Impacts and Implications project (Contract C01X1225), led by Andrew Tait (NIWA) and Daniel Rutledge (Landcare Research).",,71,11,11,4,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0199-0039,1573-7810,,POPUL ENVIRON,Popul.

The synthesis shows that there are still important knowledge gaps such as the ownership of land and trees, gender, the motivation to invest on farm trees, income and livelihood strategies and ecological issues of on farm trees in the context of climate change adaptation and sustainable development goals.

Net effects and options for adapting to them will depend very strongly on details of the system under consideration. This short paper is not a comprehensive review of climate change effects on parasites, but rather seeks to identify key areas in which detail is important and arguably under-recognized in supporting farmer adaptation. I argue that useful predictions should take fuller account of system-specific properties that influence disease emergence, and not just the effects of climatic variables on parasite biology. At the same time, excessive complexity is ill-suited to useful farm-level decision support. Dealing effectively with the devil of detail' in this area will depend on finding the right balance, and will determine our success in applying science to climate change adaptation by farmers.","Univ Bristol, Sch Vet Sci, Langford BS40 5DU, North Somerset, England",University of Bristol,"Morgan, ER (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Vet Sci, Langford House, Langford BS40 5DU, North Somerset, England.",eric.morgan@bristol.ac.uk,,"Morgan, Eric Rene/0000-0002-5999-7728",EU [288975 GLOWORM],EU(European Commission),"I am grateful for funding from EU FP7 project 288975 GLOWORM, and for stimulating discussions with partners in the Parasol and Gloworm projects, including Jan van Dijk, as well as Richard Wall, Jan van Wyk, and our graduate students.",,30,12,12,0,29,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1466-2523,1475-2654,,ANIM HEALTH RES REV,Anim.

Butterflies from cooler climates have a lower mid-infrared emissivity, which limits heat losses to surroundings, and butterflies from warmer climates have a higher mid-infrared emissivity, which enhances radiative cooling. The mid-infrared emissivity showed no correlation with other investigated climatic factors. Phylogenetic independent contrasts analysis indicates the microstructures of butterfly wings may have evolved in part to regulate mid-infrared emissivity as an adaptation to climate, rather than as phylogenetic inertia. Our findings offer new insights into the role of microstructures in thermoregulation and suggest both evolutionary and physical constraints to butterflies' abilities to adapt to climate change.","[Krishna, Anirudh] Intel Corp, Hillsboro, OR 97124 USA; [Krishna, Anirudh; Nie, Xiao; Lee, Jaeho] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Briscoe, Adriana D.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",Intel Corporation; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Krishna, A (corresponding author), Intel Corp, Hillsboro, OR 97124 USA.;Krishna, A; Lee, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",akbharad@uci.edu; jaeholee@uci.edu,"Briscoe, Adriana/E-8963-2010","Briscoe, Adriana/0000-0001-8514-4983",National Science Foundation [IOS-1656260]; Henry Samueli School of Engineering at UCI; Hellman Faculty Fellowship,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Henry Samueli School of Engineering at UCI; Hellman Faculty Fellowship,A.K. and X.N. thank the members of the Nano Thermal Energy Research laboratory for reading the manuscript.

A comprehensive clarification of the causes of cropland expansion is conducive to the adoption of appropriate actions to intervene and adapt to climate change, support rational land use, and balance ecosystem services. Using the Pumqu River Basin (PRB) in the Tibetan Plateau as the study area, we constructed a conceptual model that emphasizes the role of households and explored the causes of cropland expansion based on field survey data. Our results indicate that households' perception of climate change, families' non-agricultural income, the numbers of agricultural labor force, and the population pressure faced were the causes of cropland expansion in the PRB.

Policymakers and officials initially imagined the challenge to be principally a technical one of accounting for uncertainty in risk assessments and insurance tools. But the conduct and outcome of their efforts reflected instead politically charged normative tensions related to the temporality of climate ethics. NFIP policyholders, constituted as a 'risk public' by the instruments of flood insurance, exposed these tensions in mobilizations targeting practices of risk governance.

However, there is limited understanding of how crop insurance participation can potentially affect the adverse crop yield impacts of warming (or extreme heat). This study specifically examines whether crop insurance participation influences the impact of extreme heat on yield risk (i.e. yield variance, skewness and kurtosis). We utilise a parametric moment-based method and county-level panel data to evaluate how crop insurance participation affects the relationship between warming temperatures and the moments of crop yield distributions. Our results indicate that the yield risk increasing effect of warming is further magnified under high levels of crop insurance participation. This result still holds even when allowing for long-run adaptation (although the crop insurance effect tends to be weaker in this case). In general, our results indicate that not only does crop insurance participation adversely impact mean yields under climate change, it also influences the extent by which warming affects yield variability over time. This supports the notion that crop insurance can serve as a disincentive for climate change adaptation in agriculture.","[Wang, Ruixue; Rejesus, Roderick M.; Aglasan, Serkan] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Campus Box 8109,4340 Nelson Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Rejesus, RM (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Campus Box 8109,4340 Nelson Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",rmrejesu@ncsu.edu,,,United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA) Hatch Project [NC02696],United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA) Hatch Project,The work of Rejesus on this article was supported in part by United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA) Hatch Project No. NC02696.,,44,7,7,18,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

Serious games are gaining increasing prominence in environmental communication research, but their potential to form an integrated part of participatory research approaches is still strikingly understudied. This is particularly the case for applications of interactive digital formats in research on environmental challenges of high complexity, such as climate adaptation, which is a specifically suitable case as it involves complex interaction between climate systems and society, but where the response also involves trade-offs with potentially negative - maladaptive - outcomes. Intervention. This article presents the Maladaptation Game, which was designed to facilitate dialogue about potential negative outcomes of agricultural climate adaptation. Methods. We conducted test sessions with agricultural stakeholders in Finland and Sweden, and analysed quantitative and qualitative, audio-recorded and transcribed, material for opportunities and challenges related to dialogues, engagement, interactivity and experienced relevance. Results. The qualitative analysis of recorded dialogues shows that the Maladaptation Game has potential to support dialogue by challenging players to negotiate between options with negative outcomes. The gameplay itself presents opportunities in terms of creating engagement with options that provoke disagreement and debates between players, as well as interactivity, that players reflected upon as quick and easy, while challenges were related to the experienced relevance, in particular the options provided in the game, and its general framing. Conclusions. The results indicate a need for complementary approaches to this type of game but also suggest the importance of moderation when the game design is aimed at creating dialogue around a complex environmental challenge such as agricultural climate adaptation.","[Neset, Tina-Simone; Navarra, Carlo; Asplund, Therese; Glaas, Erik; Wibeck, Victoria] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden; [Neset, Tina-Simone; Navarra, Carlo; Asplund, Therese; Glaas, Erik; Wibeck, Victoria; Linner, Bjorn-Ola] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Linkoping, Sweden; [Wirehn, Lotten] Linkoping Univ, Linkoping, Sweden; [Linner, Bjorn-Ola] Linkoping Univ, Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden; [Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Urban Environm Policy, Helsinki, Finland; [Kayhko, Janina] Univ Helsinki, Urban Environm Policy Res Grp, Helsinki, Finland",Linkoping University; Linkoping University; Linkoping University; Linkoping University; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Neset, TS (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",tina.neset@liu.se; sirkku.juhola@helsinki.fi; lotten.wirehn@liu.se; janina.kayhko@helsinki.fi; carlo.navarra@liu.se; therese.asplund@liu.se; erik.glaas@liu.se; Victoria.wibeck@liu.se; bjorn-ola.linner@liu.se,"Linnér, Björn-Ola/AAL-2040-2020; Käyhkö, Janina/AAW-6163-2021; Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Käyhkö, Janina/0000-0003-0904-5857; Wirehn, Lotten/0000-0003-4014-1441; Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282; Neset, Tina-Simone/0000-0003-1151-9943; Navarra, Carlo/0000-0001-9892-8875",Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2013-1557]; Linkoping University as part of the Swedish Bibsam consortium,Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Linkoping University as part of the Swedish Bibsam consortium,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by the Swedish Research Council FORMAS (under Grant No. 2013-1557).

Adaptation to flooding is a major avenue through which society designs our living spaces to cope with the threat of flooding. Within this context, there are many studies investigating the employment of property-level adaptation for households and the related decision-making process as both climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction measures. By comparison, businesses are a relatively neglected topic of study. This is a limitation, as businesses are important community members and suffer from a large share of flood losses, and their lack of preparedness undermines social resilience against climate change. Using survey data from the 2013 German flood, we compare the implementation of property-level adaptation measures by households and businesses. We further investigate whether similar factors drive adaptive behaviour using a structural statistical model of a hybrid of two socio-psychological models: the protection motivation theory (PMT) and the protective action decision model (PADM). Based on the empirical analysis of the combined framework, the main conclusion is that there is no great difference between the households and businesses in terms of their pre-disaster adaptation decision processes. However, companies did have a lower level of overall preparedness than households. This implies that results of decision-making from one stakeholder set may be applicable elsewhere, e.g., in developing agent-based models of disaster risk reduction or climate change adaptation. However, most of the businesses studied were SMEs and may not be representative of larger businesses, where decision-making processes are increasingly formalized. This is important, since small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are often not well prepared against flooding or other climate change impacts.","[Hudson, Paul] Univ York, Dept Environm & Geog, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Hudson, Paul; Bubeck, Philip; Thieken, Annegret H.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany",University of York - UK; University of Potsdam,"Hudson, P (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Environm & Geog, York, N Yorkshire, England.;Hudson, P (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany.",phudson@uni-potsdam.de,"Hudson, Paul/GPS-9348-2022; Thieken, Annegret Henriette/B-1946-2017; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Hudson, Paul/0000-0001-7877-7854; Thieken, Annegret Henriette/0000-0001-7068-2615; ","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [GRK2043/1, GRK2043/2]; German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [13N13017]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),The presented work was partly developed within the framework of the research training group Natural Hazards and Risks in a Changing World (NatRiskChange) funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; GRK2043/1 and GRK2043/2).

In Ghana, the government has in the last decade emphasized the provision of subsidized mechanized ploughing services to farmers alongside a rapidly growing private sector tractor service market. While mechanized technology adoption rates have increased rapidly, the deployment of these technologies has been without critical analysis of the impacts on production patterns and local agrarian systems. This paper examines the distributional impacts of agriculture mechanization on cropping patterns and farm sizes of smallholder farmers in northern Ghana using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques, and semi-structured interviews with smallholder farmers (n=60). Specifically, comparative analysis of the field sizes and cropping patterns of participant farmers prior to and after the adoption of mechanized technologies was conducted. In-depth interviews were used to contextualize the experiences of smallholder farmers toward understanding how mechanization may be impacting traditional agriculture. Our findings reveal a mechanization paradox in which farm sizes are expanding, while cropping patterns are shifting away from traditional staple crops (pearl millet and sorghum bicolor) to market-oriented crops (maize, rice and groundnuts). This transition we argue, has adverse implications on the cultural dimension of food security, the organization of social life, and climate change adaptation. We recommend a retooling of the current agricultural policy focus to ensure context sensitivity for a more robust battle against food insecurity.","[Kansanga, M.; Kpienbaareh, D.; Atuoye, K.; Antabe, R.; Luginaah, I.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON, Canada; [Andersen, P.] Univ Bergen, Dept Geog, Bergen, Norway; [Mason-Renton, S.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Sano, Y.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Sociol, London, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Bergen; University of British Columbia; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Kansanga, M (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON, Canada.",mkansang@uwo.ca,"Kpienbaareh, Daniel/ABD-1959-2020; Atuoye, Kilian Nasung/I-4602-2019","Atuoye, Kilian Nasung/0000-0002-6003-980X; Mason-Renton, Sarah/0000-0003-2959-0633; Kpienbaareh, Daniel/0000-0002-3167-8151; Kansanga, Moses Mosonsieyiri/0000-0001-8566-396X",,,,,74,50,50,4,67,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,1745-2627,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

In the complex structure of climate finance, the AF attracts attention as it differs from other funds in several aspects. As an exception from other United Nations (UNs) climate funds, AF has not been recognised as an operating entity of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention. AF is also an unprecedented example under the Convention of a fund serving in parallel two decision-making bodies (CMP and CMA) under two agreements (Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement) ratified by nonoverlapping sets of parties; with a Fund Board elected by both bodies collectively. AFs funding source is specific, it was designed to be financed from shares of the proceeds of sales of certified emission reduction units (CERs) generated by Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects but since 2012 there is a limited possibility of offsetting the emissions with CERs under the EU emissions trading system (ETS). For several years Parties were unable to agree the operating principles and procedures of a new mechanism established in article 6(4) of the Paris Agreement, which will resemble CDM, and would constitute a source of funding for the AF. Once this source of funding is available, the AF would cease to serve the Kyoto Protocol. Despite the above problems, AF was seen as a good example of how future climate funding can be designed. We examine the evolution of the above legal problems, including the most recent decisions and conclusions adopted during Conference of Parties (COP)25 in Madrid.","[Mordasewicz, Karolina] Natl Res Inst, Inst Environm Protect, Warsaw, Poland; [Kowalczyk, Marcin] Minist Finance, Warsaw, Poland",Institute of Environmental Protection - National Research Institute,"Mordasewicz, K (corresponding author), Natl Res Inst, Inst Environm Protect, Warsaw, Poland.",Karolina.Mordasewicz@ios.edu.pl; erilrae@gmail.com,,,Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment,Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment,"The article was written as part of the Project The knowledge base on climate change and adapting to climate change impacts, together with knowledge dissemination channels, to strengthen economic, environmental and societal resilience as well as to support management of extraordinary risks associated with climate change, co-financed from the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment 2014-2020.

This paper takes an integrated approach to compare the climate adaptation and disaster resilience policies and plans of local governments of two low-lying coastal cities in Australia to understand whether (and how) local governments can make a difference. The findings indicate that local governments can significantly contribute to building resilience and adapting to climate-related hazards, however a number of factors such as the attitudes of local governments on climate change, environmental activism, and the recent experiences of climate-related disasters are instrumental for shaping a better local response. Local action also needs to be supported by a more integrated approach by all levels of government.","[Torabi, Elnaz] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Australia; Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Gold Coast, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Torabi, E (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Australia.",elnaz.torabi@griffithuni.edu.au,"Dedekorkut-Howes, Aysin/V-5636-2018; Torabi, Elnaz/AAA-3814-2020; Torabi, Elnaz/V-3585-2018","Dedekorkut-Howes, Aysin/0000-0002-3844-4796; Torabi, Elnaz/0000-0003-4578-8199; Torabi, Elnaz/0000-0003-4578-8199",,,,,108,24,24,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0811-1146,1476-7244,,URBAN POLICY RES,Urban Policy Res.,,2017,35,3,,,,,312,332,,10.1080/08111146.2017.1294538,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08111146.2017.1294538,,,21,Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,FB8HX,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000406381000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Planning and implementing climate adaptation is often left to local authorities and is fraught with the challenge of negotiating with multiple stakeholders holding differing interpretations of climate change. In such a space, local media has a critical role in communicating these differing perspectives within communities. In this article we explore the central role of a local newspaper in shaping public debate over the implementation of a climate adaptation plan in a coastal region of Australia. Rather than providing an arena for public discussion and constructive debate, we find that the newspaper adopted a clear position rejecting the need for changes in planning for anticipated climate impacts. We use the case study to explore how media discourse contributes to (i) the construction of an antagonistic debate undermining climate science, and (ii) strengthening the hegemony of economic value and property rights. In response, we suggest shoring up political alliances for climate change, including in the local media, as a basis for social change.","[Bowden, Vanessa; Nyberg, Daniel] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle, NSW, Australia; [Wright, Christopher] Univ Sydney, Sydney Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Newcastle; University of Sydney,"Bowden, V (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.",vanessa.bowden@newcastle.edu.au,"Nyberg, Daniel/ABE-2371-2021","Nyberg, Daniel/0000-0002-7144-1343; Wright, Christopher/0000-0001-8624-9605; Bowden, Vanessa/0000-0002-6642-2826",,,,,62,4,4,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

We begin by summarising the relationships between glaciers and climate change, highlighting impacts of glacier retreat, before considering tourism in glaciated areas. We explore ways in which some locations are adapting to changing environmental conditions and examine tactics that have been used to manage the effects of deglaciation on tourism, speci?cally in the European Alps.

The results show that households face considerable challenges in adapting to climate change. While many households have made small adjustments to their farming practices in response to climate change (in particular, changing planting decisions), few households are able to make more costly investments, for example in agroforestry or irrigation, although there is a desire to invest in such measures.

Climate change adds uncertainty about fish stock productivity, migratory patterns, trophic interactions and vulnerability of fish populations to fishing pressure. Fishery governance has to address additional uncertainty from climate change in both the system being governed and the governance systems. The case studies reveal governance issues that indicate adaptation will involve more flexible fishery management regimes, schemes for capacity adjustment, catch limitation and alternative fishing livelihoods for fishers. Where fishery governance systems have been less developed, fisheries are less able to adapt to climate change impacts.

The study uses a multinomial endogenous switching regression model to deal with selection bias and farmer heterogeneity. The results show that households adopting CSA enjoy higher welfare benefits than non-adopter households. Households experience a higher welfare impact (lower monetary and multidimensional poverty rate) when CSA and non-farm employment are adopted simultaneously.

For public policy sectors, the concept of transformative governance brings attention to their capacities for supporting and engaging in such governance. While much adaptation research and practice informs technical and structural understandings of these capacities (e.g., governance arrangements, learning systems and adaptation planning), most of this research (and practice) has ignored less formal, yet equally important dimensions of public administration and governance. Institutional scholarship highlights that dominant norms, beliefs, and philosophical ideas underpin how policy sectors structure their policy responses and engagement in governance. Discursive Institutionalism suggests that examining a sector's dominant discourse can provide insights into these institutional logics. This paper therefore argues that understanding a policy sector's institutional logics is a crucial part of working toward enabling transformative governance of adaptation. This argument is developed through a case study of the institutional logics operating in the fire management policy sector of Victoria, Australia, and the potential influence of these logics on that sector's capacities to engage in transformative governance. Findings suggest this sector's institutional logics may currently constrain its capacities to engage in transformative governance and highlight the need for greater attention to socioinstitutional dimensions of public administration to help catalyze transformative governance of (and for) adaptation.","[Bosomworth, Karyn] RMIT Univ, Climate Change & Resilience Grp, Ctr Urban Res, GPO Box 2476,3001E, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Bosomworth, K (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Climate Change & Resilience Grp, Ctr Urban Res, GPO Box 2476,3001E, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",karyn.bosomworth@rmit.edu.au,"Bosomworth, Karyn/A-6435-2016","Bosomworth, Karyn/0000-0001-9907-0858","Bushfire Co-Operative Research Centre, Melbourne, Australia","Bushfire Co-Operative Research Centre, Melbourne, Australia(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme)","Bushfire Co-Operative Research Centre, Melbourne, Australia",,97,15,15,3,22,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

The paper examines such technologies and underlying rationalities in a multi-level context, in three European countries that represent different stages of adaptation policy development: the UK, Finland and Sweden. Drawing upon policy documents and interviews at different levels, the paper illustrates differences in technologies of government for adaptation between the relatively 'regulative' UK state system and Finland and Sweden's traditional legalistic and welfarist systems. The study illustrates that, while the treatment of adaptation as an issue on a national level coheres with national rationalities, local and regional levels show a diversity in the development of bottom-up adaptation technologies.","[Keskitalo, E.

The observed hottest day (d), 5 d, and 30 d period of 2018 and the 5 d period with the warmest nights had return periods of 5-15 years for 1950-2018. The warmest night and the maximum 30 d average nighttime temperature were more unusual with return periods of >30 years. Anthropogenic climate change since 1850 has made all these high-temperature extremes more likely. Higher risk ratios are found for experiments from the CMIP6-generation global climate model HadGEM3-GA6 compared to those from the very-large ensemble system weather@home. Between them, the best estimates of the risk ratios for daytime extremes range between 1.2-2.4, 1.2-2.3, and 1.4-4.0 for the 1, 5, and 30 d averages. For the corresponding nighttime extremes, the values are higher and the ranges wider (1.5- >50, 1.5-5.5, and 1.6- >50). The short-period nighttime extremes were more likely in 2018 than in 2017, suggesting a contribution from year-to-year climate variability to the risk enhancement of extreme temperatures due to anthropogenic effects. Climate projections suggest further substantial increases in the likelihood of 2018 temperatures between now and 2050, and that towards the end of the century every summer might be as hot as 2018. Major negative impacts occurred, especially on rural sectors, while transport and water infrastructure alleviated most impacts by implementing costly special measures. Overall, Scotland could cope with the impacts of the 2018 heatwave. However, given the likelihood increase of high-temperature extremes, uncertainty about consequences of even higher temperatures and/or repeated heatwaves, and substantial costs of preventing negative impacts, we conclude that despite its cool climate, high-temperature extremes are important to consider for climate change adaptation in Scotland.","[Undorf, S.; Allen, K.; Hagg, J.; Metzger, M.

This commitment is legally backed by the Native Vegetation Protection Law (NVPL), which defines the situations in which landowners must recover native vegetation in their land. In this paper, we discuss the role of land use compliance as a driver for adaptation in the Brazilian Atlantic forest domain based on the case of the State of Rio de Janeiro. We used high resolution satellite imagery (5 m pixel) to map the state's land use and land cover, delineate Areas of Permanent Preservation and calculate the environmental debt, i.e. the areas required for restoration in order to comply to the NVPL. We also related the distribution of the environmental debt to the socioeconomic conditions of the municipalities and examined potential funding sources for economic incentives to enhance feasibility of restoration in private lands. The state has 31% of native vegetation cover, and an environmental debt of 412,876 ha, correlated to Human Development Index (R = -0.2952, p = 0.0043) and vulnerability to poverty (R = 0.3711, p = 0.0003). The north-northwestern region hosts the hotspots both for environmental debt and vulnerability to poverty, therefore it should constitute a priority target for environmental and social policies. Compliance to this large environmental debt to abide to the regulatory policy NVPL will demand incentive mechanisms. Oil royalties are a potential funding source for programs of payment for ecosystem services, as 3% of those annual revenues could pay the restoration of 39% of the state's environmental debt per year over 20 years. Thus, policy mixes that combine existing regulatory and incentive mechanisms should ensure low-cost landscape restoration in tandem with new job opportunities in a restoration chain, and might represent a significant opportunity for the State of Rio de Janeiro.","[Rezende, Camila Linhares; Fraga, Joana Stingel; Sessa, Juliana Cabral; Pinto de Souza, Gustavo Vinagre; Scarano, Fabio Rubio] Fundacao Brasileira Desenvolvimento Sustentavel, Rua Engenheiro Alvaro Niemeyer 76, BR-22610180 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Rezende, Camila Linhares; Scarano, Fabio Rubio] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Caixa Postal 68020, BR-21941970 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Rezende, Camila Linhares] Inst Estadual Ambiente, Diretoria Biodiversidade & Areas Protegidas, Av Venezuela 110,2 Andar, BR-20081312 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Fraga, Joana Stingel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Dept Geog, Rua Marques de Sao Vicente 225,Sala 411-F, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Assad, Eduardo Delgado] Embrapa Informat Agr CNPTIA, Av Andre Tosello 209, BR-13083886 Campinas, SP, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA),"Rezende, CL (corresponding author), Fundacao Brasileira Desenvolvimento Sustentavel, Rua Engenheiro Alvaro Niemeyer 76, BR-22610180 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",clrezende@fbds.org.br,"Scarano, Fabio Rubio/F-6620-2012; BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/AAC-9538-2021; Linhares Rezende, Camila/N-4809-2015","Scarano, Fabio Rubio/0000-0003-3355-9882; BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/0000-0002-3614-9910; Assad, Eduardo/0000-0003-2372-3685; Linhares Rezende, Camila/0000-0002-8552-8677",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES); State Environmental Institute (INEA),Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); State Environmental Institute (INEA),"The data analyzed in this study were partially collected under the Project for Supporting the Implementation of the Environmental Rural Registry (CAR), developed by the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development (http://www.fbds.org.br).

Statements of patients from geriatrics, internal medicine, psychiatry, and surgery (N = 25) of a German tertiary care hospital were analyzed using semi-structured interviews and the framework method. Areas of future adaptation were elaborated in joint discussions with transdisciplinary experts. Concerns included the foresight of severe health problems. The requested adaptations comprised the change to a patient-centered care, infrastructural improvements including air conditioning, and adjustments of the workflows. Guidelines for the behavior of patients and medical services appropriate for the climatic conditions were demanded. The patient-centered agenda for adaptation includes the steps of partnering with patients, reinforcing heat mitigation, better education for patients and medical staff, and adjusting work processes. This is the first study demonstrating that hospital patients are gravely concerned and expect adjustments according to climate change. Since heat is seen as a major risk by interviewees, the fast implementation of published recommendations is crucial. By synthesizing inpatients' expectations with scientific recommendations, we encourage patient-centered climate change adaptation. This can be the start for further collaboration with patients to create climate change resilient hospitals.","[Lenzer, Benedikt; Hoffmann, Christina; Hoffmann, Peter] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Inst Lab Med Clin Chem & Pathobiochem, Augustenburger Pl 1, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Lenzer, Benedikt; Hoffmann, Christina; Hoffmann, Peter] Free Univ Berlin, Augustenburger Pl 1, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Lenzer, Benedikt; Hoffmann, Christina; Hoffmann, Peter] Humboldt Univ, Augustenburger Pl 1, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Muller-Werdan, Ursula] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Geriatr, Hindenburgdamm 30, D-12200 Berlin, Germany; [Muller-Werdan, Ursula] Free Univ Berlin, Hindenburgdamm 30, D-12200 Berlin, Germany; [Muller-Werdan, Ursula] Humboldt Univ, Hindenburgdamm 30, D-12200 Berlin, Germany; [Muller-Werdan, Ursula] Protestant Geriatr Ctr Berlin, D-13347 Berlin, Germany; [Rupprecht, Manuel; Witt, Christian; Liebers, Uta] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Inst Physiol, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Rupprecht, Manuel; Witt, Christian; Liebers, Uta] Free Univ Berlin, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Rupprecht, Manuel; Witt, Christian; Liebers, Uta] Humboldt Univ, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Herzig, Cornelius; Liebers, Uta] Evangelische Lungenklin Berlin Buch, Dept Pneumol, Lindenberger Weg 27, D-13125 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin,"Lenzer, B (corresponding author), Charite Univ Med Berlin, Inst Lab Med Clin Chem & Pathobiochem, Augustenburger Pl 1, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.;Lenzer, B (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Augustenburger Pl 1, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.;Lenzer, B (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Augustenburger Pl 1, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.",benedikt.lenzer@charite.de; christina.hoffmann2@charite.de; peter.hoffmann@charite.de; ursula.mueller-werdan@charite.de; manuel.rupprecht@gmx.net; christian.witt@charite.de; cornelius.herzig@jsd.de; uta.liebers@charite.de,"Hoffmann, Christina/AAZ-3794-2021","Hoffmann, Christina/0000-0003-2079-9123; Hoffmann, Peter/0000-0001-5940-9132; Herzig, Cornelius/0000-0002-9641-9476; Witt, Christian/0000-0002-3068-025X; Lenzer, Benedikt/0000-0003-2239-797X; Liebers, Uta/0000-0003-0315-4534; Muller-Werdan, Ursula/0000-0003-4440-8991",German Research Foundation (DFG); Open Access Publication Fund of Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin,German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publication Fund of Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin,The article processing fee was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Open Access Publication Fund of Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin.,,33,2,2,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Barriers to grassroots implementation of national and international policies are inexorably linked to local contexts, and in-depth understanding of these barriers is crucial in areas greatly impacted by climate change. This research applied an empirical mixed-methods approach to identify the barriers to implementing grassroots climate resilience in the Araucania Region in central-southern Chile. Data was collected in the form of expert interviews, 454 questionnaires of community members, community focus group discussions, and historical climate data for the region. The need to strengthen local-level implementation persists in the Araucania Region. Barriers to implementation include limited horizontal and multi-sectoral governance, and inadequate allocation of human and financial resources at the local level. The majority of community members expressed that they had some (71% n = 322) or a lot (10% n = 47) of climate change knowledge, with 91% (n = 409) indicating that their community is impacted by climate change, and half correctly perceived changes in several climate-related hazards. However, a misconception held by experts regarding community knowledge represents a barrier that limits opportunities for leveraging community willingness to take action, and impedes the inclusion of community priorities into national policies. Opportunities exist to strengthen grassroots climate resilience by adopting a coherent approach which links DRR and CCA/M to key community concerns in sustainable development. National and regional actors need to work closely with municipal governments to mobilize synergies and foster meaningful grassroots action.","[Banwell, Nicola; Hostettler, Silvia] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Cooperat & Dev Ctr, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Stehr Gesche, Alejandra; Rojas Vilches, Octavio] Univ Concepcion, Ctr Environm Sci EULA Chile, Concepcion, Chile; [Stehr Gesche, Alejandra; Rojas Vilches, Octavio] Univ Concepcion, Fac Environm Sci, Concepcion, Chile",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion,"Hostettler, S (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Cooperat & Dev Ctr, Lausanne, Switzerland.",silvia.hostettler@epfl.ch,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Banwell, Nicola/0000-0001-9983-7334; Rojas, Octavio/0000-0002-0228-9595","Swiss Bilateral Research Programs: Leading House for the Latin American Region, Seed Money Grant [SMG1710]","Swiss Bilateral Research Programs: Leading House for the Latin American Region, Seed Money Grant","This work was supported by the Swiss Bilateral Research Programs: Leading House for the Latin American Region, Seed Money Grant 2017 [SMG1710].

However, the question of how pilots' particular characteristics contribute to collaborative capacity building is as yet unanswered. A specific domain in which pilots are frequently used is the emerging domain of climate change adaptation. In the Netherlands, pilots are used to explore the possibilities of using a more risk-based approach to flood management. The traditional approach of preventing floods by dikes and dams is gradually being replaced by a risk-based approach called multilevel flood safety. In this approach, which is quite complex compared to the traditional prevention-oriented approach, flood risk management is based on three types of measures at different levels: preventing floods, adaptive spatial planning and emergency management The implementation of this new approach requires collaboration among different public authorities with different task orientations, legal competencies and resources. In 2013, three regional pilots were started to explore how this new concept could be applied. These pilots (in which collaboration was indispensable but also highly difficult because of the huge fragmentation of the policy arena) are analyzed in this paper to determine whether and how the specific functional context of a pilot project contributes to collaborative capacity building, which pilot characteristics contribute to this capacity, and which ones hinder its development.

Yet, minimal research has examined how governments can motivate community members to prepare for disasters (e.g., purchasing flood insurance or installing water barriers in homes for floods and hurricanes). Instead, studies have focused on how to communicate actions individuals should take during disasters, rather than before disasters. This study develops messages targeting social norms, which are promising approaches to motivate community members to adopt disaster risk preparedness and mitigation behaviors. Specifically, we developed a variety of messages integrating descriptive norms (i.e., what others do), injunctive norms (i.e., what others believe should be done), and a social norms-based fear appeal, or social disapproval rationale (i.e., a negative social result of [not] taking behaviors). Then, we tested these messages through two between-subject factorial online experiments in flood- and hurricane-prone U.S. states with adult samples (N = 2,286). In experiment 1 (i.e., purchasing flood insurance), the injunctive norms message using weather forecasters and the social disapproval rationale message significantly increased social norms perceptions, which in turn influenced behavioral intentions. In experiment 2 (i.e., installing water barriers), the injunctive norms message using weather forecasters, the injunctive norms message using neighbors, and the social disapproval rationale message significantly increased social norms perceptions, which in turn influenced mitigation intentions. However, the descriptive social norms message was not effective in increasing social norms perceptions. We provide some of the first empirical evidence on how organizations' risk communication can empower community members to prepare and mitigate the impact of disasters.","[Lim, JungKyu Rhys; Liu, Brooke Fisher; Seate, Anita Atwell] Univ Maryland, Dept Commun, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Lim, JR (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Commun, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jk.rhys.lim@gmail.com,"; Lim, Jungkyu Rhys/AAI-3972-2020","Fisher Liu, Brooke/0000-0003-1985-8050; Lim, Jungkyu Rhys/0000-0002-5006-2491","University of Maryland, College Park; National Science Foundation (NSF) [1635593]; Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); University of Colorado, Natural Hazard Center","University of Maryland, College Park; National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); University of Colorado, Natural Hazard Center","University of Maryland, College Park; University of Colorado, Natural Hazard Center; National Science Foundation (NSF), Grant/Award Number: 1635593; Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)",,103,1,1,12,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0272-4332,1539-6924,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,NOV,2022,42,11,,,SI,,2550,2568,,10.1111/risa.13957,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.13957,,JUN 2022,19,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",7W3HO,35701149,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000810711500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

By revealing these obstacles and opportunities, theories of procedural justice can help to identify procedural reforms and political strategies that advance the interests of vulnerable populations. An account of procedural justice is proposed that foregrounds the capability for political control over one's environment, defined as having the political power to influence adaptation decisions. While the variables shaping this capability in the politics of environmental injustice often interact in ways that reproduce environmental inequities, adaptation politics has the potential to produce more transformational outcomes. To illustrate this potential, differences between the politics of environmental injustice and the politics of climate adaptation are drawn on to sketch the basic features of a typology of vulnerable populations' political capabilities in the politics of climate adaptation, before highlighting the potential points for intervention.","[Holland, Breena] Lehigh Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Holland, Breena] Lehigh Univ, Environm Initiat, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",Lehigh University; Lehigh University,"Holland, B (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.;Holland, B (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Environm Initiat, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",brh205@lehigh.edu,"Holland, Breena/AAP-9362-2020",,,,,,57,66,66,2,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

To improve our understanding of what adaptation might involve in practice, we investigated how the managers of conservation areas in eastern England are considering climate change. We used a written questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to collect information from managers of a range of different conservation areas. Topics investigated include the impacts of climate change perceived to be of the greatest importance; adaptation goals being set; management actions being carried out to achieve these goals; sources of information used; and perceived barriers to taking action. We identified major themes and issues that were apparent across the sites studied. Specifically, we found ways in which adaptation had been informed by past experience; different strategies relating to whether to accept or resist change; approaches for coping with more variable conditions; ways of taking a large-scale approach and managing sites as networks; some practical examples of aspects of adaptive management; and examples of the role that other sectors can play in both constraining and increasing a conservation area's capacity to adapt. We discuss the relevance of these findings to the growing discussion in conservation about identifying adaptation pathways for different conservation areas and a potential progression from a focus on resilience and incremental change to embracing transformation. Though adaptation will be place-specific, we believe these findings provide useful lessons for future action in both England and other countries.","[Macgregor, Nicholas A.] Nat England, London SW1P 3JR, England; [van Dijk, Nikki] Atkins, Peterborough PE2 6FZ, Cambs, England",,"Macgregor, NA (corresponding author), Nat England, Nobel House,17 Smith Sq, London SW1P 3JR, England.",nicholas.macgregor@naturalengland.org.uk,,"Macgregor, Nicholas/0000-0002-7995-0230",Natural England,Natural England,"The authors would like to thank the site managers and other staff in the RSPB, Norfolk Wildlife Trust, Suffolk Wildlife Trust, Essex Wildlife Trust, the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire, National Trust and Natural England who took part in the study and provided other information, including many of the photographs.

The quantitative analysis of vegetation dynamics including climate and human activities is necessary to take appropriate actions to adapt to climate change and optimize vegetation distribution to mitigate it. This article integrates the relationship between climate, soil, socioeconomic factors and vegetation change using redundancy analysis (RDA) and partial redundancy analysis (pRDA): which also considers the time-lag effect of climate change. The correlation between vegetation and dynamics of the three periods at land-use and vegetation group levels in the 14 counties in Heihe River basin (HRB) of China was revealed. Results showed that the most important driving factor was groundwater depth and mean annual temperature with 15-year lag times. More variation of vegetation change was determined at land-use level (54.7%) than that at vegetation group level (42.0%): Climate change factors explained more variations than human activities both at vegetation group and land-use level, so did the time-lag effect. Land use planning not is only necessary in urban area but also in rural area in HRB. To increase resilience of agriculture, we suggest appropriate grazing management strategy. Meanwhile time-lag effects are quite important for better evaluating vegetation dynamics under climate change.","[Gao, N.

In an attempt to address this key limitation, citizens' assemblies are proposed in contributing to the inclusivity of climate services, enhancing their legitimacy and potential for societal uptake.

However, low-income households are especially less likely to move following disasters associated with less FEMA aid. We also find that disaster-affected migrants favor safer destinations.

The key components of this work involved village level meteorological data recording and reporting, formation and development of farmer climate clubs, on-farm participatory research testing a range of sowing and irrigation practices in response to weather patterns, and preparation and dissemination of agro-meteorological advisories. This research catalysed the development of the CLimate Information Centre concept (CLIC), further evolving into the development of an ICT platform of software and hardware that integrated the ACCA project results, biweekly agro-meteorological advisory bulletins and static agronomy information. An evaluation of the CLICs was undertaken based on a survey of 330 farmers in eight CLICs villages in Telangana state in southern India. The evaluation considered aspects such as the frequency of visits to CLICs, farmer perceptions on usefulness of information, any changes in knowledge and practice due to CLICs visits, and satisfaction with the CLICs as a source of information. On average 80 percent of the surveyed farmers had visited CLICs during the period. Farmers highlighted the important contribution of the agronomy videos they watched, access to agro-meteorological bulletins, information on pests, and weather forecast information. These contributed to various types of benefits they derived including an average cost savings of US$ 4 - 64 per hectare/year. While the current version of CLICs has shown promise and relevance for small holders, they need to be further developed into small business centres that function as a knowledge and provision hub for various agriculture inputs and providing climate information as an important service. This will serve as a self-sustaining financial model for CLICs rather than climate information as the only source of information service that is currently the case.","[Nidumolu, Uday] CSIRO Agr & Food, Adelaide Labs, Gate 4,Waite Rd, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia; [Adusumilli, Ravindra] WASSAN, Secunderabad, India; [Tallapragada, Chiranjeevi; Reddy, V.

It is argued that the division of land use between intensive agriculture/tree plantation and protected forest is increasing both livelihood- and environmental risk. Qualitative interviews and group discussion with upland villagers and local government staff in two districts of north and central Vietnam suggest that farmers are facing frequent loss and damage due to floods, storms and drought. Changing production patterns, together with the increase in climate-related hazards and stresses, is changing the character of vulnerability of upland communities. The study primarily explores village-level perspectives regarding impacts of hazards and stresses, ideas of how to reduce risk, along with how related policies and institutions influence local possibilities of risk reduction and adaptation. Our fieldwork results suggest that many villagers and local leaders see adaptation and risk reduction in terms of improved irrigation and in terms of access to land and forests for their livelihoods. The findings support arguments for more integration of agriculture and forestry land use, allowing for more flexibility in the development of upland livelihoods, with the aim of facilitating adaptation to climate change.","[Beckman, Malin] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Box 7012, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Beckman, Malin] Stockholm Environm Inst Asia, Stockholm, Sweden; [My Van Thi Nguyen] Univ Hue, Dept Social Sci, Hue City, Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Stockholm Environment Institute; Hue University,"Beckman, M (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Box 7012, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.;Beckman, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst Asia, Stockholm, Sweden.",malin.beckman@slu.se,,,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) [SWE-2010-187],Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),This research has been financed by a research grant from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) [grant number SWE-2010-187].,,30,8,8,0,44,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment of AHI are critical; however, relevant diagnostic and surveillance tools have received little attention. In this exploratory cross-sectional and diagnostic accuracy study, we evaluated three tools for use in the prehospital setting: 1) case definitions; 2) portable loggers to measure on-scene heat exposure; and 3) prevalence data for potential AHI risk factors. Methods: We enrolled 480 patients who presented to emergency medical services with chief complaints consistent with AHI in Ahmedabad, India, from April-June 2016 in a cross-sectional study. We evaluated AHI case definition test characteristics in reference to trained prehospital provider impressions, compared on-scene heat index measured by portable loggers to weather station measurements, and identified AHI behavioral and environmental risk factors using logistic regression. Results: The case definition for heat exhaustion was 23.8% (12.1-39.5%) sensitive and 93.6% (90.9-95.7%) specific. The positive and negative predictive values were 33.5% (20.8-49.0%) and 90.1% (88.5-91.5%), respectively. Mean scene heat index was 6.7 degrees C higher than the mean station heat index (P < 0.001), and station data systematically underestimated heat exposure, particularly for AHI cases. Heat exhaustion cases were associated with on-scene heat index = 49 degrees C (odds ratio [OR] 2.66 [1.13-6.25], P = 0.025) and a history of recent exertion (OR 3.66 [1.30-10.29], P = 0.014), while on-scene air conditioning was protective (OR 0.29 [0.10-0.85], P = 0.024). Conclusion: Systematic collection of prehospital data including recent activity history and presence of air conditioning can facilitate early AHI detection, timely intervention, and surveillance. Scene temperature data can be reliably collected and improve heat exposure and AHI risk assessment. Such data may be important elements of surveillance, clinical practice, and climate change adaptation.","[Ranadive, Nikhil] Univ Calif San Francisco Fresno, Dept Emergency Med, Fresno, CA USA; [Ranadive, Nikhil] Univ Washington, Ctr Hlth & Global Environm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Desai, Jayraj] GVK Emergency Management & Res Inst, Dept Emergency Med Leaming & Care Gujarat, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Sathish, L.

Coastal managers and planners face the challenge of helping communities to adapt to the changing coast. Traditionally hard engineering has been used to defend communities on the coast, but as this option becomes unsustainable and financially unviable, coastal managers are increasingly employing planning policy to mitigate the risk posed by coastal change. Zonation of coastal change areas and delineation of erosion extents, such as set-back lines, are used globally to restrict development in the coastal zone. In England there is policy in place to allow planning authorities to restrict certain development in areas expected to be affected by coastal change. This study aims to examine how coastal planning authorities in England have implemented coastal change adaptation policies, specifically Coastal Change Management Areas (CCMA). These areas should include sections of coast that will experience significant change over the next 100 years through erosion, accretion or flooding. Through an analysis of planning documents, we have found that since the policy was introduced in 2012, only 15% of coastal planning authorities have designated a CCMA, with just 5.7% of the coast of England designated as a CCMA. We have found that inadequate and ambiguous guidance has reduced the effectiveness of the national policy with coastal planning authorities unsure of which datasets to apply for delineating areas of coastal change. This has led to vulnerable coastal areas being omitted from CCMAs. The datasets that are available for mapping the coastal change areas are found to vary in erosion extent and do not account for expected increases in the rate of sea-level rise. We suggest that for coastal zonation and climate change adaptation policy to be successful, a robust methodology, including a classification of coastal typologies and their response to sea level rise, is needed to delineate the extent of erosion or coastal change over the next 100 years. Understanding and mapping coastal response to sea level rise will aid planning authorities to build more resilient communities on the coast.","[Kirby, J.

Publications addressing the developmental impact of migration and its role for climate-change adaptation often portray migrants as agents of change and highlight the positive potential of migration for resilience. In contrast, research on migration and labour relations indicates the increasingly precarious travel-, working-, and living conditions of migrants both domestic and international and the adverse effects on migrants' well-being. Our objective is to understand the interrelatedness of the seemingly disparate empirical evidence, which results from differences in both foci and socio-spatial scales in the analysis of migration and its impacts. To decipher the interlinkages between the two sides of migration and resilience, we propose a translocal approach, which systematically addresses socio-spatial dimensions and the simultaneity of mobility and situatedness of migrants and non-migrants across space. Our results show the interdependence of translocal connections (e.g. remittances), which reproduce migration motives, and the embeddedness of migrants at the place of destination a process that is socially stratified and thereby articulates the disparate socio-economic wealth levels of migrants' households of origin. We conclude that, both the type of embeddedness and the exposure to precariousness determine the extent to which their sojourn proves to be a risk or an opportunity for the migrants and their household of origin.","[Porst, Luise] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Bonn, Germany; [Sakdapolrak, Patrick] Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Sci, Vienna, Austria",University of Bonn; University of Vienna,"Porst, L (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Bonn, Germany.",lporst@uni-bonn.de,"Sakdapolrak, Patrick/AAT-6359-2021","Sakdapolrak, Patrick/0000-0001-7137-1552","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany [01LN1309A]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This article is based on research within the frame of the project Buildung Resilience through Translocality: Climate Change, Migration and Social Resilience of Rural Communities in Thailand (www.transre.org) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany,grant number 01LN1309A.

Design/methodology/approach This paper is derived from a toolkit that was produced for Oxfam Australia. Disasters and climate change are major drivers of poverty and significantly affect the communities that development programs of Oxfam Australia aim to assist. Recognising the importance of building its organisational capacity to address these risks, Oxfam Australia initiated and commissioned the production of a PCVA toolkit to support disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation programs; the production of the toolkit was led by the author. The methodology of producing the toolkit consisted of discussions with experts and a review of similar toolkits. Findings Details of the PCVA process and how to conduct one in a community setting are provided including PCVA concepts, briefing, logistics and management and principles of working with communities. Importantly, the different stages of conducting a PCVA are explained, and some selected tools are presented as illustrative examples. In conclusion, the importance of the PCVA considerations and principles are reaffirmed vis-a-vis the sensitivity and soft skills required in a low-income developing country setting. Originality/value The participatory development approach, which the toolkit follows, has been widely advocated for the past few decades and most non-governmental organisations involved in community development espouse this approach. Consequently, a wide range of participatory development toolkits have been developed, many of which relate to disasters and climate change. The PCVA toolkit discussed in this paper draws on the repertoire of toolkits already available and used over a long time. Nonetheless, effort was given to assembling a range of tools that were most suitable for the purpose of this particular PCVA toolkit. Instead of focussing on the tools, which are available from the freely downloadable toolkit and available in the public domain, in this paper, the PCVA process and its main principles are explained, and the key considerations to carry out an effective PCVA is discussed. Perhaps even more than the actual tools, these considerations and an understanding of the PCVA principles are significant because they underpin the utilisation of the toolkit.","[Ahmed, Iftekhar] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Design, Callaghan, NSW, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Ahmed, I (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Design, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.",Ifte.Ahmed@newcastle.edu.au,"Ahmed, Iftekhar/GPW-8881-2022","Ahmed, Iftekhar/0000-0001-5316-4584",,,,,13,4,4,1,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1759-5908,1759-5916,,INT J DISASTER RESIL,Int.

Coastal zones are considered to be significantly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The projected impacts of climate change in the metropolitan region of Bremen-Oldenburg, Germany (a coastal area), are, for example, rising sea level, salt water intrusion, temporary groundwater scarcity in the summer and increased (heavy) rainfalls. This paper uses an existing framework, the Adaptive Capacity Wheel (ACW), complemented by two additional dimensions: adaptation motivation and adaptation belief. The objectives were first, to assess the adaptive capacity of water governance in the study region, and second, to show how the ACW can be used as an approach and a communication tool with stakeholders to identify strengths and weaknesses. Based on this, a further objective was to discover what lessons and recommendations can be drawn that could help water experts and stakeholders in the future. The results show a high adaptive capacity and that the addition of the psychological dimensions was valuable. However, it is important to look closely at each dimension assessed by the ACW. The key recommendations are: to improve public participation; to ensure better coordination; to raise awareness; and to reduce the lack of political will to overcome adaptation barriers.","Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ & Law, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Grecksch, K (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ & Law, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",kevin.grecksch@uni-oldenburg.de,"Grecksch, Kevin/AAA-1826-2021","Grecksch, Kevin/0000-0002-1913-0134",German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF); KLIMZUG (Climate Change in the Regions),German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); KLIMZUG (Climate Change in the Regions),"This paper was written within the project entitled: 'Nordwest2050.

These responses are mostly shaped by the prevailing socio-cultural knowledge systems underpinned by resilience thinking in the face of change and adversity. Despite the increasing scientific and policy attention to peoples' perceptions of climatic changes and adaptive responses, there is still a lag in the more detailed probing and exploration of the local level demographic profiles related to the perceptions of and attitudes and responses to mitigation and adaptation strategies. This is of particular importance as the research, planning, and action concerning climate change mitigation and adaptation needs to be informed by and implemented within specific place contexts. Based largely on semi-structured interviews and complementary face-to-face questionnaires, this study focuses on southern Ecuador to identify people's stances on climate change mitigation and adaptation and to investigate further the perceptions of farmers on adaptation. The results indicate a tendency among urban residents towards a pro-mitigation stance. Those with a pro-adaptation stance are mainly the residents of rural areas and farmers. Farmers appeared to be highly adaptive to climatic changes and are led by a self-assessed ability to adapt. Their adaptive responses vary according to the geographical place of residence, type of farmer, and age. The findings offer local level empirical evidence for designing effective adaptation strategies.","[Iniguez-Gallardo, Veronica] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Ciencias Biol & Agr, Loja 1101608, Ecuador; [Tzanopoulos, Joseph] Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Kent Interdisciplinary Ctr Spatial Studies, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Canterbury CT2 7NR, Kent, England",Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja; University of Kent,"Iniguez-Gallardo, V (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Ciencias Biol & Agr, Loja 1101608, Ecuador.",mviniguez1@utpl.edu.ec,,,"Ecuadorian National Secretary of Higher Education, Science and Technology (SENESCYT); Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja","Ecuadorian National Secretary of Higher Education, Science and Technology (SENESCYT); Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja","The authors would like to thank the Ecuadorian National Secretary of Higher Education, Science and Technology (SENESCYT) for funding this project through the Scholarship Programme 2012.

Using interview data and participant observation, this study explores farm consolidation, patterns of consequent depopulation and weakened infrastructure, and how these realities operate in conjunction with disaster exposure to create conditions of reduced adaptive capacity, ultimately increasing vulnerability for small prairie communities.

The current study explores a gender role in household water management in the context of climate change in the Melamchi watershed area of Nepal. The study shows that decreasing water volume compounded with the geographical proximity of water sources determines workload women have to bear regarding distance cover, time spent, and frequency for water collection. Search for new water sources is potential risk perceived by women, whereas scarcity of household water is the apparent perceived risk at the community level. Climate change effect is gradual and hence perceived as less important over other immediate problems by individual and community. Sensitization over awareness at individual, household, and community level is hence indispensable attitudinal and motivational capacity for climate change adaptation to increasing water stress borne by women.","[Shrestha, Shobha; Chapagain, Prem Sagar; Ghimire, Motilal] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Geog, Kathmandu 44618, Nepal",Tribhuvan University,"Shrestha, S (corresponding author), Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Geog, Kathmandu 44618, Nepal.",shova216@gmail.com,"Chapagain, Prem Sagar/HJA-1926-2022; Chapagain, Prem Sagar/AAI-5748-2020","Chapagain, Prem Sagar/0000-0001-7316-8769",Nepal Academy of Science and Technology; Climate Investment Funds,Nepal Academy of Science and Technology; Climate Investment Funds,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article is based on research financed under the Climate Change Research Grants program implemented by the Nepal Academy of Science and Technology.

Building an informed and collaborative process among stakeholders remains vital in minimizing climate risks and building climate-adaptive and resilient agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, stakeholders' involvement and collaboration in agriculture decision-making are framed by institutional, power, and resource dynamics, often ignoring vulnerable stakeholders most susceptible to climate shocks. These collaborative dynamics are less studied in the climate adaptation literature, especially in the context of Ghana and SSA. This study promotes stakeholder engagement and collaboration in climate-adaptive and conservation agriculture (CA) by examining the influence of and relationship dynamics among key stakeholders in the northern region of Ghana (NRG). Drawing from the normative stakeholder theory and literature on climate adaptation intervention, we use multiple qualitative research methods (e.g. brainstorming, semi-structured interviews, and focus group sessions) to profile and explore stakeholders' roles, interests, and collaboration in CA and adaptation interventions. Our findings suggest that collaborations in CA in these smallholder farming communities are often fragmented, providing few collaboration advantages to smallholder farmers. Where collaboration occurs, it is often characterized by redundancy or duplication of roles and functions performed by stakeholders, poor coordination among key government actors, or by conflictual relationships among non-governmental organizations (NGOs); relationships amongst stakeholders are often driven by conflicting interests and asymmetric power differentials. These findings suggest that measures to engage stakeholders must carefully consider aligning stakeholders' interests and addressing power differentials, which are necessary to minimize conflicts in collaborative governance arrangements for adaptation and CA. Key policy insights: Conservation agriculture (CA) creates resilient agricultural systems for enhanced food security and poverty alleviation. Stakeholder roles, interests, and collaborations should be identified to understand who should be included to establish a collaborative connection for adaptation planning. Policymakers should actively engage stakeholders, including smallholder farmers, in the design and implementation of climate adaptation planning and interventions. As the principal resource for adaptation planning and decision-making is the people themselves, engaging them will leverage their knowledge, experiences, and expertise for the design of effective adaptation policies and ensure effective implementation. Collaborative action involving stakeholders can promote effective action on climate change by fostering consensus and building local ability and expertise to collectively adopt adaptation measures.","[Yeleliere, Enoch; Antwi-Agyei, Philip] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Nyamekye, Andy Bonaventure] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Rome, Italy; [Boamah, Emmanuel Frimpong] Univ New York Buffalo, Just Inst Lab, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Buffalo, NY USA; [Boamah, Emmanuel Frimpong] Univ New York Buffalo, Community Global Hlth Equ, Buffalo, NY USA",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Yeleliere, E (corresponding author), Walkley House, Sheffield S6 2RZ, S Yorkshire, England.",enochyeleliere.ye@gmail.com,"Yeleliere, Enoch/GZM-4029-2022","Yeleliere, Enoch/0000-0003-3126-9021; Frimpong Boamah, Emmanuel/0000-0002-6608-9170; Antwi-Agyei, Philip/0000-0002-8599-474X; Nyamekye, Andy/0000-0002-3047-8596",,,,,77,0,0,8,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

The result is a regionalized map by variable. Finally, these maps are intersected, obtaining areas with a homogeneous hydroclimatic structure, because the variables have similarity in their variance structure. In the case study, 8 variables were evaluated for Colombia (9268 time series), obtaining as a result 26 hydroclimatic regions.

Climate finance has reached record levels, crossing the US$ half-trillion mark annually for the first time in 2017-18 (CPI, 2019). Action still falls far short of what is needed under a 1.5 degrees C scenario, however. Estimates include that US$ 180 billion will be needed annually for the period 2020-2030 (Global Commission on Adaptation, 2019), of which US $ 50 billion a year is necessary for Non-Annex countries1 to deliver their NDCs (UNEP, 2018). Adaptation finance is only a very small fraction (5%) of the total available climate finance, and financing for climate services and early warning systems needed to support adaptation is only a fraction of that. This paper analyses NDC adaptation priorities, the allocation of international funding, and the current status of countries' capacities to provide the climate services needed to support adaptation, using West Africa as a test case. We conclude that there is considerable potential for using such information to assess the degree to which adaptation programmes implemented with international funding are effectively addressing national adaptation priorities and improving priority adaptation outcomes, but that additional data, analysis and coordination would be needed to fully realize this potential.

This interdisciplinary study applied a participatory mixed-methods approach, co-creating climate change adaptation pathways with community and stakeholder input as a bottom-up task. The aims were to engage in a community dialogue (1) identifying assets and challenges within the natural and built environment based on community input, (2) utilizing a participatory mixed-methods approach to model and quantify selected hazards, and (3) transforming them into adaptation pathways visualized in a comprehensive master plan. The small-town of Ingleside on the Bay, Texas, served as a case study for this project, highlighting how sea-level rise and industrial activity challenge the community, its natural and cultural environment, and the infrastructure within. The outcomes identify anthropogenic vulnerability drivers and propose a concrete list of seven adaptation pathways based on community input.

This paper examines conservation agriculture (CA) from the perspective of: (i) increased yield and farm income, (ii) adaptation to heat and water stresses, and (iii) reduction in greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. The analyses and conclusions are based on the literature and evidences from a large number of on-station as well as farmers' field trials on CA in the cereal systems of IGP. Our analyses show that CA-based system substantially reduces the production cost (up to 23%) but produces equal or even higher than conventional system; thereby increasing economic profitability of production system. CA-based production systems also moderated the effect of high temperature (reduced canopy temperature by 1-4 degrees C) and increased irrigation water productivity by 66-100% compared to traditional production systems thus well adapting to water and heat stress situations of IGP. Our continuous monitoring of soil flux of CO2, N2O and CH4 revealed that CA-based rice-wheat systems emit 10-15% less GHGs than conventional systems. This is the first time that CA and its components are synthesized and analyzed from food security-climate change nexus. From this holistic analysis, we suggest that wide-scale promotion of suitable CA practices by integrating into national agriculture development strategy is a way forward to address food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation challenges faced by present agriculture.","[Sapkota, Tek B.; Jat, M.

Climate change, land use change, and increased exposure in hazard prone areas play a role in increasing pluvial flood risks. We describe a methodology for rapid probabilistic pluvial flood hazard mapping and risk assessments in urban environments developed for the Copernicus Climate Change Service Pluvial Flood Risk Assessment in Urban Areas demonstrator project for large computational domains. The methodology is designed to be flexible and robust enough to be adapted to other cities in Europe and elsewhere, and is composed of three main steps: (i) computation of the intensity-frequency relationship to express the depth of extreme hourly rainfall events at the urban scale; (ii) characterization of the pluvial flood hazard by means of raster-based flood modeling, and; (iii) estimation of the direct tangible damages at the building level for residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. Methods are tested for 20 cities across Europe and considering two infiltration rate scenarios. Spatial-explicit results at the urban-scale highlight the neighborhoods and sub-urban areas more adversely affected in terms of direct tangible damage to buildings and assets. Probabilistic risk assessment results indicate that Brussels, Antwerp, and London are the cities with higher expected annual damages per built-up area among the 20 cities considered in this study. These results can be useful for supporting the implementation of the Sendai Framework for DRR 2015-2030, for developing multi-hazard risk assessments, and for supporting the development of national climate change adaptation plans.","[Essenfelder, Arthur H.

These adaptations can still inform the design of contemporary regional architecture. In order to explore the relationship between traditional dwellings and climatic factors, we examine buildings in four provinces and cities in southwest China. A database was created using detailed data obtained from the literature on indicators of climatic factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation, temperature difference, wind speed, solar radiation) and architectural elements (e.g., roof slope and eave length). Thorough statistical analysis shows that (1) MPWM has the most significant correlation with the slope angle of traditional building roofs but is not recommended as a predictor in multivariate equations. (2) Temperature and wind speed were significant correlates of roof slope, and a multiple regression model dominated by AMT and AWS serves as a good predictor of roof slope. (3) Solar radiation was not correlated with roof slope but was the largest correlate of eaves length in traditional buildings. AMSR and AWS also dominantly affect eaves length in a regression relationship.

Amongst the many approaches of reducing the coastal vulnerabilities and achieving climate change adaptation, a potential solution is to improve risk governance through integrated coastal zone management. The coastal risk governance signifies not only the actions of the state but also of other stakeholders, especially the local communities. Community-based approaches have also for long been advocated for effective adaptation and mitigation against climate adversities. While human-nature interactions can significantly influence disaster risks, this research makes an attempt to understand various decisions and choices that a coastal rural community makes based on such interactions to mitigate and manage the climate-induced adversities. Through structured interviews, this research first identifies the significant domains that reflect on the prevailing human-nature interactions, after which the choice modelling technique is utilized to comprehend the community priorities for better climate risk governance, with a specific focus on coastal rural settlements of Katrenikona (Andhra Pradesh, India). The application of this methodology resulted in the formulation of a baseline for local coastal governance, which can be useful for informing various levels within local governments. The baseline consists of an assessment of the different community resilience domains derived based on the prevailing interactions of local communities with their surrounding ecological elements and measured by indicators of local coastal governance. The concept and method for measuring coastal risk governance based on community preferences are potentially replicable, and it can help to track the progress towards longer-term coastal management and local climate adaptation goals. At the same time, it can be turned into a self-evaluation tool to assist the local governments in reflecting on pertinent pathways involving community actions for effectively managing various climate risks and ecological impacts.","[Dakey, Shruthi; Joshi, Shreya; Deshkar, Sameer] Visvesvaraya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Architecture & Planning, South Ambazari Rd, Nagpur 440010, Maharashtra, India; [Sukhwani, Vibhas] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Media & Governance, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 2520882, Japan","National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur; Keio University","Joshi, S (corresponding author), Visvesvaraya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Architecture & Planning, South Ambazari Rd, Nagpur 440010, Maharashtra, India.",dakeyshruthi@gmail.com; shreyajoshi@students.vnit.ac.in; vibhassukhwani003@gmail.com; smdeshkar@arc.vnit.ac.in,"Dakey, Shruthi/M-9983-2017","Dakey, Shruthi/0000-0002-3741-3066; SUKHWANI, VIBHAS/0000-0002-5231-2722",,,,,56,0,0,3,5,"UNIV & NOVOM SADU, PRIRODNO-MATEMATICKI FAK",NOVI SAD,"TRG DOSITEJA OBRADOVICA 4, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",0354-8724,1820-7138,,GEOGR PANNONICA,Geogr.

Based on empirical evidence, the study simulates the thermal impact of completely retrofitting an existing building in a Southern African urban context with passively controlled, non-integrated RTGs under current and future climate change affected climatic conditions. The study concludes that the current greenhouse technologies used in South African rooftop farms provide limited thermal modulation capacity for farmers, as well as generally negatively affecting the thermal performance of the associated buildings. Simulating both highly and poorly insulated buildings reveal contrasting impacts on the indoor thermal environment, with a 0.73 degrees C decrease and 0.55 degrees C increase in mean temperatures, respectively. Conversely, the highly insulated simulation reveals an annual energy consumption increase of 3.5%, which progressively worsens under higher climate change induced temperatures.

Climate adaptation literature supports the idea that current global challenge coupled with projections for ongoing challenge requires a pro-active approach; this turn to climate adaptation for potential consideration or guidance is based on characteristics that the Covid-19 pandemic shares with climate change. Outdoor recreational professionals' review of a recent public survey and subsequent semi-structured interviews with this group were conducted to obtain outdoor recreation professionals' detailed perceptions on survey outcomes. Results show that the professionals confirm a rapid and significant increase in outdoor recreation participation. Further, professionals identified critical trends in the increase of new or inexperienced outdoor recreation participants. A positive and proactive list of implications emerged as themes of the interviews. A review and synthesis of the themes support the national goals for outdoor recreation in Sweden.

Using the case of the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority, Bangkok, this study demonstrates the application of the approach, which includes (a) identifying critical thresholds that impact the system's performance, (b) unearthing the system vulnerabilities through a stress test (scenario analysis), and (c) identifying feasible adaptation interventions. Through a stakeholder consultation process, it was found that streamflow, salinity, and turbidity are the key performance metrics of the water supply system. A series of stress tests to the system was conducted by adjusting input variables assuming a wide range of possible future climatic conditions. Frequency curves of the various input variables were developed to facilitate stakeholders' planning for impending risks and for improving the overall robustness of the water supply system. Based on the stress test results and past studies of the study area, the raw water source of the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority is expected to be more saline in the future with more frequent and severe low flow conditions, for which a number of adaptation actions were formulated and proposed. It is suggested to develop adaptation pathways that can address a range of expected impacts of future climatic conditions on the Bangkok water supply system.

In future, projected changes to the frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events could change weather-infrastructure risk profiles. Infrastructure owners and operators need to manage current weather impacts and put in place adequate plans to anticipate and adapt to changes in future weather risks, or mitigate the impacts arising from those risks. The assessment of the risk posed to railway infrastructure from current and future weather is dependent on a good understanding of the constituent components of risk: hazard, vulnerability, and exposure. A good understanding of the baseline and projected future risk is needed in order to understand the potential benefits of various climate change adaptation actions. Traditional risk assessment methods need some modification in order to be applied to climate change timescales, for which decisions need to be made under deep uncertainty. This review paper highlights some key challenges for assessing the risk, including: managing uncertainties; understanding weather-impact relationships and how they could change with climate change; assessing the costs of current and future weather impacts and the potential cost versus benefit of adaptation; and understanding practices and tools for adapting railway infrastructure. The literature reveals examples of progress and good practice in all these areas, providing scope for effective knowledge-sharing-across the railway infrastructure and other sectors-in support of infrastructure resilience and adaptation.

However, maize productivity is affected by changes in climate, such as increased temperature and variations in rainfall. These changes in climate require farmers to implement practices (adaptation strategies) in order to reduce the magnitude of crop losses. This study examined how the perceptions of maize farmers regarding climate change affect their choice of adaptation strategies. A mixed methods approach was adopted for the study. Data was collected by means of a survey of 386 maize farmers along with focus group discussions. Quantitative data were analysed with descriptive statistics, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multivariate probit regression, while qualitative responses were used to explain the findings. Results from the data analysis indicated that maize farmers employed 17 adaptation strategies in adapting to climate change. The most common strategies identified were change of planting days, crop diversification, use of resistant varieties, and monitoring weather forecasts on radio. Furthermore, the factors that influenced the choice of adaptation strategies by maize farmers in both zones were experience in farming, household size, and perceptions about the impact and intensity of climate change.","[Aidoo, Danley Colecraft; Boateng, Seth Dankyi; Freeman, Comfort Kudadjie; Anaglo, Jonathan Nicholas] Univ Ghana, Dept Agr Extens, POB LG 68, Legon, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Boateng, SD (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Dept Agr Extens, POB LG 68, Legon, Accra, Ghana.",sdboateng@ug.edu.gh,,"COLECRAFT AIDOO, DANLEY/0000-0003-1005-3627",USAID-GHANA/University of Ghana Institutional Capacity Building to Improve Agricultural Productivity and Food Security in the Context of Economic Policy Management in Ghana project,USAID-GHANA/University of Ghana Institutional Capacity Building to Improve Agricultural Productivity and Food Security in the Context of Economic Policy Management in Ghana project,This work was supported by USAID-GHANA/University of Ghana Institutional Capacity Building to Improve Agricultural Productivity and Food Security in the Context of Economic Policy Management in Ghana project.,,42,4,4,2,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,NOV,2021,7,11,,,,,,,e08307,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08307,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08307,,NOV 2021,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,WY5RN,34816030,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000719336100024,View Full Record in Web of Science

This essay outlines this more recent history, arguing that agricultural geography developed its own concepts and concerns, paralleling some of those within the wider discipline. It illustrates how in the past two decades attempts to examine changes occurring across the breadth of the agri-food system (from supply, to production, to consumption) have brought about a more issues-focused agricultural geography. There is discussion of the use of broad overarching concepts, which have conceived of changes to agriculture and the agri-food system in terms of episodic developments. This has seen recognition of different food regimes, acknowledging possible transitions from productivism to post-productivism to multifunctionality and perhaps neo-productivism. Having discussed these concepts, drawing extensively upon literature written in English, the essay then focuses on selected major problems or key issues to which agricultural geographers are currently contributing new insights, namely the closely related topics of food security, land grabs and adaptations to climate change.","[Robinson, Guy M.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Robinson, GM (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",guy.robinson@adelaide.edu.au,,"Robinson, Guy Martin/0000-0003-1652-6456",,,,,219,6,6,3,28,ASOCIACION ESPANOLES DE GEOGRAFIA,MADRID,"PINAR 25, MADRID, 28006, SPAIN",0212-9426,2605-3322,,B ASOC GEOGR ESP,Bol.

The countries in the North Sea Region need to continue to adapt if the associated risk is to be well-managed into the future. In addition to reducing flood risk, adaptation measures can bring development opportunities for those same places. These opportunities, however, are unlikely to be achieved through a 'defence only' paradigm, and instead a new approach is needed that simultaneously reduces risk and promotes liveable places, ecosystem health and social well-being. The building blocks of this new approach are promoted here and are based on an adaptation process that is collaborative and takes a whole-system, long-term perspective. The approach developed through the Interreg funded project, C5a, brings together governments, practitioners and researchers from across the North Sea to share policies, practices and the emerging science of climate change adaptation and enabling sustainable development. The new approach reflects a Cloud to Coast management paradigm and emerged through a combination of knowledge exchange and peer-to-peer learning across seven case studies. Central to the case studies was a maturity analysis of existing capabilities across the North Sea countries and their ability to adopt the new approach. This paper presents the results of this analysis, including the common challenges that emerged and the methods and examples of good practice to overcome them. Building upon these findings, the paper concludes by presenting four priority policy directions to support the uptake of the Cloud to Coast approach.","[Sayers, Paul] Sayers & Partners LLP, 24a High St, Watlington OX49 5PY, England; [Gersonius, Berry] ResilienServices, Pootstr 120, NL-2613 PN Delft, Netherlands; [Ozerol, Gul; Nugraha, Erwin] Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil, Fac Behav Management & Social Sci, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Schipper, Cor A.] Rijkswaterstaat, Minist Infrastruct & Water Management, Water, Verkeer Leefomgeving, Griffioenlaan 2, NL-3526 LA Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Gersonius, B (corresponding author), ResilienServices, Pootstr 120, NL-2613 PN Delft, Netherlands.",paul.sayers@sayersandpartners.co.uk; berry@resiliense.nl; g.ozerol@utwente.nl; e.nugraha@utwente.nl; cor.schipper@rws.nl,,"Nugraha, Erwin/0000-0002-5294-9934; Sayers, Paul/0000-0003-2160-1959",Interreg North Sea Region Programme [J-No.: 38-2-21-18],Interreg North Sea Region Programme,This research was co-funded by the Interreg North Sea Region Programme under funding number J-No.: 38-2-21-18.,,51,2,2,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,JUN,2022,11,6,,,,,,,950,10.3390/land11060950,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11060950,,,15,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2K5MY,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000816381000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we show that terrestrial carbon uptake (i.e. gross primary production) increased significantly from 1982 to 2011 using a combination of ground-based and remotely sensed land and atmospheric observations. Importantly, we find that the terrestrial carbon uptake increase is not accompanied by a proportional increase in water use (i.e. evapotranspiration) but is largely (about 90%) driven by increased carbon uptake per unit of water use, i.e. water use efficiency. The increased water use efficiency is positively related to rising CO2 concentration and increased canopy leaf area index, and negatively influenced by increased vapour pressure deficits. Our findings suggest that rising atmospheric CO2 concentration has caused a shift in terrestrial water economics of carbon uptake.","[Cheng, Lei; Zhang, Lu; Chiew, Francis H.

Results indicate that organizations were surprised climate was becoming more unpredictable, was directly affecting their operations, and was challenging long-held assumptions about climatic patterns. Our findings suggest that adaptation to climate change occurs predominantly as a reaction to climatic surprise, rather than a preemptive response to increasing awareness, and perceived uncertainty and risks as suggested by previous studies. Results also show that organizations are beginning to conceptually link changes in local climatic conditions to the global issue of climate change; though such linkages are not necessarily important to the inclusion of climate in the strategic environment.","[Haigh, Nardia] Univ Massachusetts, Coll Management, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Griffiths, Andrew] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Haigh, Nardia] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Management & Mkt, Boston, MA 02125 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University of Queensland; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Haigh, N (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Coll Management, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",Nardia.Haigh@umb.edu,,,,,,,39,31,31,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0007-6503,1552-4205,,BUS SOC,Bus.

Effective adaptation therefore depends on understanding the local context of vulnerability, which requires deliberative and participatory approaches to adaptation policy-making. But, how can local inclusiveness be achieved in the context of global environmental risk, and what sorts of institutions are needed? This article examines one avenue for the participation of vulnerable groups in adaptation policy-making: National Adaptation Programmes of Actions (NAPAs). Drawing on the case study of Bangladesh, this article shows that the adaptation paradox creates a tension between local and global definitions of climate change risk, affecting the legitimacy of participatory processes under the NAPA. I propose that early analysis and engagement of existing local institutional frameworks as a starting point for national adaptation planning is one possible entry point for meaningful local deliberation in global climate change policy-making processes.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Inst Dev Studies, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ayers, J (corresponding author), Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Inst Dev Studies, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,,,,,,49,95,95,0,28,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1526-3800,1536-0091,,GLOBAL ENVIRON POLIT,Glob.

This study assessed technical experts' and community groups' opinions about the importance of value-based prioritization considerations to provide more immediate guidance adaptation planning and decision making. The findings from four separate elicitation surveys demonstrated substantial consistency in value-based climate adaptation prioritization preferences for one type of vulnerable cultural heritage: historic buildings in coastal zones in the United States. In particular, the samples of cultural heritage professionals and members of community groups consistently rated spatial importance, uniqueness, and scientific value of historic buildings as very important considerations for climate adaptation prioritization decision-making. Also, consistently evaluated but of relatively low importance were considerations related to the cost of preservation and adaptation treatments, including previous investments.

High impervious cover exacerbates impacts of climate warming through urban heat island effects and of heavy rainfall by magnifying runoff and flooding. Concentration of human settlements along rivers and coastal zones increases exposure of people and infrastructure to climate change hazards, often disproportionately affecting those who are least prepared. Nature-based strategies (NBS), which use living organisms, soils and sediments, and/or landscape features to reduce climate change hazards, hold promise as being more flexible, multi-functional and adaptable to an uncertain and non-stationary climate future than traditional approaches. Nevertheless, future research should address the effectiveness of NBS for reducing climate change impacts and whether they can be implemented at scales appropriate to climate change hazards and impacts. Further, there is a need for accurate and comprehensive cost-benefit analyses that consider disservices and co-benefits, relative to grey alternatives, and how costs and benefits are distributed across different communities. NBS are most likely to be effective and fair when they match the scale of the challenge, are implemented with input from diverse voices and are appropriate to specific social, cultural, ecological and technological contexts.

Climate change effects contribute to sea level rise, floods, progression of the low water line and coastal erosion. This paper inventories the perception of local people, assesses and values main aspects of the livelihood damage caused by the tropical storms of the period 2008-2013 in three coastal communes of the Ky Anh District of the Ha Tinh Province in Central Vietnam. The communes were selected because the location of their coastal line is perpendicular to the storm itself, which made them prone to damage. The effects of increasingly extreme weather conditions on three communities in an area most affected by storms and floods on the local residents and their responses to these changing environmental conditions are analyzed and assessed. The results of questionnaires completed by randomly selected local inhabitants of these communes show that storms and related hazards such as flood, sea level rise and heavy rain are perceived as the most impacting climate change intensified phenomena on agriculture and aquaculture, livestock, household property and income. Opinions and measured data provided by the commune and district authorities allow estimating the total direct cost of the tropical storm at 1.56 million $US (The used conversion rate VND/$US is 21,730 when the research was conducted in 2014) during the period 2008-2013. The long-term costs of adaptation and social impact measures will be significantly higher. Details of the monetary figures allow identifying the physical and natural capital of the area as being most affected by the storm. Trend and cost analysis show that the total financial support for hazard prevention and management during 2014-2019 is estimated at 1.19 up to 1.32 million $US. Local stakeholders indicate that climate change adaptation should not be limited to technical measures such as strengthening dikes, but also should target planting protection forests and mangroves and land use planning. Financial support for the relocation policy, stakeholder involvement and integrating climate change adaptation in both the socioeconomic development master plan and local land use planning are also of importance.","[Thinh An Nguyen; Thanh Ngoc Nguyen; Tam Minh Pham; Tuyen Thi Luong; Ngoc Phuong Trinh] Hanoi Univ Nat Resources & Environm, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Thinh An Nguyen; Phai Van Vu; Hang Thi Thuy Nguyen] Vietnam Natl Univ, Univ Sci HUS, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Dung Anh Vu; Thanh Viet Nguyen; Lich Khac Hoang; Thanh Duc Vu] Vietnam Natl Univ, Univ Econ & Business UEB, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hai Trinh Le] Minist Nat Resources & Environm, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Tung Song Nguyen] Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Inst Human Geog, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hens, Luc] Vlaamse Instelling Technol Onderzoek, Boeretang 200, B-2400 Mol, Belgium",Vietnam National University Hanoi; Vietnam National University Hanoi; VITO,"Nguyen, TA (corresponding author), Hanoi Univ Nat Resources & Environm, Hanoi, Vietnam.;Nguyen, TA (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ, Univ Sci HUS, Hanoi, Vietnam.",anthinhhus@gmail.com,"Viet Nguyen, Thanh/ABA-8492-2020; Phạm, Tâm Minh/ABC-7221-2021","Viet Nguyen, Thanh/0000-0001-5829-6965; Phạm, Tâm Minh/0000-0002-5899-9537; Nguyen, Thi Thuy Hang/0000-0002-9977-4422","Vietnam National University, Hanoi [QGTD.13.10]","Vietnam National University, Hanoi","This study is in partial fulfillment of the key point project QGTD.13.10 funded by Vietnam National University, Hanoi.

Since such shifts in the climate, the substantial agriculture sector of Pakistan has been suffering widely from its drastic change. The present study is carried out in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province of Pakistan, to explore the perception of smallholder farmers related to climate change. Data is collected from 400 smallholder farmers of Malakand, Mardan and Swabi districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. This study expounds the perception of farmers and their farming adaptations to variations in climatic occurrence. Binary logistic regression was employed to discover the aspects that shape smallholder farmer's adaptation strategies. Our results depicted that the awareness and farm household's exploits methods for climate change adaptation were common throughout the study area. The main adaptation strategies carried out or executed by the smallholder farmers were irrigation, non-farm activities and early planting schemas. This research identified the barriers to climate change adaptation were lack of money, unavailability of required seed, nonexistence of market access, insecure land tenure system and shortage of information. The findings of the study recommend improving farmer's awareness and providing timely information about climate change. To improve farmer's well-being, adequate extension services and greater investment facilities are required to support farmers to sustain their livelihoods in the long run to cope with climate change.

Our study set out to investigate how members of the public evaluate policy options that aim at adaptation to climate change, and more specifically, to reduce the risk from flooding and low flows. We explored how hierarchically structured networks of values and beliefs shape public preferences and attitudes towards two different policies, insurance and a sustainable flood management scheme. In particular, we assessed the role of governance-related values such as efficiency, solidarity and sustainability that allow individuals to evaluate a policy option even if its outcomes are highly uncertain. To this end, we conducted a survey among members of the Scottish public (n = 1033). Findings from spike models and structural equation modelling suggested that there was general support for both policy measures, with a preference for the sustainable flood management approach. In particular, we found perceived severity of change, trust in government, governance-related values and fundamental values to inform attitudes and willingness to pay (WTP) for policy measures. More specific constructs, such as attitudes, were embedded in contexts of more abstract and situation-transcendent values. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper goes deeper into the question of destination choice and examines the role of climate change among the many factors affecting guest loyalty at Alpine winter destinations. The study uses an established destination choice model with choice sets, destination image and dynamic feedback loop. A qualitative online forum identifies factors influencing winter destination choice, followed by a quantitative survey which compares Alpine winter holidaymakers categorised as loyal, disloyal and undecided. The results demonstrate that climate change clearly influences destination choice, but snow sports are not the only affected attractors. Enjoyment of the natural environment and value for money are just as high on the list of guest motivators. This indicates that climate change adaptation measures such as snowmaking can be counterproductive to guest loyalty because they spoil the natural scenery and raise prices. The paper concludes with a recommendation for winter destinations to prioritize conservation of the natural environment and integrate more environmental protection measures into their management strategies.","[Bausch, Thomas] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Competence Ctr Tourism & Mobil, I-39031 Bruneck Brunico, Italy; [Humpe, Andreas] Munich Univ Appl Sci, Dept Tourism, D-80636 Munich, Germany; [Gossling, Stefan] Linnaeus Univ, Sch Business & Econ, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden; [Gossling, Stefan] Lund Univ, Dept Serv Management & Serv Studies, Box 882, S-25108 Helsingborg, Sweden; [Gossling, Stefan] Western Norway Res Inst, POB 163, N-6851 Sogndal, Norway",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Munich; Linnaeus University; Lund University,"Gossling, S (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Sch Business & Econ, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden.;Gossling, S (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Serv Management & Serv Studies, Box 882, S-25108 Helsingborg, Sweden.;Gossling, S (corresponding author), Western Norway Res Inst, POB 163, N-6851 Sogndal, Norway.",,"Humpe, Andreas/T-3903-2017","Humpe, Andreas/0000-0001-8663-3201","Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety [FKZ UM17163150]","Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety","This research was funded by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety FKZ UM17163150.",,64,9,9,15,71,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2019,11,15,,,,,,,4233,10.3390/su11154233,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11154233,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IW8FS,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000485230200238,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper the case is put forward for a critical engagement with social capital. There is need for an open debate on the conceptual and analytical traps and opportunities that social capital presents. The paper contrasts three schools of thought on social capital and uses a social capital lens to map out current and future areas for research on adaptation to climate change. It identifies opportunities for using social capital to research adaptive capacity and action within communities of place and communities of practice. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the role of social networks remains underexplored as there is only limited empirical evidence of their benefits, particularly for research on adaptation to climate change in developing countries. This paper provides a contribution to this field of research by examining how social networks foster livelihood diversification and resilience in a small rural community in northern Ghana. The study combines semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and a survey with a range of other participatory methods. The findings show that, people in the studied community have experienced a range of climatic changes with negative impacts on agriculture in the last three decades. These climatic changes have forced community members to diversify their livelihood activities away from crop production and into off-farm and non-farm activities. Our results highlight how the process of diversification is dependent on household participation in various group activities and formal and informal social networks. Further, the households participating in several group activities and social networks had more diverse livelihood strategies and were found to be more resilient to perceived climate changes because they had access to the critical resources (material and non-material) essential for diversification through their networks. Importantly, this study shows how group activities and social networks can also create adverse effects by enforcing exclusion and marginalization among certain groups in the community. In addition, it shows how some diversification strategies are in conflict with others and thus may potentially undermine future adaptive capacity and the resilience of the community as a whole.","[Dapilah, Frederick; Nielsen, Jonas Ostergaard; Friis, Cecilie] Humboldt Univ, IRI THESys, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Dapilah, Frederick; Nielsen, Jonas Ostergaard; Friis, Cecilie] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Dapilah, F (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, IRI THESys, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.;Dapilah, F (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",dapilafr@hu-berlin.de,"Friis, Cecilie/ABA-4332-2020","Nielsen, Jonas/0000-0002-9518-7511; Friis, Cecilie/0000-0002-4738-3761",,,,,59,33,33,5,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Transient, gradual, or abrupt changes in source water quality that could compromise treatment effectiveness can be triggered by climate and related meteorological events, accidental or intentional contamination, security breaches, or other disruptions. However, the design principles that underpin the majority of existing conventional treatment systems predate climate adaptation considerations. This paper considers the adaptation capacity of conventional water treatment systems. A modeling framework is used to illustrate climate adaptation mechanisms that could enable conventional treatment systems to accommodate water quality impairments. Treatment system resiliency is explored in response to generic climate-relevant water quality perturbations such as extreme temperature variations and changes in the quantity and characteristics of solids, particles, and organic constituents. Promising adaptation options include modifying chemical parameters (e.g., types of chemicals, dosages, sequence of chemical addition, mixing intensity and duration), filter operations, and microbiological augmentation of existing physical/chemical treatment systems. The capacity reserve concept provides an organizing principle that could be useful for prioritizing climate adaptation strategies such as major or minor treatment/infrastructure modifications, system-wide upgrades such as off-line storage, operational changes in distribution systems, or the use of supplemental water sources including reclaimed or recycled water.","[Levine, Audrey D.] Natl Sci Fdn, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Levine, Audrey D.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Yang, Y.

This study shows that adaptive action on both stand and business levels is missing in forest management. Beyond the cognitive dimension, affective and conative aspects should be promoted through awareness-raising initiatives specific to different target groups. Context Adaptation to climate change is a complex but urgent task in forest management. A lack of action is widely reported combined with a call for awareness-raising and better knowledge transfer to bridge the gap between knowledge and action. Aims Based on an understanding of awareness encompassing cognitive, affective, and conative dimensions, the paper aims to clarify (1) what kind of adaptive measures are missing in forest management and (2) if there is a gap in climate change awareness of forest owners and managers hindering adaptive action. Methods An online survey among German forest owners and managers was conducted. The theory of planned behavior was selected to examine variables which support the implementation of adaptive measures and to examine different awareness dimensions. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analysis. Results Adaptive measures on stand level were more often implemented than those on business level. All awareness dimensions were influential for the intention to implement adaptive measures. Experience and attitude towards adaptive measures were most important while social norm and perceived behavioral control were influential in some groups. Conclusion The potential of adaptive measures on stand level and particularly on business level is not fully exploited. Based on these findings, awareness-raising initiatives and forest consultancy can be adapted to consider the specific perspectives of target groups as a means of promoting the implementation of adaptive measures.","[Hengst-Ehrhart, Yvonne] Forest Res Inst Baden Wuerttemberg, Dept Forestry Econ, Wonnhaldestr 4, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany",,"Hengst-Ehrhart, Y (corresponding author), Forest Res Inst Baden Wuerttemberg, Dept Forestry Econ, Wonnhaldestr 4, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",yvonne.hengst-ehrhart@forst.bwl.de,,"Hengst, Yvonne/0000-0002-5283-7692",,,,,66,11,11,3,22,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Here we provide a framework for identifying which agricultural practices could be considered 'Ecosystem-based Adaptation' practices, and highlight the opportunities and constraints for using these practices to help smallholder farmers adapt to climate change. We argue that these practices are (a) based on the conservation, restoration or management of biodiversity, ecosystem processes or services, and (b) improve the ability of crops and livestock to maintain crop yields under climate change and/or by buffering biophysical impacts of extreme weather events or increased temperatures. To be appropriate for smallholder farmers, these practices must also help increase their food security, increase or diversify their sources of income generation, take advantage of local or traditional knowledge, be based on local inputs, and have low implementation and labor costs. To illustrate the application of this definition, we provide some examples from smallholders' coffee management practices in Mesoamerica. We also highlight three key obstacles that currently constrain the use of Ecosystem-based Adaptation practices (i) the need for greater understanding of their effectiveness and the factors that drive their adoption, (ii) the development supportive and integrated agriculture and climate change policies that specifically promote them as part of a broader agricultural adaptation program; and (iii) the establishment and maintaining strong and innovative extension programs for smallholder farmers. Our framework is an important starting point for identifying which Ecosystem-based Adaptation practices are appropriate for smallholder farmers and merit attention in international and national adaptation efforts.

This is particularly true in areas expected to become more arid such as the Southwestern United States, where restrictive water rights are strictly enforced. Adaptations to these dual climatic and legal challenges include user-selected rules. In particular, during water shortage self-governing irrigation systems often change water allocations between members and rotate water delivery. However, it is unclear how these rules interact with each other as configurations and with contextual factors, such as the degree of water scarcity. It is also unclear how these rules influence outcomes between irrigators closer to the water source and those farther from it. How might different configurations of rules interact with water availability to produce outcomes along an irrigation system's canal network? This study addresses this question by exploiting a natural experiment in water distribution and allocation rules during shortage among a stratified sample of 60 snowmelt dependent irrigation systems in the San Luis Valley of Colorado during a four-year drought period from 2011-2014. A key finding is that the combination of rotational delivery and flexible water allocations produces the most equal crop growth between irrigators at the head and tail of the irrigation system at all levels of water availability. The marginal productivity of water at the head and tail end of irrigation systems at all levels of water availability is also equalized under this configuration. These results suggest a greater likelihood of ongoing collective action, important for climate change adaptation. However, rotation with flexible allocations is outperformed by other configurations depending on context. These findings highlight the configurational relationships between rules, further illustrate interactions between rules and physical context, and caution against panaceas in water resource management and climate change adaptation.","[Cody, Kelsey C.] CU Boulder Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80303 USA",,"Cody, KC (corresponding author), CU Boulder Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",,,"Cody, Kelsey/0000-0001-6817-2595",National Science Foundation [BCS-1115009]; Colorado Section of the American Water Resources Association; Arkansas River Basin Water Forum; University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Open Access Fund,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Colorado Section of the American Water Resources Association; Arkansas River Basin Water Forum; University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Open Access Fund,"This study would not have been possible without funding from National Science Foundation grant BCS-1115009, the Colorado Section of the American Water Resources Association, and the Arkansas River Basin Water Forum.

The ports have asymmetric information on the actual disaster damage. In deciding on adaptation investment, the leader port is a better-informed first mover and the follower port is a less-informed follower. The government is able to acquire and verify port adaptation information and chooses whether to publicize it (publicity policy) or keep it confidential (confidentiality policy). If the information is publicized, the leader port initiates a signaling game in which it makes a decision first, and the follower acts after observing the leader's decision. Under the confidentiality policy, both ports make their decisions simultaneously. Our analysis shows the following. 1) Under the publicity policy, the leader port does not adopt a pooling strategy; rather, it determines its adaptation and output based on true information on disaster damage (i.e., it implements a separating equilibrium). 2) The publicity policy has two effects: it increases the leader's throughput while decreasing the follower's throughput (i. e., the throughput effect), and it helps rationalize the follower's adaptation investment by making more up-to-date disaster information available (i.e., the adaptation investment effect). 3) When the degree of inter-port competition is high, the publicity policy improves social welfare by increasing the total throughput of the two ports (i.e., an overall positive throughput effect) and rationalizes the follower's adaptation investment (i.e., a positive adaptation investment effect). Otherwise, it reduces the total throughput of the ports (i.e., an overall negative throughput effect). This negative throughput effect may outweigh the positive adaptation investment effect, thereby reducing social welfare. These analytical results suggest that the government needs to promote inter-port competition if it decides to publicize port adaptation information. Finally, we find that the joint implementation of publicity and subsidy policies could result in excessive adaptation investment, leading to social welfare loss. Our study illustrates the important effects of information asymmetry on adaptation investment and has policy implications in the presence of port competition and government subsidy.","[Zheng, Shiyuan] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kun; Fu, Xiaowen] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Anming] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Ge, Ying-En] Changan Univ, Coll Transportat Engn, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Shanghai Maritime University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of British Columbia; Chang'an University,"Fu, XW (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xiaowen.fu@polyu.edu.hk; yege@chd.edu.cn,,"Wang, Kun/0000-0002-2137-9457; Fu, Xiaowen/0000-0002-1925-046X",Hong Kong Polytechnic University DGRF; National Natural Science Foundation of China;  [P0035755/UAKR];  [71901065];  [72031005];  [72072113],Hong Kong Polytechnic University DGRF(Hong Kong Polytechnic University); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ; ; ; ,"Acknowledgements We are very grateful to three anonymous referees and editor (Robin Lindsey) for their constructive and detailed comments and suggestions that have led to a significant improvement of the paper.

Spatiotemporal impacts were quantified using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) datasets complemented by hydrodynamic modelling and evaluation of anthropogenic influences. Ground-level changes included examples of uplift and extensive subsidence (ca. 0.5 m) associated with intertidal area reductions, particularly in supratidal zones. 'Coastal squeeze' effects occurred where incompatible infrastructure prevented upland ecosystem movement with relative sea-level rise. Despite large-scale managed retreat, legacy effects of land-filling have reduced the reversibility of human modifications, impairing system resiliency through poor land-use design. Elsewhere, available space in the intertidal range shows that natural environment movement could be readily assisted by simple engineering techniques though is challenged by competing land-use demands. Quantification of gains and losses showed that lagoon expansion into previously defended areas is indeed required to sustain critical habitats, highlighting the importance of a whole-system view. Identifiable coastal planning principles include the need to assess trade-offs between natural and built environments in the design of hazard management plans, requiring greater attention to the natural movement of ecosystems and areas involved. Treating these observations as a scenario illustrates the mechanisms by which coastal squeeze effects may develop under global sea-level rise, but our purpose is to help avoid them by identifying appropriate human responses. We highlight the need for an improved focus on whole-system resilience, and the importance of disaster recovery processes for adaptation to climate change.","[Orchard, Shane] Univ Canterbury, Waterways Ctr Freshwater Management, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Orchard, Shane] Lincoln Univ, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Orchard, Shane; Schiel, David R.] Univ Canterbury, Marine Ecol Res Grp, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Hughey, Kenneth F.

Furthermore, expansion in food production is predicted to occur primarily in the developing world, where adaptation to climate change may be more difficult and opportunities to mitigate emissions limited. In the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), ensuring that food production is not threatened' is explicitly mentioned in the objective of the Convention. However, the focus of negotiations under the Convention has largely been on reducing GHG emissions from energy, and industrial activities and realizing the potential of forestry as a carbon sink. There has been little attention by the UNFCCC to address the challenges and opportunities for the agriculture sector. Since 2006, concerted efforts have been made to raise the prominence of agriculture within the negotiations. The most recent The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report and The Emissions Gap Report' by the UNEP highlighted the significant mitigation potential of agriculture, which can help contribute towards keeping global temperature rises below the 2 degrees C limit agreed in Cancun. Agriculture has to be a part of the solution to address climate change, but this will also require a focus on how agriculture systems can adapt to climate change in order to continue to increase food output. However, to effectively realize this potential, systematic and dedicated discussion and decisions within the UNFCCC are needed. UNFCCC discussions on a specific agriculture agenda item started in 2012, but are currently inconclusive. However, Parties are generally in agreement on the importance of agriculture in contributing to food security and employment as well as the need to improve understanding of agriculture and how it can contribute to realizing climate objectives. Discussions on agriculture are continuing with a view to finding an acceptable approach to address the climate change related challenges faced by agriculture worldwide and to ensure that food production is not threatened'.","[Muldowney, J.; Mounsey, J.; Kinsella, L.] Grattan Business Ctr, Climate Change & Bioenergy Policy Div, Dept Agr Food & Marine, Portlaoise, Ireland",,"Muldowney, J (corresponding author), Grattan Business Ctr, Climate Change & Bioenergy Policy Div, Dept Agr Food & Marine, Portlaoise, Ireland.",John.Muldowney@agriculture.gov.ie,,,,,,,32,8,8,11,58,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1751-7311,1751-732X,,ANIMAL,Animal,JUN,2013,7,,,2,,,206,211,,10.1017/S175173111300089X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S175173111300089X,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences,272ZO,23739463,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000328502300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

By 2050, millions of Africans are likely to consider, or be pushed into, migration because of climate hazards contributing to agricultural disruption, water and food scarcity, desertification, flooding, drought, coastal erosion, and heat waves. However, the migration-climate nexus is complex, as is the question of whether migration can be considered a climate change adaptation strategy across both the rural and urban space. Combining data from household surveys, key informant interviews, and secondary sources related to regional disaster, demographic, resource, and economic trends between 1990 and 2020 from north central and central dryland Namibia, we investigate (i) human migration flows and the influence of climate hazards on these flows and (ii) the benefits and dis-benefits of migration in supporting climate change adaptation, from the perspective of migrants (personal factors and intervening obstacles), areas of origin, and areas of destination. Our analysis suggests an increase in climate-related push factors that could be driving rural out-migration from the north central region to peri-urban settlements in the central region of the country. While push factors play a role in rural-urban migration, there are also several pull factors (many of which have been long-term drivers of urban migration) such as perceived higher wages, diversity of livelihoods, water, health and energy provisioning, remittances, better education opportunities, and the exchange of non-marketed products. Migration to peri-urban settlements can reduce some risks (e.g. loss of crops and income due to climate extremes) but amplify others (e.g. heat stress and insecure land tenure). Adaptation at both ends of the rural-urban continuum is supported by deeply embedded linkages in a model of circular rural-urban-rural migration and interdependencies. Results empirically inform current and future policy debates around climate mobilities in Namibia, with wider implications across Africa.","[Thorn, Jessica P.

The management and enabling of effective risk approaches, we argue, is shaped by complex contextual settings. These contexts are shaped by decisions including: What climate risks are prioritised? Who makes decisions about risk response interventions and how do they make these decisions? This preliminary study uses observed changes in storm events in the City of Johannesburg (CoJ) and the City's Climate Change Adaptation Plan as a lens through which the scope of such contexts and decisions can be interrogated. The study is used as a springboard from which to begin a dialogue on interactive approaches to adaptation and response planning for current and future climate change. We suggest that this dialogue may be required for a more proactive disaster-risk approach in the city. The major focus of the paper includes a statistical analysis of historical weather data from the OR Tambo Weather Station, located in close proximity to the city. Significant trends are identified in the frequency and intensity of thunderstorms for the period 1960-2009. This preliminary assessment shows some similarities with emerging climate change projections that suggest that heavy rainfall events may become more frequent and intense. The preliminary results presented here also concur with the recent findings contained in the CoJ's Climate Change Adaptation Plan (2009). While the study is in no way substantive and few wider generalisations and strong conclusions can be drawn from it, the study does provide a useful starting point for considering possible planning interventions. The potential value of using science and information from studies, such as this, is highlighted along with the possible ways in which such science can interact with and help inform a comprehensive planning agenda in the City. Finally, the paper calls for more attention to be paid to the contributions and perceptions of community awareness and understanding of climate risks.","[Fatti, Christina Elizabeth; Vogel, Coleen] Univ Witwatersrand, ReVAMP, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Fatti, CE (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, ReVAMP, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Sci, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",tina.fatti@gmail.com,"Culwick, Christina/AAJ-4651-2020","Culwick, Christina/0000-0003-2710-9797",,,,,31,8,8,0,20,WATER RESEARCH COMMISSION,PRETORIA,"PO BOX 824, PRETORIA 0001, SOUTH AFRICA",0378-4738,1816-7950,,WATER SA,Water SA,JAN,2011,37,1,,,,,57,65,,,,,,9,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,732BE,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000288156100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Under humid climatic conditions, the development of bunch rot on grapes cannot be suppressed completely. Selection of planting material with lower bunch rot susceptibility represents one of the most efficient long-term tools in the complex bunch rot minimisation strategy. The present investigation conducted over four consecutive years (2013-2016) under the environmental conditions of the Moselle valley aimed at (i) detecting consistent differences in the bunch rot susceptibility within a group of nine commercially available Vitis vinifera L. 'White Riesling' clones, (ii) investigating potential underlying causes and (iii) deriving recommendations for 'Riesling' clone selection in practical viticulture. Disease severity and grape maturity (total soluble solids) progress could be well simulated by sigmoidal curves (R-2 > 0.89; P < 0.038). On average of all four years, the dates when 5 % bunch rot disease severity were reached differed significantly by 9 days between the clone with the earliest epidemic (Trier 34) and the clone with the latest epidemic (Heinz 65). Multi-annual results enabled a classification of the nine clones according to (i) their relative bunch rot susceptibility as well as (ii) their relative precocity. Based on this, practical recommendations concerning a targeted clone selection as an integral long-term tool (i) in Integrated Pest Management contributing to pesticide reduction in viticulture as well as (ii) in the viticultural climate change adaptation strategy were derived.","[Molitor, D.; Biewers, B.; Schultz, M.; Hoffmann, L.; Beyer, M.] LIST, Environm Res & Innovat ERIN Dept, 41 Rue Brill, L-4422 Belvaux, Luxembourg; [Molitor, D.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Crop Sci, Div Viticulture & Pomol, Tulln, Austria; [Biewers, B.; Junglen, M.; Schultz, M.; Clementi, P.; Berkelmann-Loehnertz, B.] HGU, Inst Phytomed, Geisenheim, Germany; [Schultz, M.] IVV, Sect Viticulture, Remich, Luxembourg; [Permesang, G.; Regnery, D.; Porten, M.] Dienstleistungszentrum Landlicher Raum DLR Mosel, Abt Weinbau & Oenol, Bernkastel Kues, Germany; [Herzog, K.] JKI, Fed Res Ctr Cultivated Plants, Inst Grapevine Breeding Geilweilerhof, Siebeldingen, Germany","Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Molitor, D (corresponding author), LIST, Environm Res & Innovat ERIN Dept, 41 Rue Brill, L-4422 Belvaux, Luxembourg.",daniel.molitor@list.lu,"Beyer, Marco/S-9197-2019; Beyer, Marco/T-1139-2019","Molitor, Daniel/0000-0001-7487-6740",IVV (Remich/Luxembourg),IVV (Remich/Luxembourg),"The authors would like to thank R.

It has thus been advocated as a suitable method for analysing environmental policy making as well as decisions about projects and their effects on societal welfare. Despite the valuable use in principle, its actual use in policy processes seems to be limited. The paper presents an empirical case study in the city of Bremen, Germany and contributes to the literature on the use of CBA in policy making related to climate adaptation. We interviewed municipal actors involved in a participatory workshop series dedicated to supporting the use of CBA for deciding whether to implement specific climate adaptation measures. The municipal actors were asked about their perception of the usefulness of CBA, particularly in formulating policy options, and about the success factors and constraints connected to integrating cost-benefit results in policy making. The findings suggest that CBA is, above all, perceived as useful in raising awareness of environmental goods and in increasing the transparency of the policy-making process. Here, CBA was confirmed as useful for spurring a systematic discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of different adaptation measures. However, the municipal actors adopted a relatively critical stance towards using CBA as a decision criterion for prioritising measures. We conclude that, in this context, the participatory process of conducting the CBA, which takes municipal actors' knowledge seriously into account, is important for the perception of the usefulness of its results in policy making.","[Dehnhardt, Alexandra; Grothmann, Torsten; Wagner, Josephin] Inst Ecol Econ Res, Berlin, Germany; [Grothmann, Torsten] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany; [Dehnhardt, Alexandra] Potsdamer Str 105, D-10785 Berlin, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Dehnhardt, A (corresponding author), Potsdamer Str 105, D-10785 Berlin, Germany.",Alexandra.Dehnhardt@ioew.de,,,,,,,32,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

What about when climate change is more uncertain? What if the climate changes faster? This decision problem is difficult if the design of the investments is irreversible for their lifetime, for instance, in the construction industry. We study an irreversible design decision when the investment starts, combined with an irreversible option to abandon. The design determines the investment's robustness to sustain detrimental conditions. We find that for short-lived investments, optimal robustness decreases if the climate changes faster, and increases if uncertainty is higher. For long-lived investments, these effects reverse. This has implications for decision makers who plan infrastructure adaptation, for instance, that adverse climate change does not require more robust investments under the identified circumstances.","[Eisenack, Klaus] Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Paschen, Marius] Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Eisenack, K (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",klaus.eisenack@hu-berlin.de; marius.paschen@ifw-kiel.de,,,"Ph.D. program Systemintegration Erneuerbarer Energien - Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, Germany; Einstein Foundation Berlin; Berlin University Alliance (Einstein Research Unit 'Climate and Water under Change' [ERU-2020-609]","Ph.D. program Systemintegration Erneuerbarer Energien - Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, Germany; Einstein Foundation Berlin; Berlin University Alliance (Einstein Research Unit 'Climate and Water under Change'","Parts of this work has been financed under the Ph.D. program Systemintegration Erneuerbarer Energien, funded by the Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, Germany.

These climate adaptation convenings generally include presentations, discussions, and social learning about how to effectively respond to climate-related impacts. Many of these convenings shifted to virtual formats during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a study to understand how four virtual convenings in the United States compare with otherwise similar in-person events. Through surveys with attendees of four virtual climate adaptation convenings, we explored how attendees' outcomes differed between conference formats and captured their perceptions of virtual vs. in-person events. Overall, 71% of attendees indicated that they were more likely or equally likely to attend future convenings online, and 62% reported that knowledge gain was about the same or better online than in-person. Many respondents appreciated the accessibility and more inclusive participation at virtual convenings, as well as the environmental benefits and reduced costs. However, interpersonal interactions were inferior in virtual formats, and some attendees experienced difficulties with technology and screen fatigue. Respondents shared suggestions for addressing these challenges. Altogether, findings suggest that virtual convenings have high potential if greater attention is paid to these elements.","[Merritt, Eileen G.; Brousseau, Jennifer J.; Stern, Marc J.] Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Hansen, Lara J.] EcoAdapt, Bainbridge Isl, WA 98110 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Merritt, EG (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.;Hansen, LJ (corresponding author), EcoAdapt, Bainbridge Isl, WA 98110 USA.",egmerritt@vt.edu; lara@ecoadapt.org,,"Merritt, Eileen/0000-0001-8405-5225; Brousseau, Jennifer/0000-0003-3032-2919","National Science Foundation's Advancing Informal STEM Education program [DRL 1810851, DRL 1811534]",National Science Foundation's Advancing Informal STEM Education program,Funding for this study was provided by the National Science Foundation's Advancing Informal STEM Education program (DRL 1810851 and DRL 1811534).

Thematically, the concept is suitable for complex, interdisciplinary, societal challenges with a high degree of uncertainty regarding future changes. It is exemplified here by the need to link disaster risk reduction (DRR) with climate change adaptation (CCA) and flood risk management (FRM). The concept answers to the variety of adopted solutions and build-up of knowledge that exist, as a consequence of far-reaching local liabilities and initiatives. The concept advocates building of platforms and procedures where managers, stakeholders, researchers, policy makers, and regular students can meet, interact and learn from local examples. Design/methodology/approach - The concept IntECR (integrated education, research and collaboration) has been tested in two courses during 2009 and 2010 around the Swedish lakes Vanern and Malaren. Seminars and field visits were arranged in ten different cities. Participants replied anonymously to a course evaluation and were questioned in groups about their perceived benefit from the concept. Findings - Informal networking, holistic perspective, shared problem identification and the positive possibility to study several examples of local management in arrangements with high degree of structural openness, were mentioned by the participants as positive outcome of the concept. Originality/value - The use of this educational concept aims to increase the adaptive capacity of societal entities through raised capacity of their individual members. The applied example is timely, relevant and a contribution to DRR and CCA.","[Johansson, Magnus; Nyberg, Lars; Hansson, Max] Karlstad Univ, Ctr Climate & Safety, Karlstad, Sweden; [Johansson, Magnus] Karlstad Univ, Ctr Climate & Safety Grp, Karlstad, Sweden; [Evers, Mariele] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Bonn, Germany",Karlstad University; Karlstad University; University of Bonn,"Johansson, M (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Ctr Climate & Safety, Karlstad, Sweden.",magnus.johansson@kau.se,"Nyberg, Lars/A-6513-2012","Nyberg, Lars/0000-0002-2992-9572",,,,,32,12,12,0,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0965-3562,1758-6100,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

We seek to contribute to the growing body of literature that addresses the role of gender relations for remittance sending and usage. Based on multisited qualitative research on rural-urban migration in Thailand, we apply the concept of translocal social resilience to expound the multilocal and intersectional dimension of remittances and their impact on social resilience. Building on typical constellations of remittance transfer and usage, the paper accentuates how gender, generational relations, and the household's socio-economic status shape remittance practices and their effects on social resilience across space. We can thus conclude that addressing intersecting socio-spatial levels and axes of difference enhances the understanding of remittance potentials for resilience, which also enriches research that frames migration as a means of adaptation.","[Porst, Luise] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Meckenheimer Allee 166, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Sakdapolrak, Patrick] Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Sci, Vienna, Austria",University of Bonn; University of Vienna,"Porst, L (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Meckenheimer Allee 166, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",lporst@uni-bonn.de,"Sakdapolrak, Patrick/AAT-6359-2021","Sakdapolrak, Patrick/0000-0001-7137-1552; , Luise/0000-0001-7153-1544",,,,,93,2,2,4,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1544-8444,1544-8452,,POPUL SPACE PLACE,Popul.

The development of such strategies is the subject of target E of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030). Furthermore, an increasing understanding of the need to address the root causes of risk has led to calls for greater coherence between strategies that focus on DRRR, and those dedicated to climate change adaptation and sustainable development goals. The purpose of this paper is to increase knowledge on associated decision-making in general, and in Sweden in particular. We analyze the relevance and scope of a Swedish DRRR strategy, and identify drivers and barriers to integrated development and implementation. Based on document reviews, and interviews and group discussions with representatives in Sweden and six European countries, the results highlight a growing awareness that much remains to be learnt and shared between domains in order to progress towards integrated DRRR and more climate-proof sustainable development. In practice, most strategies are developed independently and related actors work in silos, leading to power struggles with negative impacts on national and local capacity. At the same time, windows of opportunity are appearing for the development of national DRRR strategies and increased policy coherence. We discuss these, and present some policy recommendations.","[Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Box 170, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Wamsler, Christine] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci CNDS, Uppsala, Sweden; [Johannessen, Ase] Lund Univ, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, Lund, Sweden; [Johannessen, Ase] Delft Univ Technol, Water Resources Grp, Delft, Netherlands",Lund University; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Uppsala University; Lund University; Delft University of Technology,"Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Box 170, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Johannessen, Ase/0000-0002-8752-5496",Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2011-901]; Swedish Research Council VR [2017-06214]; Swedish Civil Contingency Agency MSB [2018-04514],Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Research Council VR(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Civil Contingency Agency MSB,"This study was financed by the Swedish Research Council FORMAS (grant number 2011-901), the Swedish Research Council VR (International postdoc grant number 2017-06214) and supported by the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency MSB (2018-04514).

This has generated conflicting assumptions among experts who communicate with homeowners: half of surveyed wildfire practitioners perceive a lack of expert agreement about the effect of negative imagery (a burning house) on homeowner behavior, yet most believe negative imagery is more engaging. We tested whether this expectation matched homeowner response in the United States. In an online experiment, homeowners who viewed negative imagery reported more negative emotions but the same behavioral intentions compared to those who viewed status-quo landscape photos. In a pre-registered field experiment, homeowners who received a postcard showing negative imagery were equally likely, overall, to visit a wildfire risk webpage as those whose postcard showed a status quo photo. However, the negative imagery decreased webpage visits as homeowners' wildfire risk increased. These results illustrate the importance of testing assumptions to encourage behavioral adaptation to climate change.","[Flint, Hilary Byerly; Brenkert-Smith, Hannah] Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Flint, Hilary Byerly] Univ Wyoming, Haub Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Laramie, WY 82072 USA; [Champ, Patricia A.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Meldrum, James R.] US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Wyoming; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Flint, HB (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Flint, HB (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Haub Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Laramie, WY 82072 USA.",hflint1@uwyo.edu,"Meldrum, James R./W-4994-2019","Meldrum, James R./0000-0001-5250-3759; Flint, Hilary/0000-0002-7445-2099",National Science Foundation (NSF) [SES1823509]; United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station; NSF; Federal Emergency Management Agency,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Federal Emergency Management Agency,"We are tremendously grateful to Katie Gibble and Chris Chambers at Ashland Fire and Rescue for making the field experiment possible.

Success, however, will need much higher targets for environmental protection than the present 10% of sea and 17% of land. A new target of 30% of the sea given high levels of protection from exploitation and harm by 2030 is under consideration and similar targets are being discussed for terrestrial habitats.

This mortality is a product of acute drought compounded by the long-established removal of a key ecosystem process: frequent, low-to moderate-intensity fire. The recent tree mortality has many implications for the future of these forests and the ecological goods and services they provide to society. Future wildfire hazard following this mortality can be generally characterized by decreased crown fire potential and increased surface fire intensity in the short to intermediate term. The scale of present tree mortality is so large that greater potential for mass fire exists in the coming decades, driven by the amount and continuity of dry, combustible, large woody material that could produce large, severe fires. For long-term adaptation to climate change, we highlight the importance of moving beyond triage of dead and dying trees to making green (live) forests more resilient.","[Stephens, Scott L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Collins, Brandon M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Fire Res & Outreach, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fettig, Christopher J.; North, Malcolm P.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Davis, CA USA; [Finney, Mark A.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Missoula, MT USA; [Hoffman, Chad M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Range Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Knapp, Eric E.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Redding, CA USA; [Safford, Hugh; Wayman, Rebecca B.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Safford, Hugh] US Forest Serv, USDA, Vallejo, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Colorado State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of California System; University of California Davis; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Stephens, SL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sstephens@berkeley.edu,"North, Malcolm/AAW-8897-2020","North, Malcolm/0000-0002-9090-784X; Wayman, Rebecca/0000-0001-6040-7257",,,,,82,174,177,12,107,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0006-3568,1525-3244,,BIOSCIENCE,Bioscience,FEB,2018,68,2,,,,,77,88,,10.1093/biosci/bix146,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biosci/bix146,,,12,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,FV9AB,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000424878000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Non-climate factors influenced adaptation of both groups of farmers.

An integral approach for tourism climatologic analyses is provided by the climate-tourism/transfer-information-scheme that also bases on frequency distributions of relevant factors and parameters which are important for a destination. The knowledge about the vertical variability of tourism climatologic factors is of high importance because of the several kinds of tourism activities affected by weather. The same holds for a quantification of extreme events like heat waves because of their possible effects on health and recreation over a year's course.

Responding to this lacuna, this paper examines the connections between climate change and agricultural adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers in northern Ghana. Results from the qualitative fieldwork show that climatic changes have been accompanied by increases in climate change extremes (CCEs) over the last three decades. In order to adapt, smallholder farmers use improved crop varieties and other support strategies. Paradoxically, however, CCEs have undermined these strategies in several instances, causing crop yields to fall short of their actual potential and leading to financial indebtedness. Therefore, the results showcase that overcoming non-climatic barriers to the uptake of agricultural adaptation strategies is a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving successful adaptation outcomes. This is the case since new barriers to the adaptation process are constantly emerging, and CCEs are an example of this.","[Dapilah, Frederick; Nielsen, Jonas Ostergaard] Humboldt Univ, IRI THESys, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Dapilah, Frederick; Nielsen, Jonas Ostergaard] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Dapilah, F (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, IRI THESys, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.;Dapilah, F (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",dapilafr@hu-berlin.de,,"Nielsen, Jonas/0000-0002-9518-7511",Government of Ghana; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Doctoral Scholarship Programme [91616271],Government of Ghana; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Doctoral Scholarship Programme(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"We would like to thank the Chief and People of Bagri for their time, patience, and granting us the opportunity to learn about how they are adapting to climate change.

The building sector with its significant carbon footprint plays an important role in urban climate change adaptation strategies. Using the case study of Brisbane (Australia), the paper examines the place-specific contextualisation of green building transitions by analysing the co-evolution and interplay of building practices, policy making and involved actors. Drawing on theoretical approaches of Transition Studies and Evolutionary Economic Geography, we trace back and analyse policy and economic trajectories focusing on formative and hindering processes. The paper discusses ambivalent pathways and 'regime resistance' caused by local economic and political specificities. The analysis illustrates how crucial the continual support from both policy makers and industry actors can be when economic market mechanisms do not drive sustainability transitions. Regime actors can play a powerful role as 'transition detractors' and can determine the dynamics and the scope of sustainability transitions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data from 120 farmers (60 RWH technology adopters and 60 non-adopters) in Makwanpur district, the study employed a probit model to identify factors that influenced the adoption decision of RWH technology. The impact of RWH technology on farm income was then determined by a multiple regression model. The results showed that years of schooling, total physical assets and organizational membership of household members were the major determinants of the adoption of RWH technology. The results also showed that the adoption of RWH technology, gender of household head, total household members engaged in agriculture occupation, and total educated household members contributed significantly to annual farm income. Considering weather uncertainties faced by farmers in rainfed areas, RWH technology would be a potential option to improve the rural livelihoods.

Although OF is promptly increasing globally, the pertinent question is to figure out how OF can result in sustainable food production systems. This systematic literature review was undertaken through two database searches to maximize available data and relevant literature (Scopus and Wiley Online Library), resulting in 2069 documents published between 2007 and 2022. After excluding documents that were duplicates, not presented in English and irrelevant, 538 documents remained. From the remaining documents, 406 were excluded after careful review (not meeting at least one of the inclusion criteria), and 132 documents remained. Finally, 95 documents were excluded after assessing and reviewing full-text articles for eligibility. As a result, 37 documents were included (eligible) in the systematic review. The inclusion criteria followed in this study considered language, thematic focus and document type. The reviewed articles suggest that OF can be one of the climate change adaptation options, preserve environmental impact and improve food security. However, the relative performance in OF differs from region to region. Correspondingly, the organic-conventional yield gap mostly depends on crops and cropping practices. This review concludes the prospects of organic agriculture in Southern Africa are still largely untapped, particularly by smallholder farmers who remain uncertified. Therefore, the review recommends organised interventions on various fronts, starting with organic certification and regulation. Accordingly, sustainability (economic, environmental and social) and investments in OF need to be reinforced and promoted by stakeholders, as it has the potential to alleviate the swarming farming challenges posed by climate change and to address food insecurity.","[Wekeza, Siphelele Vincent; Sibanda, Melusi] Univ Zululand, Fac Sci & Agr, Dept Agr, ZA-3886 Kwa Dlangezwa, South Africa; [Nhundu, Kenneth] Agr Res Council ARC, Econ Anal Unit, POB 8783, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Zululand,"Sibanda, M (corresponding author), Univ Zululand, Fac Sci & Agr, Dept Agr, ZA-3886 Kwa Dlangezwa, South Africa.",sibandam@unizulu.ac.za,,,National Research Foundation (NRF) [SFH180603339360],National Research Foundation (NRF),This research was funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF) grant number: SFH180603339360.,,87,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2022,14,20,,,,,,,13489,10.3390/su142013489,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142013489,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5Q0LC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000873531100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Projected future changes in climate (e.g. UKCP09) indicate that North West England is likely to experience an increasing frequency and intensity of meteorological extremes, leading to flooding, heat waves and storms. Consequently, it is important that the region enhances its preparedness for such events. This paper explores the possibility of developing quantifiable climate risk indices for the case study area of Greater Manchester, using a combination of archival research and statistical analysis of past climate data. For extremes which are the function of a single meteorological variable (e.g. heat waves, pluvial flooding and heavy snowfall) the thresholds proved to be reliable and skillful. Days with maximum daily temperature greater than or equal to 29.2 degrees C, daily snowfall amount greater than or equal to 6 cm or maximum gust speed greater than or equal to 60 knots are found to be indicative of weather-related impacts which have in the past affected human health/well-being, have caused damage to the urban infrastructure or have severely disrupted services. Extreme events which are the result of a more complex interaction between variables (e.g. drought, freezing conditions) were less well captured by applying the thresholds associated with a single variable in isolation. Such critical threshold indices can be used in conjunction with future projections of climate change to establish weather-related risk for the future. This risk-based approach can subsequently be integrated to climate change adaptation strategies and development planning to ensure future preparedness.

The climate of a destination is believed to influence the selection of a destination, the timing of the visit and the enjoyment of the destination. The climatic suitability of locations for tourism is often evaluated using indices of climatic data, including the Tourism Climatic Index and the Climate Index for Tourism. The output of these indices is a measure of suitability based on the climatic conditions of the destination alone. This is valuable in facilitating baseline comparisons between destinations, but ignores the role of the country of origin of tourists, the anticipated climatic conditions and the infrastructure in tourist accommodation establishments and attractions. We explore the influence of these factors on the sensitivity of tourists to the climate of a destination, using commentary on climatic factors in TripAdvisor reviews for a selection of 19 locations in South Africa. An improved understanding of the climatic sensitivity of specific tourist groups and climatic challenges in tourist accommodation establishments, facilitates improved adaptation to climate change threats to the tourist sector.","[Fitchett, Jennifer] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa; [Hoogendoorn, Gijsbert] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Geog Environm Management & Energy Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Johannesburg,"Fitchett, J (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa.",jennifer.m.fitchett@gmail.com,"Fitchett, Jennifer/R-8276-2019; Fitchett, Jennifer/ABE-7179-2021","Fitchett, Jennifer/0000-0002-0854-1720; Hoogendoorn, Gijsbert/0000-0001-7969-7952",,,,,49,18,19,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

And the conflicts between different objectives in reservoir operation may become more and more challenging because of the impact of climate change. This study aims at deriving multi-objective operating rules to adapt to climate change and alleviate the conflicts. By combining the reservoir operation function and operating rule curves, an adaptive multi-objective operation model was proposed and developed. The optimal operating rules derived both by dynamic programming and NSGA-II method were compared and discussed. The projection pursuit method was used to select the best operating rules. The results demonstrate that the reservoir operating rules obtained by NSGA-II can increase the power generation and water supply yield and reliability, and the rules focusing on water supply can significantly increase the reservoir annual water supply yield (by 18.7 %). It is shown that the proposed model would be effective in reservoir operation under climate change.","[Yang, Guang; Guo, Shenglian; Li, Liping; Hong, Xingjun; Wang, Le] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Guo, SL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",yang_guang@whu.edu.cn; slguo@whu.edu.cn,"Li, LiPing/HKE-9058-2023; Yang, Guang/AGJ-3481-2022","Yang, Guang/0000-0001-7330-3502","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51539009, 51422907, 51190094]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51539009, 51422907, 51190094).

Five high-level scenarios concerning the future of international climate change law are developed, ranging from an optimistic scenario, in which there is coordinated mitigation between states within the confines of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to a pessimistic scenario, in which each state engages in its own autonomous adaptation to climate change. Some consequences for individual states of each scenario are then explored and some possible legal responses of states are developed. Governments should work together in mitigation and adaptation to achieve a global response to climate change, and should work to secure advantages in the carbon markets for their own companies, develop a geoengineering strategy, and be aware that recasting climate change as a security issue risks undermining the logic of global cooperation.","UCL, UCL Energy Inst, London WC1H 0NN, England",University of London; University College London,"de Larragan, JD (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Energy Inst, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",j.decendra@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,68,1,1,5,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

This is reflected in polarized opinions, contradictory findings, and lack of understanding on the state of adaptation globally. In this paper, we outline key methodological considerations necessary for adaptation tracking research to produce systematic, rigorous, comparable, and usable insights that can capture the current state of adaptation globally, provide the basis for characterizing and evaluating adaptations taking place, facilitate examination of what conditions explain differences in adaptation action across jurisdictions, and can underpin the monitoring of change in adaptation over time. Specifically, we argue that approaches to adaptation tracking need to (i) utilize a consistent and operational conceptualization of adaptation, (ii) focus on comparable units of analysis, (iii) use and develop comprehensive datasets on adaptation action, and (iv) be coherent with our understanding of what constitutes real adaptation.

The North Sea Region, a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, is particularly affected due to rising sea level and a changing water balance. Water management plays a key role in sustainable management of natural and societal resources. This paper presents a participatory study of community approaches to regional adaptation to climate change. Water management adaptation options to regional climate induced changes until 2050 were developed together with stakeholders for the Wesermarsch County (Northern Germany). Available information on expected regional climate change and a modelling study on hydrological change suggested that adaptation of water management will be required until 2050. A regional stakeholder forum formulated a vision on how the Wesermarsch should look like in 2050. Following the holistic approach of collaborative planning, two stakeholder groups developed an adaptation portfolio on how urban and rural areas could adapt their water management to cope with the expected changes. Since most of the stakeholders do not want the county to undergo significant changes in terms of landscape and land use, they proposed technical measures to enforce flood protection and enhance the performance of the existing water management system. Adaptation in terms of land use change was not proposed although information on comparable examples from similar regions was available. To justify the proposed adaptation options, available information on expected climate change impacts was used selectively. Uncertainty in model projections was partly ignored to legitimate suggesting inflexible (technical) adaptation measures. However, collaborative planning proved to be helpful for a joint adaptation to climate change at the regional scale.

In this research we use general systems theory to describe how farmers use the three types of system regulators (aggregation, error control and anticipation) to manage variability in the environment. We present codling moth management as an example of system regulation in agriculture. We found that adaptation to climate change is likely to require that farmers modify the structure of their farm systems by changing their combination of system regulators. Decisions regarding changes in structure may favour certain types or system regulators over others. This has implications for policy development to support farm adaptation.

Therefore, this study proposes a water-centric nexus approach for the agriculture and forest sectors for improving the response to climate change in the Korean Peninsula. Two spatial models, i.e., Environmental Policy Integrated Climate and Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs, were used to assess the extent of changes in agricultural water demand, forest water supply, and their balance at the watershed level in the current and future climatic conditions. Climate changed has increased the agricultural water demand and forest water supply significantly in all future scenarios and periods. Comparing the results with RCP8.5 2070s and the baseline, the agricultural water demand and forest water supply increased by 35% and 28%, respectively. Water balance assessment at the main watershed level in the Korean Peninsula revealed that although most scenarios of the future water supply increases offset the demand growth, a risk to water balance exists in case of a low forest ratio or smaller watershed. For instance, the western plains, which are the granary regions of South and North Korea, indicate a higher risk than other areas. These results show that the land-use balance can be an essential factor in a water-centric adaptation to climate change. Ultimately, the water-centric nexus approach can make synergies by overcoming increasing water demands attributable to climate change.","[Lim, Chul-Hee] Kookmin Univ, Coll Gen Educ, 77 Jeongneungro, Seoul 02707, South Korea; [Lim, Chul-Hee] Kookmin Univ, Inst Forest Sci, 77 Jeongneungro, Seoul 02707, South Korea",Kookmin University; Kookmin University,"Lim, CH (corresponding author), Kookmin Univ, Coll Gen Educ, 77 Jeongneungro, Seoul 02707, South Korea.;Lim, CH (corresponding author), Kookmin Univ, Inst Forest Sci, 77 Jeongneungro, Seoul 02707, South Korea.",clim@kookmin.ac.kr,,"Lim, Chul-Hee/0000-0001-7752-0694",National Research Foundation of Korea grant of the Ministry of Science and ICT [2019R1C1C1004979]; Kookmin University grant,National Research Foundation of Korea grant of the Ministry of Science and ICT(National Research Foundation of Korea); Kookmin University grant,"This research was funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea grant of the Ministry of Science and ICT (No. 2019R1C1C1004979), and Kookmin University grant.",,70,3,3,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,AUG,2021,11,8,,,,,,,1657,10.3390/agronomy11081657,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11081657,,,20,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,UF5WG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000688643500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The influence of climate variability on flooding was evaluated by an analysis of sedimentary (palaeofloods) and documentary archives. A 500-year palaeoflood record at Montilea River (657 km(2) in catchment area), eastern Spain, revealed up to 31 palaeofloods with a range of discharges of 20-950 m(3) s(-1), and with at least five floods exceeding 740-950 m(3) s(-1). This information contrasts with the available gauged flood registers (since year 1971) with an annual maximum daily discharge of 129 m(3) s(-1). Our palaeoflood dataset indicates flood cluster episodes at (1) 1570-1620, (2) 1775-1795, (3) 1850-1890, and (4) 1920-1969. Flood rich periods 1 and 3 corresponded to cooler than usual (about 0.3 degrees C and 0.2 degrees C) climate oscillations, whereas 2 and 4 were characterised by higher inter-annual climatic variability (floods and droughts). This high inter-annual rainfall variability increased over the last 150 years, leading to a reduction of annual maximum flow. Flood quantiles (>50 years) calculated from palaeoflood+gauged data showed 30%-40% higher peak discharges than those using only instrumental records, whereas when increasing the catchment area (1500 km(2)) the discharge estimation variance decreased to-15%. The results reflect the higher sensitivity of small catchments to changes on flood magnitude and frequency due to climate variability whereas a larger catchment buffers the response due to the limited extent of convective storms. Our findings show that extended flood records provide robust knowledge about hazardous flooding that can assist in the prioritization of low-regret actions for flood-risk adaptation to climate change.","[Benito, Gerardo; Calle, Mikel; Machado, Maria J.] CSIC, Natl Museum Nat Sci MNCN, Dept Geol, Serrano 115 Bis, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Sanchez-Moya, Yolanda] Univ Complutense Madrid, CSIC, Inst Geociencias, Fac CC Geol, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Medialdea, Alicia] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; [Barriendos, Mariano] Univ Barcelona, Dept Hist & Archaeol, Montalegre 6, Barcelona 08001, Spain; [Rico, Mayte] CSIC, Pyrenean Inst Ecol IPE, Avda Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Sopena, Alfonso] Univ Complutense Madrid, CSIC, Inst Geociencias, Madrid 28006, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Complutense University of Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC-UCM - Instituto de Geociencias (IGEO); University of Cologne; University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Complutense University of Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC-UCM - Instituto de Geociencias (IGEO),"Benito, G (corresponding author), CSIC, Natl Museum Nat Sci MNCN, Dept Geol, Serrano 115 Bis, Madrid 28006, Spain.",benito@mncn.csic.es; yol@ucm.es; amediald@uni-koeln.de; barriendos@telefonica.net; m.calle@mncn.csic.es; mayterico68@gmail.com; sopena@ucm.es; machado@mncn.csic.es,"Sanchez-Moya, Yolanda/S-4862-2019; Calle, Mikel/B-7143-2019; Medialdea, Alicia/S-1424-2019; Benito, Gerardo/E-5456-2013; Calle, Mikel/AAZ-8329-2020","Sanchez-Moya, Yolanda/0000-0002-1966-3838; Calle, Mikel/0000-0003-1590-6772; Medialdea, Alicia/0000-0001-5895-0736; Benito, Gerardo/0000-0003-0724-1790; ","Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through the project Assessment and modelling eco-hydrological and sedimentary responses in Mediterranean catchments for climate and environmental change adaptation EPHIMED - European FEDER funds [CGL2017-86839-C3-1-R]","Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through the project Assessment and modelling eco-hydrological and sedimentary responses in Mediterranean catchments for climate and environmental change adaptation EPHIMED - European FEDER funds","This research was funded by the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through the project Assessment and modelling eco-hydrological and sedimentary responses in Mediterranean catchments for climate and environmental change adaptation EPHIMED (CGL2017-86839-C3-1-R) co-financed with European FEDER funds.",,80,5,6,5,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,APR,2020,12,4,,,,,,,1008,10.3390/w12041008,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12041008,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,LX0JR,,"Green Published, Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000539527500085,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Sustainable Development Goals and the Climate Agenda have placed great emphasis on collaborative frameworks and the private sector's crucial contribution to closing the climate gap in terms of investment and leadership in innovation. However, there has not been a concise follow-up and assessment of the private sector's practical involvement and contribution, whether policy and legislative frameworks and planning approaches are suitable to enable this involvement, and who would lead in delivering the climate agenda locally. The present article addresses this gap reporting on case observations regarding the delivery of climate interest and sustainability through urban development in London and Copenhagen-two European cities of different sizes and varying government approaches. Thereby, the article assesses patterns of private-sector involvement and governance around climate adaptation and mitigation and locates gaps around its involvement in delivering the climate agenda. The analysis clarifies overarching differences in governance and frameworks for the involvement of the private sector between the two cities, attributing this on the local level partly to city size and scale, but to a great extent to 'city leadership' in the built environment and sustainable urban innovation in general. A crucial finding highlights the importance that cities further establish platforms for collaborative learning, specifically around pilot urban projects, thereby stimulating voluntary private engagement. Another key finding is in the potential effectiveness of strategies by public agencies such as city governments to incentivise private actors and simultaneously monitor sustainability effects both broadly at the city level, and specifically at urban project level using ecological, circular and life-cycle approaches. Further implications of the analysis point to the importance of developing a more nuanced approach to understanding the different roles fulfilled by the 'private sector' in the built environment and the necessity of creating an information base addressing the life cycle of development projects and business processes and comparing their impacts. The situation also necessitates considering efforts, impacts, climate finances and data on the broad city scale. The findings of this article can inspire further research, benefit further action in these cities and inform international efforts about climate gaps related to climate adaptation and mitigation.","[Alkhani, Roudaina] Univ Westminster, Sch Architecture & Cities, FHEA, London W1W 7BY, England",University of Westminster,"Alkhani, R (corresponding author), Univ Westminster, Sch Architecture & Cities, FHEA, London W1W 7BY, England.",r.alkhani@westminster.ac.uk,,,,,,,124,8,8,1,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2020,12,20,,,,,,,8431,10.3390/su12208431,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12208431,,,35,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OI1US,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000583073100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Characteristics of residents like races are often associated with differing levels of vulnerability to climate disasters. Developing adaptation strategies that provide just and equal protection to diverse population groups has become an urgent concern. Here, we examine the spatial and quantitative dis-tribution of 3,466 adaptation actions reported over the past five years among 983 U.S. urban counties with different racial groups and socioeconomic statuses. Our findings reveal significant and growing disparities in climate adaptation among U.S. urban counties with overrepresented White, Black and Asian residents. We also find that the local level of disaster exposure plays an unignorable role in deriving racial disparities in adaptation actions. Disaster exposure, characterized by expected annual loss, has a stronger impact on adaptation policy-making in urban counties with high proportions of Asian or Black residents, compared to those with high pro-portions of White residents. With limited adaptation resources, focusing heavily on areas with high exposure to disaster damages might hinder adaptation actions to protect vulnerable individuals, households and communities and thus exacerbates racial disparities in climate adaptation and causes adaptation failure of racially minority groups. Our study provides novel empirical evidence for researchers and decision-makers on the evaluation of justice in climate adaptation. The co-present disparities between climate disaster exposure and adaptation ac-tions can serve as an indicator of the societal need for adaptation actions to be equally developed and implemented.","[Liu, Tong; Fan, Chao] Clemson Univ, Coll Engn Comp & Appl Sci, S Palmetto Blvd, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Clemson University,"Liu, T (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Coll Engn Comp & Appl Sci, S Palmetto Blvd, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",tliu2@g.clemson.edu; cfan@g.clemson.edu,,,,,,,61,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

This study evaluated the vulnerability of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to climate change for 2050 to 2079 in Maine, U.S.A., and the potential of changing variety and planting date as climate adaptation strategies. The DSSAT model v4.7 was calibrated and evaluated for contrasting varieties of potato (Atlantic, a mid-season variety, and Russet Burbank, a late-season variety) and barley (Robust, a 6-row feed variety, and Newdale, a 2-row malting variety) using 99 field experiments conducted in Maine. The model accurately simulated observed final yield for each variety with modeling efficiencies (EF) ranging from 0.60 to 0.84 and coefficients of determination (r(2)) above 0.98. Climate change simulations compared crop yield across multiple planting dates for one baseline period (1989-2018) and four future climate scenarios (two emissions scenarios, RCP 6.0 and 8.5, with and without elevated CO2). In the absence of elevated CO2, yield of the potato variety Atlantic, and both barley varieties declined by 6 to 27% under elevated temperature and precipitation, but increased by 5% for the potato variety Russet Burbank. However, under future climate conditions and elevated CO2, yield of all potato and barley varieties increased or were unchanged. Optimal planting date for each variety was consistent across climate scenarios. These results suggest that climate change may favor longer-season varieties such as Russet Burbank, but adjusting planting date may not be an effective climate change adaptation strategy in this region. Elevated CO2 boosted crop growth and development across all varieties for a humid continental climate and for the time period studied. The models used do not address climate change's possible effects on crop quality or losses due to plant diseases and pests.","[Tooley, Brogan E.; Mallory, Ellen B.; Porter, Gregory A.] Univ Maine, Sch Food & Agr, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Hoogenboom, Gerrit] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL USA; [Hoogenboom, Gerrit] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Mallory, EB (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Food & Agr, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",brogan.tooley@maine.edu; ellen.mallory@maine.edu; porter@maine.edu; gerrit@ufl.edu,"Hoogenboom, Gerrit/F-3946-2010","Hoogenboom, Gerrit/0000-0002-1555-0537; Mallory, Ellen/0000-0001-8962-8854","USDA-NIFA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative [2016-67003-24822]; USDA-NIFA through the Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station [Hatch project] [ME021815]; NASA Earth Science/Applied Science Program; NIFA [810655, 2016-67003-24822] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",USDA-NIFA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative; USDA-NIFA through the Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station [Hatch project]; NASA Earth Science/Applied Science Program; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"The authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. Robert Larkin of the USDA New England Plant, Soil and Environment Lab for sharing data for model evaluation, Dr. Sean Birkel for expert advice on climate models, Dr. Patricio Sanda ~na for serving as a sabbatical host, and Tom Molloy, Joseph Cannon, Sam Sheppard, Katie O'Brien, Issac Mazzeo, and Elizabeth Damon for technical assistance in the field.

It is expected that the patterns of household resilience factors and adaptation practices have a strong linkage with household food security. The purpose of this paper is to seek an effective technique of adaptation for food security and the required types of support for adaptation to food insecurity among the poor and low-income households in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach This study was based on primary data that were collected in July-October 2012 through a questionnaire survey among 460 poor and low-income households from the Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu states of Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database based on a two-stage cluster random sampling technique. The study considered household food security as household food availability and food accessibility, and ran ordinal regressions to find out the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security. Findings The study concludes that several resilience factors and adaptation practices were statistically significant to household food security, and several external supports were statistically and significantly needed to ensure household food security. Therefore, to ensure sustainable household food security in Malaysia, the food security programs need to be integrated with sustainable development goals (SDGs) and climatic changes adaptation programs, and the involvement of relevant stakeholders are crucial. Originality/value This study is a pioneer work based on primary data that empirically measured the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security in Malaysia. This study also discussed some issues related to the climate change linkage, which would help future climate change research. The findings of the study will be beneficial for all the stakeholders, including policy makers related to the food security and climate change adaptation.","[Alam, Md.

Across much of the world a command-and-control philosophy continues to assert human authority over rivers. Tasked to treat rivers as stable and predictable entities, engineers have 'fixed rivers in place' and 'locked them in time'. Unsustainable outcomes ensue. Legacy effects and path dependencies of silenced and strangled (zombified) rivers are difficult and increasingly expensive to address. Nature fights back, and eventually it wins, with disastrous consequences for the environment, society, culture and the economy. The failure to meet the trans-formative potential of nature-based applications is expressed here as a disregard for 'Truths of the Riverscape'. The first truth emphasises the imperative to respect diversity, protecting and/or enhancing the distinctive values and attributes of each and every river. A cross-scalar (nested hierarchical) lens underpins practices that'know your catchment The second truth envisages management practices that work with processes, interpreting the behaviour of each river. This recognises that erosion and deposition are intrinsic functions of a healthy living river-in appropriate places, at appropriate rates. This premise underpins the third truth, assess river condition, highlighting the importance of what to measure and what to measure against in approaches that address the causes rather than the symptoms of unexpected river adjustment. The fourth truth interprets evolutionary trajectory to determine what is realistically achievable in the management of a given river system. Analysis of whether the river sits on a degradation or recovery pathway (i.e., condition is deteriorating or improving), alongside assessment of catchment-specific recovery potential, is used to foresight river futures. Viewed collectively, Truths of the Riverscape provide a coherent platform to develop and apply proactive and precautionary catchment management plans that address concerns for biodiversity loss and climate change adaptation.","[Brierley, Gary] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Fryirs, Kirstie] Macquarie Univ, Sch Nat Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",University of Auckland; Macquarie University,"Brierley, G (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",g.brierley@auckland.ac.nz,,"Fryirs, Kirstie/0000-0003-0541-3384; Brierley, Gary/0000-0002-1310-1105",,,,,191,5,5,6,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2196-4092,,,GEOSCI LETT,Geosci.

A predominant approach to vulnerability assessment is indicator-based, wherein variables are aggregated to assess the vulnerability of units in a system (e.g., neighborhoods in a city). Here we show that a particular evidence-based predictive statistics approach can address two shortcomings of the most commonly-used indicator-based approach: lack of a means of validation and problematic weighting of individual indicators. We demonstrate how robust evidence-based models can produce frameworks that overcome these limitations. Using the case study of Hurricane Sandy in the State of New Jersey, we conducted two-pronged validated vulnerability assessments, based on insurance claim payouts and assistance grants. The latter needs-based assessment shows that Minorities are substantially more vulnerable than others based on a significant negative association with assistance approval rate (approved claims divided by all claims). Our findings highlight issues discussed in the literature within the context of climate justice and equity. Such an approach is helpful locally, but also when adaptation plans are developed over broad scales of time and space considering disparities between regions or across multiple jurisdictions.","[Barankin, Ram A.; Kirshen, Paul; Bowen, Robert E.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Portman, Michelle E.] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Haifa, Israel",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Barankin, RA (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",ram.barankin@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,1,1,4,9,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9375,,FRONT WATER,Front.

However, ignoring the complex and contested histories of nation-state colonisation can result in naive adaptation plans that increase vulnerability. Here, through a case study in central Australia, we investigate the conditions under which co-production between scientific and Indigenous knowledge can support climate change adaptation pathways among place-attached Indigenous communities. A research team including scientists, Ltyentye Apurte Rangers and other staff from the Central Land Council first undertook activities to co-produce climate change presentations in the local Arrernte language; enable community members to identify potential adaptation actions; and implement one action, erosion control. Second, we reflected on the outcomes of these activities in order to unpack deeper influences. Applying the theory of articulation complexes, we show how ideologies, institutions and economies have linked Indigenous societies and the establishing Australian nation-state since colonisation. The sequence of complexes characterised as frontier, mission, pastoral, land-rights, community-development and re-centralisation, which is current, have both enabled and constrained adaptation options. We found knowledge co-production generates adaptation pathways when: (1) effective methods for knowledge co-production are used, based on deeply respectful partnerships, cultural governance and working together through five co-production tasks-prepare, communicate, discuss, bring together and apply; (2) Indigenous people have ongoing connection to their traditional territories to maintain their Indigenous knowledge; (3) the relationship between the Indigenous people and the nation-state empowers local decision-making and learning, which requires and creates consent, trust, accountability, reciprocity, and resurgence of Indigenous culture, knowledge and practices. These conditions foster the emergence of articulation complexes that enable the necessary transformative change from the colonial legacies. Both these conditions and our approach are likely to be relevant for place-attached Indigenous peoples across the globe in generating climate adaptation pathways.","[Hill, Rosemary] CSIRO, Cairns, Australia; [Hill, Rosemary] James Cook Univ, Div Trop Environm & Soc, Cairns, Australia; [Walsh, Fiona J.] 9 Raggatt St, Alice Springs, NT, Australia; [Davies, Jocelyn] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Alice Springs, NT, Australia; [Sparrow, Ashley] Arthur Rylah Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Wiser, Russell M.] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Tengo, Maria] Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); James Cook University; Charles Darwin University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Stockholm University,"Hill, R (corresponding author), CSIRO, Cairns, Australia.;Hill, R (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Div Trop Environm & Soc, Cairns, Australia.",ro.hill@csiro.au,"Tengö, Maria/AAC-5698-2020; Davies, Jocelyn/D-7058-2011; Hill, Rosemary/A-6954-2011","Tengö, Maria/0000-0002-4776-3748; Davies, Jocelyn/0000-0001-7829-7527; Hill, Rosemary/0000-0002-7426-3132",CSIRO Land and Water Flagship; Ninti One Ltd.; Central Land Council Ltyentye Apurte (Santa Teresa) Rangers; Tangentyere Council Aboriginal Corporation Land and Learning Program; National Environmental Science Program's Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub; Indigenous Land Corporation,CSIRO Land and Water Flagship; Ninti One Ltd.; Central Land Council Ltyentye Apurte (Santa Teresa) Rangers; Tangentyere Council Aboriginal Corporation Land and Learning Program; National Environmental Science Program's Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub; Indigenous Land Corporation,"This research was supported by a partnership between the CSIRO Land and Water Flagship and Ninti One Ltd., working in collaboration with the Central Land Council Ltyentye Apurte (Santa Teresa) Rangers and the Tangentyere Council Aboriginal Corporation Land and Learning Program.

Despite the increasing and broadening use of adaptation pathways reported in the literature, there has not yet been a systematic attempt to review, compare and contrast approaches to adaptation pathways design and their application. In this paper we address this gap through a literature review of conceptual and applied studies of adaptation pathways in the context of climate change. Adaptation pathways started to be conceptualised in 2010. They have become recognised as sequences of actions, which can be implemented progressively, depending on how the future unfolds and the development of knowledge. A difference between scholars is whether pathways are understood as alternative sequences of measures to realise a well-defined adaptation objective, or as broad directions of change for different strategic aims or outcomes. Analysis of case studies on adaptation pathways development showed three clusters of approaches: (a) performance-threshold oriented, (b) multi-stakeholder oriented, and (c) transformation oriented approaches. These broadly correspond to three desired outcomes of pathways development: (i) meeting short and long-term adaptation needs, (ii) promoting collaborative learning, adaptive planning and adaptive capacity, (iii) accounting for complexity and long-term change, including a potential need for transformation. Yet, as of now there is little evidence of the utility of different approaches for pathways development in different decision contexts. Scholars appear to be guided more by how they understand the adaptation problem and by what approaches are known to them, than by the context of the case.

Based on the review, we present a learning framework to guide systematic reflection about why and how adaptation pathways are developed.

Relocations are particularly relevant for small island regions, where sea-level-rise-induced retreat from the coast will be inevitable for some communities. However, relocations are contested because communities are generally reluctant to move, and decision-makers face high political risks. As a consequence, relocations mostly occur after extreme events. In such situations, existing rules can be undermined by politics and power, driving relocation policy and resulting in varying relocation outcomes. However, these political and policy dimensions of post-disaster relocations have received little attention. Here, we study the politics and power dynamics of two post-tsunami relocations in the Maldives. Using process tracing, we find that vested interests, rather than adaptation considerations, explain varying relocation outcomes. Our findings highlight the complex power structures inherent in post-disaster relocations, which explain why similar events and drivers did not produce similar outcomes.","[Gussmann, Geronimo; Hinkel, Jochen] Global Climate Forum, Neue Promenade 6, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Gussmann, Geronimo; Hinkel, Jochen] Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst, Invalidenstr 42, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Gussmann, G (corresponding author), Global Climate Forum, Neue Promenade 6, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.;Gussmann, G (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst, Invalidenstr 42, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",geronimo.gussmann@globalclimateforum.org,,"Hinkel, Jochen/0000-0001-7590-992X; Gussmann, Geronimo/0000-0002-3451-0370",INSeaPTION project; BMBF; MINECO; NOW; ANR; European Union [690462]; Dutch Research Council (NWO),INSeaPTION project; BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); MINECO(Spanish Government); NOW; ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); European Union(European Commission); Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This research is funded by the INSeaPTION project which is part of ERA4CS, an ERA-NET initiated by JPI Climate, and funded by BMBF (DE), MINECO (ES), NOW (NL) and ANR (FR) with co-funding by the European Union (Grant 690462) and Dutch Research Council (NWO).

Here we investigate whether climate change may limit water availability for a proposed coal-fired (CF) power station site with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). We find that climate change may pose constraints on water availability, and that regulatory constraints on water abstraction licences may affect CF electricity generation with CCS. The regulatory constraints associated with the current misalignment of water and energy policies are explored through interviews with stakeholders. We find that water availability has not been identified as a potential limiting factor for future CF electricity generation with CCS and that current UK energy policy, combined with economic and historical factors, may exacerbate the water demand of CF electricity generation with CCS.

In order to prioritize, design and implement interventions to adapt to climate change, it is essential to adopt a coherent and consistent set of definitions and frameworks for examining vulnerability, adaptation and adaptive capacity. In practice, a variety of definitions of vulnerability and adaptation are found in the literature. This paper uses the base of literature from the context of the coastal impacts of climate change to draw some explicit linkages between the objectives of vulnerability and adaptation assessment and the definitions used in the analysis. We find that such a linkage is helpful for identifying the nature of assessment required, and the data and information necessary.

A typology can inform stakeholders about the physical hazards a coastal town or small city may be exposed currently and in the future; identify the impact that may have to the local population and the economic, cultural, and environmental assets in the settlement; and identify any barriers or opportunities to plan, develop, and implement adaptation strategies. A typology is presented here that includes 34 parameters that cover physical, economic, environmental and social characteristics. This typology has been used within this Special Issue to obtain information about all 22 case studies of the Special Issue.

Drawing on the energy situation in Niger Republic, it argues that redressing gender concerns is critical to mitigating the impact of climate changes and energy poverty in the Sahelean country. A gender sensitivity analysis reveals that Niger is a take-off stage, a state of gender equity verified from the willingness of men to support women, as well as the entrepreneurial mindset of respondents coupled with supporting policies at both macro and micro levels. The study nonetheless recommends a more significant continental effort toward gender integration in energy planning processes. It also justifies the pursuance of alternative livelihood activities and an adjustment of policy frameworks towards universal energy access by 2030, as a means to breaking the vicious circle of limited income, increased vulnerability and narrowed opportunities that thwart gender equality and mainstreaming efforts in the country and across Africa.","[Antwi, Sarpong Hammond] Pan African Univ, Inst Water & Energy Sci Including Climate Change, BP 119, Tilimsen 13000, Algeria",,"Antwi, SH (corresponding author), Pan African Univ, Inst Water & Energy Sci Including Climate Change, BP 119, Tilimsen 13000, Algeria.",antwisarpong1@gmail.com,"Antwi, Hammond Sarpong/AAS-2947-2021",,Risk Assessment and Reduction Strategies for Sustainable Urban Resource Supply in Sub-Saharan Africa (RARSUS/RARSUS-SEMALI) Project in Niger; Risk Assessment and Reduction Strategies for Sustainable Urban Resource Supply in Sub-Saharan Africa (RARSUS/RARSUS-SEMALI) Project in Mali,Risk Assessment and Reduction Strategies for Sustainable Urban Resource Supply in Sub-Saharan Africa (RARSUS/RARSUS-SEMALI) Project in Niger; Risk Assessment and Reduction Strategies for Sustainable Urban Resource Supply in Sub-Saharan Africa (RARSUS/RARSUS-SEMALI) Project in Mali,"This paper is part of a Master of Science research on Community Acceptability of Renewable Energy and its Implication for Climate Actions in Africa: the case of Niger supervised by Dr Debora Ley of the Environmental Change Institute, School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford, UK, with funding from the Risk Assessment and Reduction Strategies for Sustainable Urban Resource Supply in Sub-Saharan Africa (RARSUS/RARSUS-SEMALI) Projects in Niger and Mali.",,65,2,2,2,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0343-2521,1572-9893,,GEOJOURNAL,GeoJournal,FEB,2022,87,1,,,,,183,195,,10.1007/s10708-020-10246-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-020-10246-9,,JUN 2020,13,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,ZI9VZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000543009000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Local officials are proud of their strengthened role in disaster response and they are eager to boost investment in infrastructure. They have struggled to reinforce their legitimacy among their constituents, but given the shifting roles of the state, private sector, and civil society, and the undiminished emphasis on high-risk development models, their responsibilities for responding to emerging climate change scenarios are increasingly nebulous.

This paper offers empirical insights regarding decision-making politics in the context of collective learning through participatory scenario building and flexible flood management and planning in the Eastern Brahmaputra Basin of Assam, India. By foregrounding intergroup and intragroup power dynamics in such collective learning spaces and how they intersect with existing micropolitics of adaptation on the ground, we examine opportunities for and limitations to challenging entrenched authority and subjectivities. Our results suggest that emancipatory agency can indeed emerge but is likely to be fluid and multifaceted. Community actors who are best positioned to resist higher-level domination may well be imbricated in oppression at home.

Both bodies of work are nevertheless framed within a view of the future that is recognizable from the present, a future reached via socioecological change that is gradual rather than transformative or catastrophic. In this article, we acknowledge the agency of extreme biophysical forces and ask what everyday household life might be like in an unstable future significantly different from the present. We revisit our own longitudinal empirical research examining household sustainability and reinterpret key results in a more volatile frame influenced by political ecological work on disasters. We seek to move beyond incremental to transformative conceptions of change and invert vulnerability as capacity. Vulnerability and capacity are contingent temporally and spatially and experienced intersubjectively. The resources for survival are ultimately social and therefore compel closer scrutiny of, among other things, household life.","[Gibson, Chris; Head, Lesley; Carr, Chantel] Univ Wollongong, Australian Ctr Cultural Environm Res, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Gibson, C (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Dept Geog & Sustainable Commun, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",cgibson@uow.edu.au; lhead@uow.edu.au; cac900@uowmail.edu.au,"Gibson, Chris/A-7733-2011","Gibson, Chris/0000-0002-7242-8255; Head, Lesley/0000-0002-5114-7614; Carr, Chantel/0000-0002-1541-2409","Australian Research Council [DP0986041, FT0991193, FL0992397]; Australian Research Council [DP0986041, FT0991193] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This research was funded by the Australian Research Council (DP0986041, FT0991193, and FL0992397).",,61,27,28,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

This paper studies impacts of rainfall variability and changing return periods of rainfall extremes on cost-effective adaptation of water systems to climate change given a predefined system performance target, for example a flood risk standard. Rainfall variability causes system performance estimates to be volatile. These estimates may be used to recurrently evaluate system performance. This paper presents a model for this setting, and develops a solution method to identify cost-effective investments in stormwater drainage adaptations. Runoff and water levels are simulated with rainfall from stationary rainfall distributions, and time series of annual rainfall maxima are simulated for a climate scenario. Cost-effective investment strategies are determined by dynamic programming. The method is applied to study the choice of volume for a storage basin in a Dutch polder. We find that 'white noise', i.e. trend-free variability of rainfall, might cause earlier re-investment than expected under projected changes in rainfall. The risk of early re-investment may be reduced by increasing initial investment. This can be cost-effective if the investment involves fixed costs. Increasing initial investments, therefore, not only increases water system robustness to structural changes in rainfall, but could also offer insurance against additional costs that would occur if system performance is underestimated and re-investment becomes inevitable.

In a Dutch-German case study in the Rhine delta, we explore the range of strategies that policy entrepreneurs employ in cross-border water management to effectively anchor and embed climate adaptation in the water policy debate. We focus on climate adaptation on the local and regional scale in the Deltarhine region where increased flooding and prolonged drought periods are expected under the current climate change scenarios with a considerable impact on flood protection, agricultural activities, drinking water and ecosystem development. We analyse the impact of policy entrepreneurs while coping with the challenging cross-border setting and dealing with structural differences in national systems such as the legal and institutional framework. It is shown that whilst the European water guidelines advocate a river basin approach across borders, the guidelines do not (yet) play a catalyst role regarding climate adaptation, and the presence and activities of policy entrepreneurs contribute in putting climate adaptation on the cross-border policy agenda. Finally, marked differences in the presence of entrepreneurs in Germany and the Netherlands are observed for which two important complementary explanations are offered relating to contextual elements of power asymmetry and dependency as well as different policy styles and organisational cultures in both countries.","[Renner, Tobias] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, POB 9010, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Meijerink, Sander] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Renner, T (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, POB 9010, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands.",tobias.renner@rhdhv.com; s.meijerink@fm.ru.nl,"Meijerink, Sander V/D-6490-2012","Meijerink, Sander V/0000-0002-4249-6230",,,,,36,10,11,3,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

In recent years, many countries have gradually adopted adaption strategies to climate change, with the aim of reducing the impact of climate variabilities. Taiwan is in a geographical location that is prone to natural disasters and is thus very vulnerable to climate change. To explore an appropriate method for Taiwan to adapt to climate change, this study took Dajia River Basin as the simulation site to explore the potential climate change impact in the area. An impact study was conducted to identify the trend of flooding under climate change scenarios. We used the SOBEK model to simulate downstream inundation caused by the worst typhoon event of the 20th century (1979-2003) and for typhoon events that might occur at the end of the 21st century (2075-2099) in Taiwan, according to the climate change scenario of representative concentration pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) and dynamical downscaling rainfall data. Agricultural lands were found to be the most affected areas among all land types, and the flooded area was forecast to increase by 1.89 times by the end of 21st century, when compared to the end of 20th century. In this study, upland crops, which are affected the most by flooding, were selected as the adaptation targets for this site and multiple engineering and non-engineering options were presented to reduce the potential climate change impacts. With respect to the results, we found that all adaptation options, even when considering the cost, yield higher benefits than the do-nothing option. Among the adaptation options presented for this site, utilizing engineering methods with non-engineering methods show the best result in effectively reducing the impact of climate change, with the benefit-to-cost ratio being around 1.16. This study attempts to explore useful and effective assessment methods for providing sound scientific and economic evidence for the selection of adequate adaption options for flood impacts in agriculture in the planning phase.","[Li, Hsin-Chi; Hsiao, Yi-Hua; Chang, Chia-Wei; Chen, Yung-Ming; Lin, Lee-Yaw] Natl Sci & Technol Ctr Disaster Reduct, New Taipei 23143, Taiwan",National Science & Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR),"Li, HC (corresponding author), Natl Sci & Technol Ctr Disaster Reduct, New Taipei 23143, Taiwan.",hsinchi@ncdr.nat.gov.tw; xiaohua@ncdr.nat.gov.tw; joyce3437@ncdr.nat.gov.tw; ymchen@ncdr.nat.gov.tw; yaw@ncdr.nat.gov.tw,,"Chen, Yungming/0000-0001-7265-1927; Li, Hsin-Chi/0000-0002-2191-5440","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST, Taiwan) through Taiwan Climate Change Projection Information and Adaptation Knowledge Platform (TCCIP) project [MOST106-2621-M-865-001]","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST, Taiwan) through Taiwan Climate Change Projection Information and Adaptation Knowledge Platform (TCCIP) project","This research was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST, Taiwan) through Taiwan Climate Change Projection Information and Adaptation Knowledge Platform (TCCIP) project (TCCIP; MOST106-2621-M-865-001).",,26,5,5,1,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,13,,,,,,,7311,10.3390/su13137311,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13137311,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TG0MA,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000671106200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Between 2015 and 2018, the Western Cape Province of South Africa experienced a multi-year severe drought. Projections show that the Western Cape is likely to experience hotter and drier conditions, with more frequent droughts. Without appropriate adaptation actions, climate change is likely to increasingly constrain agricultural activities in the province. Commercial farmers represent a considerable population of decision-makers, which are fundamental to climate change adaptation. Understanding farmers' perceptions is important to develop effective policy, support structures, and communications. This study aimed to understand wheat farmers' and apple producers' perceptions of climate change and adaptation in the Western Cape, South Africa, and establish whether the recent drought offered lessons for adaptation. Study methods included the use of an online questionnaire as well as several in-depth interviews with farmers and producers. Results showed that most farmers and producers agree that climate change is real and is caused by human activities. Most farmers and producers in the region are already actively (or intend to start) preparing for climate change (69%). In response to climate change, apple producers view on-farm water management (such as irrigation management and water recycling) as the most important strategy. Wheat farmers strategies are focused on crop management (including cultivar selection and conservation agriculture). Many farmers and producers further agreed that they had learnt from the past 2015-2018 drought. Notably, results showed that farmers and producers who rely a great deal on weather forecasts were more likely to feel that their farm's response was effective. Furthermore, it was found that farmers and producers who felt they learned from the drought were also more likely to be actively preparing for climate risks. It is recommended that investments into climate change adaptation focus on research and development, particularly with regard to cultivar development, irrigation management, tailored weather forecasting, and localised risk assessments. Policy should prioritise the more vulnerable farmers and producers while focusing on integrated risk reduction measures which account for multiple stressors.","[Theron, S.

Using environmental justice (specifically recognition and procedural) and policy learning literature, we contextualize a three-governance learning typology that emerges through collective actions that may trigger governance structures for policy integration: governance learning by resisting, co-opting, and expanding. We identify what kind of learning is introduced to the existing governance structures in Bergen and Istanbul, and how that learning shapes or is shaped by the governance structures, local government in Bergen and local to national governments in Istanbul, while developing climate adaptation policies and actions.

We analyze transitions of negotiation states and describe how ancillary benefits and first-mover advantages influence agents' behavior in the negotiations, when three different strategies or levels of climate protection efforts are available. Finally, we also integrate strategies to mitigate and to adapt to climate change into the analysis in the (3 x 3) game setting.","[Rubbelke, Dirk T.

Coping with climate change is, first and foremost, a challenge to political decision making and, considering the long-term effects of the climate system, to planning. However, there have never been more doubts that the political-administrative system is able to meet these requirements. Although much evidence has been put forward in favor of such skepticism, sometimes, it is dangerous to overstate the existing limits. Drawing on two case studies in the area of flood risk management in Germany, the article illustrates how and why significant path change came about. In both cases, the state proved to still being a pivotal actor, due to a number of functions that cannot be assumed by other actors. However, other actor groups-such as actors from science, the media, NGOs, and citizen groups-play a significant role as well by providing relevant expertise and influencing the public discourse, thus mobilizing significant political pressure.","[Garrelts, Heiko; Lange, Hellmuth] Univ Bremen, Res Ctr Sustainabil Studies, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Garrelts, H (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Res Ctr Sustainabil Studies, Enrique Schmidt Str 7, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",garrelts@artec.uni-bremen.de; lange@artec.uni-bremen.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),The authors wish to thank the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research for funding the mentioned research projects and the two referees for their helpful comments.,,54,39,39,3,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0044-7447,,,AMBIO,Ambio,MAR,2011,40,2,,,SI,,200,209,,10.1007/s13280-010-0131-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-010-0131-3,,,10,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,715ZB,21446398,"Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000286933300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Freshwater fishing societies are among the most vulnerable to climate change given their dependence on highly threatened aquatic resources. As climate change intensifies, building adaptive capacity within communities and understanding the efficacy of adaptive strategies for maintaining household stability is essential for coping with ongoing social and environmental change. In this study, we examined household perceptions of climate change, livelihood impacts and responses to socio-ecological changes in fishing-dependent households in the Lake Victoria basin in Uganda, East Africa. Through a series of household surveys and focus group discussions in five fish landing sites, we assessed social adaptive capacity (SAC) based on 207 households and identified adaptive strategies that are effective for coping with climatic change. We found that people in fishing households are aware of environmental change but that most households do not have adaptive strategies that are efficacious for securing long-term income and food security. We also investigated household demographics that contribute to SAC, examined links between SAC and adaptive efficacy and established potential routes towards developing effective adaptive approaches in small-scale fisheries. This work contributes to a growing foundation of documented community-based knowledge for building adaptive capacity in inland fisheries and the communities around the world that depend on them.

However, with the full implementation of the Chinese three-child policy, the number of children in families will continue to increase and the cost of raising children will rise, which will have a crowding out effect on the adoption of climate adaptive technologies. In this context, we analyzed the impact and mechanism of child rearing burden on farmers' adoption of climate adaptive technology by Probit model and discussed its heterogeneity based on family life cycle theory. Cross-sectional survey data were collected from 511 farm households in the 3 provinces of China to produce the findings. We found that the child rearing burden had a significant negative impact on farmers' adoption of climate adaptive technology. The impact mechanism analysis showed that the child rearing burden mainly affected farmers' adoption of climate adaptive technology through three paths: risk appetite, economic capital and non-agricultural employment, with non-agricultural employment having the largest impact, followed by risk appetite and finally, economic capital. Furthermore, the effect of child rearing burden on the adoption of climate adaptive technology was heterogeneous amid different family life cycles: In the upbringing and burden period, the child support burden had a significant negative impact on the adoption of climate adaptive technology and the impact was greater in the upbringing period, while in the stable period, the child support burden had a significant positive impact on the adoption of climate adaptive technology. The influence mechanism was also heterogeneous in different family life cycles. This paper not only provides research evidence on the relationship between child rearing burden and farmers' adoption of climate adaptive technology, but also has certain empirical value for the formulation and implementation of supportive measures for improving fertility policies.","[Cui, Min; Zhang, Jizhou; Xia, Xianli] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Xianyang 712100, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China,"Xia, XL (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Xianyang 712100, Peoples R China.",xncuimin@nwafu.edu.cn; zjz611@nwafu.edu.cn; xnxxli@nwafu.edu.cn,"cui, min/HGD-8340-2022",,General Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [21BJY187],General Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China,This study was funded by the General Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (nos. 21BJY187).,,90,0,0,13,49,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,JUN,2022,12,6,,,,,,,854,10.3390/agriculture12060854,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12060854,,,22,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,2P3JN,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000819642100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This attribute is particularly important as the region also plays a key role in the production of bioenergy feedstock. This study focuses on potential change in streamflow, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus due to climate change and land management practices in the South Fork Iowa River (SFIR) watershed, Iowa. The watershed is covered primarily with annual crops (corn and soybeans). With cropland conversion to switchgrass, stover harvest, and implementation of best management practices (BMPs) (such as establishing riparian buffers and applying cover crops), significant reductions in nutrients were observed in the SFIR watershed under historical climate and future climate scenarios. Under a historical climate scenario, suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) at the outlet point of the SFIR watershed could decrease by up to 56.7%, 32.0%, and 16.5%, respectively, compared with current land use when a portion of the cropland is converted to switchgrass and a cover crop is in place. Climate change could cause increases of 9.7% in SS, 4.1% in N, and 7.2% in P compared to current land use. Under future climate scenarios, nutrients including SS, N, and P were reduced through land management and practices and BMPs by up to 54.0% (SS), 30.4% (N), and 7.1% (P). Water footprint analysis further revealed changes in green water that are highly dependent on land management scenarios. The study highlights the versatile approaches in landscape management that are available to address climate change adaptation and acknowledged the complex nature of different perspectives in water sustainability. Further study involving implementing landscape design and management by using long-term monitoring data from field to watershed is necessary to verify the findings and move toward watershed-specific regional programs for climate adaptation.","[Ha, Miae; Wu, May] Argonne Natl Lab, 9700 S Cass Ave, Lemont, IL 60439 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory,"Ha, M (corresponding author), Argonne Natl Lab, 9700 S Cass Ave, Lemont, IL 60439 USA.",mha@anl.gov,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, Bioenergy Technology Office (BETO) of EERE office, under DOE ANL Contract [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","U.S. Department of Energy, Bioenergy Technology Office (BETO) of EERE office, under DOE ANL Contract(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was supported by U.S. Department of Energy, Bioenergy Technology Office (BETO) of EERE office, under DOE ANL Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.

Using participatory mapping and field surveys, we examined the prevalence and characteristics of EbA practices on 300 smallholder coffee and maize farmers in six landscapes in Central America and explored the socioeconomic and biophysical factors associated with their use. The prevalence of individual EbA practices varied across smallholder farms. Common EbA practices included live fences, home gardens, shade trees in coffee plantations, and dispersed trees in maize fields. We found a mean of 3.8 EbA practices per farm. Factors that were correlated with the total number of EbA practices on farms included the mean area of coffee plantations, farmer age, farmer experience, the farm type and the landscape in which farms were located. Factors associated with the presence or characteristics of individual EbA practices included the size of coffee plantations, farmer experience, farmer education, land tenure, landscape and farm type. Our analysis suggests that many smallholder farmers in Central America are already using certain EbA practices, but there is still scope for greater implementation. Policy makers, donors and technicians can encourage the broader use of EbA by smallholder farmers by facilitating fanner-to-farmer exchanges to share knowledge on EbA implementation, assessing the effectiveness of EbA practices in delivering adaptation benefits, and tailoring EbA policies and programs for smallholder farmers in different socioeconomic and biophysical contexts.","[Harvey, Celia A.; Martinez-Rodriguez, M.

Institutions in this respect are the rules that shape the interactions of actors in different phases of climate adaptation. Currently there is no comprehensive method to systematically identify and map dependencies between institutions. This study proposes the Institutional Network Analysis (INA) approach that is based on the Institutional Grammar as a systematic and comprehensive tool to (1) visualise institutional dependencies, (2) identify points of concern in the institutional landscape such as conflicts and voids, and (3) provide quantitative insights into the centrality of actors, embeddedness of institutional outcomes, and dependencies between institutions. The approach is applied to the case of climate adaptation of transport infrastructures surrounding the Port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The analysis reveals a conflict in the use of risk assessment criteria, as parties in the Port may follow their own matrices in the presence of a shared decision-making framework. Nonetheless, the network metric analysis reveals that the criteria, whether shared or individual, build on the same source of risk analysis, suggesting that this duality may not be detrimental for climate adaptation efforts. Additionally, an institutional void is identified for financial responsibilities in locations where infrastructures overlap. Finally, the network metrics show high dependency between institutions in the risk dialogue phase, and reveal the centrality of infrastructure owners ProRail and RWS in the institutional landscape instead of local or regional governmental bodies.","[Mesdaghi, Batoul; Ghorbani, Amineh; de Bruijne, Mark] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Ghorbani, A (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands.",a.ghorbani@tudelft.nl,,,,,,,61,2,2,2,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Finally, this paper adopts a novel linguistic style, based on an informal format, in order to explore the set-up and follow-up of the Hydrological Service's initiatives, with the final aim of sparking curiosity and building awareness, from different sectors and disciplines, which, ultimately, may benefit from the presented approaches.","[Allodi, Alessandro; Angelo, Letizia; Bordini, Fabio; Branchi, Monica; Comune, Elisa; Del Longo, Mauro; Nicolosi, Giuseppe; Noberini, Mauro; Pizzera, Filippo; Pugliese, Alessio; Ricciardi, Giuseppe; Tonelli, Fabrizio; Tugnoli, Franca; Zenoni, Enrica] Reg Agcy Prevent Environm & Energy Emilia Romagna, I-40139 Bologna, Italy",Regional Environmental Protection Agency - Italy,"Ricciardi, G (corresponding author), Reg Agcy Prevent Environm & Energy Emilia Romagna, I-40139 Bologna, Italy.",aallodi@arpae.it; langelo@arpae.it; fbordini@arpae.it; mbranchi@arpae.it; ecomune@arpae.it; mdellongo@arpae.it; gnicolosi@arpae.it; mnoberini@arpae.it; fpizzera@arpae.it; apugliese@arpae.it; gricciardi@arpae.it; ftonelli@arpae.it; ftugnoli@arpae.it; ezenoni@arpae.it,,"Pugliese, Alessio/0000-0003-0403-0533",,,,,19,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,MAR,2022,10,3,,,,,,,32,10.3390/cli10030032,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli10030032,,,16,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,0E8SJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000776944000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The international EbA South project implemented EbA interventions across three countries (Mauritania, Nepal, the Seychelles), piloting the restoration of mountain, desert and coastal ecosystems to enhance the climate resilience of local communities. The experiences of the EbA South project across these distinct ecosystems and socio-economic environments provide unique insights into the adaptive management invariably required within EbA initiatives. This analysis also provides lessons on how to share knowledge among different stakeholders and countries to advance South-South cooperation. SummaryClimate change is having an increasingly negative impact on the world's most vulnerable societies. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) uses biodiversity and ecosystem services to help local communities adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. This approach, which has the potential to be implemented across a wide range of ecosystem types and scales, is increasingly being adopted by governments and international donors within climate change adaptation initiatives. The objective of the EbA South project was to enhance the climate resilience of communities in Mauritania, Nepal, and the Seychelles by building institutional capacity, mobilizing knowledge and transferring EbA technologies based on China's experience in successfully implementing restoration. The project implemented EbA interventions in the drylands of Mauritania, Himalayan forests in Nepal, and the coastal zone of the Seychelles. All interventions were carefully monitored by researchers to generate scientific evidence of the impacts of EbA. Here, we provide implementers of EbA with the major lessons learned from the EbA South project, namely: (a) quantifying the full suite of ecosystem goods and services generated through EbA at a landscape scale; (b) budgeting in advance for management of time-consuming complexities related to socioeconomics and ecology such as land-use conflict, ineffective government structures, disagreements regarding intervention options, and challenging environmental conditions; (c) undertaking long-term research for adaptive management and documenting the project's successes; (d) providing platforms for effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders with different first languages; and (e) regularly adjusting exit strategies for maintenance of the EbA landscapes after closure of the project.","[Mills, Anthony J.] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Soil Sci, ZA-7602 Cape Town, South Africa; [Tan, Diwen; Vijitpan, Tatirose; Cazzetta, Silvia] UNEP Int Ecosyst Management Partnership, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Manji, Atifa K.] UN Environm, Climate Change Adaptat Unit, Ecosyst Div, Nairobi, Kenya; [Henriette, Elvina] Univ Seychelles, Isl Biodivers & Conservat Ctr, Anse Royale, Seychelles; [Murugaiyan, Pugazhendhi] Minist Environm Energy & Climate Change, Mahe, Seychelles; [Pantha, Ram H.] Minist Populat & Environm, Climate Change Sect, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Lafdal, Mohamed Y.] Minist Environm & Dev Durable MEDD, Nouakchott, Mauritania; [Soule, Ahmedou] Ecole Normale Super Nouakchott, Ctr Rech Valorisat Biodiversite CRVB, Nouakchott, Mauritania; [Begat, Pierre; Vlieghe, Kelly E.

Restructuring of the coral-associated bacterial community, either through natural or assisted strategies, has been suggested as a means of adaptation to climate change. A low complexity microbial system would facilitate testing the efficacy of microbial restructuring strategies. We used the model organism for corals, Exaiptasia diaphana, and determined that short-term (3 weeks) exposure to filter-sterilized seawater conditions alone reduced the complexity of the microbiome. Metabarcoding of the V5-V6 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that alpha diversity was approximately halved in anemones reared in filtersterilized seawater compared to controls reared in unfiltered seawater and that the composition (beta diversity) differed significantly between the two. By reducing the complexity of the E. diaphana microbiome, the development of a system for testing assisted strategies such as probiotics, is more feasible.","[Dungan, Ashley M.; van Oppen, Madeleine J.

This study employs mental maps to analyse thermal (dis)comfort in the mediumsized Czech cities of Olomouc and Plzen in summer. Locations of mental hotspots are identified particularly on busy streets, at transport hubs, and in the city centres. The results reveal mental hotspots as highly-frequented locations in which people experience inferior thermal and environmental conditions. Slight variations in the spatial patterns of thermal discomfort for particular groups of persons are described. Mental hotspots overlap with surface temperature hotspots by less than half of their area; differences are statistically significant and spatially modulated. Overlap areas of mental and real hotspots show a promising approach towards indication of locations prone to development of heat stress in urban areas. These findings may contribute to adaptation to climate change and to urban planning, which should address not only the physical but also the subjectively-perceived issues of thermal comfort.","[Lehnert, Michal; Jurek, Martin] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Fac Sci, Dept Geog, 17 Listopadu 12, Olomouc 77900, Czech Republic; [Geletic, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Comp Sci, Dept Complex Syst, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 271-2, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic; [Geletic, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Kopp, Jan] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Geog, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic; [Brabec, Marek] Czech Acad Sci, Dept Stat Modeling, Inst Comp Sci, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 271-2, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic; [Panek, Jiri] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Fac Sci, Dept Dev & Environm Studies, 17 Listopadu 12, Olomouc 77900, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of West Bohemia Pilsen; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Palacky University Olomouc,"Panek, J (corresponding author), Palacky Univ Olomouc, Fac Sci, Dept Dev & Environm Studies, 17 Listopadu 12, Olomouc 77900, Czech Republic.",jiri.panek@upol.cz,"Jurek, Martin/A-1785-2017; Geletič, Jan/U-9763-2018; Brabec, Marek/F-9816-2012; Kopp, Jan/ABB-4488-2021; Lehnert, Michal/V-2649-2019","Jurek, Martin/0000-0001-9567-8073; Geletič, Jan/0000-0002-0904-3133; Kopp, Jan/0000-0002-4768-613X; Lehnert, Michal/0000-0001-7691-1618; Brabec, Marek/0000-0001-6367-5791; Panek, Jiri/0000-0002-6390-3149","Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [TJ01000118]; Palacky University, Olomouc [IGA_PrF_2021_027]","Technology Agency of the Czech Republic; Palacky University, Olomouc","This research was supported by the project Identification of locations vulnerable to thermal stress: a tool for sustainable urban planning, grant ref.

It is argued that the payments for ecosystem services (PES) scheme allows for effective CSF management and long-term sustainability if introduced in compliance with local, cultural, and social values. In a case study of an Icelandic afforestation programme, we conducted an institutional analysis of the PES scheme and assessed its effect on the sustainable provision of forest ecosystem services for the long term. We provide preliminary findings on the application of CSF in the 30-year-old Icelandic afforestation programme scheme. The perspectives of forest and policy experts, as well as local farmers participating in the scheme, were crucial for assessing the effectiveness of PES scheme performance in Iceland.","[Brnkalakova, Stanislava; Bastakova, Viera; Kluvankova, Tatiana] SlovakGlobe Slovak Acad Sci, Vazovova 5, Bratislava 81243, Slovakia; [Brnkalakova, Stanislava; Bastakova, Viera; Kluvankova, Tatiana] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Vazovova 5, Bratislava 81243, Slovakia; [Svetlik, Jan] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Forest Ecol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Brynleifsdottir, Sigridur Julia] Iceland Forest Serv, Afforestn Serv, Suourgata 12, IS-400 Isafjorur, Iceland; [Snorrason, Arnor] Iceland Forest Res, IS-162 Reykjavik, Iceland",Slovak University of Technology Bratislava; Mendel University in Brno,"Kluvankova, T (corresponding author), SlovakGlobe Slovak Acad Sci, Vazovova 5, Bratislava 81243, Slovakia.;Kluvankova, T (corresponding author), Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Vazovova 5, Bratislava 81243, Slovakia.",tana@cetip.sk,"Svetlik, Jan/AGI-5282-2022; Světlík, Jan/B-7426-2014","Svetlik, Jan/0000-0002-3812-694X",VEGA [2/0170/21]; Czech Mountain Forests Climate-Smart Forestry [CZECLIMO LTC17007],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); Czech Mountain Forests Climate-Smart Forestry,"We acknowledge the CLIMO project for enabling us to conduct this case study research.

This research is aimed at examining how smallholder farmers in the Northeastern region of Burundi perceive climate change and variability and at identifying the methods that are used to adapt, based on data from 200 small farmers and on actual weather data recorded between 1986 and 2017. We find that the majority of farmers (54%) perceive significant increases in temperature and unpredictability of rainfall duration and intensity and are making adjustments to adapt their agriculture in response to changes in climate. Over 80% of farmers have implemented at least one adaptation strategy among the nine evaluated. Changing crop varieties, changing fertilizers, and planting shade trees are the main adaptation strategies that were being implemented by farmers across the study area. The results of a binary regression model showed that the agricultural education and experience of farmers, as well as farm and family size, livestock ownership, climate information access, credit access, and farm income, strongly influence smallholder farmers' decisions to adapt to climate change. The main obstacles are the lack of information on climate and adaptation strategies, and poverty, which makes it difficult to cope with the increased costs of farming. Understanding farmers' perceptions of climate change and variability on a local level would provide information on how to develop adaptation strategies. The present study suggests the need for strengthening farmers' capacities and improving the policy framework for adaptation to climate change in order to improve farmers' livelihoods. Implications for policymakers will, therefore, include making flexible credit facilities, and investing in training extension agents on both climate change outreach and coping strategies.","[Batungwanayo, Pacifique] Univ Burundi Doctoral Sch, Res Ctr Math & Phys Sci, Bujumbura 2700, Burundi; [Habarugira, Viateur; Nkurunziza, Jean de Dieu] Ecole Normale Super, Dept Sci Nat, Bujumbura 6983, Burundi; [Batungwanayo, Pacifique; Vanclooster, Marnik] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst ELI, GERU, Croix Sud 2, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Ndimubandi, Jean] Univ Burundi, Fac Bioengn, Bujumbura 2940, Burundi; [F.

Diverse rotations can deliver ecosystem services, provide economic resilience, and support adaptation to climate change. Our aim was to assess farmers' attitudes to planning and diversifying crop rotations, focusing on their responses in the face of contrasting climate viewpoints. We interviewed 75 farmers from four regions along a latitudinal gradient from the south of the UK to the south of France. We used a semi-structured questionnaire with face-to-face interviews and asked farmers to respond to two narrative viewpoints of climate change impacts: one viewpoint focused on opportunities, the other on constraints. We found in all four regions that farmers' use rotations, and the crops within rotations, to achieve their main objectives of financial stability and improved soil health. Most farmers (79-100% depending on region) said they had experienced climate change, and many (54-83%) had already implemented changes in their farming practices. We did not find a difference in these results based on latitude. However, farmers' self-reported outlook was mostly optimistic in southern UK and become progressively more pessimistic further south. When presented with a viewpoint of climate change impacts focusing on opportunities, more farmers were likely to diversify and lengthen rotations, and fewer were likely to shorten them, compared to a viewpoint presenting constraints from these impacts. Crucially, here we show that the presentation of climate change affects the ways in which farmers predict how they will respond to climate change. Diversified rotations align with multiple other economic and environmental benefits. Therefore, it is essential to consider the way in which climate change impacts are communicated, and the effect this has farmers' behavior, when designing measures to support environmentally sustainable adaptation to climate change.","[Bane, Miranda S.; Pocock, Michael J.

We conclude that although there has been progress in recent years, it is insufficient given the scope of the climate change challenge and the myriad ways climate impacts negatively affect communities. We argue for seven principles of strong climate change planning: 1) clear goals; 2) strong fact base; 3) diverse strategies; 4) public participation; 5) coordination across actors, sectors, and plans; 6) processes for implementation and monitoring; and 7) techniques to address uncertainty.

In the era of rapid technological improvements, with overwhelming volumes and channels of data, we still record a lack of basic figures of disaster losses at the scale, granularity and level of detail needed for most applications. First, a theoretical overview of data science applied to disaster risk management and the description of collection procedures and use of damage data for buildings in the case of earthquakes for Italy and Greece are provided. Second, the Information System (IS) which is intended to enhance damage and loss data collection and management proposed by the LODE (Loss Data Enhancement for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation) project is illustrated. The IS is described in detail, starting from the stakeholder consultation to elicit the requirements, to the system's architecture, design and implementation. The IS provides a comprehensive tool to input and query multisectoral post-disaster damage and loss data at relevant spatial and temporal scales. The part of the IS devoted to building damage is described in depth showing how obstacles and difficulties highlighted in the collection and use of data in the Greek and the Italian case have been approached and solved. Finally, further developments of the IS and its background philosophy are discussed, including the need for institutionalized damage data collection, engineering of the developed software and re-engineering of current damage and loss data practices.","[Faiella, Anna] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture & Urban Studies, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Menoni, Scira; Rueda, Nicolas] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Boni, Maria Pia] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Panoutsopoulou, Maria; Thoma, Thekla] Earthquake Planning & Protect Org Greece, Athens 15451, Greece; [Salari, Sandro] Dev Informat Syst, I-06038 Spello, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Faiella, A (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture & Urban Studies, I-20133 Milan, Italy.;Menoni, S (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",anna.faiella@polimi.it; scira.menoni@polimi.it; mariapia.boni@polimi.it; mpanouts@oasp.gr; thomathekla@oasp.gr; sandro.salari@gmail.com; nicolas.rueda@mail.polimi.it,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,"UCPM Program of DG ECHO, Prevention and Preparedness 2018 LODE project | Loss Data Enhancement for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation project [826567]","UCPM Program of DG ECHO, Prevention and Preparedness 2018 LODE project | Loss Data Enhancement for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation project","The funding comes from the UCPM Program of DG ECHO, Prevention and Preparedness 2018 LODE project | Loss Data Enhancement for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation project, grant agreement Nffi. 826567 (https://www.Lodeproject.polimi.it, accessed on 20 January 2022).",,49,0,0,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2022,14,10,,,,,,,6187,10.3390/su14106187,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14106187,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1R4VQ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000803368600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Being an agrarian economy and dependent on monsoon rain, the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity and production has been experienced. Different adaptation strategies have been adopted by the communities to cope with the consequences of climate change. Design/methodology/approach - Four village development committees (VDCs) situated in the buffer zone of Langtang National Park of Rasuwa district representing rice, wheat, maize and potato production area was purposively selected for this study. A two-stage sampling technique was adopted for data and information collection. Thirty households from each VDC were randomly selected. Data on the socio-economic and climate change perception were collected using structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression technique was used to identify the determinants of climate change adaptation technologies and practices. Findings - The farmers' decisions whether to adopt climate change adaptation technologies are governed by the size of landholding, perceived threat of climate change to food security, education level and gender of the interviewee, perception on the increased incidence of droughts during rainy season and income received from the off-farm sources. In a community where agricultural activity is the dominant means of living, adaptive strategies help to increase the capacity of a farming system to survive external shocks and cope with the consequences. Originality/value - The assessment of farm-level adaptation strategies and factors influencing their adoption decision is important to formulate policies and design programs. This will also help to recognize adaptation as a tool for managing a variety of risks associated with climate change in agricultural sector.","[Joshi, Binaya] Minist Populat & Environm, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Ji, Weihong] Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Joshi, Narayan Babu] Sustainable Res & Dev Ctr, Kathmandu, Nepal",Massey University,"Joshi, B (corresponding author), Minist Populat & Environm, Kathmandu, Nepal.",joshibinaya84@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,17,17,2,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Securing formal property rights can be challenging in coastal small-scale fisheries, which often operate under open access conditions. We argue that insecure, informal rights can offer one pathway for property-rights regime change, and may also provide greater flexibility for developing sustainable fishing practices compatible with climate change adaptation, among other policy-relevant outcomes. The process of establishing short-term but renewable area-based conservation tools, such as the Fish Refuges of Baja California Sur, Mexico, offers the opportunity to examine how community-based strategies can generate incentives for conservation despite the lack of secure property rights. Using in-depth qualitative methods, socioeconomic surveys, and ecological data from 2009 to 2019, we studied the process of engagement among fishers, civil society, and government. We focused on understanding the emerging transition from a scenario of open access and limited withdrawal property rights, toward locals' attaining of insecuredefactomanagement and exclusion property rights and longer-term visions of resource use and conservation. Altogether, this case illustrates the potential and limitations of Fish Refuges as an area-based fisheries and conservation tool.","[Quintana, Anastasia C.

One way to better understand the issues is to learn from the experiences of farmers themselves. Thus, this study aimed to better understand rainfed upland cropping systems in NW Cambodia and to identify practical, social and economic constraints to adoption of known climate adaptation options applicable to local agro-ecosystems. The study also sought to document the climate change perceptions and adaptation options employed by farmers to mitigate the climate risks. A household survey was conducted in the districts of Sala Krau and Samlout in North-west Cambodia in 2013 where 390 representatives of households were randomly selected for interviews, group discussions and field observations. The majority of respondents perceived that changes had occurred in the rainfall pattern such as a later start to the monsoon season, decreasing annual rainfall, increasing frequencies of drought and dry spells, and warmer temperatures. Farmers reported reductions in crop yields of 16-27 % over the five-year period of 2008-2012. However, these reductions were not evident in provincial data for the same period. Farmers claimed climate impacts resulted in significant yield reductions, but they appear not to have an effective strategy to adapt to the changes in climate. Further regional research is required to refine climate change adaptation strategies for rainfed upland cropping systems in Cambodia.","[Touch, Van] Univ New England, Agron & Soil Sci Dept, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Martin, Robert John] Agr Syst Res Co Ltd, Battambang, Cambodia; [Scott, Fiona] Tamworth Agr Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Tamworth, NSW 2340, Australia; [Cowie, Annette] Beef Ind Ctr, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Liu, De Li] Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia",University of New England; NSW Department of Primary Industries; NSW Department of Primary Industries; NSW Department of Primary Industries,"Touch, V (corresponding author), Univ New England, Agron & Soil Sci Dept, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",van.touch84@gmail.com,"Scott, Fiona/L-4743-2016; Cowie, Annette/E-1485-2016; , De Li Liu/Y-4656-2019","Scott, Fiona/0000-0001-7214-4319; Cowie, Annette/0000-0002-3858-959X; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) through the John Allwright Fellowship scheme,Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) through the John Allwright Fellowship scheme,We thank the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) for funding this research through the John Allwright Fellowship scheme.,,42,12,12,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

However, little quantitative information is available to guide investment or policy choices at a time when countries and development agencies are under pressure to implement policies that can help achieve Sustainable Development Goals while coping with climate change. Among smallholder adaptation options, developing seeds resilient to current and future climate shocks expected locally is one of the most important actions available now. In this paper, we used national and local data to estimate the costs of climate change to smallholder farmers in Malawi and Tanzania. We found that the benefits from adopting resilient seeds ranged between 984 million and 2.1 billion USD during 2020-2050.

It highlights how some interventions inadvertently reinforce, redistribute or create new sources of vulnerability. Four mechanisms drive these maladaptive outcomes: (i) shallow understanding of the vulnerability context; (ii) inequitable stakeholder participation in both design and implementation; (iii) a retrofitting of adaptation into existing development agendas; and (iv) a lack of critical engagement with how 'adaptation success' is defined. Emerging literature shows potential avenues for overcoming the current failure of adaptation interventions to reduce vulnerability: first, shifting the terms of engagement between adaptation practitioners and the local populations participating in adaptation interventions; and second, expanding the understanding of 'local' vulnerability to encompass global contexts and drivers of vulnerability. An important lesson from past adaptation interventions is that within current adaptation cum development paradigms, inequitable terms of engagement with 'vulnerable' populations are reproduced and the multi-scalar processes driving vulnerability remain largely ignored. In particular, instead of designing projects to change the practices of marginalised populations, learning processes within organisations and with marginalised populations must be placed at the centre of adaptation objectives. We pose the question of whether scholarship and practice need to take a post-adaptation turn akin to post-development, by seeking a pluralism of ideas about adaptation while critically interrogating how these ideas form part of the politics of adaptation and potentially the processes (re)producing vulnerability. We caution that unless the politics of framing and of scale are explicitly tackled, transformational interventions risk having even more adverse effects on marginalised populations than current adaptation.

Since agricultural production and its land use produce appr. 20% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Finland, reducing agricultural GHG emissions is important for meeting national target of climate neutrality by 2035. Healthier food diets, maintenance of biodiversity, and reduced nutrient leaching from agriculture are also required for a more sustainable food economy. This paper aims to show how agriculture in Finland, traditionally dominated by livestock production, could decrease GHG emissions significantly and simultaneously respond to other sustainability concerns. Our results, based on economic modelling of the agricultural sector, suggest that moderate changes in food diets and land use can reduce GHG emissions of agriculture by more than 40% by 2050 if productivity growth and policy changes support the overall change in the agriculture and food sector. Adaptation to climate change, e.g. more higher crop yields efficient input use, is necessary for productivity growth. Decreased demand for meat and decreased cultivation of feed crops would decrease GHG emissions and free up land for carbon sequestration through afforestation. Whilst healthier food diets imply less livestock and increased imports of protein crops for food, a reasonable volume of livestock production is useful for maintaining food security, grasslands, crop rotations, soil carbon, and biodiversity. We conclude that transition to low carbon and more sustainable agriculture is possible without risking food security at northern latitudes.","[Lehtonen, Heikki; Ramo, Janne] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke Bioecon & Environ, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Lehtonen, H (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke Bioecon & Environ, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland.",heikki.lehtonen@luke.fi,"郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022","Lehtonen, Heikki/0000-0003-1543-1594","Academy of Finland [342560, 316215]; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Academy of Finland (AKA) [316215] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),"Funding from Academy of Finland for FINSCAPES (Finnish scenarios for climate change research addressing policies, regions and integrated systems, decision number 342560) and DivCSA (Diversifying cropping system for climate-smart agriculture, decision number 316215) projects, as well as funding from Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) for strategic project EFFI (Cost-effective actions and incentives for climate change mitigation in agriculture and forestry) made this study possible.

Municipalities are considered best-equipped extension of governments to harmonise and mainstream these two developmental interventions. However, municipalities require harmonised legal, policy and other enablers to effectively streamline and mainstream these two developmental options into development planning. This paper uses summative content analysis and exclusive use of secondary data to review the extent to which the Zambian gov-ernment in the Global South has tried to undertake three significant modifications, namely: (1) harmonise newly formulated legislation, policy frameworks and enablers post year 2015, that relate to CCA-M, DRR and municipality Integrated Development Plans (IDPs), (2) promote the streamlining of CCA-M and climate-related DRR conceptually and (3) promote the mainstreaming of these two harmonised concepts and practices into municipality IDP through the revised legal, policy frameworks and enablers. The results shows that, there is little activity to harmonise legislation, policy frameworks, enablers that relate to CCA-M, DRR and municipality IDPs. There is equally little activity to encourage conceptual harmonisation of CCA-M and DRR at practice level. Finally, there is little activity by government to conceptually promote the mainstreaming of these two concepts in unison into municipality IDPs. Nevertheless, there is good political will and international donor support for this mainstreaming agenda, in general, for CCA and CCM as singular developmental options into the public sectors. This is not the case regarding harmo-nisation with DRR.","[Banda, Bowen] North West Univ, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Block E4, Private Bag X6001, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [van Niekerk, Dewald; Nemakonde, Livhuwani] North West Univ, Sch Geoand Spatial Sci, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Block E4,Private Bag X6001, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Granvorka, Charley] Econ Independent, Residence Bateliere 883,Schoelcher, F-97233 Martinique, France",North West University - South Africa; North West University - South Africa,"Banda, B (corresponding author), North West Univ, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Block E4, Private Bag X6001, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",bowenbanda@yahoo.com; Dewald.VanNiekerk@nwu.ac.za; livhu.nemakonde@nwu.ac.za; charleygranvorka@yahoo.fr,"; van Niekerk, Dewald/H-6134-2012","Nemakonde, Livhuwani David/0000-0002-3458-5575; van Niekerk, Dewald/0000-0002-4571-4205; Banda, Bowen/0000-0002-8673-8318",,,,,101,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

This paper reviews a study of the rural farming community of East Jelekhali in climate-impacted coastal Bangladesh, where SNA was applied to investigate the role of social network connectivity in household access to climate-adaptive innovative production technologies, such as saline-tolerant rice and high-yielding vegetables, which may provide a means of climate adaptation for agricultural households. Insights are shared on how SNA was applied to map and analyze a community-level livelihood adaptation network. A particular emphasis is made on discussing the benefits, practical applications, and challenges in applying the whole network methodology within a community survey-based approach.

Even so, efforts to mitigate these issues in arid regions have been insufficient. Thus, in this paper, further research is discussed based on data obtained from various crop and climate models. Two DSSATcrop models (CMs) (CERESWheat and N-Wheat) were calibrated with two wheat cultivars (Gemiza9 and Misr1). A baseline simulation (1981-2010) was compared with different scenarios of simulations using three Global Climate Models (GCMs) for the 2030s, 2050s and 2080s. Probable impacts of climate change were assessed using the GCMs and CMs under the high emission Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5). Results predicted decreased wheat grain yields by a mean of 8.7%, 11.4% and 13.2% in the 2030s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively, relative to the baseline yield. Negative impacts of climatic change are probable, despite some uncertainties within the GCMs (i. e., 2.1%, 5.0% and 8.0%) and CMs (i.e., 2.2%, 6.0% and 9.2%). Changing the planting date with a scenario of plus or minus 5 or 10 days from the common practice was assessed as a potentially effective adaptation option, which may partially offset the negative impacts of climate change. Delaying the sowing date by 10 days (from 20 November to 30 November) proved the optimum scenario and decreased further reduction in wheat yields resulting from climate change to 5.2%, 6.8% and 8.5% in the 2030s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively, compared with the 20 November scenario. The planting 5-days earlier scenario showed a decreased impact on climate change adaptation. However, the 10-days early planting scenario increased yield reduction under projected climate change. The cultivar Misr1 was more resistant to rising temperature than Gemiza9. Despite the negative impacts of projected climate change on wheat production, water use efficiency would slightly increase. The ensemble of multi-model estimated impacts and adaptation uncertainties of climate change can assist decision-makers in planning climate adaptation strategies.","[Ali, Marwa Gamal Mohamed; Ibrahim, Mahmoud Mohamed; El Baroudy, Ahmed] Tanta Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Soil & Water, Tanta 33516, Egypt; [Ali, Marwa Gamal Mohamed; Omar, El-Said Hamad; Kheir, Ahmed Mohammed Saad] Agr Res Ctr, Soils Water & Environm Res Inst, Giza 12411, Egypt; [Fullen, Michael] Univ Wolverhampton, Fac Sci & Engn, Wolverhampton WV1 1LY, England; [Ding, Zheli] Chinese Acad Trop Agr Sci CATAS, Haikou Expt Stn, Haikou 570000, Hainan, Peoples R China",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Tanta University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Agricultural Research Center - Egypt; University of Wolverhampton; Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences,"Kheir, AMS (corresponding author), Agr Res Ctr, Soils Water & Environm Res Inst, Giza 12411, Egypt.",drahmedkheir2015@gmail.com,"Ding, Zheli/ABA-6083-2020; Kheir, Ahmed/M-9292-2016","Kheir, Ahmed/0000-0001-9569-5420; ding, zhe li/0000-0002-3044-4791; El Baroudy, Ahmed/0000-0002-5212-609X","Agricultural Research Center; Soils, Water and Environment Research Institute (SWERI)","Agricultural Research Center; Soils, Water and Environment Research Institute (SWERI)","We thank the Agricultural Research Center; Soils, Water and Environment Research Institute (SWERI) for financial support.

These concerns include the high administrative costs of implementation, poor incentives for long-term investments, bureaucratic inefficiency, practical problems in water pricing and adaptability to climate change threat.

These studies have rarely verified whether farmers' perceptions are consistent with observed changes in meteorological conditions to establish sufficient premise. This study compares farmers' perceptions of changes in precipitation and temperature in a rainfed agriculture region of Ghana against objective measurements made in nearby weather stations in the region. The study finds that farmers correctly perceived the increase in temperature over time but incorrectly perceived a reduction in precipitation, while objective data showed high fluctuations with no clear trend. It is possible that farmers mistakenly assumed reduction in soil moisture meant to support crop growth requirements was caused by less rainfall when in fact it was caused by higher temperature.","[Dadzie, Samuel Kwesi Ndzebah] Univ Cape Coast, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Cape Coast, Ghana",University of Cape Coast,"Dadzie, SKN (corresponding author), Univ Cape Coast, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Cape Coast, Ghana.",sdadzie@ucc.edu.gh,,,,,,,78,4,4,2,5,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

Improving confidence in climate models may be achieved by (i) evaluating their capacity for repro-ducing observed climatic evolution and (ii) attributing these evolutions. Moreover, there is a need to consider relevant cli-matic indicators, from an end-user point of view. Fully coupled (CMIP6-AOGCM) models with idealized detection and attribution forcings (DAMIP) as well as atmosphere-only simulations (AMIP) are used to investigate the respective roles of external forcing factors and internal climate variability in the observed intensification of the Sahelian rainfall regime. We show that CMIP6 models contain signs of the intensification of the rainfall regime as detected over the past 35 years from a regional daily observations network. Both the increase in intensity and occurrence of wet days, as well as that of ex-treme daily rainfall, are remarkably well reproduced by historical simulations incorporating anthropogenic forcing factors, with anthropogenic aerosols contributing the largest share of this trend. Though more strongly affected by model structure uncertainty, the greenhouse gas forcing also displays noticeably robust features. Models are shown to fail at simulating the observed dry extreme evolution. These findings give incentive for further investigating the underlying physical mechanisms that drive the Sahelian rainfall regime evolution at regional to subregional scales. Furthermore, future hydroclimatic trajec-tories in the Sahel should be explored, though particular caution is required as to which rainfall indicator to consider. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The rainfall regime at a particular location is crucial to human and ecosystem liveli-hoods. Changes in rainfall regime characteristics on multidecadal time scales result from both the effects of external forcing factors on the climate and of its internal variability, with this latter aspect becoming more prominent on small spatial scales. In this study, several state-of-the-art climate simulations are used to document the rainfall regime evolu-tion of the past 65 years in the Sahel, in terms of amplitude, timing, and causes. It is shown that large-scale anthropo-genic factors have a substantial imprint, modulated to some extent by internal variability. These findings demonstrate that coarse-resolution climate models are a well-suited tool to investigate the recent intensification of rainfall in the Sahel, and may provide valuable information for climate change adaptation planning.","[Chagnaud, G.; Vischel, T.; Lebel, T.] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IRD, Grenoble INP, Grenoble, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Chagnaud, G (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IRD, Grenoble INP, Grenoble, France.",guillaume.chagnaud@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,,,,,,,100,0,0,4,4,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Key informant interviews with stakeholders from government, research institutes, international and local development agencies, and the private sector identified technology development as an important investment and action area. A desk review of policy documents revealed that considerations on climate change adaptation in agriculture are embedded in Myanmar's international commitments and national plans, including policies on making the agriculture sector resilient. Moreover, climate change resilience has been framed as a key component of the country's sustainable development plans. This means the basic framework for advocating and promoting CSA is already in place. However, policies on land, water, environment, seed, and fertilizer and pesticide management are poorly enforced. In addition, the extension system has an inadequate coverage and reach of the remote communities. In the current political context of Myanmar, the process of policymaking has changed. Thus, the impetus for shaping an enabling environment for scaling up CSA will likely shift toward more active citizen engagement via local nongovernment organizations (NGOs), the private sector, and independent academic institutions. There are opportunities for policy integration to effectively scale up CSA, but much remains to be done. Donors of Myanmar have a special opportunity to support the integration of CSA into their respective country program strategies. Likewise, local and international NGOs may take this opportunity to mainstream CSA into various conventional development programs, such as livelihood development, women's empowerment, and food security and nutrition. On the other hand, academic institutions can pursue research opportunities to support the development of CSA technologies and approaches and to generate evidence for input to capacity development, advocacy, and policymaking.","[Barbon, Wilson John D.; Thant, Phyu Sin] Int Inst Rural Reconstruct IIRR, Yangon, Myanmar; [Khaing, Ohnmar] Food Secur Working Grp Myanmar, Yangon, Myanmar; [Gonsalves, Julian] Int Inst Rural Reconstruct, Reg Ctr Asia, Dasmarinas, Philippines",,"Barbon, WJD (corresponding author), Int Inst Rural Reconstruct IIRR, Yangon, Myanmar.",wilsonjohn.barbon@iirr.org,"Barbon, Wilson John/ABR-2416-2022","Barbon, Wilson John/0000-0002-5028-1774",,,,,31,0,0,1,1,SOUTHEAST ASIAN REGIONAL CENTER GRADUATE STUDY & RESEARCH AGRICULTURE,LAGUNA,"UPLB CAMPUS, LOS BANOS, LAGUNA, 00000, PHILIPPINES",1656-4383,,,ASIAN J AGRIC DEV,Asian J.

It is apparent that this integrated aquaculture-agriculture system is stilted to environmental and hydrological conditions found in specific areas. Production strategies devised by farmers demonstrate that the diversified culture of shrimp with rice is technically feasible. Shrimp-rice agroecosystems exhibit several synergistic effects between systems components that result in efficient resource use and enhanced production, whilst avoiding negative environmental impacts. Integrated cropping enhances agro-biodiversity and reduces dependence on external inputs (agrochemicals, feed and fertiliser). Diversified shrimp-rice culture produces a valuable export crop, stimulating economic development and staple cereal, fish and vegetable crops that enhance human nutrition and food security. The contribution that diversified shrimp-rice agroecosystems make to social-ecological resilience is evaluated using the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impacts, Responses) framework. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) associated with prevailing practices are reviewed using the SWOT framework. We conclude, that with appropriate safeguards, diversified shrimp-rice agroecosystems could contribute to climate change adaptation and enhance production from land affected by salinization. Policy-support and practical action is needed to support and promote diversified shrimp-farming agroecosystems as they can contribute to social-ecological resilience in vulnerable coastal communities.

Time-dependent climate scenarios are commonly used in mitigation studies. However, despite the dynamic nature of adaptation, most scenarios for local or regional decision making on climate adaptation are static 'endpoint' projections. This paper describes the development and use of transient (time-dependent) scenarios by means of a case on water management in the Netherlands. Relevant boundary conditions (sea level, precipitation and evaporation) were constructed by generating an ensemble of synthetic time-series with a rainfall generator and a transient delta change method. Climate change impacted river flows were then generated with a hydrological simulation model for the Rhine basin. The transient scenarios were applied in model simulations and game experiments. We argue that there are at least three important assets of using transient scenarios for supporting robust climate adaptation: (1) raise awareness about (a) the implications of climate variability and climate change for decision making and (b) the difficulty of finding proof of climate change in relevant variables for water management; (2) assessment of when to adapt by identifying adaptation tipping points which can then be used to explore adaptation pathways, and (3) identification of triggers for climate adaptation.","[Haasnoot, M.; Schellekens, J.; Kwadijk, J.

This article provides an exploratory statistical analysis of three adaptation measures (shoreline armoring, property acquisitions, and beach nourishment) and their deployment with respect to metrics of risk exposure, socioeconomic markers, and critical infrastructure in North Carolina (U.S.). This exploratory analysis evaluates two propositions. First, adaptation measures are deployed relative to specific metrics of risk. Second, adaptation choice disproportionately correlates with socioeconomic attributes. The findings support both propositions and reveal that shoreline armoring correlates with higher home values, household incomes, and population density and low racial diversity. Property acquisitions are found to correlate with low home values, household incomes, and population density and high racial diversity. Furthermore, adaptation measures are interconnected. Acquisitions are more likely to occur in areas with low levels of armoring. Beach nourishment occurs exclusively in areas with shoreline armoring. The results find no correlation of adaptation deployment with critical infrastructure.

Despite this, adaptation seems challenged to move to action, and users of guides often report being overwhelmed or confused. New guides seem to continually re-invent the details of the adaptation cycle of planning and implementation, whereas it may be better to focus more on making these details salient to users at different stages of their adaptation journey, in terms of levels of experience or organisational process. We review 39 guides to identify leading practice around a basic set of six core steps in an adaptation cycle, which could be the starting point for any new guide. We then argue that it should be standard to provide guidance about different modes of applying an adaptation cycle in practice, which can help practitioners with different types of use and as they evolve their understanding of their adaptation needs. We show how defining three archetypal modes of adaptation cycle - Scan, Portfolio and Project - helps to sharpen the advice about the approaches to apply in each of the steps within each mode, and particularly to simplify the journey to action for practitioners considering climate adaptation for the first time. We discuss what response users have had to some applications of this approach. We conclude that it is time for adaptation researchers and practitioners to move on from putting energy into re-inventing the adaptation cycle, and instead provide more differentiated guidance for how the cycle can be applied as the user's context changes through their adaptation journey.","[Stafford-Smith, Mark; Doerr, Veronica; Wise, Russell M.] CSIRO Land & Water, POB 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Rissik, David] Griffith Univ, Natl Climate Change Adaptat Res Facil, Gold Coast Campus,1 Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia; [Street, Roger] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, OUCE, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Lin, Brenda] CSIRO Land & Water, GPO Box 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Webb, Robert] Australian Natl Univ, Inst Climate,Energy & Disaster Solut, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Rissik, David] BMT, Level 5,348 Edward St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Doerr, Veronica] Australian Ctr Int Agr Res, 38 Thynne St, Bruce, ACT 2617, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Griffith University; University of Oxford; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University,"Stafford-Smith, M (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, POB 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",mark.staffordsmith@csiro.au; David.rissik@bmtglobal.com.au; roger.street@ouce.ox.ac.uk; Brenda.lin@csiro.au; veronica.doerr@aciar.gov.au; bob.webb@anu.edu.au; Lesley.m.andrew@gmail.com; russell.wise@csiro.au,"Smith, Mark Stafford/G-1680-2010; Wise, Russell M/G-5463-2010","Smith, Mark Stafford/0000-0002-1333-3651; Wise, Russell M/0000-0002-5882-5123; Lin, Brenda/0000-0002-6011-9172",Australian Government's former Department of the Environment and Energy; CSIRO,Australian Government's former Department of the Environment and Energy(Australian Government); CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"Thanks to our internal reviewers, and to numerous others who have contributed to workshops and thinking related to adaptation planning processes in Australia over the past decade, and particularly to Anna Summers who collated an initial set of guides.

It is a strong indicator for a given area showing how vulnerable it is to flood risk and how much can be gained by implementing e. g., climate change adaptation measures. This study identifies and compares three different methods for estimating the EAD based on unit costs of flooding of urban assets. One of these methods was used in previous studies and calculates the EAD based on a few extreme events by assuming a log-linear relationship between cost of an event and the corresponding return period. This method is compared to methods that are either more complicated or require more calculations. The choice of method by which the EAD is calculated appears to be of minor importance. At all three case study areas it seems more important that there is a shift in the damage costs as a function of the return period. The shift occurs approximately at the 10 year return period and can perhaps be related to the design criteria for sewer systems. Further, it was tested if the EAD estimation could be simplified by assuming a single unit cost per flooded area. The results indicate that within each catchment this may be a feasible approach. However the unit costs varies substantially between different case study areas. Hence it is not feasible to develop unit costs that can be used to calculate EAD, most likely because the urban landscape is too heterogeneous.","[Olsen, Anders Skovgard; Zhou, Qianqian; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Olsen, Anders Skovgard; Linde, Jens Jorgen] Kruger AS, DK-2860 Soborg, Denmark; [Zhou, Qianqian] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Transportat Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Technical University of Denmark; Guangdong University of Technology,"Arnbjerg-Nielsen, K (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",ano@kruger.dk; qiaz@gdut.edu.cn; jl@kruger.dk; karn@env.dtu.dk,"Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/J-7792-2012; Zhou, Qianqian/GXG-4345-2022","Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/0000-0002-6221-9505; ",Danish Strategic Research Council as part of the project Centre for Regional Change in the Earth System [09-066868],Danish Strategic Research Council as part of the project Centre for Regional Change in the Earth System,"The authors would like to thank the municipalities and utility companies of Aarhus, Odense and Copenhagen.

Here we propose an integrated assessment and interpretation of climate change impacts as a prerequisite for stakeholder outreach and planning of suitable climate change adaptation measures. The assessment includes (i) identifying trends in meteorological and hydrological observations and their nature, (ii) analysing the relation between the meteorological drivers and generated run-off as an integrated catchment response and (iii) analysing how hitherto changes agree with the simulations by regional climate models (RCMs). The Lusatian river catchments of Spree and Schwarze Elster, characterised by high anthropogenic impact (e.g. mining activities) and low natural water yield, serve as study areas. The results of this study suggest that increases in observed temperature and potential evapotranspiration are robust while observed precipitation remained nearly unchanged (1963-2006). The RCMs agree on simulating a temperature increase but simulate opposing trends for precipitation for both past (1963-2006) and future (2018-2060) periods, the latter inducing differences in the hydrological response (actual evapotranspiration and run-off). For stakeholder outreach, we communicated a range of potential future climates and identified the statistical RCMs (STAR, WettReg) as warm and dry scenarios, and the dynamical RCMs (REMO, CCLM) as wet scenarios. Ultimately, the combined analysis of trends in observations and simulation models can be beneficial for stakeholder outreach and may increase their willingness to plan and implement suitable climate change adaptation strategies which are urgently needed within the Lusatian river catchments.","[Gaedeke, Anne; Pohle, Ina; Gruenewald, Uwe] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources Management, Siemens Halske Ring 10, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany; [Gaedeke, Anne] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Water & Environm Res Ctr, POB 75 5860, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Koch, Hagen] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Res Domain Climate Impacts & Vulnerabil, Telegrafenberg A62, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany",Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Gadeke, A (corresponding author), Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources Management, Siemens Halske Ring 10, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany.;Gadeke, A (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Water & Environm Res Ctr, POB 75 5860, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",agaedeke@alaska.edu; Ina.Pohle@b-tu.de; hagen.koch@pik-potsdam.de; Uwe.Gruenewald@b-tu.de,"Gädeke, Anne/ABG-9630-2021","Gädeke, Anne/0000-0003-0514-2908; Pohle, Ina/0000-0002-5703-6763",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Project INKA BB) [FZK: 01LR0803A]; Lausitzer und Mitteldeutsche Bergbau- Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Project INKA BB); Lausitzer und Mitteldeutsche Bergbau- Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH,"The study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Project INKA BB, FZK: 01LR0803A) and the Lausitzer und Mitteldeutsche Bergbau- Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH.

Based on this assessment, electrical climate change adaptation plans should be formulated by the utility in cooperation with utility regulators, municipalities and supralocal governments. A collaborative process is essential, because adaptation measures need to be tailored to the regional circumstances and many types of adaptation measures require governmental approval.

The conservation community has promoted the use of locally sourced seed for grassland restorations, but it is unclear how widespread the practice has become. Furthermore, rethinking how seed is sourced for grassland restorations is one potential strategy to facilitate climate change adaptation. We surveyed practitioners (anyone conducting grassland restorations) across the United States and Canada in 2017 regarding organizational, state/local government, or individual policies for using locally sourced seed in grassland restorations, how local was defined, and whether climate change was considered in these policies and decisions. We received 494 responses from 40 U.S. states and 5 Canadian provinces. Policies and individual decisions supporting locally sourced seed were common, with only 3.6% of practitioners reporting no consideration of local seed sources in restorations. However, the definition of local varied widely, with relatively large geographic areas, such as ecoregions, considered as a local source. Some practitioners considered climate change, but it was not the greatest concern when making seed sourcing decisions. When they did consider climate change, practitioners' most reported strategy was expanding seed zones used for their seed mix. Although there was a heavy upper Midwest bias in the survey responses, the number and geographic scope of responses provides a snapshot of seed sourcing strategies used by practitioners. Our results suggest that practitioners are concerned about maintaining adaptation given the focus on local seed sources, and outreach could be useful to help practitioners incorporate climate adaptation strategies into seed sourcing practices.Copyright: All material appearing in the Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management is in the public domain and may be reproduced or copied without permission unless specifically noted with the copyright symbol &.

The paper uses a framework of micro, meso and macro-level Institutional behaviour drawing strongly on new institutionalism perspectives to identify and explain factors enabling and hindering policy integration. It focuses on integration in the coastal and marine policy sector, which is expected to be particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts, and draws from data collected through a document review and interviews with key informants. The findings show that the integration of climate adaptation is still at an early stage. The integration process appears to be largely dependent on institutional dynamics at the EU-level combined with how member states and wider sectoral stakeholders engage with adaptation concerns.

Considering the key role of perception and its impact on behavior and given the importance of climate changes in today's world, the present research was conducted with the aim of investigating the factors affecting perception and adaptation behavior of farmers in response to climatic changes in Hamedan, Iran. For this aim, first, the factors affecting the farmers' perception and adaptation behavior were extracted from literature review. Then, a questionnaire was developed, and to determine its validity, the questionnaire was examined by a panel of experts. Further, to measure the reliability of the research instrument, a pilot test was conducted. The statistical population of the research consisted of 115,160 farmers in Hamedan Province and the sample size based on Krejcie and Morgan table was determined as n=384 farmers. Then, a stratified random sampling with proportional allocation was used. The findings indicated that among the studied variables, knowledge, perception, and belief with path coefficients of, respectively, 0.53, 0.32, and 0.18 had the maximum impact on the adaptation behavior, while the maximum impact on perception belonged to belief and knowledge with path coefficients of, respectively, 0.56 and 0.35. According to the results, knowledge, which had the highest contribution in explaining behavior, was not seen in the Arbuckle et al. (2015) model. Therefore, to make it easier for the farmers to communicate and facilitate the transfer of information on climate change, establishment of community-based organizations is suggested. In addition, by enhancing the level of farmers awareness about climate-smart agriculture, it is possible to take major steps to improve their adaptation to climate changes.","[Momtaz, A.

In view of the increase in the buildings height defined in the last update of the urban legislation in the city of Curitiba/PR that took place in 2019, this study aims to analyze the impact of shading from surrounding buildings from simulations in three squares located in different zonings not consolidated or expanding which allow buildings with at least six floors. The method composed of different steps from open data, results in different maps for the summer and winter solstices, and equinoxes. The analyzes demonstrate that when the simulation is carried out considering the buildings height with the acquisition of constructive potential, the shading impact on public spaces is considerable, especially in the winter solstice. Considering Curitiba as a city characterized by cold at that time of the year, ample solar access in public spaces can be recommended. It is argued that the study of the impact of buildings shading is a possibility for delimiting more restrictive indices in urban planning processes.","[Moro, Jeanne; Kruger, Eduardo] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana UTFPR, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Rosaneli, Alessandro Filla; Camboim, Silvana] Univ Fed Parana UFPR, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana; Universidade Federal do Parana,"Moro, J (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Fed Parana UTFPR, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",jeannemoro@gmail.com; alefilla@yahoo.com; ekruger@utfpr.edu.br; silvanacamboim@gmail.com,"Camboim, Silvana/C-9002-2016; Kruger, Eduardo/K-6644-2012","Camboim, Silvana/0000-0003-3557-5341; rosaneli, alessandro/0000-0002-8922-5649; Kruger, Eduardo/0000-0003-2895-5530",,,,,39,0,0,0,2,PONTIFICIA UNIV CATOLICA PARANA-PUCPR,CURITIBA,"RUA IMACULADA CONCEICAO, 1155 PREDIO ADMINISTRACAO 6 ANDAR, CURITIBA, 80215-901 PR, BRAZIL",2175-3369,,,URBE-CURITIBA,Urbe-Rev.

In response, ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is gaining recognition as a cost-effective and synergistic approach for enhancing livelihoods through nature's services, building community resilience, and integrating marine spatial planning. Using Seychelles in the West Indian Ocean as a case study, we assess the readiness for climate change as a tool to implement and mainstream EbA across various spatial scales. Our assessment highlights certain governance mechanisms and policy processes that could contribute to joint adaptation and economic planning and in achieving multiple objectives. These include leadership, institutional mechanisms, science-policy nexus, decision-making structures, stakeholder involvement, and technological innovation. These readiness factors as well as knowledge gaps on future risks provide lessons for other SIDS in their climate change and integrated coastal management initiatives.

While most discussions of climate justice in the academic literature focus on ideal conceptions and normative arguments of justice theory, or on the pragmatic policy of the more elite environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), a distinct discourse has developed out of the grassroots. In these movement articulations of climate justice, the concerns and principles of environmental justice are clear and consistent. Here, climate justice focuses on local impacts and experience, inequitable vulnerabilities, the importance of community voice, and demands for community sovereignty and functioning. This review traces the discourse of environmental justice from its development, through the range of principles and demands of grassroots climate justice movements, to more recent articulations of ideas for just adaptation to climate change.

The focus is not on external effects, but industries where economies of scale are introduced from adapting to pollution. The structure of the resulting oligopolistic market is endogenous, since the level of adaptation is chosen by the firms. The analysis of externalities usually disregards defensive or adaptation measures, with a few exceptions that point to considerable complications. The present debate on adaptation to climate change shows the importance of understanding defensive measures. I show that the market failure caused by economies of scale leads to production costs above the social optimum, i.e. to under-adapation. When pollution increases, adaptation only increases if demand is price inelastic. Otherwise, welfare loss from market failure decreases with pollution. The total welfare loss is only convex if demand is price inelastic and the influence of pollution on production costs is stronger than the influence of adaptation. Concave welfare loss has crucial implications for abatement policies.","Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Eisenack, K (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",klaus.eisenack@uni-oldenburg.de,,,,,,,25,4,4,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The response will involve balancing the long-term water demands of society with the changing needs of the environment in sustainable and cost effective ways. This paper describes a modeling framework for evaluating the sensitivity of low river flows to different configurations of abstraction licensing under both historical climate variability and expected climate change. A rainfall-runoff model is used to quantify trade-offs among environmental flow (e-flow) requirements, potential surface and groundwater abstraction volumes, and the frequency of harmful low-flow conditions. Using the River Itchen in southern England as a case study it is shown that the abstraction volume is more sensitive to uncertainty in the regional climate change projection than to the e-flow target. It is also found that smarter licensing arrangements (involving a mix of hands off flows and rising block abstraction rules) could achieve e-flow targets more frequently than conventional seasonal abstraction limits, with only modest reductions in average annual yield, even under a hotter, drier climate change scenario.","[Wilby, R.

The Vietnamese Mekong Delta region is an important agricultural region yet highly vulnerable to climate change. In 2017, the Government of Vietnam issued Resolution 120, which calls for a transition towards sustainable development and climate change resilient agriculture in the delta. We evaluated the governance of implementing this resolution using an established transition governance framework, based on policy document analysis, ethnographic observations and interviews with national government agencies and ten departments in the delta provinces An Giang and Ben Tre. The analysis indicates that delays are caused by fragmented central government leadership and that friction exists between top-down plans and bottom-up action taken by the provinces in the delta. The transition is further constrained by the absence of inter-provincial coordination and funding mechanisms. Overall, this study shows that the required governance structure exists on paper but highlights how an insufficient governance process constrains climate change adaptation in Vietnam.","[Minkman, Ellen] Erasmus Univ Rotterdam Netherlands, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Minkman, Ellen] Delft Univ Technol Netherlands, Dept Multi Actor Syst, Delft, Netherlands; [Nguyen, Hong Quan; Luu, Tang] Vietnam Natl Univ, Ctr Water Management & Climate Change, Inst Environm & Resources, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Nguyen, Hong Quan] Vietnam Natl Univ, Inst Circular Econ Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Dang, Kim Khoi] Vietnam Univ Agr, Inst Agr Market & Inst Res, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Nguyen, Sy Linh] Minist Nat Resources & Environm, Inst Strategy & Policy Nat Resources & Environm, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Du, Haomiao] Utrecht Univ Netherlands, Utrecht Ctr Water Oceans & Sustainabil Law UCWOSL, Fac Law Econ & Governance, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Huizer, Tanya] Arcadis Nederland BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rijke, Jeroen] HAN Univ Appl Sci, Arnhem, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Utrecht University,"Nguyen, HQ (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ, Ctr Water Management & Climate Change, Inst Environm & Resources, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Nguyen, HQ (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ, Inst Circular Econ Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",e.minkman@tudelft.nl; hongquanmt@yahoo.com; luuthitang@gmail.com; khoidk@gmail.com; linhnguyensy@gmail.com; h.du@uu.nl; tanya.huizer@arcadis.com; j.rijke@han.nl,"Du, Haomiao/GXM-8013-2022; Luu, Tang/HLQ-6954-2023","Minkman, Ellen/0000-0002-8543-3029","DUPC2 Grant [108 474]; NWO UDW project Strengthening strategic delta planning processes in Bangladesh, the Netherlands, Vietnam and beyond [W 07.69.106];  [KHCNTNB-DT/14-19/C20]","DUPC2 Grant; NWO UDW project Strengthening strategic delta planning processes in Bangladesh, the Netherlands, Vietnam and beyond; ","The Vietnamese authors are supported by the projects Flood based farming systems for enhancing livelihood resilience in the floodplain of upper Mekong delta (DUPC2 Grant 108 474) and the  Transforming agricultural livelihoods for climate change adaptation in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta: A case study in Ben Tre province -KHCNTNB-DT/14-19/C20.

Despite the emerging prominence of these types of policymaking challenges, more research is needed to understand policy responses to them. In this paper, I use survey responses from 287 cities and a hurdle model to comparatively examine the factors that underlie the adoption of climate change mitigation and adaptation as issues influencing city policymaking and their extension across areas of city policymaking. I find evidence that while social change, crisis, and conditions supporting nascent coalitions were associated with adoption, extension across areas of policymaking was associated with the city's prevailing political economy as well as the resources for expanding communities of interest. In the process, I offer empirical evidence for existing similarities and differences in cities' considerations about climate change mitigation and adaptation; particularly that the number of policymaking areas influenced by mitigation was associated with financial factors while the number influenced by adaptation was associated with socioeconomic ones.","[Kalafatis, Scott E.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kalafatis, Scott E.] Sustainable Dev Inst, Coll Menominee Nations, Keshena, WI 54135 USA",Michigan State University,"Kalafatis, SE (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;Kalafatis, SE (corresponding author), Sustainable Dev Inst, Coll Menominee Nations, Keshena, WI 54135 USA.",,,,,,,,79,31,32,4,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0190-292X,1541-0072,,POLICY STUD J,Policy Stud.

Through this dialogue, points of connection among local actors emerged around the need for more integrated, transparent design of adaptation measures; for strengthening local capacity; and for strategies to diversify economic activities in order to increase the resilience of the region.

A goal of the NOAA Fisheries social vulnerability and resilience indicator program is to support time and cost effective use of readily available data in furtherance of both social impact assessments of proposed changes to fishery management regulations and climate change adaptation planning. The use of the indicators to predict the response to change in coastal communities would be enhanced if community level analyses could be grouped effectively. This study examines the usefulness of combining 1130 communities into 35 relevant subgroups by comparing results of a numerical taxonomy with data collected by interview methods, a process herein referred to as ground-truthing.

This article presents results from a qualitative study using focus groups conducted with health care providers serving the low-income, ethnic minority population in East Harlem, New York. The focus groups sought to identify and explore providers' perceived health threats of climate change, as well as their perceived role as frontline disseminators of information and detectors of disease for their patients. Extreme heat events were used to frame the discussion in each group. Three major themes emerged: 1) environmental awareness, 2) an ecohealth lens, and 3) heat and health vulnerability. The participants demonstrated their interest in playing a role in climate change adaptation by identifying at-risk patients and helping to tailor clinical care to better serve these individuals.","[Sheffield, Perry E.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Durante, Kathleen T.] HawkPartners, Boston, MA USA; [Rahona, Elena] Arnhold Global Hlth Inst Mt Sinai, New York, NY USA; [Zarcadoolas, Christina] CUNY Hunter Coll, Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10021 USA",Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY),"Sheffield, PE (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, New York, NY 10029 USA.",perry.sheffield@mssm.edu,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [T32 HD049311, 5T32 HD049311] Funding Source: Medline; NIEHS NIH HHS [L40 ES017745, P30 ES023515] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NIEHS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)),,,28,5,5,0,11,HARVARD UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"79 GARDEN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",1079-0969,2150-4113,,HEALTH HUM RIGHTS,Health Hum.

Colombia has undertaken various measures in terms of climate change mitigation and adaptation since becoming a party of the Kyoto protocol in 2001 and a party of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995. The first national communication to the UNFCCC stated how Colombian agriculture will be severely impacted under different emission scenarios and time frames. The analyses in this document further support that climate change will severely threaten the socioeconomics of Colombian agriculture. We first query national data sources to characterize the agricultural sector. We then use 17 Global Circulation Model (GCM) outputs to quantify how Colombian agricultural production may be affected by climate change, and show the expected changes to years 2040-2069 (2050) under the A2 scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES-A2) and the overall trends in both precipitation and temperature to 2100. We then evaluate expected changes within different regions and measure the proportion of area affected within each crop's distributional range. By 2050, climatic change in Colombia will likely impact 3.5 million people, 14 % of national GDP corresponding to agriculture, employment of 21 % of the population, agro-industries, supply chains, and food and nutritional security. If no adaptation measures are taken, 80 % of crops would be impacted in more than 60 % of their current areas of cultivation, with particularly severe impacts in high value perennial and exportable crops. Impacts also include soil degradation and organic matter losses in the Andes hillsides; likely flooding in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts; niche losses for coffee, fruit, cocoa, and bananas; changes in prevalence of pests and diseases; and increases in the vulnerabilities of non-technically developed smallholders. There is, however, still time to change the current levels of vulnerability if a multidisciplinary focus (i.e., agronomic, economic, and social) in vulnerable sectors is undertaken. Each sub-sector and the Government need to invest in: (1) data collection, (2) detailed, regionally-based impact assessments, (3) research and development, and (4) extension and technology transfer. Support to vulnerable smallholders should be given by the state in the form of agricultural insurance systems contextualized under the phenomenon of climate change. A national coordination scheme led by (but not restricted to) the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) with the contributions of national and international institutions is needed to address agricultural adaptation.","[Ramirez-Villegas, Julian; Jarvis, Andy; Navarro-Racines, Carlos E.] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Cali, Colombia; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian; Salazar, Mike; Jarvis, Andy; Navarro-Racines, Carlos E.] Ctr Int Agr Trop, Cali 6713, Colombia; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Jarvis, Andy] Reg Off Amer, Biovers Int, Cali 6713, Colombia",CGIAR; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University of Leeds; Alliance; Bioversity International,"Ramirez-Villegas, J (corresponding author), CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Km 17, Cali, Colombia.",j.r.villegas@cgiar.org,"Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/AAY-8073-2020; Jarvis, Andy/K-5516-2013","Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/0000-0002-8044-583X; Jarvis, Andy/0000-0001-6543-0798; Navarro-Racines, Carlos Eduardo/0000-0002-8692-6431",United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); Colombian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR),United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); Colombian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR),"We would like to thank Sam Fujisaka, Alexandra Walter and Charlotte Lau for their editorial work.

Moreover, not enough attention is devoted to basic utilities other than extension services. Aimed at a reassessment that accounts for these issues, this paper formulates conditional and mixed logit (logit kernel) models with/without neighbourhood effects. In particular, a spatial logit kernel allows capturing behavioural differences and interdependence between neighbours. The analysis was based on a survey covering 162 villages of the Ethiopian Nile basin, with 50 farm households-multistage stratified randomly sampled-in each of 20 districts (woredas). Supplementary information concerned linear programming solutions on adaptation choice attributes in smallholder farming areas, under two scenarios. Lastly, cross-district aid emergency allocation priorities for food security and agriculture, among others, served as yardsticks for comparison with prevailing adjustment decisions and location characteristics. Closeness to farms with more educated farmers and larger plot sizes turned out to increase the likelihood of a household opting to sell livestock and land along with combined measures of farmland enhancement. Logit kernel outperformed conditional logit in explanatory power, and random parameters highlighted individual and group heterogeneity in preferences. Access to electricity, healthcare, and reliable and safe water supply strengthen farmers' ability to respond to climate change. Specific adaptation measures can contribute in turn to improve the capacity of rural communities to mitigate the severity of health and nutrition crises. By contrast, inworedashit by recurrent epidemics and droughts, many farmers appear to be unable to resort even to basic adaptation measures, such as planting of new trees. This prompts an additional need for institutional support and infrastructure development.","[Mainardi, Stefano] Uniwersytet Marii Curie Sklodowskiej, Dept Stat & Econometr, Lublin, Poland; [Mainardi, Stefano] Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Appl Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University; Technical University of Ostrava,"Mainardi, S (corresponding author), Uniwersytet Marii Curie Sklodowskiej, Dept Stat & Econometr, Lublin, Poland.;Mainardi, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Appl Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",stemaind@gmail.com,,"Mainardi, Stefano/0000-0002-4684-9857",VSB-TUO [SGS SP17/145]; Czech Science Foundation [GA15-23177S],VSB-TUO; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The author is grateful to IFPRI/EDRI for the Ethiopian Nile survey data, VSB-TUO (SGS SP17/145), and the Czech Science Foundation (GA15-23177S) for financial support and to anonymous reviewers and R.

Building soil organic carbon (SOC) is proposed as a key strategy for climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, practices that increase SOC may also increase nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and impact crop yields and on-farm income. A comprehensive assessment of the effects of different management practices on trade-offs between GHG emissions and agricultural systems profitability under climate change is needed. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to: (1) analyze the long-term trends of SOC and N2O emissions, and ascertain whether the croplands of the study region are net GHG sources or sinks under climate change; (2) quantify the GHG abatement on a gross margin basis; (3) identify effective management practices that could achieve a win-win strategy; and (4) investigate sources of uncertainty in estimates of GHG emissions and gross margins under climate change. METHODS: APSIM was used to simulate the effects of three crop residue retention rates (10%, 50% and 100%), and six representative crop rotations (wheat-canola, wheat-field pea-wheat-canola, wheat-field pea-wheat-oats, wheat-wheat-barley, wheat-wheat-canola, and wheat-wheat-oats) under two Shared Socio-economic Pathways scenarios (SSP245 and SSP585) using climate projections from 27 GCMs. GHG emissions and gross margins from 1961 to 2092 were assessed across 204 study sites in southeastern Australia. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that residue retention can turn the soil from a carbon source (10% retention, 304-450 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1)) to a carbon sink (100% retention,-269 similar to-57 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1)), and the potential of carbon sequestration was partly offset by concomitantly increased N2O emissions. The wheat-wheat-canola rotation with full residue retention was shown to be a win-win solution with both large potential of GHG abatement and high gross margin compared with other rotations. Spatial analysis showed that the southeastern part of the study region, with higher rainfall, had higher gross margins, while the drier northwestern part had greater GHG emission reduction potentials. Although climate change led to increased GHG emissions and decreased yields for some crops, these adverse effects were overweighed by the higher SOC and yield advantages from full residue retention. SIGNIFICANCE: This study emphasizes the significant potential for agronomic management to maximize gross margin and reduce GHG emissions under climate change in southeast Australia. Results from this study could be used by farmers and policymakers to mitigate climate change without compromising agroecosystem profitability.","[He, Qinsi; Li, Linchao; Tian, Qi; Yu, Qiang] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [He, Qinsi] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Sch Life Sci, POB 123,Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [He, Qinsi; Liu, De Li; Wang, Bin; Li, Linchao; Li, Guangdi D.] Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia; [Liu, De Li] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Cowie, Annette] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Trevenna Rd, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Simmons, Aaron] NSW Dept Primary Ind, 98 Victoria St, Taree, NSW 2430, Australia; [Zhou, Hongxu] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Li, Sien] China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Li, Yi] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ke; Harrison, Matthew Tom] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Newnham Dr, Launceston, Tas 7248, Australia; [Yan, Haoliang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, State Key Lab Cotton Biol, Inst Cotton Res, Anyang 455000, Peoples R China; [Feng, Puyu] China Agr Univ, Coll Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Waters, Cathy] NSW Dept Primary Ind, 34 Hampden St, Dubbo, NSW 2830, Australia; [de Voil, Peter] Univ Queensland, Queensland Alliance Agr & Food Innovat QAAFI, Gatton Campus, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia; [Yu, Qiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Northwest A&F University - China; University of Technology Sydney; NSW Department of Primary Industries; University of New South Wales Sydney; NSW Department of Primary Industries; NSW Department of Primary Industries; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; China Agricultural University; Northwest A&F University - China; University of Tasmania; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Cotton Research, CAAS; China Agricultural University; NSW Department of Primary Industries; University of Queensland; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Yu, Q (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Liu, DL; Wang, B (corresponding author), Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia.",de.li.liu@dpi.nsw.gov.au; bin.a.wang@dpi.nsw.gov.au; yuq@nwafu.edu.cn,"Wang, Bin/AFI-6568-2022","Wang, Bin/0000-0002-6422-5802; Liu, Ke/0000-0002-8343-0449; He, Qinsi/0000-0001-9585-3716; tian, qi/0000-0001-8897-1714","NSW Primary Industries Climate Change Research Strategy; NSW Climate Change Fund; Natural Science Foundation of China [41730645]; Meat & Livestock Australia; University of Tasmania [P.PSH.1219, B.CCH.2121]; CMIP6; ESGF",NSW Primary Industries Climate Change Research Strategy; NSW Climate Change Fund; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Meat & Livestock Australia(Meat and Livestock Australia); University of Tasmania; CMIP6; ESGF,"This study was funded by the NSW Primary Industries Climate Change Research Strategy, the NSW Climate Change Fund, and Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41730645).

Following the most recent drought period (2015-2018), local authorities such as the City of Cape Town are being tasked with restructuring policy to include climate change adaptation strategies to adapt more adequately and proactively to these new challenges. This paper describes an evaluation of the water governance processes required to implement Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Cape Townwith a specific focus on the barriers to, and opportunities for, those processes related to wastewater treatment, flood risk and the pressing issue of water scarcity. The City Blueprint Approach (CBA) was selected as the indicator assessment approach for this task. The CBA is a set of diagnostic tools comprising the Trends and Pressures Framework, the City Blueprint Framework and the Governance Capacity Framework. This was applied to Cape Town based on in-depth interviews and publicly available information. The analysis revealed that smart monitoring, community knowledge and experimentation with alternative water management technologies are important when considering uncertainties and complexities in the governance of urban water challenges. We conclude that there is potential for Cape Town to transition to a water sensitive city through learning from this experimentation and by implementing WSUD strategies that address water scarcity following the shifts in governance caused by the 2015-2018 drought.","[Madonsela, Boipelo; Carden, Kirsty] Univ Cape Town, Dept Civil Engn, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Madonsela, Boipelo; Carden, Kirsty] Univ Cape Town, Future Water Res Inst, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Koop, Stef; van Leeuwen, Kees] KWR Watercycle Res Inst, Groningenhaven 7, NL-3430 BB Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [Koop, Stef; van Leeuwen, Kees] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; KWR Watercycle Research Institute; Utrecht University,"Carden, K (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Civil Engn, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.;Carden, K (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Future Water Res Inst, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",mdnboi002@myuct.ac.za; stef.koop@kwrwater.nl; kees.van.leeuwen@kwrwater.nl; kirsty.carden@uct.ac.za,"Carden, Kirsty/ABC-2415-2021; van Leeuwen, Cornelis J/S-5815-2016","Carden, Kirsty/0000-0003-2760-2418; van Leeuwen, Cornelis J/0000-0003-1605-4268",South African Water Research Commission (WRC) [K5/2413]; POWER project; European Commission [687809],South African Water Research Commission (WRC); POWER project; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),This project was partially funded by the South African Water Research Commission (WRC) as part of Project K5/2413-Development and management of a Water Sensitive Design Community of Practice program.

To do so, I will first discuss two alternate approaches to valuing, both of which fail to recognise the loss of valued objects and practices that both of which help to generate a sense of self and deserve to be respected and mourned.

Yet, our understanding of the WAP nexus remains surprisingly undeveloped and dispersed across multiple disciplines due to conceptual (biophysical and economic) and measurement issues. We argue that water for agriculture will need to be better managed for it to contribute to reductions in poverty and vulnerabilities. Moreover, this management will need to consider not just quantities of water, but the quality of the water and the multiple agricultural and non-agricultural uses. For this reason, expanding research in WAP needs to involve interdisciplinary efforts. We identify three key knowledge gaps in WAP that are particularly pressing in light of greater climatic variability. These are climate change adaptation, over-abstraction of groundwater, and water quality.","[Stifel, David] Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA 18040 USA; [Balasubramanya, Soumya; Stifel, David] Int Water Management Inst, Battaramulla, Sri Lanka",Lafayette College; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Stifel, D (corresponding author), Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18040 USA.",stifeld@lafayette.edu,,,"CGIAR Program on Water, Land, and Ecosystems; International Water Management Institute; Millennium Challenge Corporation under DCO SEC Program Management for Development and Implementation within the Irrigated Agricultural Sector [95332419T0016]; United States Agency for International Development [AID-OAA-A-13-00055]","CGIAR Program on Water, Land, and Ecosystems(CGIAR); International Water Management Institute; Millennium Challenge Corporation under DCO SEC Program Management for Development and Implementation within the Irrigated Agricultural Sector; United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID))","We would like to thank three anonymous reviewers, Chris Barrett, Matthew McCartney, Ruth Meinzen-Dick, Lal Mutuwatte, Lisa-Maria Rebelo, Claudia Sadoff, Petra Schmitter and Barbara van Koppen for discussions and comments, which helped us structure our thoughts.

We do this by examining the different risk components - mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis - in a multinomial treatment effects framework by controlling weather variables for key stages of crop growth. We found that adoption of combinations of practices is widely viewed as a risk-reducing insurance strategy that can increase farmers' resilience to production risk. The hypothesis of equality of weather parameters across crop development stages is also rejected. The heterogeneous effects of weather across crop growth stages have important implications for climate change adaptation to maximize quasi-option value.

In northern Kenya, under conditions of reduced rainfall and more frequent droughts, one response has been for pastoralists to focus increasingly on camel herding. Camels have started to be kept at higher altitudes and by people who rarely kept camels before. The development has been understood as a climate change adaptation strategy and as a means to improve climate resilience. Since 2003, development organizations have started to further the trend by distributing camels in the region. Up to now, little has been known about the nature of, reasons for, or ramifications of the increased reliance on camels.

Six future weather scenarios are employed to verify the integrated reservoir management system using Upper Thames River basin in Canada as a case study.

A number of existing studies, however, suggest that the two might be negatively affecting each other - climate adaptation might decrease mitigation efforts and vice versa. We have examined these effects in five experimental studies carried out in four countries (total N = 4,800) and have used Bayesian analysis to evaluate the strength of empirical support for such effects. We did not find any evidence that compensation between climate mitigation and adaptation takes place. On the contrary, we found some evidence, albeit rather weak, that prior focus on adaptation measures increases the subsequent tendency to engage in mitigation behavior; this effect is likely to be driven by an increase in worry about the impacts of climate change that results from a prior focus on climate adaptation. If anything, offering adaptation options may increase the tendency to mitigate climate change.","[Urban, Jan; Vackarova, Davina; Badura, Tomas] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, V Jircharich 149-6, Prague 11000, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Urban, J (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, V Jircharich 149-6, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",urban.j@czechglobe.cz,"Urban, Jan/Q-1484-2016; Vackarova, Davina/G-2128-2014; Badura, Tomas/AAE-7366-2020","Urban, Jan/0000-0003-3754-459X; Vackarova, Davina/0000-0002-6185-200X; Badura, Tomas/0000-0001-8264-0850",LIFE Programme of the European Union [LIFE17 GIC/CZ/000107],LIFE Programme of the European Union,"We wish to thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions, and Cliff McLenehan for his language support.

The USDA Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was calibrated to USGS daily streamflow data from 2011 to 2016 to evaluate watershed-scale daily and seasonal runoff responses to multiple future climate and management scenarios. The stormwater GI watershed had less runoff than the traditional management watershed in climate change scenarios for most days with rainfall (>98% of days). However, the climate change scenarios resulted in increased seasonal fall and winter runoff compared to current conditions in both watersheds. Simulated expansion of GI implementation reduced runoff in both watersheds under future climate scenarios.

Among the factors influencing these policy decisions is the question of timing: when are we likely to see climate change effects? Using a national climate-hydrology model cascade over the 21(st) century, times and extents of emergence of six hydrological metrics are evaluated across New Zealand rivers. While the stringency of the emergence criteria has a significant effect on timing and extent, emergence for all metrics generally occurs after mid-century, if at all, and in the country's South Island. Looking at the first emerging metrics, in contrast, allows us to sidestep the high uncertainties of the time of emergence, revealing mean winter flows to be the most extensive sentinel of climate change in New Zealand rivers among the metrics considered. This has implications for hydrological monitoring to inform timely climate change adaptation.","[Collins, Daniel B. G.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Collins, Daniel B.

Nutrient availability may be a critical factor explaining this variation, but is often ignored in analyses of drought responses. Here, we used a standardized nutrient addition experiment covering 10 European grasslands to test if full-factorial nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium addition affected plant community responses to inter-annual variation in drought stress and to the extreme summer drought of 2018 in Europe. We found that nutrient addition amplified detrimental drought effects on community aboveground biomass production. Drought effects also differed between functional groups, with a negative effect on graminoid but not forb biomass production. Our results imply that eutrophication in grasslands, which promotes dominance of drought-sensitive graminoids over forbs, amplifies detrimental drought effects. In terms of climate change adaptation, agricultural management would benefit from taking into account differential drought impacts on fertilized versus unfertilized grasslands, which differ in ecosystem services they provide to society.","[Van Sundert, Kevin; Nijs, Ivan; Radujkovic, Dajana; Vicca, Sara] Univ Antwerp, Biol Dept, Res Grp PLECO Plants & Ecosyst, Global Change Ecol Ctr Excellence, Antwerp, Belgium; [Arfin Khan, Mohammed A.

Considering the advantage in computational efficiency of the stochastic downscaling method, thousand scenarios of rainfall projections at very high temporal and spatial resolution were generated.

A particular focus is placed on the human security risks associated with the three elements. Recent Findings Climate change has been perceived as a threat multiplier, directly aggravating human security risks, such as food and water insecurity, as well as indirectly contributing to (violent) conflict in regions vulnerable to climate change. In addition to climate change-related environmental risks, such as droughts and floods, land and land use can be affected by climate mitigation and adaptation measures. These include, for instance, large-scale renewable energy plants and relocation efforts. Summary It is not only important for decision-makers to take climate change impacts into account but also to assess the indirect risks associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. For further research, it is hence promising to explore how conflict-sensitive approaches to climate change adaptation and mitigation can be developed.","[Froese, Rebecca; Schilling, Janpeter] Univ Koblenz Landau, Peace Acad Rhineland Palatinate, Landau, Germany; [Froese, Rebecca; Schilling, Janpeter] Univ Koblenz Landau, Res Grp Landuse Conflicts, Inst Environm Sci, Landau, Germany; [Froese, Rebecca; Schilling, Janpeter] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Res Grp Climate Change & Secur CLISEC, Hamburg, Germany",University of Koblenz & Landau; University of Koblenz & Landau; University of Hamburg,"Schilling, J (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Peace Acad Rhineland Palatinate, Landau, Germany.;Schilling, J (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Res Grp Landuse Conflicts, Inst Environm Sci, Landau, Germany.;Schilling, J (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Res Grp Climate Change & Secur CLISEC, Hamburg, Germany.",schilling@uni-landau.de,"Froese, Rebecca/R-3402-2019","Froese, Rebecca/0000-0001-6410-5432",University of Koblenz-Landau; School of Integrated Climate System Sciences (SICSS) at the University of Hamburg; National Geographic Society,University of Koblenz-Landau; School of Integrated Climate System Sciences (SICSS) at the University of Hamburg; National Geographic Society(National Geographic Society),"The overall work is supported by the University of Koblenz-Landau, the School of Integrated Climate System Sciences (SICSS) at the University of Hamburg and a grant of the National Geographic Society.",,108,33,35,28,91,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2198-6061,,,CURR CLIM CHANGE REP,Curr.

From a global justice perspective this may seem irrelevant but when the resulting technocratic approaches are applied to aid programs, addressing climate change as an autonomous field, the problems on the ground become distorted. Based on field studies in central Vietnam, the paper argues that fragmented approaches risk missing the target of helping the most vulnerable population groups, while ignoring the structural and environmental issues, which in many cases constitute more immediate threats to their livelihoods.","Roskilde Univ, Inst Soc & Globalizat, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Bruun, O (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Inst Soc & Globalizat, Bldg 23-1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",obruun@ruc.dk,,,Danida,Danida,"This research derives from a Vietnam Denmark collaborative research project on Impacts of Climate Change in MidCentral Vietnam (P1-08-Vie), funded by the Danida during 2009-12.",,65,22,22,0,27,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1948-8327,,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

J,"Ford, JD; King, D",,,,"Ford, James D.; King, Diana",,,Coverage and framing of climate change adaptation in the media: A review of influential North American newspapers during 1993-2013,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Adaptation; Media; Framing; Newspapers; North America,PRINT MEDIA; US; POLITICS; SCIENCE; IMPACT,"The portrayal of climate change in the news has been a major focus of research over the last decade, reflecting the importance of the media in affecting public opinion and policy. This work has primarily focused on the science of climate change, impacts, and mitigation, yet our understanding on how adaptation is being profiled in the media is limited. In response to this gap, this paper quantitatively examines the coverage and framing of climate change adaptation in four influential North American newspapers between 1993 and 2013. Over the observation period, the total number of articles focusing on adaptation published each year increases, with peaks in reporting in 2007, 2012, and 2013. While adaptation has permeated news coverage, it still remains overshadowed by stories on impacts and mitigation, with increased reporting consistent with increased media attention to climate change over the last two decades. Of the newspaper articles with adaptation content (n = 271), the majority (53%) focus primarily on stating the need to adapt, as opposed to documenting actual preparations being undertaken for adaptation or profiling actual adaptations that have taken place. The types of adaptation being reported on are predominantly 'hard' in nature, profiling techno-engineering based responses to reduce potential climate change impacts, in contrast to 'soft' responses that seek to enhance resilience. This representation is particularly evident in reporting in 2012 and 2013. Adaptations being described in the selected newspaper articles are primarily anticipatory in nature up until 2011, after which adaptations are primarily discussed in terms of responding to extreme weather events, specifically in the context of a surge in reporting documented in response to Hurricane Sandy (2012) and flooding in Canada in 2013.

There were three treatment combinations (S+ PP-relay horsegram (HG), S+PP-ratoon S and S+ PP-sequence HG) accommodating an opportune crop of relay or sequence HG to be tested against checks of sole crops. S and PP strip system in a high rainfall year (2013) yielded 31% higher grain than 2: 1 S and PP intercropping, but such advantages were not observed during a deficit rainfall year (2014). Significant PP yield increase during a high rainfall year in a strip system increased both water productivity (10.1 to 16.5 kg/ha/mm) and net returns ( 57490 to 71680/ year). Similarly, during high rainfall year (2013), a superior diverse index (1.63 over 1.19) and production efficiency (19.6 over 13.5 kg/ha/day) was observed. Both relay/sequence cropped HG performed equally well while ratoon S performed poorly. Therefore, for changing climate, 4: 4 strip intercropping of S and PP showed higher productivity and economic returns as compared to 2: 1 intercropping system. Opportune cropping through relay or sequence HG can be successfully carried out in semi-arid regions during post monsoon season for climate change adaptation.","[Maruthi, V.] ICAR Cent Res Inst Dryland Agr, Div Crop Sci, Agron, Hyderabad 500059, Telangana, India; [Reddy, K.

However, urban regions worldwide exhibit an immense diversity of conditions, capabilities and responses to the challenges of changing climatic conditions. While separated by politico-administrative borders, adjacent municipalities within such regions are connected through biophysical, politico-economic, and social systems likely to be reconfigured under changing climatic/environmental conditions. Yet, to date, politico-administrative borders have largely determined the parameters of local government climate change adaptation strategies, with insufficient attention to the role of inter-municipal collaboration, especially between neighbouring rural, peri-urban and urban municipalities, for co-ordinating such policies and interventions. Within a multi-level governance framework, this paper considers the recent evolution of climate agendas in the eThekwini (formerly Durban City Council) metropolitan municipality and the adjacent Ugu (predominantly rural) district municipality on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal province (KZN), South Africa, focusing particularly on cross-border collaboration within the greater city region. The challenges were investigated by means of 53 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with municipal, regional and local authority association staff in November 2009, March 2012, and August 2017. Our core argument is that weak inter-municipal collaboration, particularly between urban, peri-urban and rural areas within metropolitan and functional city regions, has been a significant impediment to realizing transformative adaptation within such regions. The experiences of these two contiguous yet contrasting municipalities represent a microcosm of the dramatic discontinuities and inequalities on all variables within adjacent urban metropolitan and rural contexts in South Africa and beyond. Despite promising recent signs, the challenges of inter-municipal collaborative action are therefore formidable.","[Leck, Hayley] Kings Coll London, Sch Global Affairs, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Simon, David] Chalmers Univ Technol, Mistra Urban Futures, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Simon, David] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Geog, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England",University of London; King's College London; Chalmers University of Technology; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Leck, H (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Sch Global Affairs, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England.",hayley.leck@kcl.ac.uk; david.simon@chalmers.se,,"Simon, David/0000-0002-3164-4138","Emma Smith Overseas Scholarship; Royal Holloway, University of London College Overseas Research Fund","Emma Smith Overseas Scholarship; Royal Holloway, University of London College Overseas Research Fund","Initial empirical work by H.L. for this paper was partly funded by the Emma Smith Overseas Scholarship and the Royal Holloway, University of London College Overseas Research Fund.",,65,10,10,3,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2018,10,7,,,,,,,2542,10.3390/su10072542,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10072542,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GP5WQ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000440947600433,View Full Record in Web of Science

Like other forms of green infrastructure, they are increasingly being considered as a design feature to cool internal building temperatures, reduce building energy consumption and facilitate urban adaptation to a warming climate. To develop a better predictive framework for green facade thermal performance we reviewed the scientific literature - a literature currently dominated by the disciplines of architecture and engineering, and lacking inter-disciplinary input from plant biology, ecology, horticulture and soil science. We found that many of the studies were prone to research design problems; the small number of experimental studies lacked replication and provided insufficient information about the microclimate parameters measured, while the assumptions of modelling studies were not always delineated or justified. Few studies considered the influence of climbing plant characteristics, and fewer still investigated the impact of green facade design components (support structures, growing media, plant containers and irrigation systems) on green facade thermal performance. As a framework for future green facade research, we propose that standardised methods be adopted, and to this end, set out the minimum microclimatic data required to enable comparative assessment of green fac, ade performance. Furthermore, we stress the need for research on the interaction between climbing plant parameters and building energy balances, as well as on the influence of green fac, ade design elements on thermal performance. Without this shift in approach, unrealistic expectations of green facade performance and their climate change adaptation benefits will persist. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Participatory plant breeding (PPB) has been promoted for its advantages to increase selection efficiency, variety adoption and farmers' empowerment, and for being more socially equitable and gender responsive than conventional plant breeding. In this review paper we concentrate on one specific benefit of PPB, namely, increasing agrobiodiversity by describing how the combination of decentralized selection with the collaboration of farmers is able to address the diversity of agronomic environments, which is likely to increase because of the location specificity of climate change. Therefore, while PPB has been particularly suited to organic agriculture, in light of the increasing importance of climate change, it should also be considered as a breeding opportunity for conventional agriculture.","[Ceccarelli, Salvatore; Grando, Stefania] Corso Mazzini 256, I-63100 Ascoli Piceno, Italy",,"Ceccarelli, S (corresponding author), Corso Mazzini 256, I-63100 Ascoli Piceno, Italy.",ceccarelli.salvatore83@gmail.com; sgrando56@gmail.com,,"Ceccarelli, Salvatore/0000-0003-3063-9836; Grando, Stefania/0000-0002-0255-8433",,,,,57,4,4,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,FEB,2022,14,2,,,,,,,126,10.3390/d14020126,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14020126,,,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZK1AA,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000762727200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Traditionally, flood management has concentrated on providing protection against floods using technical measures, but there is currently an international shift towards more integrated flood risk management, whereby flood risk is defined as the probability of flooding multiplied by the potential consequences. Governance plays a key role in this transition. However, relatively little has been written on how climate governance lessons are implemented on a city-scale.

Adaptation to climate change and variability has gained a prominent place on global and local policy agendas, evolving from mainly climate risks impacts and vulnerability assessments to mainly adaptation action, imposing new defies to higher education ( HE). The purpose of this paper is to introduce the Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation (VIA) Network (CliVIA-Net), a South American university-based coalition aimed at achieving a science for/of adaptation. Design/methodology/approach - CliVIA-Net is a collaborative effort by academic groups from across the spectrum of the natural, social and health sciences focused on improving climate VIA on education, research and practice. In consonance with international literature and practices, the network shifted from a discipline-oriented approach to an interdisciplinary and Earth System Science (ESS)-oriented one. It seeks to advance fundamental understanding and participatory practice-oriented research and to develop a problem orientation question/solving answering methodology. A set of cases studies illustrates how CliVIA-Net faces adaptation and sustainability challenges in the twenty-first century. Findings - Focusing on interdisciplinary graduate education, practice-oriented research and problem orientation practice on climate threats which are already threatening the environment, population's well-being and sustainability, allows for the co-production of knowledge and solutions, as well stakeholders' buy-in and commitment. Originality/value - CliVIA-Net draws upon the results of evolving interdisciplinary approaches on global change and VIA education, the research partnership with stakeholders and decision-makers to develop environmental and health outcomes, e.g. vulnerability indicators and scenario planning.","[Nagy, Gustavo J.] Univ Republ UdelaR, Fac Ciencias, IECA, Climate Impact Vulnerabil & Adaptat CliVIA Networ, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Cabrera, Carolina] FC UdelaR, Unidad Ensenanza, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Coronel, Genaro] Univ Nacl Asuncion FP UNA, Fac Politecn, MCG, San Lorenzo, Paraguay; [Aparicio-Effen, Marilyn; Arana, Ivar] UMSA, IBBA, Fac Med, Unidad Cambio Climat Ambiente & Salud, La Paz, Bolivia; [Lairet, Rafael] UCV, CLCC, Fac Ingn, Caracas, Venezuela; [Villamizar, Alicia] Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Estudios Ambientales, Caracas, Venezuela","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidad Mayor de San Andres; University of Central Venezuela; Simon Bolivar University","Nagy, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Republ UdelaR, Fac Ciencias, IECA, Climate Impact Vulnerabil & Adaptat CliVIA Networ, Montevideo, Uruguay.",gustavo.nagy56@gmail.com,,,,,,,57,8,8,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

However, problematic assumptions of rationality remain common in studies of agricultural economics and climate change adaptation, especially those that involve quantitative models. Recent movement toward more complex agent-based modeling provides an opportunity to reconsider the empirical basis for farmer decision making. Here, we reconceptualize farmer decision making from the ground up, using an in situ mental models approach to analyze weather and climate risk management. We assess how large-scale commercial grain farmers in South Africa (n = 90) coordinate decisions about weather, climate variability, and climate change with those around other environmental, agronomic, economic, political, and personal risks that they manage every day. Contrary to common simplifying assumptions, we show that these farmers tend to satisfice rather than optimize as they face intractable and multifaceted uncertainty; they make imperfect use of limited information; they are differently averse to different risks; they make decisions on multiple time horizons; they are cautious in responding to changing conditions; and their diverse risk perceptions contribute to important differences in individual behaviors. We find that they use two important nonoptimizing strategies, which we call cognitive thresholds and hazy hedging, to make practical decisions under pervasive uncertainty. These strategies, evident in farmers' simultaneous use of conservation agriculture and livestock to manage weather risks, are the messy in situ performance of naturalistic decision-making techniques. These results may inform continued research on such behavioral tendencies in narrower lab- and modeling-based studies.","[Findlater, Kieran M.; Satterfield, Terre; Kandlikar, Milind] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Findlater, Kieran M.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Kandlikar, Milind] Univ British Columbia, Sch Publ Policy & Global Affairs, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of Cape Town; University of British Columbia,"Findlater, KM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",k.findlater@alumni.ubc.ca,,"Findlater, Kieran/0000-0002-6818-5588",International Development Research Centre [106204-99906075-058]; Centre for International Governance Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2013-2017]; University of British Columbia; IODE Canada,International Development Research Centre; Centre for International Governance Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); University of British Columbia; IODE Canada,"We thank our participants for their time and attention; Mark New and the African Climate & Development Initiative at the University of Cape Town for logistical support; Peter Johnston, Johann Strauss, and Francis Steyn for their guidance; Jannie Bruwer, Pieter Burger, Louis Coetzee, Pierre Laubscher, Daniel Badenhorst, and Elena Hough for their help in recruiting willing participants; and Lucy Rodina for her research assistance.

This paper argues that nature-based solutions could guide climate adaptation planning, but it would need to be scaled-up across the globe to have an effective impact on climate adaptation. Literature poses various proposals of how to include nature-based solutions to guide adaptation planning, but practical examples and evidence of such are more limited. This paper addresses this lack by providing examples of two case studies, one in the Netherlands (Amersfoort) and one in South Africa (Lephalale). These two case studies were purposefully selected based on the nature-based approaches they employed in response to climate change challenges. The cases were accordingly considered in terms of their socio-ecological and environmental context, the scale of implementation of the nature-based solutions, the flexibility of these responses employed, and the overall benefits provided through the nature-based approaches. A comparative analysis was conducted between the two cases and highlighted that nature-based approaches could not be limited to a singular ad-hoc approach, but should rather be scaled up and more comprehensive, in order to align with the objectives of climate adaptation planning. The cases evidenced how the broader environment could benefit when nature-based solutions are scaled up to guide climate adaptation.","[Cilliers, Elizelle Juanee; Rohr, Hildegard] North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Cilliers, Elizelle Juanee] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, Ultimo, NSW, Australia; [Timmermans, Wim] Wageningen Univ, Climate Resilience Team, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Goosen, Hasse] Climate Adaptat Serv, Bussum, Netherlands",North West University - South Africa; University of Technology Sydney; Wageningen University & Research,"Cilliers, EJ (corresponding author), North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa.;Cilliers, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, Ultimo, NSW, Australia.",juaneep@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,1,1,8,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9634,,FRONT SUSTAIN CITIES,Front.

The objectives of this study were to (a) assess the future impact of climate change on cacao in Peru and (b) identify areas where climate change-tolerant genotypes are potentially present. Location Peru Methods Drawing on 19,700 and 1,200 presence points of cultivated and wild cacao, respectively, we modelled their suitability distributions using multiple ensemble models constructed based on both random and target group selection of pseudo-absence points and different resolutions of spatial filtering. To estimate the uncertainty of future predictions, we generated future projections for all the ensemble models. We investigated the potential emergence of novel climates, determined expected changes in ecogeographical zones (zones representative for particular sets of growth conditions) and carried out an outlier analysis based on the environmental variables most relevant for climate change adaptation to identify areas where climate change-tolerant genotypes are potentially present. Results We found that the best modelling approaches differed between cultivated and wild cacao and that the resolution of spatial filtering had a strong impact on future suitability predictions, calling for careful evaluation of the effect of model selection on modelling results. Overall, our models foresee a contraction of suitable area for cultivated cacao while predicting a more positive future for wild cacao in Peru. Ecogeographical zones are expected to change in 8%-16% of the distribution of cultivated and wild cacao. We identified several areas where climate change-tolerant genotypes may be present in Peru. Main conclusions Our results indicate that tolerant genotypes will be required to facilitate the adaptation of cacao cultivation under climate change. The identified cacao populations will be target of collection missions.","[Ceccarelli, Viviana; Fremout, Tobias; Zavaleta, Diego; Lastra, Sphyros; Thomas, Evert] Biovers Int, Lima, Peru; [Fremout, Tobias] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Leuven, Belgium; [Iman Correa, Sixto; Cruz Hilacondo, Wilbert] Inst Nacl Innovac Agr, La Molina, Peru; [Arevalo-Gardini, Enrique] Inst Cult Trop ICT, Tarapoto, Peru; [Arevalo-Gardini, Enrique] Univ Nacl Autonoma Alto Amazonas, Yurimaguas, Peru; [Rodriguez, Carlos Armando] Serv Nacl Sanidad & Calidad Agroalimentaria, Quillabamba, Peru",Alliance; Bioversity International; KU Leuven,"Thomas, E (corresponding author), Biovers Int, Lima, Peru.",e.thomas@cgiar.org,,"Ceccarelli, Viviana/0000-0003-2160-9483; Fremout, Tobias/0000-0002-0812-3027; thomas, evert/0000-0002-7838-6228; Lastra, Sphyros/0000-0001-9017-0852; Zavaleta, Diego P./0000-0002-2704-8114; AREVALO-GARDINI, ENRIQUE/0000-0002-1725-6788","Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany [81219430]; CGIAR Fund Donors","Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany; CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR)","Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany, Grant/Award Number: 81219430; CGIAR Fund Donors",,73,11,11,5,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

We introduce a global high-resolution asset exposure dataset responding to this challenge. The data are produced using lit population (LitPop), a globally consistent methodology to disaggregate asset value data proportional to a combination of nightlight intensity and geographical population data. By combining nightlight and population data, unwanted artefacts such as blooming, saturation, and lack of detail are mitigated. Thus, the combination of both data types improves the spatial distribution of macroeconomic indicators. Due to the lack of reported subnational asset data, the disaggregation methodology cannot be validated for asset values. Therefore, we compare disaggregated gross domestic product (GDP) per subnational administrative region to reported gross regional product (GRP) values for evaluation. The comparison for 14 industrialized and newly industrialized countries shows that the disaggregation skill for GDP using nightlights or population data alone is not as high as using a combination of both data types. The advantages of LitPop are global consistency, scalability, openness, replicability, and low entry threshold.

This study explores these gender impacts across different farming systems and gender-respondent-household typologies using data from the Rural Household Multiple Indicator Survey (RHoMIS) in 2,859 households in three East African countries-Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. Female control scores over incomes or foodstuffs produced through both on and off farm activities were highest in farming systems that had more land and more livestock. However, increasing commercialization-defined herein as the increasing importance of crop and livestock sales to farm households-resulted in an overall decline in female control across all farming systems and gender-respondent-household typologies. In contrast, crop and livestock diversification were positively associated with female control across gender-respondent-household typologies. Analysis of specific crops and livestock products across farming systems and respondent typologies revealed women have far greater control over decisions related to consumption than decisions related to sales, although the gap between the two were less pronounced in lesser-valued livestock products (chickens, eggs). However, the analyses suggest that as sale of crops and livestock increase, female control over these areas could likely diminish, regardless of specific activity. The authors conclude that approaches to adapt to or mitigate climate change that rely on increasing market orientation of smallholder production will likely intensify men's control over benefits from production, whereas diversification will likely have a more positive impact on female control. Thus, climate adaptation strategies promoting increased diversification will likely have a more positive impact on women smallholders than commercialization alone. The authors recommend that when commercialization is the target intervention, it must be accompanied by a gender differentiated analysis of trade-offs and risks to mitigate the potential negative consequences shown in this study.","[Tavenner, Katie; van Wijk, Mark; Fraval, Simon; Hammond, James; Baltenweck, Isabelle; Teufel, Nils; Kihoro, Esther; de Haan, Nicoline] ILRI, Dept Sustainable Livestock Syst, Nairobi, Kenya; [van Etten, Jacob; Steinke, Jonathan] Biovers Int, Maccarese, Italy; [Baines, David; Carpena, Pietro; Skirrow, Tom] TreeAID, Bristol, Avon, England; [Rosenstock, Todd; Lamanna, Christine; Ng'endo, Mary; Chesterman, Sabrina; Namoi, Nictor; Manda, Lucas] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Nairobi, Kenya",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Alliance; Bioversity International; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Tavenner, K (corresponding author), ILRI, Dept Sustainable Livestock Syst, Nairobi, Kenya.",tavenka05@gmail.com,,"Tavenner, Katie/0000-0002-6070-5921; Ng'endo Kanui, Mary/0000-0002-6349-5325; Fraval, Simon/0000-0002-2936-2537; Kihoro, Esther/0000-0002-0956-5134; van Etten, Jacob/0000-0001-7554-2558; Steinke, Jonathan/0000-0001-5742-702X",CGIAR Research Program on Livestock; United States Agency for International Development (USAID),CGIAR Research Program on Livestock(CGIAR); United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIAR),`This study was made possible by support of the CGIAR Research Program on Livestock and its donors.

A prominent exemplar is the Colorado River, where meteorological drought and warming are shrinking a water resource that supports more than 1 trillion dollars of economic activity per year. A Monte Carlo simulation with a radiation-aware hydrologic model resolves the longstanding, wide disparity in sensitivity estimates and reveals the controlling physical processes. We estimate that annual mean discharge has been decreasing by 9.3% per degree Celsius of warming because of increased evapotranspiration, mainly driven by snow loss and a consequent decrease in reflection of solar radiation. Projected precipitation increases likely will not suffice to fully counter the robust, thermodynamically induced drying. Thus, an increasing risk of severe water shortages is expected.","[Milly, P.

Decision makers are faced with uncertain sea-level projections when designing a strategy for coastal adaptation. The traditional methods are often silent on tradeoffs as well as the effects of tail-area events and of potential future learning. Here we reformulate a simple sea-level rise adaptation model to address these concerns. We show that Direct Policy Search yields improved solution quality, with respect to Pareto-dominance in the objectives, over the traditional approach under uncertain sea-level rise projections and storm surge. Additionally, the new formulation produces high quality solutions with less computational demands than an intertemporal optimization approach. Our results illustrate the utility of multi-objective adaptive formulations for the example of coastal adaptation and point to wider-ranging application in climate change adaptation decision problems.","[Garner, Gregory G.] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Keller, Klaus] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Keller, Klaus] Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Syst Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Keller, Klaus] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Princeton University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Carnegie Mellon University,"Garner, GG (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, 413A Robertson Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",ggarner@princeton.edu,"Keller, Klaus/A-6742-2013","Garner, Gregory/0000-0001-7864-1535",National Science Foundation through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF [GEO-1240507]; Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management; Directorate For Geosciences [1240507] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF; Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF cooperative agreement GEO-1240507 as well as the Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management.

What are the arguments for and against EbA? Who favours EbA? What does EbA mean in practice? What are the limits to EbA as global average temperature rises? Reviewing documents of non-governmental organisations, governments, intergovernmental organisations and scholars helps answer these and related questions. As climate change results in increasing challenges for society, the more important all forms of adaptation, including EbA, will become.

Adaptation of the agricultural sector is vital to increase the resilience of smallholder farmers' livelihoods in times of climate change. To complement efforts already implemented by farmers to reduce social vulnerability it is important to understand how farmers perceive their current and future capacity to adapt to climate change. This paper aims to explore smallholder farmers' capacity to respond to climate change in current and future agricultural production. We carried out open, in-depth interviews (n=13), focus group discussions, and structured interviews (n=114) in the Thua Thien Hue province. Our findings show that farmers nowadays experience more extreme climate variability. Farmers report increasing stresses due to temperature increase and droughts. The autonomous adaptation strategies adopted by farmers include; adjusting the season calendar, using tolerant varieties and breeds, applying integrated crop production models, and income diversification. The motives for adopting particular planned adaptation options differ between farmers in crop production and livestock production. Four factors were found to be significant (p<.05) in influencing the spread of adaptation measures (AMs) farmers adopted: farm income, the number of available information sources, number of workers on the farm, and farmable land available during the summer season. Farmers report several barriers to implement adaptation strategies including; market price fluctuations, lack of skilled labour, lack of climate change information, and lack of capacity to learn and apply techniques in their daily practice. While both crop and livestock farmers participated in one or several training courses on climate change in the past years, livestock farmers were still uncertain about their future capacity and possible AMs.","[Le Thi Hong Phuong; Wals, Arjen E.

The public health infrastructure in the U. S. is organized largely as an interlocking set of public agencies at the federal, state and local level, with lead responsibility for each city or county often residing at the local level. To understand how directors of local public health departments view and are responding to climate change as a public health issue, we conducted a telephone survey with 133 randomly selected local health department directors, representing a 61% response rate. A majority of respondents perceived climate change to be a problem in their jurisdiction, a problem they viewed as likely to become more common or severe over the next 20 years. Only a small minority of respondents, however, had yet made climate change adaptation or prevention a top priority for their health department. This discrepancy between problem recognition and programmatic responses may be due, in part, to several factors: most respondents felt personnel in their health department-and other key stakeholders in their community-had a lack of knowledge about climate change; relatively few respondents felt their own health department, their state health department, or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had the necessary expertise to help them create an effective mitigation or adaptation plan for their jurisdiction; and most respondents felt that their health department needed additional funding, staff and staff training to respond effectively to climate change. These data make clear that climate change adaptation and prevention are not currently major activities at most health departments, and that most, if not all, local health departments will require assistance in making this transition. We conclude by making the case that, through their words and actions, local health departments and their staff can and should play a role in alerting members of their community about the prospect of public health impacts from climate change in their jurisdiction.","[Maibach, Edward W.] George Mason Univ, Ctr Climate Change Commun, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Chadwick, Amy] Penn State Univ, State Coll, PA USA; [McBride, Dennis] Milford Dept Hlth, Milford, MA USA; [Chuk, Michelle] Natl Assoc County & City Hlth Officials, Washington, DC USA; [Ebi, Kristie L.] ESS, LLC, Alexandria, VA USA; [Balbus, John] Environm Defense, Washington, DC USA",George Mason University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Maibach, EW (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Ctr Climate Change Commun, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",emaibach@gmu.edu,"Maibach, Edward/A-7102-2009","Maibach, Edward/0000-0003-3409-9187",,,,,24,74,76,0,27,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUL 30,2008,3,7,,,,,,,e2838,10.1371/journal.pone.0002838,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002838,,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,420QM,18665266,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000264304300057,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, little cross-fertilization between climate adaptation and strategy management literature has taken place. This study explores how strategy management theories focused on the role of business relations help to understand the influence of business networks on the adaptive behaviour of firms. As investigated through the business dynamics operating in Jamaica's cassava value chain, companies are exposed to a series of trade-offs generated within their business environment. In particular, networks are shown to generate both opportunities and constraints that affect business adaptive behaviour and to be a mechanism to influence and be influenced by others. Two fundamental network-level actions that businesses can foster to increase their adaptive capacity and maintain local economic development can be drawn from this assessment. First, by effectively managing relationships, business can unlock access to valuable resources for adaptation. Second, the dynamic and interdependent nature of business relationships calls for business adaptation efforts to focus on the development of collaborative and joint problem-solving approaches. The relational strategy management view of climate adaptation introduced in this study opens interesting lines of inquiry on factors shaping the adaptation landscape of businesses.","[Canevari-Luzardo, Laura] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, Bush House,North East Wing ,30 Aldwych, London WC2B 4BG, England",University of London; King's College London,"Canevari-Luzardo, L (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, Bush House,North East Wing ,30 Aldwych, London WC2B 4BG, England.",laura.canevariluzardo@linacre.ox.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J500057/1],Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES/J500057/1].,,79,5,5,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The objective of this study was to develop an orchestration aid system for concurrent gridded simulations of crop growth, which would support the design of climate change adaptation options on crop production without expertise in distributed computing. The orchestration aid system was designed to help a user build a set of virtualized cluster computers using a simple input file, which would require little expertise in distributed computing, rather than manual configuration. The orchestration aid system, which was referred to as GROWLERS-kube, was implemented to launch multiple sets of gridded simulations using pods or containers managed by Kubernetes. As a case study, GROWLER-kube was executed using 16 Raspberry Pi 4 computers to perform 120 sets of the gridded simulations under diverse crop management options, including varying planting date and cultivar, for the period from 2001 to 2010. The wall time or the elapsed time for the given sets of the gridded simulation differed by configuration of virtualized cluster computers, such as the number of pods used for server and client nodes, although the total number of physical nodes were identical. For example, the wall time difference between virtualized cluster computer sets was about 28.9% when 15 worker nodes were used. In particular, the acceleration of the gridded simulations was at maximum using a large number of the virtualized cluster computers with a small number of nodes. It was found that the spatial distribution of planting dates and cultivars was similar to that of a previous study based on field experiments mostly in regions where rice is usually grown. These results suggest that GROWLERS-kube would facilitate the spatial assessment of climate change impact on crop production without considerable effort and expertise in distributed computing, which would aid a researcher to focus on the design of adaptation strategies.","[Kim, Junhwan] Rural Dev Adm, Natl Inst Crop Sci, Crop Prod & Physiol Div, Wanju Gun 55365, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea; [Park, Jin Yu; Kim, Kwang Soo] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Hyun, Shinwoo; Yoo, Byoung Hyun; Kim, Kwang Soo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Forestry & Bioresources, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Fleisher, David H.] USDA ARS, Adapt Cropping Syst Lab, Beltsville, MD USA","Rural Development Administration (RDA), Republic of Korea; National Institute of Crop Science; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)","Kim, KS (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Forestry & Bioresources, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",luxkwang@snu.ac.kr,,,Cooperative Research for Agriculture Science Technology [PJ013837032019],Cooperative Research for Agriculture Science Technology,This study was supported by Cooperative Research for Agriculture Science Technology.; Development (PJ013837032019) program.,,29,2,2,1,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

It argues that treaty pathways may not work, and an operable pathway to promote clean technology diffusion is to maximize and consolidate TRIPS flexibilities in national laws. This option challenges the popular proposal of a Doha-like declaration on TRIPS and climate change due to the paralyzed multilateral trade mechanism, asymmetrical negotiation power of developing countries, prolonged negotiation process, and categorization problem in treaty negotiations.","[Cheng, Wenting] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Law, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Cheng, WT (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Coll Law, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Wenting.cheng@anu.edu.au,,"Cheng, Wenting/0000-0002-7986-3946",ANU Grand Challenge Zero-Carbon Energy for the Asia-Pacific,ANU Grand Challenge Zero-Carbon Energy for the Asia-Pacific,This paper is supported by the ANU Grand Challenge Zero-Carbon Energy for the Asia-Pacific.,,128,0,0,3,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2044-2513,2044-2521,,ASIAN J INT LAW,Asian J.

Against calls within civil society for dramatic decarbonisation, the continued expansion of the fossil fuel industry is constructed by governments and business as 'common sense'. By analysing the political process surrounding the 2016 and 2017 coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, we show how a fossil fuel hegemony has been upheld against the counter-hegemonic forces of environmental critique and the catastrophic bleaching events. By distinguishing between politics (i.e. strategies, practices and discourses) and the political (i.e. the antagonism constitutive of societies), we explain what different hegemonic practices achieve in the process of establishing and defending hegemony. In our case, this resulted in downplaying emissions mitigation and emphasising local climate change adaptation. Through the political process, business solutions and self-regulation were presented as the logical response to the climate crisis.","[Nyberg, Daniel] Univ Newcastle, Business Sch, Management, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Wright, Christopher] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Org Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Newcastle; University of Sydney,"Wright, C (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",christopher.wright@sydney.edu.au,"Nyberg, Daniel/ABE-2371-2021","Nyberg, Daniel/0000-0002-7144-1343; Wright, Christopher/0000-0001-8624-9605",University of Sydney Business School; University of Sydney Sydney Environment Institute,University of Sydney Business School; University of Sydney Sydney Environment Institute,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding for this research was provided by the University of Sydney Business School and the Sydney Environment Institute.",,89,0,0,5,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1350-5084,1461-7323,,ORGANIZATION,Organization,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/13505084221115836,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/13505084221115836,,AUG 2022,22,Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,3L8ON,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000835022100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, estimates of future climate are uncertain and methods for assessing uncertainties typically rely on the results of climate model simulations, which are constrained by the quality of assumptions used in model experiments and the limitations of available models. To strengthen scientific knowledge for climate services and climate change adaptation decisions, we explore the use of structured expert elicitation to assess future regional climate change. Using the Lower Yangtze region in China as a case study, we elicit judgements from six experts on future changes in temperature and precipitation as well as uncertainty sources, and compare it with climate model outputs from the Couple Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). We find high consensus amongst experts that the Lower Yangtze region will be warmer in the coming decades, albeit with differences in the magnitude of change. There is less consensus about the direction and magnitude of future precipitation change. Compared with CMIP5 climate model outputs, experts provide similar or narrower uncertainty ranges for temperature change and very different uncertainty ranges for precipitation. Experts considered additional factors (e.g. model credibility, observations, theory and paleo-climatic evidence) and uncertainties not usually represented in conventional modelling approaches. We argue that, in context of regional climate information provision, expert-elicited judgements can characterise less predictable, or less explored, elements of the climate system and expert elicited reasoning provides additional information and knowledge that is absent from modelling approaches. We discuss the value in bringing together multiple lines of evidence, arguing that expert elicited information can complement model information to strengthen regional climate change knowledge and help in building dialogue between climate experts and regional stakeholders, as part of a more complete climate service.","[Grainger, Sam] Maynooth Univ, Dept Geog, Irish Climate Anal & Res UnitS ICARUS, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Grainger, Sam; Taylor, Andrea; Siu, Yim Ling] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, England; [Dessai, Suraje] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, England; [Dessai, Suraje; Daron, Joseph] Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, England; [Daron, Joseph] Univ Bristol, Fac Sci, Bristol BS8 1UH, England; [Taylor, Andrea] Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Ctr Decis Res, Leeds LS2 9JT, England; Univ Leeds, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, England",Maynooth University; University of Leeds; University of Leeds; Met Office - UK; University of Bristol; University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Leeds,"Grainger, S (corresponding author), Maynooth Univ, Dept Geog, Irish Climate Anal & Res UnitS ICARUS, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",sam.grainger@mu.ie,"Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009; Daron, Joseph/I-3942-2014","Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364; Daron, Joseph/0000-0003-1917-0264","UK-China Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund [112459]; U.K.'s Economic and Social Research Council Centre for Climate Change, Economics and Policy (CCCEP) [ES/R009708/1]","UK-China Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund; U.K.'s Economic and Social Research Council Centre for Climate Change, Economics and Policy (CCCEP)","This work was supported by the UK-China Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund (112459).

High rates of urban sprawl need to be reduced by increased inner-urban development while settlements have to adapt to climate change and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. In this study, we analyze conflicts in the management of urban areas and develop integrated sustainable land use strategies for Germany. The spatial explicit land use change model Land Use Scanner is used to simulate alternative scenarios of land use change for Germany for 2030. A multi-criteria analysis is set up based on these scenarios and based on a set of indicators. They are used to measure whether the mitigation and adaptation objectives can be achieved and to uncover conflicts between these aims. The results show that the built-up and transport area development can be influenced both in terms of magnitude and spatial distribution to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Strengthening the inner-urban development is particularly effective in terms of reducing built-up and transport area development. It is possible to reduce built-up and transport area development to approximately 30 ha per day in 2030, which matches the sustainability objective of the German Federal Government for the year 2020. In the case of adaptation to climate change, the inclusion of extreme flood events in the context of spatial planning requirements may contribute to a reduction of the damage potential.","[Hoymann, Jana] Fed Inst Res Bldg Urban Affairs & Spatial Dev, Deichmanns Aue 31-37, D-53179 Bonn, Germany; [Goetzke, Roland] Fed Minist Transport & Digital Infrastruct, Robert Schumann Pl 1, D-53175 Bonn, Germany",,"Hoymann, J (corresponding author), Fed Inst Res Bldg Urban Affairs & Spatial Dev, Deichmanns Aue 31-37, D-53179 Bonn, Germany.",jana.hoymann@bbr.bund.de; roland.goetzke@bmvi.bund.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ: 01LL0909B],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The research at the Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development (BBSR) was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (FKZ: 01LL0909B).",,38,13,13,3,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2220-9964,,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

Based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change methodology, VESTAP can be used to evaluate Korea's vulnerability to major climate impacts (including 32 conditions in 8 categories). VESTAP is based on RCP 4.5/8.5 scenarios and can provide evaluation results in 10-year intervals from the 2010s to 2040s. In addition, this paper presents the results of a case study using VESTAP for targeted assessment of health vulnerability to heat waves under the RCP 8.5 scenario for the 2040s. Through vulnerability assessment at the province level in South Korea, Daegu Metropolitan City was identified as the most vulnerable region. The municipality and submunicipality levels of Daegu were also assessed in separate stages. The results indicated that Pyeongni 3-Dong in Seo-Gu was most vulnerable. Through comprehensive analysis of the results, the climate exposure index was identified as the greatest contributor to health vulnerability in Korea. Regional differences in climate exposure can be moderated by social investment in improving sensitivity and adaptive capacity. This study is significant in presenting a quantitative assessment of vulnerability to climate change by the administrative unit in South Korea. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the efficient development and implementation of climate change adaptation policies in South Korea.","[Oh, Kwan-Young; Lee, Moung-Jin] KEI, Ctr Environm Assessment Monitoring, 370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong 30147, South Korea; [Jeon, Seong-Woo] Korea Univ, Div Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea Environment Institute (KEI); Korea University,"Lee, MJ (corresponding author), KEI, Ctr Environm Assessment Monitoring, 370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong 30147, South Korea.;Jeon, SW (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Div Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",ohky@kei.re.kr; leemj@kei.re.kr; eepps_korea@korea.ac.kr,"Jeon, Seongwoo/AAU-4618-2020","Jeon, Seongwoo/0000-0001-5928-8510","Technology Advancement Research Program (TARP) - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Korean government [16CTAP-C114629-01]; Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) [114628] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)","Technology Advancement Research Program (TARP) - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Korean government(Ministry of Land, Infrastructure & Transport (MOLIT), Republic of Korea); Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA)(Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA))","This research was conducted at Korea Environment Institute (KEI) with support by a grant (16CTAP-C114629-01) from the Technology Advancement Research Program (TARP) funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Korean government.",,34,12,12,6,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2017,9,7,,,,,,,1103,10.3390/su9071103,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9071103,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3AB,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000406709500032,View Full Record in Web of Science

On mitigation, the forests have enormous opportunities to contribute to the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) mechanism. But the forest itself and its multiple dependent societies and sectors need to adapt to potential climate risks. Hence, actors are debating the design of climate change policy in the forest sector. Theoretically, we combine the agency-focus of frame analysis and discourse theory to analyze how different agents hold frames on climate change adaptation and mitigation policies in the region. This paper draws upon interviews with 103 different actors from government, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, research institutions and private sector in three countries: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Three discourses were found on policy response to climate change in the forest sector: mitigation policy only, separated policy on adaptation and mitigation, and an integrated policy on adaptation and mitigation. The various frames articulated around each discourse by the coalitions include elements of: costs and benefits, scale of operation, effectiveness, financial resources and implementation mechanisms. Overall, the mitigation discourse, through its mix of actors, resources and interests seems to be stronger than the adaptation discourse. The paper finally outlines a number of implications of the discourses for policy design. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to deal with recurrent water scarcity, different types of ice reservoirs, commonly called artificial glaciers, have been introduced in Ladakh and promoted as appropriate adaptive strategies to cope with changes in the cryosphere. The resulting seasonal ice reservoirs increase meltwater availability during the critical period of water scarcity in spring. We examine the efficacy of 14 ice reservoirs through a long-term analysis of their functioning within the environmental and socioeconomic context of Ladakh. Using multi-temporal satellite data (1969-2017), close range photogrammetry, and repeat field measurements (2014 and 2015), we provide an inventory and typology of these ice reservoirs and estimate storage volume of one selected structure, which ranges from 1010 to 3220m(3) of water. We extrapolate this volume to all ice reservoirs and estimate potential irrigation cycles of cropped areas, which vary between less than 0.1 in unfavorable cases and almost 3 in optimal cases and years. Based on interviews and field surveys (2007-2017), we discuss the benefits perceived by local smallholders, such as the reduction of seasonal water scarcity and resulting crop failure risks together with the possibility of growing cash crops. We argue that artificial glaciers are remarkably suited to the physical environment. However, their usefulness as a climate change adaptation strategy is questionable because climatic variability, natural hazards, and an incomplete integration into the local socioeconomic setting significantly reduce their efficacy.","[Nuesser, Marcus; Baghel, Ravi; Schmidt, Susanne] Heidelberg Univ, South Asia Inst, Dept Geog, Heidelberg, Germany; [Dame, Juliane; Krause, Benjamin] Heidelberg Univ, HCE, Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Nusser, M (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, South Asia Inst, Dept Geog, Heidelberg, Germany.",marcus.nuesser@uni-heidelberg.de; juliane.dame@uni-heidelberg.de; benjamin-kraus@gmx.net; s.schmidt@uni-heidelberg.de,"Nüsser, Marcus/N-2393-2015; Schmidt, Susanne/A-1164-2019","Nüsser, Marcus/0000-0002-8626-8336; Baghel, Ravi/0000-0002-8263-0924; Schmidt, Susanne/0000-0002-6200-4539; Kraus, Benjamin/0000-0002-0956-5222",,,,,40,41,41,2,22,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

In this study, we performed a quantitative simulation to research the passive climate adaptability of a residential area, considering piloti as the main method for climate adaptation in a hot-summer and cold-winter city in China. Numerical simulations were performed with a coupled simulation method of convection, radiation, and conduction. A cubic non-linear k-epsilon model proposed by Craft et al. was selected as the turbulence model and three-dimensional multi-reflections of shortwave and longwave radiations were considered in the radiation simulation. Through the simulation, we found that setting the piloti at the two ends of the building was the optimal piloti arrangement for climate adaptation. Then the relationship between the piloti ratio (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) and the outdoor thermal environment was studied. It could be concluded that with the increasing piloti ratio, the wind velocity increased, the mean radiant temperature (MRT) decreased slightly, and the average standard effective temperature (SET*) decreased to 3.6 degrees C in summer, while in winter, with the increasing piloti ratio, the wind velocity, MRT, and SET* changed slightly. The wind environment significantly affected the SET* value, and the piloti ratio should be between 12% and 38% to avoid wind-induced discomfort.","[Zhou, Zeng] Wuhan Univ, Sch Urban Design, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Deng, Qinli; Lin, Yaolin] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guang] Liaoning Tech Univ, Coll Engn & Architecture, Fuxing 123000, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University of Technology; Liaoning Technical University,"Deng, QL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",haomaoz@whu.edu.cn; deng4213@whut.edu.cn; yangguang_tm@lntu.edu.cn; yaolinlin@gmail.com,"Lin, Yaolin/K-1467-2017; Lin, Yaolin/AFU-4839-2022","Lin, Yaolin/0000-0002-8673-3736; Lin, Yaolin/0000-0002-8673-3736","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51608405, 51808410]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [WUT: 2017IVB048, 2042016kf0007]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This project was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51608405, 51808410), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WUT: 2017IVB048; 2042016kf0007).",,51,5,5,3,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

However, relationships between plant traits and model parameters are often model specific and not necessarily direct, depending on how models formulate plant morphological and physiological features. This hinders model application in plant breeding. We developed a novel trait-based multi-model ensemble approach to improve the design of rice plant types for future climate projections. We conducted multi-model simulations targeting enhanced productivity, and aggregated results into model-ensemble sets of phenotypic traits as defined by breeders rather than by model parameters. This allowed to overcome the limitations due to ambiguities in trait-parameter mapping from single modelling approaches. Breeders' knowledge and perspective were integrated to provide clear mapping from designed plant types to breeding traits. Nine crop models from the AgMIP-Rice Project and sensitivity analysis techniques were used to explore trait responses under different climate and management scenarios at four sites. The method demonstrated the potential of yield improvement that ranged from 15.8% to 41.5% compared to the current cultivars under mid-century climate projections. These results highlight the primary role of phenological traits to improve crop adaptation to climate change, as well as traits involved with canopy development and structure. The variability of plant types derived with different models supported model ensembles to handle related uncertainty. Nevertheless, the models agreed in capturing the effect of the heterogeneity in climate conditions across sites on key traits, highlighting the need for context-specific breeding programmes to improve crop adaptation to climate change. Although further improvement is needed for crop models to fully support breeding programmes, a trait-based ensemble approach represents a major step towards the integration of crop modelling and breeding to address climate change challenges and develop adaptation options.","[Paleari, Livia; Movedi, Ermes; Confalonieri, Roberto] Univ Milan, Cassandra Lab, ESP, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Li, Tao] DNDC Applicat Res & Training, Durham, NH USA; [Yang, Yubin; Wilson, Lloyd T.] Texas A&M AgriLife Res Ctr, Beaumont, TX USA; [Hasegawa, Toshihiro] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Boote, Kenneth J.; Hoogenboom, Gerrit; Gao, Yujing; Wallach, Daniel] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL USA; [Buis, Samuel; Ruget, Francoise] INRAE, UMR1114 EMMAH, Avignon, France; [Singh, Upendra] Int Fertilizer Dev Ctr IFDC, Muscle Shoals, AL USA; [Stockle, Claudio O.] Washington State Univ, Biol Syst Engn, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Tang, Liang; Zhu, Yan] Nanjing Agr Univ, MARA Key Lab Crop Syst Anal & Decis Making, Jiangsu Key Lab Informat Agr, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wallach, Daniel] Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, UMR Agroecol Innovat & Terr AGIR 1248, Castanet Tolosan, France",University of Milan; National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; INRAE; Washington State University; Nanjing Agricultural University; INRAE,"Paleari, L; Confalonieri, R (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Cassandra Lab, ESP, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",livia.paleari@unimi.it; roberto.confalonieri@unimi.it,"Gao, Yujing/HHC-0699-2022; Hoogenboom, Gerrit/F-3946-2010","Hoogenboom, Gerrit/0000-0002-1555-0537; Li, Tao/0000-0002-1360-1396; Hasegawa, Toshihiro/0000-0001-8501-5612; Buis, Samuel/0000-0002-8676-5447",Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [JPMEERF20S11820],Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan,"Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan, Grant/Award Number: JPMEERF20S11820",,85,3,3,14,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In the Comoros, as in many other small island developing states (SIDS), communities frequently respond to coastal erosion by building seawalls-yet seawalls and other coastal defence structure are controversial, especially in a SIDS context, where they typically are poorly designed and constructed and thus tend to increase rather decrease erosion and are often unable to prevent flooding. Through an exploratory qualitative case study of Grande Comore, the main island of the Comoros (West Indian Ocean), we compare and contrast how local stakeholders, national elites and donors understand coastal erosion and flooding in the context of a changing climate and how they experience and perceive seawalls as a response measure. Our analysis suggests that although stakeholders are aware of different drivers of coastal erosion and flooding, including sand mining, seawalls are a frequent and customary response to coastal erosion and flooding. Little is known about their disadvantages or alternative response measures, especially among local community members. Further, a lack of capacity and resources leads not only to poorly designed and constructed seawalls but also to difficulties in enforcing rules and regulations such as bans on sand mining. From our exploratory study, three conclusions emerge: (1) local drivers of coastal erosion and flooding are more visible than global climate change while funding is more readily available for adaptation to climate change; (2) a mix of context and site-specific measures would be needed to adequately respond to coastal erosion and flooding; and (3) further information and knowledge about the extent and causes of coastal erosion and flooding as well as about the effects of different response measures would be needed to allow such context and site-specific measures.","[Betzold, Carola] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Lange Sint Anna Str 7, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Mohamed, Ibrahim] Univ Comoros, Dept Geog, Moroni, Comoros",University of Antwerp,"Betzold, C (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Lange Sint Anna Str 7, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",carola.betzold@uantwerpen.be; jesrashma@yahoo.fr,,"Klock, Carola/0000-0003-2987-7570",Gothenburg Centre for Globalisation and Development,Gothenburg Centre for Globalisation and Development,"We would like to thank the many people that have contributed to this project, in particular Dr. Kamardine Sinane, Hamid Soule, the staff and interns at the Herbier des Comores, the student research assistants, and of course all our interview partners and survey respondents for sharing their views with us.

Utilizing the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach, this article thematically analyzed and synthesized 174 journal articles on social work-specific interventions and environmental justice. The results illustrate insights into the experiences, practices, or objectives of rural social workers vis-a-vis climate change. Significant themes from the literature demonstrated that gender, age, and race limited access to social work services and climate-related disaster response support in rural settings; this article argues that rural community-driven social work practices focused on environmental justice and sustainability should be encouraged and that policy advocacy attentive to climate change and its impact on vulnerable and marginalized groups should be pursued. Current and prospective social work scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders should collaborate with local rural communities to address their unique needs related to climate change. In turn, grassroots strategies should be co-developed to promote climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, ultimately achieving the goal of building resilient, healthy, and sustainable rural communities.","[Wu, Haorui; Greig, Meredith; Bryan, Catherine] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Social Work, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Wu, HR (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Sch Social Work, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",haorui.wu@dal.ca; mr546260@dal.ca; catherine.bryan@dal.ca,"Wu, Haorui/AAN-4311-2021","Wu, Haorui/0000-0002-6314-0452",Dalhousie University,Dalhousie University,"This research was undertaken, in part, thanks to funding from the Vice-President Research & Innovation International Seed Fund, Dalhousie University.",,111,1,1,14,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0760,,SOC SCI-BASEL,Soc.

Furthermore, inductive analysis was carried out to determine the most critical sustainability parameters in the particular urban fabric. The climate response parameters of the study cities were evaluated using Ecotect simulation tools, and the determinants of sustainability indicators were quantitatively evaluated to assess each indicator's impact on the sustainability of the urban fabric.

Agro-climatic resources have obviously changed, which will seriously affect crop growth and development in this region. It is important to investigate the contribution of climate change adaptation measures to the yield and resource use efficiency to improve our understanding of how we can effectively ensure high yield and high efficiency in the future. In this study, we divided the study area into five accumulated temperature zones (ATZs) based on growing degree days (GDD). Based on the meteorological data, maize data (from agrometeorological stations) and the validated APSIM-Maize Model, we first investigated the spatial distributions and temporal trends of maize potential yield of actual planted cultivars, and revealed the radiation use efficiency (RUE) and heat resource use efficiency (HUE) from 1981 to 2017. Then according to the potential growing seasons and actual growing seasons, we identified the utilization percentages of radiation (P-R) resource and heat resource (P-H) for each ATZ under potential production from 1981 to 2017. Finally, we quantified the contributions of cultivar changings to yield, P-R and P-H of maize. The results showed that during the past 37 years, the estimated mean potential yield of actual planted cultivars was 13 649 kg ha(-1), ranged from 11 205 to 15 257 kg ha(-1), and increased by 140 kg ha(-1) per decade. For potential production, the mean values of RUE and HUE for the actual planted maize cultivars were 1.22 g MJ(-1) and 8.58 kg (degrees C d)(-1) ha(-1). RUE showed an increasing tendency, while HUE showed a decreasing tendency. The lengths of the potential growing season and actual growing season were 158 and 123 d, and increased by 2 and 1 d per decade. P-R and P-H under potential production were 82 and 86%, respectively and showed a decreasing tendency during the past 37 years. This indicates that actual planted cultivars failed to make full use of climate resources. However, results from the adaptation assessments indicate that, adoption of cultivars with growing season increased by 2-11 d among ATZs caused increase in yield, P-R and P-H of 0.6-1.7%, 1.1-7.6% and 1.5-8.9%, respectively. Therefore, introduction of cultivars with longer growing season can effectively increase the radiation and heat utilization percentages and potential yield.","[Su Zheng-e; Liu Zhi-juan; Bai Fan; Zhang Zhen-tao; Sun Shuang; Huang Qiu-wan; Liu Tao; Liu Xiao-qing; Yang Xiao-guang] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Sun Shuang] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS),"Liu, ZJ (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",suzhenge_cau@163.com; zhijuanliu@cau.edu.cn,"yang, xiao/HJI-7815-2023; Liu, Zhijuan/AEA-8412-2022",,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0300101-03],National Key Research and Development Program of China,This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0300101-03).,,40,2,3,5,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2095-3119,,,J INTEGR AGR,J.

The proposed models are based on functional data analysis (FDA), a statistical framework dealing with continuous curves instead of scalar time series. The models are applied to the temperature-related cardiovascular mortality issue in Montreal. By making use of the whole information available, the proposed models improve the prediction of cardiovascular mortality according to temperature. In addition, results shed new lights on the relationship by quantifying physiological adaptation effects.

While models are useful for visualizing potential future outcomes and evaluating options for potential adaptation, they do not adequately represent and integrate adaptive human agency. Richards' concept of 'agriculture as performance' is useful in counterbalancing the modelling approach to adaptation because it highlights how adaptive processes and technologies, whether short term or long term, are more than simple technical responses to biophysical conditions. Instead, adaptive processes are social phenomena whose significance and effects expand well beyond changing climate conditions. This examination of agriculture as performance in the context of climate adaptation draws on two different examples. The first example explores how technical aspects of climate adaptation in Mali are situated within the enactment of ethnic identities and political struggles between farmers and herders. The second example shows how farmers in southeastern United States approach climate variability and climate forecasts as risk management tools. There are substantial differences between approaching adaptation as a dynamic process that is socially embedded and approaching adaptation as a set of modelled responses to anticipated future conditions. It is unlikely that either is adequate to meet the challenges posed by the uncertainties associated with climate change. However, building a synergistic relationship between the two promises to be as difficult as it is necessary.

In postulating that insufficient cocreation by stakeholders in the quadruple helix model is an important factor contributing to the low effectiveness of climate actions in the regions, we have focused our research on identifying real stakeholder engagement in climate action and identifying the needs, barriers, and drivers for strengthening the cocreation process. We identified the needs for action highlighted by stakeholders as having an impact on reducing barriers and stimulating drivers. We treated the identified needs for action as deep leverage points (intent and design) focused on three realms-knowledge, values, and institutions-in which engagement and cocreation can be strengthened and have the potential to increase the effectiveness of climate action taken by stakeholders within our quadruple helix. We recommend knowledge-based cocreation, which puts the importance of climate action in the value system and leads to paradigm reevaluation. The implementation of the identified needs for action requires the support of institutions, whereby they develop standards of cooperation and mechanisms for their implementation as a sustainable framework for stakeholder cooperation. The research has proved how the quadruple helix operates for climate action in the Poznan Agglomeration. We believe that this case study can be a reference point for regions at a similar level of development, and the methods used and results obtained can be applied in similar real contexts to foster local stakeholders in climate action. Significance Statement This study aims to understand the condition of cocreation and engagement between stakeholders included in the quadruple helix model responding to climate change challenges. We identified needs for climate actions in the Poznan Agglomeration and operationalized them as leverage points, which can strengthen engagement and cocreation and contribute to increasing the effectiveness of climate action taken by stakeholders. We show a wide range of possible climate actions, but at the same time we highlight the barriers that, in the Poznan Agglomeration case, mainly result from poor cooperation between stakeholders and insufficient use of social capital.

Climate change projections indicate a considerable precipitation decrease in the broader basin area leading to river discharge loss the forthcoming decades. The study design accounted for preservation of current levels of different river services such as: irrigation, rafting activities, hydroelectricity power and ecological services. Our estimation strategy consisted in estimating a conditional logit model and a random parameters logit, together with their extended forms with census and attitudinal interacted variables. Results from all models present a tendency towards the selection of adaptation alternatives, showing that people are willing to pay for all river services except for rafting activities. Preferences' heterogeneity proves to be present and determinant, illustrating the choice patterns.

It gives the results of a questionnaire survey of 1261 users along a 106-km greenway in Spain linking the Pyrenees with the Mediterranean Sea. Unlike previous studies, sampling was random and unequal probabilities of selection were properly accounted for. The results show a complex range of user profiles, tourist and non-tourist, their perceptions of the trail and some of the direct and indirect impacts of the greenway on the communities through which it passes. Management recommendations flowing from the survey are presented with the aim of increasing the use of accommodation services and businesses in the towns and villages near the greenway and helping create a more sustainable tourism system.

This note analyses the plausible causes of the avalanche using pre-disaster field survey data, supported by the limited geological and remote sensing based geomorphological investigations as the site could not be investigated due to remoteness of the location and travel restrictions due to COVID pandemic. The present observations suggest that active and relict cirques to the north of the South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS) are the sites for potential snow and debris avalanches under the projected warming trends in the western Himalaya.

A 1995-2016 annual time series that yields a panel dataset of 192 countries is employed. Findings suggest that country-level climate change vulnerability is responding (strongly) to the majority of the explanatory variables considered. Findings also confirm that less-developed countries demonstrate increased vulnerability compared to the developed ones and those in transition stages.

This paper reviews how gender is framed in 41 papers on climate change adaptation through an intersectionality lens. The main findings show that while intersectional analysis has demonstrated many advantages for a comprehensive study of gender, it has not yet entered the field of climate change and gender. In climate change studies, gender is mostly handled in a men-versus-women dichotomy and little or no attention has been paid to power and social and political relations. These gaps which are echoed in other domains of development and gender research depict a 'feminization of vulnerability' and reinforce a 'victimization' discourse within climate change studies. We argue that a critical intersectional assessment would contribute to unveil agency and emancipatory pathways in the adaptation process by providing a better understanding of how the differential impacts of climate change shape, and are shaped by, the complex power dynamics of existing social and political relations.","[Djoudi, Houria; Brockhaus, Maria] CIFOR, Bogor Bar, Jawa Barat, Indonesia; [Locatelli, Bruno] CIRAD CIFOR, Ave La Molina 1895, Lima 12, Peru; [Vaast, Chloe] Royal Trop Inst KIT, Mauritskade 63, NL-1092 AD Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Asher, Kiran] Univ Massachusetts, 208 Bartlett Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Sijapati, Bimbika Basnett] Jalan CIFOR, Bogor Bar, Jawa Barat, Indonesia; [Sijapati, Bimbika Basnett] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor Bar, Jawa Barat, Indonesia",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); CIRAD; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Djoudi, H (corresponding author), CIFOR, Bogor Bar, Jawa Barat, Indonesia.",h.djoudi@cgiar.org; bruno.locatelli@cirad.fr; C.Vaast@kit.nl; kasher@umass.edu; m.brockhaus@cgiar.org; b.basnett@cgiar.org,"Locatelli, Bruno/C-9957-2009","Locatelli, Bruno/0000-0003-2983-1644; Asher, Kiran/0000-0002-3256-8077; Brockhaus, Maria/0000-0001-7348-4921","CGIAR Fund; CRP-FTA (Consortium Research Program on Forests, Trees, and Agroforestry); Fonds Francais pour l'Environnement Mondial (FFEM)","CGIAR Fund(CGIAR); CRP-FTA (Consortium Research Program on Forests, Trees, and Agroforestry); Fonds Francais pour l'Environnement Mondial (FFEM)","This research was supported by the CGIAR Fund, the CRP-FTA (Consortium Research Program on Forests, Trees, and Agroforestry) and co-funded by the Fonds Francais pour l'Environnement Mondial (FFEM).

In this respect various aspects of Seyhan basin were evaluated, including evaluation of existing water resources, determination of water demand of existing and planned projects, and water resources supply-demand characteristics. The global climate change model was downscaled to the basin scale, the results were associated with hydrometeorological monitoring network and finally the impact of climate change on surface water resources and demands were determined for specific projection years. Water resources management scenarios were developed to evaluate adaptation alternatives to climate change scenarios at the basin level. It was determined that even though there was no water stress in Seyhan basin in 2010, many parts of the basin were expected to suffer significant shortages over the coming years.","[Selek, Bulent] Gen Directorate State Hydraul Works DSI, Planning & Invest Div, Ankara, Turkey; [Tuncok, I.

Previous studies of ozone and warming impacts on crops typically do not account for the strong ozone-temperature correlation when interpreting crop-ozone or crop-temperature relationships, or the spatial variability of crop-to-ozone sensitivity arising from varietal and environmental differences, leading to potential biases in their estimated crop losses. Here we develop an empirical model, called the partial derivative-linear regression (PDLR) model, to estimate the spatial variations in the sensitivities of wheat, maize and soybean yields to ozone exposures and temperature extremes in the US and Europe using a composite of multidecadal datasets, fully correcting for ozone temperature covariation. We find generally larger and more spatially varying sensitivities of all three crops to ozone exposures than are implied by experimentally derived concentration-response functions used in most previous studies. Stronger ozone tolerance is found in regions with high ozone levels and high consumptive crop water use, reflecting the existence of spatial adaptation and effect of water constraints. The spatially varying sensitivities to temperature extremes also indicate stronger heat tolerance in crops grown in warmer regions. The spatial adaptation of crops to ozone and temperature we find can serve as a surrogate for future adaptation. Using the PDLR-derived sensitivities and 2000-2050 ozone and temperature projections by the Community Earth System Model, we estimate that future warming and unmitigated ozone pollution can combine to cause an average decline in US wheat, maize and soybean production by 13%, 43% and 28%, respectively, and a smaller decline for European crops. Aggressive ozone regulation is shown to offset such decline to various extents, especially for wheat. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering ozone regulation as well as ozone and climate change adaptation (e.g., selecting heat- and ozone-tolerant cultivars, irrigation) as possible strategies to enhance future food security in response to imminent environmental threats.

The subject of the paper is the urban nature, which, skillfully used and introduced into public space, becomes an active tool for adapting cities to future climate conditions. The aim of the paper is to identify key solutions to introduce urban nature into public spaces in the context of model strategic planning and urban design undertaken in cities. To this aim, development strategies, with a particular focus on urban nature, developed in Copenhagen over the past few years, were researched. Of those identified, the directions and actions that address public spaces and holistically link the needs of the built and natural environment with the needs of humans were selected. Research leads to a comparison of the model strategies and selected implementations used in Copenhagen, prioritizing the urban nature, with examples of strategic development policies and adaptation projects implemented in the public spaces of selected Polish cities. The result of the research is an assessment of the completeness of climate change adaptation measures undertaken in Poland, using the potential of urban nature in public spaces and recommendations for updating planning and strategic documents based on Copenhagen's model solutions.","[Pancewicz, Alina] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Architecture, Gliwice, Poland; [Pancewicz, Alina] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Architecture, Akad 7, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland",Silesian University of Technology; Silesian University of Technology,"Pancewicz, A (corresponding author), Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Architecture, Akad 7, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland.",alina.pancewicz@polsl.pl,,,,,,,58,0,0,1,1,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",2080-5187,2450-8594,,CIV ENVIRON ENG REP,Civ.

The three processes are related to agriculture and, as such, to both food safety and food security, and ultimately to human health. Adaptation to climate change is a difficult breeding objective because of its complexity, its unpredictability, and its location specificity. However, one strategy exists, which is based on a more dynamic use of agrobiodiversity in agriculture through the cultivation of evolutionary populations. In this review, we show how the translation into agricultural practice of nearly 100 years of research on evolutionary populations and mixtures is able to address the complexity of climate change while stabilizing yield, decreasing the use of most agrochemicals, thus reducing emissions and producing healthy food.","[Ceccarelli, Salvatore; Grando, Stefania] Corso Mazzini 256, I-63100 Ascoli Piceno, Italy",,"Ceccarelli, S (corresponding author), Corso Mazzini 256, I-63100 Ascoli Piceno, Italy.",ceccarelli.salvatore83@gmail.com,,,,,,,102,19,19,4,23,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,2589-0042,,ISCIENCE,iScience,DEC 18,2020,23,12,,,,,,,101815,10.1016/j.isci.2020.101815,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101815,,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,PH8QM,33305179,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000600670000061,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drawing on multidisciplinary perspectives, the article suggests an analytical frame for polycentric property system responses to climate migration. The case study is Solomon Islands, a South Pacific state with high levels of environmental vulnerability, where people draw on various governance mechanisms to secure proprietary relationships with land. These governance mechanisms not only encompass property rights derived from the state, but also proprietary relationships secured through social norms, informal agreements, and acts of mutual coordination. The key argument is that governance mechanisms to secure property rights for climate migrants have absorptive limits that affect broader processes of adaptation to climate change. The heuristic of absorptive capacity provides a basis to consider adaptive property law for a future of climate migration.","[Fitzpatrick, Daniel] Monash Univ, Fac Law, 15 Ancora Imparo Way, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Monson, Rebecca] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Law, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Monash University; Australian National University,"Fitzpatrick, D (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Fac Law, 15 Ancora Imparo Way, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",daniel.fitzpatrick@monash.edu,"Monson, Rebecca/V-8684-2018","Monson, Rebecca/0000-0001-7427-757X; Fitzpatrick, Daniel/0000-0002-0549-4906",Australian Research Council [DP130104802],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This work was supported by a Discovery Project grant from the Australian Research Council (DP130104802).

Two parameters: degree of flooding (DOF) and specific flood volume (SPY) were adopted to indicate potential system overloads. The simulations showed numerous outflows from the sewers, which means, that the investigated system needs adapting to climate changes. The causes of this should be sought in the too small diameters of the sewers and so in the insufficient hydraulic capacity of the sewerage system dimensioned in the past using methods which are inadequate today.","[Nowakowska, Monika; Wartalska, Katarzyna; Kazmierczak, Bartosz; Kotowski, Andrzej] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Environm Engn, 27 Wybrzeke Wyspianskiego St, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Nowakowska, M (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Environm Engn, 27 Wybrzeke Wyspianskiego St, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland.",monika.nowakowska@pwr.edu.pl,"Kaźmierczak, Bartosz/AAO-2612-2020; Wartalska, Katarzyna/AAK-6649-2020","Kaźmierczak, Bartosz/0000-0003-4933-8451; ",Ministry of Science and Higher Education [0401/0006/17],"Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)",The work was realized within the allocation No. 0401/0006/17 awarded for Faculty of Environmental Engineering Wroclaw University of Science and Technology by Ministry of Science and Higher Education in years 2017-2018.,,24,3,3,1,6,BUDAPEST UNIV TECHNOLOGY ECONOMICS,BUDAPEST,"PERIODICA POLYTECHNICA, BUDAPEST, 1521, HUNGARY",0553-6626,,,PERIOD POLYTECH-CIV,Period.

The mechanisms by which natural populations modulate their thermoresponsiveness are not known [2]. To address this, we surveyed Arabidopsis accessions for variation in thermal responsiveness of elongation growth and mapped the corresponding loci. We find that the transcriptional regulator EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) controls elongation growth in response to temperature. Through a combination of modeling and experiments, we show that high temperature relieves the gating of growth at night, highlighting the importance of temperature-dependent repressors of growth. ELF3 gating of transcriptional targets responds rapidly and reversibly to changes in temperature. We show that the binding of ELF3 to target promoters is temperature dependent, suggesting a mechanism where temperature directly controls ELF3 activity.","[Box, Mathew S.; Domijan, Mirela; Jaeger, Katja E.; Yoo, Seong Jeon; Sedivy, Emma L.; Jones, D.

Given the reliance of a large segment of the population on the agricultural sector for both their livelihoods as well as national food security, climate change adaptation in the agricultural sector is crucial for continued national food security and economic growth. Using household data from lowland rice farmers of selected haor areas in Sylhet, the current work presents an analysis of the determinants behind the implementation of different climate change adaptation strategies by lowland rice farmers. The first objective of this study was to explore the extent of awareness of climate change within this population as well as the type of opinions held by lowland rice farmers with respect to climate change. To serve this purpose, a severity index (SI) was developed and subsequently employed to evaluate the perceptions and attitudes of 378 farmers with respect to climate change vulnerability. Respondents were interviewed with respect to climate change related circumstances they faced in their daily lives. Attained SI index values ranged from 69.18% to 93.52%. The SI for the perception Climate change affects rice production was measured as 93.52%. Using data collected from the same 378 farmers, a logistic regression was carried out to investigate the impact of socio-economic and institutional factors on adaptation. The results show that credit from non-government organizations is highly statistically significant for adaptation, and that rural market structure also has a positive effect on adaptation. Among the studied factors, credit from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) was found to be the most important factor for adaptation. The results of this work further indicate that marginal farmers would benefit from government (GoB) funded seasonal training activities that cover pertinent information regarding adaptation after flash floods. Additionally, the authors of this piece recommend timely issuance of government-assisted credit during early flash floods to afflicted farmers, as such an initiative can aid farmers in adapting different strategies to mitigate losses and enhance their productivity as well as livelihood.","[Ferdushi, Kanis Fatama] Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Stat, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh; [Ismail, Mohd Tahir] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, Usm Pulau Pinang 11800, Malaysia; [Kamil, Anton Abdulbasah] Telkom Univ, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Bandung 40257, Indonesia",Shahjalal University of Science & Technology (SUST); Universiti Sains Malaysia; Telkom University,"Ferdushi, KF (corresponding author), Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Stat, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh.",kanisusm@gmail.com,"Ismail, Mohd Tahir/A-7280-2018; Kamil, Anton Abdulbasah/A-9795-2011","Ismail, Mohd Tahir/0000-0003-2747-054X; Kamil, Anton Abdulbasah/0000-0001-5410-812X",SUST Research Center [PS/2017/17];  [PS/2018/2/26],SUST Research Center; ,This research was funded by [SUST Research Center] grant number [PS/2017/17] and The APC was funded by [PS/2018/2/26].,,40,16,16,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,JUL,2019,7,7,,,,,,,85,10.3390/cli7070085,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7070085,,,17,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,IN6AT,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000478759000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we combine data from US census estimates, satellites, and satellite-derived products to develop a framework to target potentially suitable areas for urban afforestation to mitigate urban heat and minimize tree cover disparity. We test this framework for California and show that space exists for an additional 36 million (1.28 million acres of) trees in the state's urban areas. This would reduce the average urban land surface temperature by 1.8C and provide multiple co-benefits totaling $1.1 billion annually, including reduction in heat-related medical visits (almost 4000 over 10 years) and 4.5 million metric tons of annual CO2 sequestration. Because funding is limited, we provide suitability scores for urban afforestation at the census block group (CBG) scale based on multiple considerations. In California, afforestation in CBGs with positive suitability scores will lead to $712 million of net annual benefits (against an annual investment of $467 million) and will serve 89% of the & AP;9 million urban residents in the lowest income quartile for their cities.

We review knowledge of relationships between climate variables and several forest diseases, as well as current evidence of how climate, host and pathogen interactions are responding or might respond to climate change. Many forests can be managed to both adapt to climate change and minimize the undesirable effects of expected increases in tree mortality. We discuss four types of forest and disease management tactics - monitoring, forecasting, planning and mitigation - and provide case studies of yellow-cedar decline and sudden aspen decline to illustrate how forest diseases might be managed in the face of climate change. The uncertainties inherent to climate change effects can be diminished by conducting research, assessing risks, and linking results to forest policy, planning and decision making.","[Sturrock, R.

In face of these hazards, the increasing use of the connotation of 'urban resilience' in worldwide commitments and discourses is a promising approach to increase efficiency and stretch for integrated solutions. Despite its importance, the nexus of the concepts is yet not unveiled in the existing literature. In this work and in an attempt to interconnect the terms, this study provides an insight to the emerging concept of the urban resilience to represent the city durability and to mutualize it with the complexity of the 'green' energy transition.

Pacific Island ecosystems are being degraded by pollution, overfishing, and unsustainable development. They also increasingly face severe climate impacts including sea-level rise, changing temperature and rainfall patterns. These impacts result inchanges in food and water security, loss of identity, climate-induced migration and threats to sovereignty. In response, communities in the region are leading climate adaptation strategies, often combining traditional practices and cutting-edge science, to build the resilience of their communities and ecosystems in the face of increasing climate risk. For example, communities are implementing resilient networks of marine protected areas using the best available science and strengthening tribal governance to manage these networks, experimenting with salt and drought tolerant crops, revegetating coastlines with native salt-tolerant plants, revitalizing traditional wells, and implementing climate-smart development plans. Often these efforts contribute to local development priorities and create co-benefits for multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs). These community efforts are being scaled up through provincial and national policies that reinforce the critical role that ecosystems play in climate adaptation and provide a model for the rest of the world. While adaptation efforts are critical to help communities cope with climate impacts, in some cases, they will be insufficient to address the magnitude of climate impacts and local development needs. Thus, there are inherent trade-offs and limitations to climate adaptation with migration being the last resort for some island communities.","[Mcleod, Elizabeth; Gaines, Graham] Nat Conservancy US, Arlington, TX 76018 USA; [Bruton-Adams, Mae; Franco, Chiara; Gorong, Berna; Terk, Elizabeth] Nat Conservancy Micronesia, Kolonia, Micronesia; [Foerster, Johannes] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Leipzig, Germany; [James, Robyn] Nat Conservancy Australia, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Posing-Kulwaum, Gabriel; Tara, Magdalene] Nat Conservancy Manus, Manus, Papua N Guinea",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Mcleod, E (corresponding author), Nat Conservancy US, Arlington, TX 76018 USA.",emcleod@tnc.org,,"Forster, Johannes/0000-0003-0174-926X","Nature Conservancy; German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU); International Climate Initiative (IKI); BMU","Nature Conservancy; German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU); International Climate Initiative (IKI); BMU","This study is an outcome of a project that is financially supported by the Nature Conservancy and the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU).

SDA reveals that size-related, technological and structural components have contributed substantially to changes in virtual water use. Network analysis offers new insights about the vulnerability of the system to shocks through trade links across country-sector pairs. Our analysis highlights a possible trade-off in the increasing importance of virtual water trade: the efficiency improvement in granting access to virtual water might come at the cost of increasing systemic vulnerability. Overall, the great unbalance between water availability and usage combined with rigidity of global consumption and production networks and the risk of cascade effects imply increasing vulnerability of the virtual water network to shocks propagation.","[Distefano, T.] Politecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Riccaboni, M.] IMT Sch Adv Studies, AXES, Piazza S Francesco 19, I-55100 Lucca, Italy; [Riccaboni, M.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat MSI, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Marin, G.] Univ Urbino, Dept Econ Soc Polit, Via Aurelio Saffi 2, I-61029 Urbino, Italy; [Marin, G.] SEEDS, Ferrara, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; KU Leuven; University of Urbino,"Distefano, T (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",tiziano.distefano@polito.it,"Distefano, Tiziano/AAR-2458-2021; Marin, Giovanni/A-1917-2014","Distefano, Tiziano/0000-0002-1593-6480; Marin, Giovanni/0000-0002-7396-1561; RICCABONI, Massimo/0000-0003-4979-8933",,,,,61,28,28,3,53,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4284,,,WATER RESOUR ECON,Water Resour.

Using California as a case study, it estimates this co-benefit of California's statewide urban water conservation goal of 20% per capita reduction by 2020 (relative to a year 2000 baseline). We developed a model of a water supply system to assess the impact of reduced urban water demand on emissions. Embedded energy and emissions were established for each stage of the water supply cycle: supply and conveyance, treatment, distribution, end use and wastewater treatment. We conclude that water conservation, in addition to being an important strategy for adaptation to climate change, represents a significant opportunity for mitigation. Under policies that prioritize savings of water that is heated, the most energy-intensive process in the supply cycle, water conservation offers the potential to conserve 3.5 Mt CO(2)e in 2020. This result suggests that water conservation could be an important mitigation strategy in other states, even those that are not water-constrained and do not have highly energy intensive supply sources.","[Haley, Benjamin] Energy & Environm Econ, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA; [Haley, Benjamin; Gallo, Jean-Baptiste; Kehr, Abigail; Perry, Michael; Siao, David; Smallen, William; Williams, James H.] Monterey Inst Int Studies, Monterey, CA 93940 USA; [Torn, Margaret S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Haley, B (corresponding author), Energy & Environm Econ, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA.",Ben@ethree.com,"Torn, Margaret/CAF-8960-2022; Torn, Margaret S/D-2305-2015","Torn, Margaret/0000-0002-8174-0099; Torn, Margaret S/0000-0002-8174-0099","Energy and Environmental Economics, Inc.","Energy and Environmental Economics, Inc.","The authors would like to thank Energy and Environmental Economics, Inc. for their support of this research.

Using a framework with repeated feedback loops, the impact of the rate of carbon dioxide absorption by natural ecosystems, the stochastic nature of economic systems and the stochastic and irreversible nature of global climate are analyzed, with the Dynamic Climate Change Simulator with Stochastic and Irreversible Climate Change. The simulator game models one control variable, carbon dioxide emissions and one stock variable, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. In addition, the rate of carbon dioxide absorption by natural ecosystems is modeled, with business cycle shocks and climate change tipping points. The ability to control carbon dioxide concentrations to a goal level is evaluated and policy insights are provided about how learning about the dynamics of the Earth's climate through gamification can be advanced.","[Nastis, StefanosA] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Pagoni, Eirini Grammatiki] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Ind Management, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Nastis, S (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",snastis@auth.gr,"Nastis, Stefanos/K-4869-2019","Nastis, Stefanos/0000-0002-3102-5505",,,,,22,1,1,2,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

We use Random Forest, an empirical statistical model, to project the future crop cover. Our results show that, at the global scale, increases and decreases in crop cover cancel each other out. Crop cover in the Northern Hemisphere is projected to be impacted more by future climate than the in Southern Hemisphere because of the disparity in the warming rate and precipitation patterns between the two Hemispheres.

This is performed by integrating the two-step decision making sub-models, Perception-of-Climate-Change and Adaptation-Choice-Strategies, to the Land Use Dynamic Simulator (LUDAS). The simulation results suggest that the land-use choices in the study area reflect a tendency towards increasing subsistence farming in an area where there has been a gradual trend away from traditional land uses such as cereal production to the cultivation of groundnut, rice, maize and soybean. Groundnut monoculture production has emerged locally as coping measure for dealing with increased climatic variability. In terms of livelihood strategy, there is an increasing contribution of rice and groundnut to household gross incomes. The predicted pattern of changes in gross household income under a scenario in which climate change is perceived by local farmers explicitly revealed the contribution of adaptation options to household livelihood strategy.","[Amadou, Mahamadou L.] AGRHYMET Reg Ctr, Niamey, Niger; [Villamor, Grace B.] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany; [Villamor, Grace B.] Univ Idaho, Ctr Resilient Communities, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Kyei-Baffour, Nicholas] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Agr Engn, Kumasi, Ghana; [Amadou, Mahamadou L.] CRS, Niamey, Niger",University of Bonn; Idaho; University of Idaho; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Amadou, ML (corresponding author), AGRHYMET Reg Ctr, Niamey, Niger.",a.laouali@agrhymet.ne; gracev@uni-bonn.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We thank the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research for financial assistance.

To narrow these uncertainties, significant efforts have been made to understand the intermodel differences in future rainfall changes. Here, we show a strong inverse relationship between present-day precipitation and its future change to possibly calibrate future precipitation change by removing the present-day bias in climate models. The results of the models with less tropical (40 degrees S-40 degrees N) present-day precipitation are closely linked to the dryness over the equatorial central-eastern Pacific, and project weaker regional precipitation increase due to the anthropogenic greenhouse forcing(1-6) with stronger zonal Walker circulation. This induces Indo-western Pacific warming through Bjerknes feedback, which reduces relative humidity by the enhanced atmospheric boundary-layer mixing in the future projection. This increases the air-sea humidity difference to enhance tropical evaporation and the resultant precipitation. Our estimation of the sensitivity of the tropical precipitation per 1 K warming, after removing a common bias in the present-day simulation, is about 50% greater than the original future multi-model projection.","[Ham, Yoo-Geun; Choi, Jun-Young] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Oceanog, Gwangju, South Korea; [Kug, Jong-Seong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Earth Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea; [Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Watanabe, Masahiro] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan",Chonnam National University; Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Tokyo,"Kug, JS (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Earth Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea.",jskug@postech.ac.kr,,"Choi, Jun-Young/0000-0003-0526-2600; KUG, JONG-SEONG/0000-0003-2251-2579","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2016R1A6A1A03012647]; Korean Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [KMIPA2015-6170]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017R1A2B3011511]; National Research Foundation of Korea [22A20130012323, 22A20130012068, 2017R1A2B3011511, 2016R1A6A1A03012647] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education; Korean Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),Y.-G.H. was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2016R1A6A1A03012647).

Meteorological and rice yield data over the period 1960-2009 from the Heilongjiang Reclamation Area of north-east China (HRANC) were used to explore the possible impacts of climate change on rice yields at sub-regional scale. ResultsResults showed that a warming trend was obvious in the HRANC and discernible climate fluctuations and yield variations on inter-annual scale were detected to have occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively. Statistically positive correlation was observed between growing season temperature and rice yields, with an increase rate by approximately 3.60% for each 1 degrees C rise in the minimum temperature during growing season. Such findings are consistent with the current mainstream view that warming climate may exert positive impacts on crop yields in the middle and higher latitude regions. ConclusionOur study indicated that the growing season minimum temperature was a major driver of all the climatic factors to the recent increase trends in rice yield in HRANC over the last five decades.

Unfortunately, productivity in East and Central Africa is severely constrained by two viral diseases: cassava mosaic disease (CMD) and cassava brown streak disease (CBSD). CBSD was first reported in 1936 from northeast Tanzania. For approximately 70 years, CBSD was restricted to coastal East Africa and so had a relatively low impact on food security compared with CMD. However, at the turn of the 21st century, CBSD re-emerged further inland, in areas around Lake Victoria, and it has since spread through many East and Central African countries, causing high yield losses and jeopardizing the food security of subsistence farmers. This recent re-emergence has attracted intense scientific interest, with studies shedding light on CBSD viral epidemiology, sequence diversity, host interactions and potential sources of resistance within the cassava genome. This review reflects on 80 years of CBSD research history (1936-2016) with a timeline of key events.

Nova Scotia has the oldest population of any Canadian province, the majority of whom reside in coastal communities on the Atlantic, making it an ideal site for such analysis. Through this work we forward a useful decision-making support tool for policy and planning one that can help coastal communities respond to the particular needs of seniors in rural areas and adapt to impacts of coastal climate change.

Drawing on previous work in the nuclear risk and earthquake engineering communities, PBDE's three analysis stages are de-coupled at pinch-points, allowing the use of a convolution integral to link uncertainty in exposure, deterioration and repair, and sustainability impacts. The convolution-based methodology for the PBDE framework has been compared with traditional Monte Carlo simulation. Results of the convolution approach were statistically equivalent to brute-force Monte Carlo analysis using the same number of simulations, and the convolution approach has advantages in deaggregation, backwards conditioning, and updating of results to reflect new information or models. Limitations of the convolution approach are discussed, as are possible techniques for decreasing computational expense and areas for future work. Potential applications for PBDE include design code calibration, decision support for climate change adaptation policy, and sensitivity assessment to direct research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we considered wetland vulnerability to climate change, focusing on wetland exposure and sensitivity. We then outlined the existing policy context for dealing with climate change, with an emphasis on the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. We then considered how the objectives and targets for wetland management can be set in the face of climate change, how management can be adapted to climate change given the uncertainties involved, and how we can monitor and evaluate wetland condition in the face of climate change. We concluded with a set of principles to guide adaptation of wetland conservation and management policy to climate change.","[Finlayson, C. M.; Davidson, N.

Carotenoid metabolic engineering could enhance plant adaptation to climate change and improve food security and nutritional value. However, lack of fundamental knowledge on carotenoid pathway localization limits targeted engineering. Phytoene synthase (PSY), a major rate-controlling carotenoid enzyme, is represented by multiple isozymes residing at unknown plastid sites. In maize (Zea mays), the three isozymes were transiently expressed and found either in plastoglobuli or in stroma and thylakoid membranes. PSY1, with one to two residue modifications of naturally occurring functional variants, exhibited altered localization, associated with distorted plastid shape and formation of a fibril phenotype. Mutating the active site of the enzyme reversed this phenotype. Discovery of differential PSY locations, linked with activity and isozyme type, advances the engineering potential for modifying carotenoid biosynthesis.","[Shumskaya, Maria; Bradbury, Louis M.

There are already examples of the insurance industry promoting efforts to mitigate the impacts of weather hazards, by disseminating information about reducing the vulnerability of properties, offering financial incentives to invest in mitigating the impacts of extreme weather, and by working in partnership with policy-makers to establish maximum thresholds of acceptable risk.

In recent years, climate change has been identified as an urgent and growing threat to critical infrastructures, and many studies have been conducted to assess the vulnerability of critical infrastructures to climate change. However, despite these research efforts, the vulnerability of critical infrastructures is often vaguely defined and inconsistently studied in the literature. This paper proposes a framework to analyze critical infrastructure's vulnerability to climate change based on the traditional vulnerability/sustainability framework and hazard-of-place model of vulnerability. The vulnerability assessment of emergency services to sea level rise and storm surge in Collier County, Florida, is taken as an example to validate the proposed framework. Flood simulation, comparisons of storm surge models, spatial analysis, and network-based service area analysis are conducted to assess the vulnerability of fire stations in the case study area. The vulnerability assessment identifies the predominant hazard risk and the exposed infrastructures, analyzes the sensitivity of serviceability, and evaluates the effectiveness of potential adaptive capacity. The results show that the fire stations in the case study area are more vulnerable to the potential landfall and changes in hurricane and tropical cyclone patterns compared to the flooding caused directly by sea level rise. It indicates that the lack of consideration of potential landfall and changes in storms could greatly underestimate the vulnerability to climate change, especially in coastal areas with limited historical tidal data. The analysis also illustrates the current floodplain management that focuses primarily on the 100-year flood may not be a sufficient standard for all regions given the potential changes in frequency and magnitude of climate-related hazards. Finally, it confirms that disaster risk management strategies could also contribute to climate change adaptation. The weak linkages between existing climate change adaptation and disaster risk management need to be strengthened. The proposed concept and framework could be generalized and expanded to other critical infrastructures, regions, and climate-related hazards.","[Shen, Suwan] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Saunders Hall 107,2424 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Feng, Xi] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, 1100 Dexter Ave N,Suite 400 BSRC, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Peng, Zhong Ren] Univ Florida, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, POB 115706, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Peng, Zhong Ren] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Shen, SW (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Saunders Hall 107,2424 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",suwans@hawaii.edu; Xi.Feng@pnnl.gov; zpeng@ufl.edu,"Peng, Zhongren/AAH-8123-2020; Shen, Suwan/AAH-9425-2021; Peng, Zhong-Ren/X-4342-2019","Peng, Zhongren/0000-0003-3648-6770; Shen, Suwan/0000-0002-8339-3000",Collier County Bureau of Emergency Services Division (BES); Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO),Collier County Bureau of Emergency Services Division (BES)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO),"Collier County Bureau of Emergency Services Division (BES) and Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) have provided data and help to support the case study.

This article takes advantage of the unique feature of the Chinese green bond market that allows a proportion of the proceeds to be used for nongreen purposes. The authors find that greener bonds (more proceeds are used for green projects) are sold at a premium. This pricing differential is primarily driven by bonds with proceeds used 100%for green projects. The authors also show that green bonds verified by a third party have lower yield spreads and the effect is stronger for more reputable third parties.

This study sort to explore the institutional constraints to and opportunities for farmers' adoption of planned adaptation interventions under the Climate Change Adaptation in Northern Ghana Enhanced (CHANGE) and the Adaptation Learning Programme (ALP) projects. Using a mix of methods, the study elicited data from 184 crop farmers under these two initiatives in the Upper East Region of Ghana. The study found that the institutional opportunities for farmer adoption of planned interventions were adequate and proactive extension services; frequent farmer training and development programmes; ease of access to and timeliness of credit; input subsidies; and timely weather information. The constraints to farmer adoption were land tenure insecurity; inadequate involvement in the planning of interventions; limited coverage of interventions due to cost; poor extension services; and inaccurate or non-existent weather information. On the basis of these farmer perspectives, the research recommends urgent need to enhance institutional capacities and improved farmer access to institutional support.","[Kangah, Henry] TCC Co Ltd, POB CT 4170, Accra, Ghana; [Atampugre, Gerald] Univ Cape Coast, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, Cape Coast, Ghana",University of Cape Coast,"Kangah, H (corresponding author), TCC Co Ltd, POB CT 4170, Accra, Ghana.",henryk1979@gmail.com; gerald.atampugre@ucc.edu.gh,,"Atampugre, Gerald/0000-0001-9595-9879",,,,,26,1,1,1,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1886,,,COGENT SOC SCI,Cogent Soc.

Adaptability, resilience, and cooperative approaches are promoted as the appropriate vehicles to meet the contemporary conditions of uncertainty and complexity. We claim that the legitimacy and effectiveness of these responsive strategies might be augmented via the use of legal perspectives. Rather than the instrumental use of command and control type of regulation, the legal perspectives should focus on establishing principal norms that enable the search for different solutions in different contexts. From these assumptions, the concept of legal obligation is explored as embodying the meaning of legality, and at the same time conditioning and committing the probing of different ways of purposeful action in different local circumstances. We explore the innovative potential of legal norms and demonstrate how responsive strategies to climate change can be guided by the contextualization of legal norms.",,,,,,"van Rijswick, Helena/0000-0002-0492-1718",,,,,29,37,37,0,15,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

It was proven that relatively small urban conglomerations in mid-latitudes, such as the case study region of Rostock, have undergone a considerable effect recently, noticeable particularly in the warm season. Due to climatic changes, these effects are expected to alter in intensity and/or frequency. This was investigated using a model that focuses on interactions between land use and surface temperatures and on specific air conditions in cities. The model enables urban surface temperature differences to be projected with regard to different assumptions of (future or planned) land use/land cover and its specific characteristics. In addition, 99th percentile summer days from the period 1961-1990 and scenario runs from regional climate models (RCMs) were used as an example of extreme heat events. The frequency of occurrence of extreme heat events resembling those occurring in the present day will be up to four (2041-2070) and six (2071-2100) times higher, respectively. Furthermore, the average temperature on defined extreme heat days will rise by 1.6 to 3.4 degrees C (2041-2070) and 2.2 to 4.4 degrees C (2071-2100), respectively. The model calculated no significant effects for differences in maximum surface temperatures between land use classes. Some parts of land use change scenarios constructed during scenario workshops in Rostock were integrated into the surface temperature model with regard to climate change adaptation. The results revealed a range of outcomes, from an enlargement of vulnerable areas to the near eradication of climate change-related heat effects in several areas.","[Richter, Michael] HafenCity Univ Hamburg, Uberseeallee 16, D-20457 Hamburg, Germany",,"Richter, M (corresponding author), HafenCity Univ Hamburg, Uberseeallee 16, D-20457 Hamburg, Germany.",michael.richter@hcu-hamburg.de,"Richter, Michael/V-1763-2018","Richter, Michael/0000-0002-0670-3634",HafenCity University Hamburg; German Federal Ministry of Research and Education through Social-Ecological Research Programme [FKZ 01UU0909],HafenCity University Hamburg; German Federal Ministry of Research and Education through Social-Ecological Research Programme,The author would like to thank the research group plan B:altic for ongoing discussions.

Yet, positive or negative behavioral spillover effects-if prevalent-have the potential to render behavioral interventions more or less effective. Behavioral spillover occurs when the adoption of one behavior targeted by an intervention changes the likelihood that an individual will adopt one or more nontargeted behaviors. As spillover is defined as a causal process, methods that isolate cause-and-effect relationships are needed to generate evidence of spillover; however, non-experimental methods can still advance knowledge in the field. Recent work reveals growing evidence for positive spillover, including recent field studies involving commonly utilized behavioral interventions. Yet, on average, effects are small and also vary in direction and magnitude as a function of how behaviors are measured. Measurement artifacts as well as concerns of publication bias suggests the need for more work in this field.","[Carrico, Amanda R.] Univ Colorado, 397 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Carrico, AR (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, 397 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",amanda.carrico@colorado.edu,,,,,,,64,8,8,3,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-1546,2352-1554,,CURR OPIN BEHAV SCI,Curr.

We propose a land use suitability strategy model to orient Land Uses of NUAs, based on integration of Land Cover Analysis (LCA) and Fragmentation Analysis (FA). With LCA the percentage of evapotranspiring surface is defined for each land use. Dimensions and densities of NUAs patches are assessed in FA. The model has been developed with Geographical Information Systems, using an extensive set of geodatabases, including orthophotos, vectorial cartographies and field surveys.

This leaves planners vulnerable to surprise if future conditions diverge from predictions. In this review, we describe contemporary approaches to decision support that address deep uncertainty about future external forcings, system responses, and stakeholder preferences for different outcomes. Many of these methods are motivated by climate change adaptation, infrastructure planning, or natural resources management, and they provide dramatic improvements in the robustness of management strategies.

The general objectives of the case studies were about identifying and exploring the potential of adaptation strategies to cope with flood risk in mountain areas. The proposal consists of a sequence of steps including participatory local workshops and the use of a decision support systems (DSS) tool. Workshops allowed for the identification of four categories of possible responses and a set of nine evaluation criteria, three for each of the three pillars of sustainable development: economy, society and the environment. They also led to the ranking of the broad categories of response strategies, according to the expectations and preferences of the workshop participants, with the aim of orienting and targeting further activities by the research consortium. The DSS tool was used to facilitate transparent and robust management of the information, the implementation of multi criteria decision analysis and the communication of the outputs. The outcomes of the implementation of the proposed methods and DSS tool are discussed to assess the potential to support decision-making processes in the field of climate change adaptation (CCA) and integrated water resources management (IWRM).

Constraints to adaptive capacity are experienced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across sub-Saharan Africa, regardless of the gender of the business owner. However, gender is a critical social cleavage through which differences in adaptive capacity manifest and in Africa most entrepreneurs are women. We conduct a systematic review to synthesize existing knowledge on differential vulnerability of female entrepreneurs in Africa to climate risk, in relation to their sensitivity to extreme climate events and their adaptive capacity. We synthesize this literature using a vulnerability analysis approach that situates vulnerability and adaptive capacity within the context of the wider climate risk framework denoted in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. In doing so, we identify gendered barriers and enablers to private sector adaptation and suggest women entrepreneurs face a triple differential vulnerability to climate change, wherein they: (1) are often more sensitive to climate risk, as a result of their concentration in certain sectors and types of enterprises (e.g., micro SMEs in the agricultural sector in remote regions); (2) face additional barriers to adaptation in the business environment, including access to finance, technologies, (climate and adaptation) information and supportive policies; and (3) are also often concurrently on the frontline of managing climate risk at household levels. Since various forms of inequality often create compounding experiences of discrimination and vulnerability, we pay particular attention to how factors of differential vulnerability intersect, amplify, and reproduce.

In particular, societies with a long-term orientation display greater support towards climate change policies.

Thus, actors in these industries seek less to depoliticize water issues than to reaffirm their political dimension by providing other problematizations and other frameworks for interpreting the ecological emergency. This article is based on an analysis of the multi-scalar political work of actors in these industries using some fifty interviews and gray literature. The results show that the politicization of climate issues enables them to transform the frameworks for legitimizing water policy and to reproduce their industrial uses of watercourses.

A ubiquitous issue in irrigation is the tendency of upstream users to deplete the stream and deprive downstream users of water. Climate change threatens to exacerbate this problem by threatening the water supply to many irrigation systems, especially those that rely on snowmelt. Using a natural experiment in the Rio Grande Basin of Colorado, I examine five hypotheses about how water rights and physical properties of irrigation systems interact to produce varying levels of irrigation performance. Results indicate that enforced water rights are reliably influential, but their influence depends on diversion location, geographic features of the watershed, physical water availability, and higher level water policy. Results highlight the interdependence of institutions and geography and support a role for carefully crafted water rights congruent with cultural norms and higher level policy in adaptation to climate change.","[Cody, Kelsey C.] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, 397 UCB Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Cody, KC (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, 397 UCB Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",codykc@colorado.edu,,"Cody, Kelsey/0000-0001-6817-2595",NSF grant [BCS-1115009],NSF grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study would not have been possible without NSF grant BCS-1115009.

We then used long-term coefficients for climatic response to simulate future electricity demand using four scenarios based on the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Our results show a gradual increase in electricity consumption due to warmer temperatures with the possibility of peak demand in winter; however, demand tends to decrease in the middle of the twenty-first century across the RCPs, while the summer peak load increases by the end of the century.

Additionally, few studies have focused on how these treatments affect forest structure and function over the long term, or our forests' ability to adapt to climate change. Despite this, there is a widespread belief in the policy arena that timber harvesting is an effective and necessary tool to address beetle infestations. That belief has led to numerous proposals for, and enactment of, significant changes in federal environmental laws to encourage more timber harvests for beetle control. In this review, we use mountain pine beetle as an exemplar to critically evaluate the state of science behind the use of timber harvest treatments for bark beetle suppression during outbreaks. It is our hope that this review will stimulate research to fill important gaps and to help guide the development of policy and management firmly based in science, and thus, more likely to aid in forest conservation, reduce financial waste, and bolster public trust in public agency decision-making and practice.","[Six, Diana L.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59804 USA; [Biber, Eric; Long, Elisabeth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Six, DL (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59804 USA.",diana.six@cfc.umt.edu; ebiber@law.berkeley.edu; elisabethllong@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation Montana Institute on Ecosystems EPSCoR [EPS-1101342],National Science Foundation Montana Institute on Ecosystems EPSCoR,This paper was funded in part though the National Science Foundation Montana Institute on Ecosystems EPSCoR EPS-1101342.,,110,43,46,1,59,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,JAN,2014,5,1,,,,,103,133,,10.3390/f5010103,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f5010103,,,31,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,AH0OW,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000335820700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The citizen science field lacks the assessment frameworks and empirical studies for understanding impacts on citizen scientists' common adaptive capacities for supporting social processes of adaptation. In addressing this gap, this paper describes a citizen science initiative carried out with communities in northeast Bangladesh, and assesses how it contributed to local governance capacity for climate adaptation. In doing so, it develops and tests a novel framework that assesses citizen science's contributions a high-quality knowledge base, and to five different capital stocks. The assessment saw high increases in citizen scientists' human capital relative to their awareness and understanding of local rainfall; learning that they applied in adaptive practices at work and at home, and local leadership. There were also high increases in social capital among citizen scientists, but more moderate increases in technological and resource capital, and in political capital. There was some evidence of the citizen science being used to support public adaptation decision-making.

Also, occupants have better experiences in naturally ventilated buildings than in mechanically ventilated buildings. However, the application of natural ventilation design is often hindered by extreme weather conditions. To cope with such problems, this paper proposes climate adaptive natural ventilation designs which utilize and adapt to the local climate. The ventilation performance of this design is quantitatively evaluated using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The CFD simulation is first validated against experiments and then utilized to reproduce the wind flow inside the building for all four seasons. The evaluation parameters include air changes per hour (ACH), wind speed at the pedestrian level and wind flow patterns indoors. Results showed that this climate adaptive natural ventilation meets the requirements of the Chinese green building assessment standards (GB/T50378-2019) with the highest ACH value of up to 15.8 times per hour. Furthermore, the wind speed at pedestrian level varies from 0.08 m/s to 0.39 m/s.

As part of the institutional dimension of adaptive capacity, how to foster processes of learning and reflexivity among different administrative units and actors is particularly essential. The aim of this paper is to analyse how the call for systematic organizational learning is manifested in local climate adaptation in two Swedish municipalities, illustrating what forms of learning occur and what learning challenges are identified. Despite the distinct and often contrasting approaches to climate adaptation adopted in the two municipalities-reflecting a variety of learning approaches-there are striking similarities in terms of difficulties in moving beyond the specialized few and reaching general acceptability as well as in the inability to mediate tensions between local sector interests, values and priorities and thus bringing about reflexive learning through experience. The paper shows that the cross-cutting nature of climate change needs to be further acknowledged in practice, including to what extent learning takes place among a specialized few key actors or as part of a systematic and cross-sectoral organizational mainstreaming as well as to what extent learning 'on paper' is actually embraced as 'learning in use' in concrete working practices.","Linkoping Univ, Dept Water & Environm Studies, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res CSPR, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Storbjork, S (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Water & Environm Studies, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res CSPR, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",sofie.storbjork@liu.se,,,,,,,57,72,72,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-908X,1522-7200,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

More recent studies include broader representations of both systems, but there are still few studies which can be regarded fully integrated. Full integration of ecological and economic models is needed to address forest management under climate change appropriately. The conclusion so far is that there are vast uncertainties about how climate change affects forests.

We present an empirical analysis of five different capacities and assess how interactions between them confer resilience in two coastal communities in Cornwall, UK. These capacities are place attachment, leadership, community cohesion and efficacy, community networks, and knowledge and learning.

Climate change may change spatial demands. For example, rising temperatures will increase the need for recreation areas, and areas could be assigned for water storage. There is a growing sense that, especially at the local scale, spatial planning has a key role in addressing the causes and impacts of climate change. This paper promotes an approach to help translate information on climate change impacts into a guiding model for adaptive spatial planning. We describe how guiding models can be used in designing integrated adaptation strategies. The concept of guiding models has been developed in the 1990s by Tjallingii to translate the principles of integrated water management in urban planning. We have integrated information about the present and future climate change and set up a climate adaptation guiding model approach. Making use of climate adaptation guiding models, spatial planners should be able to better cope with complexities of climate change impacts and be able to translate these to implications for spatial planning. The climate adaptation guiding model approach was first applied in the Zuidplaspolder case study, one of the first major attempts in the Netherlands to develop and implement an integrated adaptation strategy. This paper demonstrates how the construction of climate adaptation guiding models requires a participatory approach and how the use of climate adaptation guiding models can contribute to the information needs of spatial planners at the local scale, leading to an increasing sense of urgency and integrated adaptation planning process.","[de Groot-Reichwein, M.

This is especially so for countries like Nepal, where climate vulnerability and women participation in agriculture is high, accompanied by gender gaps in access to information, technologies, markets, and labor burden. To do this, it becomes necessary to address the inter-related issues of gender, agriculture, and climate change instead of looking at them in isolation. This study, therefore, highlights policy gaps to suggest a set of recommendations for improving gender responsiveness at policy level in Nepal. It presents the gender gaps that women face in agriculture, based on data collected from five districts of the country. Subsequently, using the concept of gender-agriculture-climate change nexus, it analyses 20 government policies and related documents of Nepal based on a set of five indicators. The policy analysis elucidates the level of gender integration in agriculture and climate change policies in the country. Eleven of the 15 agriculture related documents acknowledge the need to focus on women farmers, with nine of them also defining provisions for women-related issues in agriculture. Two of the five climate change policies merely acknowledge gender issues related to climate change. However, only two of the 20 policy documents recognize the need to address gender, climate change, and agricultural issues in coherence. Accordingly, the paper proposes a framework highlighting key points to make policy process and implementation plans in the agriculture sector more gender responsive in Nepal, focusing on the development and promotion of gender responsive Climate-Smart Agriculture technologies and practices. It suggests measures to increase access of assets and services to women farmers, improve their capacity to participate in decision making across levels, and promote transformative changes at both local and policy level.","[Paudyal, Bimala Rai] Natl Planning Commiss Nepal, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Chanana, Nitya; Khatri-Chhetri, Arun; Aggarwal, Pramod] CIMMYT, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Borlaug Inst South Asia, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, New Delhi, India; [Sherpa, Lakpa] Local Initiat Biodivers Res & Dev LI BIRD, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Kadariya, Ishwori] Agr & Forestry Univ, Ctr Biotechnol, Chitwan, Nepal",CGIAR,"Khatri-Chhetri, A (corresponding author), CIMMYT, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Borlaug Inst South Asia, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, New Delhi, India.",a.khatri-chhetri@cgiar.org,,"Chanana, Nitya/0000-0003-3545-0362",CGIAR Trust Fund,CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR),"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Trust Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

In the United States, China, Indonesia and the Netherlands, some factors (such as perceived costs) have similar influences on household adaptation to flooding, but others (such as flood experience) differ between countries. Understanding social and behavioural drivers and constraints of household adaptation is essential to effectively address increasing climate-induced risks. Factors shaping household adaptation are commonly treated as universal, despite an emerging understanding that adaptations are shaped by social, institutional and cultural contexts. Using original surveys in the United States, China, Indonesia and the Netherlands (N = 3,789), we explore variations in factors shaping households' adaptations to flooding, the costliest hazard worldwide. We find that social influence, worry, climate change beliefs, self-efficacy and perceived costs exhibit universal effects on household adaptations, despite countries' differences. Disparities occur in the effects of response efficacy, flood experience, beliefs in governmental actions, demographics and media, which we attribute to specific cultural or institutional characteristics. Climate adaptation policies can leverage the revealed similarities when extrapolating best practices across countries yet should exercise caution, as context-specific socio-behavioural drivers may discourage or even reverse household adaptation motivation.","[Noll, Brayton; Filatova, Tatiana; Taberna, Alessandro] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands; [Need, Ariana] Univ Twente, Fac Behav Management & Social Sci, Enschede, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; University of Twente,"Noll, B; Filatova, T (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands.",B.L.Noll@tudelft.nl; T.Filatova@tudelft.nl,"; Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","Taberna, Alessandro/0000-0002-0207-4148; Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930; Noll, Brayton/0000-0002-2962-3258",European Research Council under the European Union [758014],European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),"This work was supported by the European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program (grant agreement no. 758014).

There has been an increase in the number of floods reported since 2010, which seems to correlate with the evolution of the city's urban footprint.

Mobilizing and coordinating disparate public and private efforts is a key challenge in this policy domain, and this has focused research attention on the governance of adaptation, including the dynamics of interaction among interests and the institutions that facilitate collective action. This paper contributes to the study of adaptation governance by adopting the policy regimes perspective, an analytical framework designed to make sense of the loose governing arrangements surrounding complex, fragmented problems. The perspective's constructs are applied to a longitudinal case study of adaptation governance in Canada, which identifies, analyzes, and evaluates the policy ideas, institutions, and interests that comprise Canada's adaptation policy regime.","[Henstra, Daniel] Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Henstra, D (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",,,"Henstra, Daniel/0000-0003-0224-9152",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The author thanks the Editor and anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on an earlier version, and gratefully acknowledges support for this research from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",,74,19,19,2,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1541-132X,1541-1338,,REV POLICY RES,Rev.

Climate also affects infectious diseases, which have played a significant role in human history, impacting the rise and fall of civilizations and facilitating the conquest of new territories. Our review highlights significant regional changes in vector and pathogen distribution reported in temperate, peri-Arctic, Arctic, and tropical highland regions during recent decades, changes that have been anticipated by scientists worldwide. Further future changes are likely if we fail to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Many key factors affect the spread and severity of human diseases, including mobility of people, animals, and goods; control measures in place; availability of effective drugs; quality of public health services; human behavior; and political stability and conflicts. With drug and insecticide resistance on the rise, significant funding and research efforts must to be maintained to continue the battle against existing and emerging diseases, particularly those that are vector borne.","[Caminade, Cyril; McIntyre, K.

A regression model with a flexible functional form was specified on the basis of agronomic considerations. Explanatory variables included in the model were seasonal growing degree days, precipitation, technological change (e.g. adoption of new crop varieties, improved equipment, better management, etc.) and dummy variables to account for regional fixed effects. Results indicated that a fractional polynomial model in growing degree days could explain variability in maize yields better than a linear or quadratic model. Growing degree days, precipitation in July, August and September, and technological changes were important determinants of maize yields. The results could be used to predict potential maize yields under future climate change scenarios, to construct financial weather products and for policy makers to incentivize technological changes and construction of infrastructure (e.g. irrigation works) that facilitate adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector.","[Sun, B.

Future climate change scenarios suggest that the Western Australian wheat-belt is likely to see greater future reductions in rainfall than other regions, together with a further increase in temperatures. While these changes appear adverse for water-limited rain-fed agriculture, a close analysis of the changes and their impacts reveals a more complex story. Twentieth century changes in rainfall, temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration have had little or no overall impact on wheat yields. Changes in agricultural technology and farming systems have had much larger impacts. Contrary to some claims, there is no scientific or economic justification for any immediate actions by farmers to adapt to long-term climate change in the Western Australian wheat-belt, beyond normal responses to short-term variations in weather. Rather than promoting current change, the most important policy response is research and development to enable farmers to facilitate future adaptation to climate change.

This ability of flood risk reduction has for the first time been evaluated with empirical data in this study. In 2014, Malmo, Sweden, was hit with extreme precipitation corresponding to a return period of 50-200years that led to severe pluvial flooding. This and other large events presented the opportunity to evaluate the efficiency of the 15-year-old stormwater system retrofit in the Augustenborg area (30ha). Blue-green infrastructure is widely promoted for climate change adaptation, making this unique case important in the discussion of the capabilities of the related technical solutions. The long-term trends showed less flood damage in Augustenborg than in similar neighborhoods that have conventional sewer systems (combined or separate), indicating a direct effect of the retrofit with stormwater control measures. Even though a few properties were flooded in Augustenborg, it was shown that the retrofitted stormwater system performed successfully during the extreme event in 2014.","[Soerensen, J.] Lund Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, POB 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Emilsson, T.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture Planning & Management, Box 66, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden",Lund University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Sorensen, J (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, POB 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",johanna.sorensen@tvrl.lth.se,"Sörensen, Johanna Lykke/AAG-3189-2019","Sörensen, Johanna Lykke/0000-0002-2312-4917; Emilsson, Tobias/0000-0001-9806-9652",Formas [942-2015-149]; Vinnova project [2016-04254],Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Vinnova project(Vinnova),"The authors thank Helen Nilsson from the insurance company Lansforsakringar Skane and Stefan Milotti from the utility company VA Syd for flood claim data.

In contrast, I offer a critical analysis of the CCRIF that draws out how it facilitates what I call the 'financialization of disaster management'. The introduction of financial logics and techniques enables the state and capital to visualize a population's self-organizing adaptive capacity as both a threat to state-based forms of order and a value that can be leveraged on capital markets as catastrophe risk. Leveraging enhances a state's ability to repair its critical infrastructure and preemptively negate undesirable adaptations. The CCRIF blends risk pooling with parametric insurance techniques to turn the uncertainty surrounding a population's immanent adaptability into catastrophe risks that can be leveraged to enhance state security and capital accumulation in an emergent environment.","[Grove, Kevin] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Geog, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Grove, Kevin] Dartmouth Coll, Dickey Ctr Int Understanding, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Dartmouth College; Dartmouth College,"Grove, K (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Geog, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",kevin.j.grove@dartmouth.edu,,"Grove, Kevin/0000-0001-9114-5050",,,,,56,63,63,1,49,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0967-0106,1460-3640,,SECUR DIALOGUE,Secur.

I develop a stylized framework that endogenously relates the delineation of the production area of the GI product to the distribution of specific geographical characteristics and their influence on the quality of the product and the corresponding comparative advantages. The model can then study how the GI production area responds to climate-related changes in the production conditions. The model shows that the GI production area can marginally expand as climate change worsens the production conditions, but it may disappear under more severe degradations. This opportunity to relocate current GIs hinges on striking a careful balance between mitigating climate-induced yield losses and altering quality, but it is also threatened by political economy barriers that govern the redistribution of GI rents.","[Henry, Loic] Univ Paris Dauphine PSL, CNRS, LEDA, IRD, Paris, France; [Henry, Loic] Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, AgroParisTech, Paris Saclay Applied Econom, Palaiseau, Paris, France; [Henry, Loic] Univ Paris Dauphine PSL, Loic Henry, LEDA, CNRS,IRD, F-75016 Paris, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa,"Henry, L (corresponding author), Univ Paris Dauphine PSL, Loic Henry, LEDA, CNRS,IRD, F-75016 Paris, France.",loic.henry@dauphine.psl.eu,,"Henry, Loic/0000-0002-8169-1370",Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-16-CONV-0003],Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"I thank editor Terry Hurley and two anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful suggestions.

Despite many impulses for change, the analysis has shown that centralized flood risk governance by the state persists and the strategy of flood protection through technical flood infrastructure dominates in Slovakia. However it is argued that, this type of flood risk governance is unsustainable in the long term and some decentralization and diversification of flood risk governance is required to increase the societal resilience to flood risk and adapt to climate change.","[Solin, L'ubomir] Geog Ustav SAV, Stefanikova 49, Bratislava 81473, Slovakia","Slovak Academy of Sciences; Earth Science Institute, SAS","Solin, L (corresponding author), Geog Ustav SAV, Stefanikova 49, Bratislava 81473, Slovakia.",geogsol@savba.sk,"Solín, Ľubomír/AAC-8780-2019","Solín, Ľubomír/0000-0002-9810-2763",,,,,41,3,3,0,6,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCE, INST GEOGRAPHY",BRATISLAVA,"STEFANIKOVA 49, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0016-7193,2453-8787,,GEOGRAFICKY CASOPIS,Geograficky Casopis,,2020,72,4,,,,,351,370,,10.31577/geogrcas.2020.72.4.18,http://dx.doi.org/10.31577/geogrcas.2020.72.4.18,,,20,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,QW7BA,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000628802800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

It argues that local development practitioners, as a result of unconscious dispositions linked to a growing 'development legacy', habitually employ a simultaneity of rationalities. Based on fieldwork in northern Ghana conducted in the context of changing development discourse, policy and practice spurred by new challenges deriving from climate change anxiety, the study shows how local practitioners often make local activities fit into travelling development rationalities as a matter of habit, rather than as a conscious strategy. They may therefore cease to 'translate' between different rationalities. This is shown to have important implications for theory, research and practice concerning disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation in which such translation is often expected.","Roskilde Univ, Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Olwig, MF (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Roskilde, Denmark.",,"Olwig, Mette Fog/Y-4322-2018","Olwig, Mette Fog/0000-0001-5081-6671",,,,,29,12,12,0,10,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",0957-8811,1743-9728,,EUR J DEV RES,Eur.

We show that they are not always substitutes. Efficiency improvement can increase the demand for storage capacity in two scenarios: (1) if it increases water demand; (2) if, as a result of re-optimization of water inventory control, it increases the probability that the storage capacity will be exhausted. We identify properties of water demand and productivity under which the two scenarios will happen, and illustrate the potential complementarity using an empirical example of the California State Water Project. The results are also applicable to choices among infrastructure investment, improved consumption efficiency, and conservation of other storable resources, for example, energy.","[Xie, Yang] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Xie, Y (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",yang.xie@ucr.edu; zilber11@berkeley.edu,"Xie, Yang/AAM-3528-2021",,,,,,129,9,9,3,38,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Farmers face a coordination problem of collectively preserving electric power quality and a linked dilemma of obtaining sufficient electric infrastructure capacity from utilities. Low equilibria prevail due to asymmetric payoffs and farmers not knowing electric network properties. The findings derived from survey data, empirical tests, and model synthesis indicate how the capacity dilemma can be overcome to enable coordinated technology adoption via farmers' and utilities' investment into energy-efficient and economically viable technology.

Along the United States Mid-Atlantic coast, high marsh has already declined, and is particularly vulnerable to future loss due to greater regional rates of relative sea level rise and limited capacity for both vertical accretion and landward migration. To support climate adaptation efforts in the region, we conducted a spatial overlay analysis to (1) assess interior ponding in the high tidal marsh zone caused by waterlogging, and (2) identify restoration opportunities where poor drainage is limiting natural recovery. Surface inundation has increased across over 14,000 ha of high marsh in the region, mostly along the eastern Chesapeake Bay and New Jersey coast. Within this waterlogged area, we identified 239 potential restoration sites (275 ha). Validation data indicate our analysis had relatively high accuracy in identifying potential restoration sites, with a true positive rate of 76% and a true negative rate of 96%. Widespread waterlogging emphasizes the need for climate adaptation efforts to restore and protect high marsh in the face of future change. Our recommended restoration strategy of connecting waterlogged sites to tidal creeks aligns with best practices by enabling drainage of high marsh to halt or even reverse ponding, improve recovery from future flooding events, and ultimately facilitate marsh migration with sea level rise.","[Taylor, Lotem; Verutes, Gregory M.; Wilsey, Chad] Natl Audubon Soc, Div Sci, New York, NY 10014 USA; [Curson, David] Audubon Maryland DC, Baltimore, MD USA",,"Taylor, L (corresponding author), Natl Audubon Soc, Div Sci, New York, NY 10014 USA.",ltaylor@audubon.org,,"Wilsey, Chad/0000-0002-1448-1445; Taylor, Lotem/0000-0002-4881-6928; Verutes, Gregory/0000-0002-7667-7902",Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Climate Adaptation Fund; National Fish & Wildlife Foundation's Chesapeake Bay Stewardship Fund; France-Merrick Foundation; Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Chesapeake Bay Program's Innovative Nutrient and Sediment Reduction grants program; Bancroft Foundation; CSX; Chesapeake Audubon Society,Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Climate Adaptation Fund; National Fish & Wildlife Foundation's Chesapeake Bay Stewardship Fund; France-Merrick Foundation; Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF)(Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF)); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); Chesapeake Bay Program's Innovative Nutrient and Sediment Reduction grants program; Bancroft Foundation; CSX; Chesapeake Audubon Society,"Major funding for this research includes generous grants from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Climate Adaptation Fund, the National Fish & Wildlife Foundation's Chesapeake Bay Stewardship Fund, and the France-Merrick Foundation.

However, the scientific understanding of the key factors that determine the decisions that these pastoralist and agro-pastoralist households make, as well as the relation between existing human, social, natural, physical and financial assets and the adoption of adaptation practices at the household level has remained insufficient. Therefore, multivariate probit estimates were used to identify the key drivers of multiple adoption of climate-smart agro-pastoral adaptation practices in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of Burkina Faso. The results indicated that respondent households adopted a combination of adaptation practices rather than a single practice. Most of these practices aimed at enhancing household food security and livelihoods. Regarding the variables that are related to the adoption of these adaptation practices overall, a few assets were found to contribute significantly to the decision to adopt the assessed adaption practices. These include the possession of household and farm assets and equipment, membership in associations and assistance from government, farming experience of the household head, access to credit, as well as ownership and size of farmland. In addition, access to climate and agronomic information, as well as a household's location within a specifically dedicated pastoral zone, enhanced uptake of various adaptation practices in this study. Access to these assets and features hence plays a critical role in pastoralists' and agro-pastoralists' adaptive capacity. This study provides insights for policy makers in view of climate change adaptation and wider sustainable development planning in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of Africa.","[Zampaligre, Nouhoun] Inst Environm & Rech Agr INERA, Stn Farako Ba, 01 BP 910, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Zampaligre, Nouhoun] Ctr Int Rech Dev Elevage Zone Subhumide CIRDES, 01 BP 454, Bobo Dioulasso 01, Burkina Faso; [Fuchs, Lisa Elena] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Syst Theme, POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Zampaligre, N (corresponding author), Inst Environm & Rech Agr INERA, Stn Farako Ba, 01 BP 910, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.;Zampaligre, N (corresponding author), Ctr Int Rech Dev Elevage Zone Subhumide CIRDES, 01 BP 454, Bobo Dioulasso 01, Burkina Faso.",nouhoun.zampaligre@cirdes.org,,"Fuchs, Lisa Elena/0000-0002-8342-6087",USAID; International Livestock Research Centre (ILRI); Institut de l'Environment et de Recherches Agricoles (INERA) in Burkina Faso,USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); International Livestock Research Centre (ILRI)(CGIAR); Institut de l'Environment et de Recherches Agricoles (INERA) in Burkina Faso,"We are indebted to the pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities of Sondre-Est for their participation and support in helping us acquire the data for the realization of this research.

However, this is not always the experience of researchers, practitioners and decision makers responding to the challenges of a rapidly changing climate, despite the billions now being made available for investment in climate change adaptation initiatives throughout the world and particularly in developing countries. In recognition of the importance of information in adaptation planning, Article 7.7 of the Paris Agreement sets out clear guidance for parties to develop, share, manage and deliver climate change knowledge, information and data as a means to strengthening cooperation and action on adaptation. This article provides some key lessons and insights on climate change information and knowledge management (IKM) in small island developing States (SIDS) from the perspective of Pacific SIDS. A situation analysis of current climate change IKM practices in Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu was conducted and key barriers to effective climate change IKM identified. The outcome of this article is a range of pragmatic policy considerations for overcoming common barriers to climate change IKM in the Pacific, which may be of value to SIDS more widely.Key policy insights The partnership approach of co-investigating climate change IKM barriers in collaboration with Pacific SIDS generated considerable trust, a shared purpose and therefore rich IKM lessons and insights.Turning climate change IKM aspirations into practice is significantly more complicated than expected, and requires a long-term commitment from both national governments and development partners.Pacific SIDS need to establish national guiding climate change IKM Frameworks that leverage rather than duplicate growing national investments in whole-of-government IKM.Reframing climate change IKM in the Pacific towards demand and user needs will be critical to ensuring widespread ownership and participation in IKM solutions that lead to greater adaptation and resilience outcomes.It is also critical that IKM activities in SIDS support the development of national capacity to scope, develop, deploy and maintain decision support systems.Federated IKM systems are ideal for encouraging greater IKM collaboration.","[Mackay, Samuel; Brown, Rebecca; Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Gonelevu, Makelesi; Pelesikoti, Netatua] SPREP, Apia, Samoa; [Kocovanua, Talei] Fiji Govt, Minist Econ, Climate Change Div, Ro Lalabalavu House, Suva, Fiji; [Iaken, Rebecca; Iautu, Florence] Govt Vanuatu, Natl Advisory Board Climate Change & Disaster Ris, Program Management Unit, Port Vila, Vanuatu; [Tuiafitu-Malolo, Luisa; Fulivai, Sione; Lepa, Ma'asi] Tonga Govt, Minist Meteorol Energy Informat Disaster Manageme, Nukualofa, Tonga",Griffith University,"Mackay, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.",samuel.mackay@griffith.edu.au,"Mackey, Brendan/ABE-3805-2020","Brown, Rebecca/0000-0002-9621-9933; Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064; Mackay, Samuel/0000-0003-2063-2622",Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade [68616],Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade(Australian Government),"The analysis undertaken and described in this article was carried out under the Pacific iCLIM project, which is funded by the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under Grant agreement 68616 and implemented by Griffith University.",,67,22,22,3,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Through five cases, covering a range of climate risks and types of adaptation measures, this paper critically examines Swedish project coordinators' perceptions of costs and benefits in already-implemented climate adaptation measures. Our study finds that project coordinators make use of different system boundaries - on temporal, geographical and administrative scales - in their cost/benefit evaluations, making the practice of determining adaptation costs arbitrary and hard to compare. We further demonstrate that the project coordinators interpret costs and benefits in a manner that downplays the intangible environmental and social costs and benefits arising from the adaptation measures, despite their own experience of how such measures negatively impact upon social value. The exclusion of social and environmental costs and benefits has severe implications for justice, as it can bias decisions against people and ecosystems that are affected negatively. Based on the findings, we propose three tentative social justice dilemmas in local climate adaptation planning and implementation: 1. Cost and benefit distribution across scales; 2. The identification and valuation of non-market effects; and 3.

Because of the psychological connections (cognitive and emotional) with the frequency, intensity and age of a climatic event, people may have the capacity to recognize key variations at lower scales, especially those from which they perceive risk. Yet, the anticipatory actions and social engagement to respond or adapt to climate change are difficult to achieve, mostly when there exists a long psychological distance to climatic phenomena. Research about climate change communication provides clues about the relevance of place based discussion to gauge risk perception and improve response protocols, their design and prioritization. It argues that strategies and actions required to face climate risks may widely differ depending on the scale and accuracy of the local representations displayed during discussions of climate impacts. This work examines how local attributes (from climate to social) operate and control place-specific risks and priorities, by comparing coastal communities in two locations, Cabo Pulmo, Mexico and Zanzibar, Tanzania, which are subject to different climate dynamics. This paper discusses the need to identify relevant climate risks/responses at the local level and how psycho-social factors (e.g., psychological distance, collective memory, and social engagement) may operate positively for building climate resilience.

The survey results contained in this paper focus on three product categories - mango, potato chips and wine. The survey revealed that when faced with climate-adapted mango, potato chips or wine products, respondents were most likely to substitute or purchase less often rather than purchasing a more expensive 'adapted' product or a cheaper 'non-adapted' product. Across the three commodities, the level of acceptance also varied little with socio-demographic factors and the respondent's perceptions of climate change.

The sustainability of urban green as part of NbS packages and the usefulness for improvement of livelihoods is determined by the spatial (geographical location) and temporal (time of action) scales, and socio-ecological and institutional factors. Various NbS packages have shown the ability for use as climate change adaptation measures throughout the world. These functions include protection from soil erosion, protection from inland flooding, buffering natural resources against drier and more variable climates, protection from coastal hazards and sea-level rise, moderation of urban heatwaves and effects of heat island, and managing storm-water and flooding in urban areas. Furthermore, the benefits of urban agriculture and arboriculture include use as sources of food and generation of income; improve recreation and social interactions, and the sustainability of biodiversity. They also mitigate the impact of environmental pollution and climate change through reduction of gas emissions and act as carbon sinks. While the starting capital and lack of policy on urban agriculture and arboriculture in many countries, the importance of the industry is inevitably a useful agenda especially in the Global South due to vulnerability to the impact of climate change. This review also suggests the inclusion of all institutions, governments, and relevant stakeholders to emphasize gender sensitization at all levels of planning and decision-making in food production and adaptation measures to climate change.","[Nassary, Eliakira Kisetu] Sokoine Univ Agr, Coll Agr, Dept Soil & Geol Sci, POB 3008, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Msomba, Bahati Hakimu] Sugar Board Tanzania, POB 4355, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Masele, Wilson Elias; Ndaki, Patrick Madulu] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Ctr Climate Change Studies, Inst Resource Assessment, POB 35097, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Kahangwa, Caren Anatory] Natl Environm Management Council NEMC, POB 2724, Dodoma, Tanzania",Sokoine University of Agriculture; University of Dar es Salaam,"Nassary, EK (corresponding author), Sokoine Univ Agr, Coll Agr, Dept Soil & Geol Sci, POB 3008, Morogoro, Tanzania.",keliakira@yahoo.com; hakimubahati@gmail.com; wmasele5@gmail.com; patrick_ndaki@yahoo.co.uk; caren.kahangwa@gmail.com,,"Masele, Wilson/0000-0002-9983-689X; Ndaki, Patrick/0000-0001-7859-7941",,,,,184,1,1,37,65,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Likewise, future climate change adaptation (CCA) will also be slow if complex interactions highlighted in the innovation and adoption literature are ignored. The aim of this review is to collate and conceptualise this multidisciplinary literature into a nested multi-scale spatial hierarchy to understand the complexity of the CCA decision making process, highlighting the influential factors across the nested scales. Seven nested hierarchical scales were identified under an overarching level of governance. The outer boundary is the Hazardscape a spatially defined climatic region where potential impacts of climate change (CC) and suitable CCA strategies are defined. Differing socio-economic and demographic profiles (Community Typologies) under this scale mean that these strategies need to be tailored to enhance community adoption and bolster their resilience to CC. The strength and type of social interaction within and between Community will also influence CCA. Central to the hierarchy is the variation in Individuals' beliefs and risk perceptions. Greater CC risk perception within the Household can enhance or constrain CCA at the Farm scale. In turn, the Farm scale attributes can influence CCA. Differing Farm and Farmer characteristics provide a further layer of complexity when considering CCA capability. Greater knowledge and evaluation of the circumstances and factors involved in CCA decision making highlighted by the use of the hierarchy will create an evidence base which will allow a more targeted approach to CCA. Adoption can be increased through a targeted range of CCA strategies and tailored plans of communication and dissemination of CC and CCA information across the nested scales. This approach will build much needed momentum for CCA in a rural setting. While the interaction between scales is discussed, future research is required to understand the cross-scale interactions, feedback loops and temporal dynamics within the hierarchy.

It is essential for smallholders to adapt to reduce their vulnerability. Estimating the economic effectiveness of climate adaptation practices would enhance planning and actions among stakeholders and consequently impact policy. This study conducted an ex-ante in-depth empirical analysis of the costs and benefits of implementing five climate adaptation strategies identified among smallholder horticultural farmers in Ghana. A total of 180 smallholder households who have implemented the identified practices in two horticultural crop-growing municipalities were surveyed. Profitability indicators, evaluation of environmental and social externalities were employed to comparatively estimate the cost-effectiveness of the practices. The results indicated that, from private and public perspectives, implementing any of the five adaptation practices would yield positive benefits. However, considering the capital required, payback period for investments made and risks from implementation, two out of the five practices are particularly fitting choices for the smallholders. Institutional and policy support is desirable if all the practices are to be adopted. To broaden information on potential of climate adaptation vis-a-vis climatic effects with economic analysis, the study proposes integrating localized climate vulnerability and economic assessments for enhanced climate adaptation actions.","[Williams, Portia Adade; Crespo, Olivier] Univ Cape Town, Environm & Geog Sci Dept, Climate Syst Anal Grp, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Williams, Portia Adade] CSIR, Sci & Technol Policy Res Inst, Box CT 519, Accra, Ghana; [Ng'anga, Stanley Karanja] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Reg Off Africa Pan Africa Bean Res Alliance, Natl Agr Res Labs, POB 6247, Kampala, Uganda; [Abu, Mumuni] Univ Ghana, Reg Inst Populat Studies, Legon, Ghana",University of Cape Town; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University of Ghana,"Williams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Environm & Geog Sci Dept, Climate Syst Anal Grp, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.;Williams, PA (corresponding author), CSIR, Sci & Technol Policy Res Inst, Box CT 519, Accra, Ghana.",adadeposh@gmail.com,"Abu, Mumuni/Y-2583-2019; crespo, olivier/L-6398-2013; Karanja, Stanley/AAI-4188-2021","Abu, Mumuni/0000-0002-6455-0162; crespo, olivier/0000-0001-7320-9428; Karanja, Stanley/0000-0002-6166-7920","Organisation of Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD) Fellowship Programme; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); Africa Climate Development Initiative (ACDI), University of Cape Town","Organisation of Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD) Fellowship Programme; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); Africa Climate Development Initiative (ACDI), University of Cape Town","This study received funding support from the Organisation of Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD) Fellowship Programme and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida).

Here, we report the results of the most comprehensive survey carried out in the Canadian forestry sector to date regarding perceptions of climate change. A total of 1158 individuals, representing a wide range of stakeholders across the five most important forestry provinces in Canada, were asked about climate change, its impact on forest ecosystems, and the suitability of current forest management for addressing future impacts. Overall, we found that respondents were more concerned about climate change than the general population. More than 90% of respondents agreed with the anthropogenic origins of climate change, and > 50% considered it a direct threat to their welfare. Political view was the main driver of general beliefs about the causes of climate change and its future consequences, while the province of origin proved to be the best predictor of perceived current impacts on forest ecosystems and its associated risks; and type of stakeholder was the main driver of perceived need for adaptation. Industrial stakeholders were the most skeptical about the anthropogenic cause(s) of climate change (18% disagreed with this statement, compared to an average of 8% in the other stakeholders), its impacts on forest ecosystems (28% for industry vs. 10% for other respondents), and the need for new management practices (18% vs. 7%). Although the degree of awareness and the willingness to implement adaptive practices were high even for the most skeptical groups, our study identified priority sectors or areas for action when designing awareness campaigns. We suggest that the design of a strategic framework for implementing climate adaptation within the Canadian forest sector should focus on the relationship between climate change and changes in disturbance regimes, and above all on the economic consequences of these changes, but it should also take into account the positions shown by each of the actors in each province.","[Ameztegui, Aitor] Univ Lleida, Dept Agr & Forest Engn EAGROF, Lleida, Spain; [Ameztegui, Aitor; Solarik, Kevin A.; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec, CEF, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ameztegui, Aitor] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Solsona, Spain; [Parkins, John R.] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Houle, Daniel] Minist Forets Faune & Parcs, Foret Quebec, Direct Rech Forestiere, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Houle, Daniel] Consortium Reg Climatol & Adaptat Climate Change, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, Dept Sci Nat, Ripon, PQ, Canada; [Gravel, Dominique] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, 2500 Boul Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada",Universitat de Lleida; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Centre Tecnologic Forestal de Catalunya (CTFC); University of Alberta; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; University of Sherbrooke,"Ameztegui, A (corresponding author), Univ Lleida, Dept Agr & Forest Engn EAGROF, Lleida, Spain.;Ameztegui, A (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, CEF, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Ameztegui, A (corresponding author), Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Solsona, Spain.",ameztegui@gmail.com,"Ameztegui, Aitor/C-2587-2009","Ameztegui, Aitor/0000-0003-2006-1559; Solarik, Kevin/0000-0002-0198-0595",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [430393-12],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This project was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) through a strategic grant 430393-12.

This article addresses the management of living marine resources, and how management regimes cope with change and bolster the resilience of ecosystems. Experiences from the Norwegian management regime for living marine resources are used to illustrate how an existing regime can respond to change.

This robust fingerprint of climate change is of particular concern, resulting in heavy rainfall and devastating floods. Often this intensification is explained as a consequence of the Clausius-Clapeyron law in a warmer world, under constant relative humidity. Here, based on an ensemble of CMIP5 global climate models and high-resolution regional climate simulations, we take the example of Southwest Asia, where extreme storms will intensify beyond the Clausius- Clapeyron scaling, and propose an additional novel mechanism for this region: the unique increase in atmospheric relative humidity over the Arabian Sea and associated deep northward penetration of moisture. This increase in humidity is dictated by changes in circulation over the Indian Ocean. Our proposed mechanism is consistent with the recent, most extreme storm ever observed in the region. Our findings advance a new understanding of natural climate variability in this region, with substantial implications for climate change adaptation of the region's critical infrastructure.","[Tuel, Alexandre; Choi, Yeon-Woo; Eltahir, Elfatih A.

We provide observational evidence that increased foliage cover over the Northern Hemisphere, during 1982-2011, triggers an additional soil moisture deficit that is further carried over into summer. Climate model simulations independently support this and attribute the driving process to be larger increases in evapotranspiration than in precipitation. This extra soil drying is projected to amplify the frequency and intensity of summer heatwaves. Most feedbacks operate locally, except for a notable teleconnection where extra moisture transpired over Europe is transported to central Siberia. Model results illustrate that this teleconnection offsets Siberian soil moisture losses from local spring greening. Our results highlight that climate change adaptation planning must account for the extra summer water and heatwave stress inherited from warming-induced earlier greening.","[Lian, Xu; Piao, Shilong; Li, Yue; Li, Xiangyi; Wang, Xuhui; Zeng, Zhenzhong] Peking Univ, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Earth Sci, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong; Li, Laurent Z.

Sustainable seed innovation within India receives support primarily from nonprofit groups favoring open-source systems. Conserving natural and financial capital motivated farmers to adopt sustainable techniques, but farmers believed attracting additional innovators required development of new markets. India's Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act recognizes farmers as plant breeders but does not provide incentive to innovate sustainably.

Our findings showed that a 10% increase in urban land cover can cause a 0.11 K increase in surface temperature in PRD, and urban temperature will rise by 0.15-0.21 K because of global climate change alone. We found that urbanization has marginal effects on thermal comfort despite increasing surface temperature in PRD. Moreover, global climate change will increase the frequency at which temperatures exceed critical temperatures reported in the literature and the extreme heat stress level (95th percentile of baseline year).

Standards of analysis that can normalize measurements under various contexts are particularly valuable in the global arena of disaster management. One concern that may benefit from normalizing is the analysis of disaster loss trends. Previous studies have used a combination of inflation, wealth, and societal factors in their normalization of disaster loss methodologies. This study examines the various normalization methods in previous research and applies a selection of eight formulae to 50 years of disaster data in South Korea. The results show both decreasing and increasing trends in disaster damage losses based on the methods, but there are curious biases under the results that may be artifacts of Korea's unique experiences in economic development. The conclusion discusses how the case of Korea may help to clarify the optimal normalization methodology for other countries.","[Choi, Donghyun] Korea Army Acad, Dept Business Adm, Yeongcheon, Gyeongsangbuk D, South Korea; [Kasdan, David Oliver] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Grad Sch Governance, Dept Publ Adm, Seoul, South Korea; [Yoon, D.

A moderate reduction in annual rainfall together with a marked increase in maximum and minimum air temperature was observed in Castelporziano along the study period. Principal component analysis distinguished 'dry' and 'hot' years (concentrated in the last decade) from 'wet' and 'cold' years, more common in the 1980s and the 1990s. Our results underline the increased unpredictability of Mediterranean dry spells possibly due to the higher climate variability in the drier season.

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative study was conducted in three peri-urban communities in Malolos, Philippines, looking at the perception and adaptation mechanisms of children in the face of climate change, using Lazarus and Folkman's typology for children's coping strategies in stressful situations. The support that children receive at the household, community, and city levels was also examined. Findings - Climate change has impacted the daily lives of children, aggravating in particular the everyday and invisible risks of those who belong to poor households. In general, emotion-focused coping that hinges on denial or distancing did not seem to be prominent among children; many of them were rather pre-disposed to problem-focused coping as they try to cope with the impacts of climate change in their immediate environment. Unfortunately, however, interventions to mitigate the impacts of climate change on children at the household, community, and city levels were found to be lacking. Research limitations/implications - The selected communities do not represent the wide spectrum of localities in the Philippines. At best, findings from the small sample size provide only a snapshot of the conditions of children living in peri-urban areas. Practical implications - The study points to the need for child-sensitive climate change adaptation at the household, community, and city levels to support the coping mechanisms of children. Originality/value - The study adopts a multi-level approach at understanding the impacts of climate change on Filipino children and the interventions that they and other social institutions have undertaken in response thereto. Findings add empirical evidence to growing literature on the subject, especially in the context of the Philippines where academic studies on the matter remain scant.","[Berse, Kristoffer] Univ Philippines Diliman, Natl Coll Publ Adm & Governance, Quezon City, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Berse, K (corresponding author), Univ Philippines Diliman, Natl Coll Publ Adm & Governance, Quezon City, Philippines.",kbberse@up.edu.ph,"Berse, Kristoffer/Y-3604-2019","Berse, Kristoffer/0000-0002-2452-5341",,,,,52,7,8,3,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0965-3562,1758-6100,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

In particular climate change and the concomitant increase of extreme weather events has exposed the inability of current governance regimes to deal with present and future challenges. Still our knowledge about resource governance regimes and how they change is quite limited. This paper develops a conceptual framework addressing the dynamics and adaptive capacity of resource governance regimes as multi-level learning processes. The influence of formal and informal institutions, the role of state and non-state actors, the nature of multi-level interactions and the relative importance of bureaucratic hierarchies, markets and networks are identified as major structural characteristics of governance regimes. Change is conceptualized as social and societal learning that proceeds in a stepwise fashion moving from single to double to triple loop learning. Informal networks are considered to play a crucial role in such learning processes. The framework supports flexible and context sensitive analysis without being case study specific. First empirical evidence from water governance supports the assumptions made on the dynamics of governance regimes and the usefulness of the chosen approach. More complex and diverse governance regimes have a higher adaptive capacity. However, it is still an open question how to overcome the state of single-loop learning that seem to characterize many attempts to adapt to climate change. Only further development and application of shared conceptual frameworks taking into account the real complexity of governance regimes can generate the knowledge base needed to advance current understanding to a state that allows giving meaningful policy advice.

This has led many to pursue climate adaptation planning, seeking to achieve preparedness through reducing vulnerability and enhancing resilience of populations, assets, and municipal operations. Although cities typically share these common goals, many are electing to pursue different planning approaches. In this paper, we examine three climate adaptation planning approaches in the cities of Quito (Ecuador), Surat (India), and Durban (South Africa) and analyze the trade-offs associated with different planning pathways and different forms of stakeholder involvement. We assess the potentials and limitations of these different approaches, including their implications for enhancing government integration and coordination, promoting participation and adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups, and facilitating overall urban resilience. We find that, in order to gain widespread commitment on adaptation, sustained political leadership from the top, departmental engagement, and continued involvement from a variety of stakeholders are integral to effective decision-making and institutionalization of programs in the long run. When climate adaptation is advanced with a focus on learning, awareness, and capacity building, the process will likely lead to more sustained, legitimate, and comprehensive adaptation plans and policies that enhance the resilience of the most affected urban areas and residents.

Equally important is the need to engage stakeholders in discussions of climate-related impacts, risks, vulnerabilities, and adaptation issues. The impact chain (IC) approach, which emerged about a decade ago, can be used to reveal potential climate risks and vulnerabilities and to visualize how climate-related impacts may propagate as cascades. Here, we discuss the composition, key features, and potentials of the IC approach. Drawing from actual experience, we discuss some important factors that must be considered in the development of ICs via stakeholder participation. Such considerations are centered on the need for clarity with respect to the conceptual framing of relevant ICs, the need to allocate ample time for the development of ICs, and the need for stakeholders to be representative of the relevant sectors and sub-sectors. The insights presented in this article should facilitate the implementation of this relatively simple, practical, and useful approach for understanding climate-related impacts, risks, vulnerabilities, and adaptation issues.","[Estoque, Ronald C.] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Ctr Biodivers & Climate Change, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Estoque, Ronald C.; Ooba, Makoto; Hijioka, Yasuaki] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Togawa, Takuya; Yoshioka, Akira; Gomi, Kei; Nakamura, Shogo; Tsuji, Takashi] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Fukushima Reg Collaborat Res Ctr, Fukushima 9637700, Japan; [Watanabe, Manabu; Kitahashi, Midori] E Konzal, Osaka 5320011, Japan",Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Estoque, RC (corresponding author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Ctr Biodivers & Climate Change, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan.;Estoque, RC (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",estoquerc21@affrc.go.jp,"Estoque, Ronald C./Q-3769-2016","Estoque, Ronald C./0000-0001-9681-492X; Tsuji, Takashi/0000-0002-4447-5329",Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan through its Environment Research and Technology Development Fund [JPMEERF20202009],Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan through its Environment Research and Technology Development Fund,This work was supported by the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan through its Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (JPMEERF20202009).,,63,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

This problem has been studied in cold weather, but it also takes place in warm climates such as those of Mediterranean countries, and it has not been widely targeted. In these countries, approximately 70% of its building stock was built during 1960-1980, its renovation being an opportunity to reduce its energy demand, improve tenants' quality of life, and make it more resilient to climate change. In the retrofitting process, it is also important to consider tenants' adaptability and regional scenarios. In this sense, the present work proposes an assessment model of retrofitting projects that takes into consideration energy consumption, comfort, tenants' health, and monetary poverty. For this, the Index of Vulnerable Homes was implemented in this research to consider adaptive comfort in the energy calculation as well as the adaptability to climate change. A case study of 40 social housings in Seville, Spain, was analyzed in 2050 and 2080 future scenarios, defining the impact in energy poverty of the building retrofitting projects.","[Alba-Rodriguez, M.

Traditional irrigation techniques were identified as a key aspect of soil conservation and agricultural practices, to build living and autopoietic ecosystems, also in adverse climatic conditions, and to adapt to climatic changes. Being a structural source of ecosystem survival, and being based on long-lasting observation of the climate and of the environment, they have deep roots in local cultures and they were identified as a common ground also for multicultural interaction. The core of the exhibition is structured in sections focused on techniques for collecting groundwater, atmospheric humidity and surface water, on water lifting techniques and on water distributive systems. The final section of the exhibition is devoted to the oases which are presented as an equilibrium ecosystem, established upon the alliance between man and nature and founded on the capability of collecting water.","[Barontini, S.; Boselli, V.; Louki, A.; Ben Slima, Z.; Ghaouch, F.

In this paper, we use critical discourse analysis of an influential small-town newspaper to understand how the environment is being represented publicly and consider how these representations might affect local environmental politics and efforts to mitigate or adapt to climate change and exurban sprawl. We find that the environment is generally represented as an amenity to be enjoyed rather than a subject of concern, that environmental degradation, when represented at all, is often discussed in vague or distancing terms, and that human agency is typically presented in individualizing, hyper-local terms rather than in collective, community-or national-scale ones. In conclusion, we suggest that these representational styles are likely very effective for inspiring interest in and connection to local landscapes, but they do not provide a strong basis for collective efforts to understand and address climate change and exurbanization.","[Burke, Brian J.] Appalachian State Univ, Sustainable Dev Dept, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Welch-Devine, Meredith] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Gustafson, Seth] Univ Bremen, ARTEC Sustainabil Res Ctr, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Gustafson, Seth] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Bremen; University of Bremen,"Burke, BJ (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Sustainable Dev Dept, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",,"Welch-Devine, Meredith/AAG-1278-2020","Welch-Devine, Meredith/0000-0001-8519-4585; Burke, Brian/0000-0002-0550-6364; Gustafson, Seth/0000-0002-8326-0291","National Science Foundation [DEB-0823293]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [0823293, 1440485] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"Brian J.

Despite future climate change, current climate variability is already an issue of concern that justifies adaptation efforts. In Brazil, the Semi-Arid Region is a climate hotspot, well known for both historic socioeconomic setbacks, and agriculture failures caused by dry spells and severe droughts. In 2010, the Brazilian government enacted the National Policy on Climate Change, which states as one of its key goals the identification of vulnerabilities and the adoption of adequate measures of adaptation to climate change. The improvement of vulnerability assessment tools is a response to the growing demand of decision makers for regular information and indicators with high spatial and temporal resolution. This article aims at undertaking a comparative assessment of smallholder farming's vulnerability to droughts. An integrated assessment system has been developed and applied to seven municipalities located in the Brazilian Semi-Arid Region (within the State of Ceara).

The results show that losses to irrigated agriculture under a median climate change scenario are modest, but under a 'modified 2030 dry extreme scenario' there would be substantial reductions in water use, irrigated land use and profits. Nevertheless, the Basin-wide proportional economic impacts would be less than the percentage decline in water use. A comparison of model results with and without inter-regional water trade shows that inter-regional water trade in periods of much reduced water availability mitigates the on-farm impacts of climate change. Given that agricultural production in the Basin is likely to be affected by climate change, the development of drought-tolerant crops and cultivars along with learning and extension of best farming practices to reduced water use could also assist irrigated agriculture adapt to climate change within the Basin.

Two dominant atmospheric patterns, described by an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, are related to the results of the extreme value statistics. The principal components of the second and third mode of EOFs have significant trends over the last 40 years, but with an opposing impact on the return values of extreme precipitation. This explains the observed stationarity of extreme precipitation over recent decades at the west coast of Norway, which was also found in previous studies. The second mode of EOFs also shows a relation to the sea-ice coverage in the Barents and Kara Seas, which suggests a connection between the decline of sea-ice to the changes in the atmospheric pattern.","[Odemark, Karianne; Muller, Malte; Palerme, Cyril; Tveito, Ole Einar] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Oslo, Norway; [Odemark, Karianne; Muller, Malte] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Meteorological Institute; University of Oslo,"Odemark, K (corresponding author), Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Oslo, Norway.",karianneo@met.no,,,"Norwegian Research Council; Energi Norge, Norway [NFR-235710/E20]","Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Energi Norge, Norway","The study is supported by the Norwegian Research Council and Energi Norge, Norway through the project FlomQ (NFR-235710/E20) .

A warming and drying trend was seen in Xiongan New Area during 1961-2018, as evidenced by the increase in the number of high-temperature days and the maximum rainfall intensity per hour, a decrease in surface water resources and groundwater levels, a reduction in wind speeds, and weakening of the self-purification capacity of the atmosphere. It is estimated that the areas at high risk of floods and heats will increase by 15.7 and 15.6% in around 2035 relative to 1986-2005, respectively. Although the runoff in the Daqing River Basin will increase, the construction of Xiongan New Area means that the imbalance between the supply and demand of water resources will remain. Climate change adaptation measures should therefore be improved in the planning and construction of Xiongan New Area.

To do so, it examines the descriptive linkages between 12 design features and nine benefits using 447 project case studies from the American Society of Landscape Architects. Multiple benefits of green infrastructure were found in 65% of the projects, regardless of the number of applied design features. The major green infrastructure design features with multiple benefits were: bioretention areas, permeable pavements, grassed swales, rainwater harvesting, rain gardens, and curb cuts. The major benefits of applied design features were: enhanced economic capacity, educational opportunities, improvements to the built environment, and enhanced environmental soundness. The findings show that the multiple benefits of green infrastructure's multifunctionality can be inferred in many current cases. Knowing the relationship between design features and their benefits for green infrastructure would facilitate selecting optimal design features to achieve specific goals and planning outcomes. For communities that require a range of complex benefits, a multifunctionality-based green infrastructure will advance highly acceptable climate change adaptation measures.","[Kim, Donghyun] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Engn, 2 Busandaehak Ro 63Beon-gil, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Song, Seul-Ki] Korea Environm Inst, 370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong 30147, South Korea",Pusan National University; Korea Environment Institute (KEI),"Kim, D (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Engn, 2 Busandaehak Ro 63Beon-gil, Busan 46241, South Korea.",donghyun-kim@pusan.ac.kr,"Kim, Donghyun/HDO-8306-2022","Kim, Donghyun/0000-0003-3711-5103",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government [NRF-2017R1A2B4008057],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government,"This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), funded by the Korean government (no.

These records have become informative proxies in the study of current sea level rise. Well-preserved notches along the vertical limestone cliffs within the study property reveal several phases of prolonged stable sea levels that likely pertain to the Mid-Holocene marine transgression 8 ka BP to 4 ka BP and allow for detailed coastline reconstructions for parts of the Red River Delta (RRD). The resulting coastline model facilitates a closer look at past human responses to landscape and environmental changes at local and individual site-level, which improves our understanding of past human adaptations to climate-change induced sea level rise.

The findings of the study revealed that peri-urban farmers perceived and observed significant climatic and related changes that were negatively impacting their farming activities. Observed changes included reduced precipitation levels, increased atmospheric temperature and diminishing borehole yields. Farmers were adapting with a variety of methods which included repeated planting, watering plants during the night, renting animal space in other farms with more water sources and purchasing supplementary feed for livestock.

This can potentially be attained through an increased understanding of the relationship between heatwaves and one of their main dynamical drivers, atmospheric blocking. In the 1979-2015 period, we find that there is a significant correlation between summer heatwave magnitudes and the number of days influenced by atmospheric blocking in Northern Europe and Western Russia. Using three large global climate model ensembles, we find similar correlations, indicating that these three models are able to represent the relationship between extreme temperature and atmospheric blocking, despite having biases in their simulation of individual climate variables such as temperature or geopotential height. Our results emphasize the need to use large ensembles of different global climate models as single realizations do not always capture this relationship. The three large ensembles further suggest that the relationship between summer heatwaves and atmospheric blocking will not change in the future. This could be used to statistically model heatwaves with atmospheric blocking as a covariate and aid decision-makers in planning disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change.","[Schaller, N.; Sillmann, J.] Ctr Int Climate Res CICERO, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Anstey, J.] Univ Victoria, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Fischer, E.

This review describes the status and challenges facing irrigated agriculture in Kenya. The results indicated that as of 2018, the developed irrigation schemes covered an area of 222,240 ha, which is 16% of the irrigation potential of 1.34 million ha. Most large-scale irrigation schemes use the furrow system. Private and commercial farms and smallholder irrigation schemes use modern irrigation systems. The major challenges to irrigation development are technical, socio-economic, and institutional. The main technical challenges include poor water infrastructure, water scarcity, and poor water quality. The main socio-economic challenges include the high cost of modern irrigation systems, inadequate credit facilities, and market inaccessibility. The institutional challenges include the existence of a pluralistic legal framework, inadequate participation by farmers, including women farmers, and poorly organized irrigation water user associations. However, the future of irrigation development is bright through climate change adaptation strategies such as solar-powered irrigation systems and rainwater harvesting.","[Kanda, Edwin Kimutai; Lutta, Valery Osimbo] Masinde Muliro Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, POB 190, Kakamega 50100, Kenya",,"Kanda, EK (corresponding author), Masinde Muliro Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, POB 190, Kakamega 50100, Kenya.",ekanda@mmust.ac.ke,"Kanda, Edwin Kimutai/AAG-6429-2021","Kanda, Edwin Kimutai/0000-0002-5357-1005",,,,,55,0,0,8,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1531-0353,1531-0361,,IRRIG DRAIN,Irrig.

As the U.S. Forest Service faces budget constraints and increasing management complexity, the agency is engaging companies to fund projects on national forests that address climate change adaptation and mitigation objectives. We interviewed Forest Service staff, 26 corporate partners, and several key members of non-profit organizations who serve as intermediaries facilitating these partnerships, to gain perspectives on the reasons why companies fund these types of projects. Participants indicated that companies engage based on four primary motivations: (1) a sustainability culture defined by leadership; (2) stakeholder pressures, such as those from consumers; (3) organizational characteristics, such as a reliance on forest products; and (4) marketing. Identifying what drives companies to fund projects can help managers create strategies to more effectively bring in private sector funding for public land management. In a broader sense, partnerships between companies and the Forest Service reflect a global trend in the growth of public-private partnerships, where governments, often facing budget constraints, increasingly rely on private actors to meet management objectives.","[Collins, Natasha Haruka; Schultz, Courtney A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Collins, NH (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",nharuka.collins@gmail.com; courtney.schultz@colostate.edu,,"Schultz, Courtney/0000-0002-9972-7802",U.S. Forest Service Office of Sustainability and Climate [l 6-CS-11132000-272]; National Science Foundation [1702676],U.S. Forest Service Office of Sustainability and Climate; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This study was funded by the U.S. Forest Service Office of Sustainability and Climate under agreement number l 6-CS-11132000-272 and by the National Science Foundation under grant 1702676.,,49,0,0,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Alternative food networks are initiatives related to food provision that operate at a local level and are concerned with both environmental stewardship and social justice. This paper presents a case study of alternative food networks operating in Brisbane and Melbourne in order to analyze: i) their socio-economic and environmental contributions to the resilience and sustainability of urban food systems; and, ii) the limitations that alternative food networks are facing. The cases researched include examples of urban agriculture, food hubs, buyers' groups, and specialist retailers. The results indicate that alternative food networks can improve access to healthy food, provide fairer conditions for farmers, reduce food loss/waste, increase environmental protection, and facilitate climate change adaptation. The limitations to the expansion of alternative food networks are also discussed, including the restricted access to land for growing food, low public engagement, and the dependence on volunteer labor. The paper concludes by summarizing the contribution of alternative food networks to urban food systems and identifies issues for future research.","[Vieira, Leticia Canal; Serrao-Neumann, Silvia] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Serrao-Neumann, Silvia] Univ Waikato, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Howes, Michael] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Cities Res Inst, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; University of Waikato; Griffith University,"Vieira, LC (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",leticiacvieira@gmail.com,"Vieira, Letícia Canal/Y-8700-2019","Vieira, Letícia Canal/0000-0001-5810-8565; Howes, Michael/0000-0003-1102-1483; Serrao-Neumann, Silvia/0000-0001-9601-4914",GUIPRS Scholarship scheme; Griffith University [GUIPRS Scholarship],GUIPRS Scholarship scheme; Griffith University [GUIPRS Scholarship],"This research is part of Leticia Canal Vieira's PhD, funded by the GUIPRS Scholarship scheme; Griffith University [GUIPRS Scholarship].",,79,9,9,10,57,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2168-3565,2168-3573,,AGROECOL SUST FOOD,Agroecol.

Considering this, a foresight study on business model innovation, technological adaptation, and market design policy alternatives is presented. A Policy Delphi method was applied, involving two iterative survey rounds and 207 European experts, which assessed 57 policy alternatives. The results highlight adaptation challenges for implementing new technologies and business practices. Experts support innovation and transition to new roles, and innovative services, while warranting that core electricity distribution activities are secured. This shift in roles is expected to be achieved through research and development (R&D) support policies, innovation friendly regulatory frameworks, and concerted actions at the EU and Member States level.

However, while the analysis shows fewer typhoons (above 118 kph), more extreme TCs (above 150 kph) have affected the Philippines. The study also confirms that the Northern island of Luzon is most frequently hit by TCs, and that TC-associated rainfall is greatest in this region compared to the southernmost part of the country. The impact of TCs shows a consistently increasing trend in economic losses and damages.

This will exacerbate the already high cost incurred by utility companies and communities due to damage to distribution systems by hurricanes. Consequently, long-term investment in critical civil infrastructure systems, such as distribution systems, requires long-term planning that incorporates the potential impact of climate change. This can only be achieved through a comprehensive risk analysis framework for evaluating the impact of climate change and studying the effectiveness of various adaptation strategies. This paper presents a framework for incorporating the potential impact of climate change in the reliability analysis of power distribution systems subject to hurricane hazards. The framework incorporates a time-dependent hurricane hazard model, time-dependent fragility model, system reliability evaluation, and a life cycle cost analysis for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various climate change adaptation strategies. A notional power distribution system located in the hurricane-prone state of Florida is used to demonstrate the proposed framework.

Despite advances in disaster risk reduction efforts of the country, the twin December storms caused numerous deaths in the Visayas and Mindanao regions. Analysis of these events shows that alerts raised during the Pre-Disaster Risk Assessment (PDRA) for both storms were largely ineffective because they were too broad and general calling for forced evacuations in too many provinces. Repeated multiple and general warnings that usually do not end up in floods or landslides, desensitize people and result in the cry-wolf effect where communities do not respond with urgency when needed. It was unlike the previous execution of PDRA from 2014 to early 2017 by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), which averted mass loss of lives in many severely impacted areas because of hazard-specific, area-focused and time-bound warnings. PDRA must reinstate specific calls, where mayors of communities are informed by phone hours in advance of imminent danger to prompt and ensure immediate action. Mainstreaming Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction information using probabilistic (multi-scenario) hazard maps is also necessary for an effective early warning system to elicit appropriate response from the community. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach Methods of early warning through the PDRA of the National Disaster Mitigation and Management Council (NDRRMC) of the Philippines during tropical storm Urduja and Typhoon Vinta were assessed in this study and compared to the previous PDRA system from 2014 to early 2017. Findings It was found out that the numerous casualties were due to inadequate warning issued during the approach of the tropical cyclones. During an impending hazard, warnings must be accurate, reliable, understandable and timely. Despite the availability of maps that identified safe zones for different communities, warnings raised during the PDRA for both tropical cyclones were deemed too general calling for evacuations of whole provinces. As such, not all communities were evacuated in a timely manner because of failure in the key elements of an effective early warning system. Originality/value To avoid future disasters from happening, it is recommended that the PDRA reinstate its hazards-specific, area-focused and time-bound warnings. Similarly, to increase the resilience of communities, more work on mainstreaming of Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk and Vulnerability Reduction systems for communities must be done as well. Learning from the lessons of these previous disasters will enable communities, their leaders and every stakeholder, not to repeat the same mistakes in the future.","[Lagmay, Mahar] Univ Philippines, Natl Inst Geol Sci, Quezon City, Philippines; [Lagmay, Mahar] Univ Philippines, Nationwide Operat Assessment Hazards Ctr, Quezon City, Philippines; [Lagmay, Mahar] Univ Philippines, Resilience Inst, Quezon City, Philippines; [Alan Racoma, Bernard] Univ Philippines Diliman, Natl Inst Geol Sci, Nationwide Operat Assessment Hazards Ctr, Quezon City, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Lagmay, M (corresponding author), Univ Philippines, Natl Inst Geol Sci, Quezon City, Philippines.;Lagmay, M (corresponding author), Univ Philippines, Nationwide Operat Assessment Hazards Ctr, Quezon City, Philippines.;Lagmay, M (corresponding author), Univ Philippines, Resilience Inst, Quezon City, Philippines.",amfal2@yahoo.com; bbracoma@up.edu.ph,"Racoma, Bernard Alan/AFW-9681-2022","Racoma, Bernard Alan/0000-0002-7778-7273",,,,,41,6,6,1,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0965-3562,1758-6100,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

When such decisions are made at the parcel-level, there is potential for spatial spillovers, including externalities due to deflected wave action and peer effects. We estimate a discrete choice model of landowner armoring choices from 1990 to 2015 in the U.S. state of Oregon that suggests the impacts of spatial spillovers are highly influential determinants in these private adaptation decisions. Our landscape simulations excluding spatial spillovers may under-predict future armoring by 37-97 percent. From scenario-based simulations, we then demonstrate the primacy of policy, as a removal of a current land-use regulation that limits armoring has potential to significantly increase future armoring by 69 percent. Furthermore, inclusion of SLR projections suggests armoring would increase an additional 5.4 percent within four decades. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.","[Beasley, W.

Faced with this known phenomenon, this article outlines a research approach for assessing the law's role in encouraging states to preemptively protect individuals who live in deteriorating territories, notably by enabling mobility. The question is, however, far from simple, insofar as most of the ways to adapt to climate change-and particularly mobility, which has important human and social implications-require profound societal choices that anthropology has the tools to study. I therefore accompany my legal research with an anthropological approach centered around ethnography conducted at three sites-France, Guadeloupe, Senegal-where state-sponsored mobility is either being considered or already being used as an option to confront the progressive disappearance of land that is being swept away by the sea.","[Courtoy, Marie] Univ catholique Louvain UCLouvain, Ottignies Louvain La Neuv, Belgium; [Courtoy, Marie] Katholieke Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Courtoy, M (corresponding author), Univ catholique Louvain UCLouvain, Ottignies Louvain La Neuv, Belgium.;Courtoy, M (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",marie.courtoy@uclouvain.be,,"Courtoy, Marie/0000-0003-1075-3260",Belgian Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS),Belgian Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),"Marie Courtoy holds a double Bachelor's degree in Sociology and Anthropology and in Law (Universite Saint-Louis-Bruxelles, Belgium) as well as a Master's degree in Law (UCLouvain, Belgium).

We use a field-level data set on maize and soybean yields in the central United States for 1995 through 2012 to examine changes in drought sensitivity. Although yields have increased in absolute value under all levels of stress for both crops, the sensitivity of maize yields to drought stress associated with high vapor pressure deficits has increased. The greater sensitivity has occurred despite cultivar improvements and increased carbon dioxide and reflects the agronomic trend toward higher sowing densities. The results suggest that agronomic changes tend to translate improved drought tolerance of plants to higher average yields but not to decreasing drought sensitivity of yields at the field scale.","[Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Roberts, Michael J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Schlenker, Wolfram] Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Braun, Noah; Rejesus, Roderick M.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Little, Bertis B.] Tarleton State Univ, Dept Math, Off Provost, Stephenville, TX USA; [Little, Bertis B.] Tarleton State Univ, Div Acad Affairs, Stephenville, TX USA; [Hammer, Graeme L.] Univ Queensland, Queensland Alliance Agr & Food Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Stanford University; Stanford University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Columbia University; North Carolina State University; Texas A&M University System; Tarleton State University; Texas A&M University System; Tarleton State University; University of Queensland,"Lobell, DB (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dlobell@stanford.edu,"Hammer, Graeme L/A-3785-2008","Hammer, Graeme L/0000-0002-1180-7374; Lobell, David/0000-0002-5969-3476; Braun, Noah/0000-0002-9710-0686","NSF [SES-0962625]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA11OAR4310095]; USDA's Risk Management Agency; Australian Research Council [LP100100495]; Australian Research Council [LP100100495] Funding Source: Australian Research Council; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0962625] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0962559] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USDA's Risk Management Agency; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank G.

This framework, based on social vulnerability as a linking element between climate change adaptation and poverty reduction, goes beyond current attempts to 'mainstream' adaptation and mitigation into national development priorities.

The research, unprecedented for the Chilean case, is aimed at acknowledging the news framings by means of which climate change is communicated, since the media are the main source of information on climate change for decision makers and citizens. The results show that the primary definers of the topic are the governmental actors of national level and the invisibilization of individuals and civil organizations in the process. Thus, we see a high degree of consensus between the visible actors with regard to the framing of economic opportunity and the absence of framings of critical ecology.

Drawing on social cognitive theory, this paper examines the role of perceived collective efficacy-people's shared beliefs about their group's capabilities to accomplish collective tasks-and trust in government as factors influencing Indians' engagement with government water conservation policies. Using a national survey of Indians (N = 4031), we found that individuals with high levels of perceived collective efficacy and trust in government are more likely to support government water conservation policies. Moreover, for individuals with low trust in government, higher collective efficacy is associated with greater policy support. Perceived collective efficacy is also associated with activist behaviours, while distrust is not. Increasing collective efficacy beliefs, for example through mass media channels and targeted campaigns, could help increase citizens' engagement with climate change adaptation policies.","[Thaker, Jagadish] Massey Univ, Sch Commun Journalism & Mkt Manawatu, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Howe, Peter] Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, Quinney Coll Nat Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Leiserowitz, Anthony] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Maibach, Edward] George Mason Univ, Dept Commun, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Massey University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Yale University; George Mason University,"Thaker, J (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Sch Commun Journalism & Mkt Manawatu, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",j.thaker@massey.ac.nz,"Leiserowitz, Anthony/HGB-4208-2022; Leiserowitz, Anthony/ABE-6529-2020; Thaker, Jagadish/AAU-4301-2020","Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Thaker, Jagadish/0000-0003-4589-7512",Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation; Rice Family Foundation,Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation; Rice Family Foundation,This work was supported by the Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation and the Rice Family Foundation.,,77,30,30,6,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

Design/methodology/approach - The study was based on a cross-sectional survey of 296 sample households selected from three districts in east Ethiopia. Data were collected with the aid of a semi-structured questionnaire and review of literature, documents and databases. Findings - The study provides empirical evidence that majority of farmers in the study area are aware of climate change patterns and their adverse effect on income, food security, diversity, forest resources, food prices and crop and livestock diseases. In response to these adverse effects, major adaptation strategies used by farmers include cultivating different crops, planting different crop varieties, changing planting dates, use of soil and water conservation techniques, conservation agriculture practices and engaging in non-farm income activities. Choice of adaptation strategies are influenced by gender of household head, household size, farm size, distance from market and number of farm plots. Practical implications - The study suggests that developing more effective climate change adaptation strategies need support from the government. Such an effort needs provision of the necessary resources such as credit, information and extension services on climate change adaptation strategies and technologies, and investing in climate smart and resilient projects. Originality/value - The study adopts multivariate probit model that models farmers' simultaneous adaptation choice behavior which has been rarely addressed by previous researches.","[Tesfaye, Wondimagegn] Haramaya Univ, Sch Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Seifu, Lemma] Haramaya Univ, Agr Econ & Stat, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia",Haramaya University; Haramaya University,"Tesfaye, W (corresponding author), Haramaya Univ, Sch Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.",wondie22@gmail.com,,,,,,,66,62,65,2,98,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

In the case of small island developing states (SIDS), the successful development, implementation and evaluation of national-level adaptation policies are especially important because of their disproportionate vulnerability. The status of adaptation policies in these countries, however, is poorly understood and documented, particularly for the Atlantic, Indian Oceans, Mediterranean and South China Seas (AIMS) region. This is so largely because of minimal mainstream research interest in these small nations. This paper helps fill this gap. It develops an Adaptation Policy Assessment Framework that facilitates a rapid qualitative assessment of countries' national adaptation policies. It applies the framework to seven representative policies across six of the nine SIDS in the AIMS region-Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Maldives, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles and Singapore. It finds that countries are mostly successful in identifying climate and climate-related vulnerabilities and linking associated risks to other national development priorities such as poverty reduction. Countries, however, struggle with establishing and maintaining systems to review and improve adaptation interventions, which is not entirely unique to them or their circumstances. This paper's findings provide critical points of reflection for countries preparing and revising their National Adaptation Plans in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. They also contribute to a broader understanding of the complexities of climate policy development in small jurisdictions.","[Robinson, Stacy-ann] Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Mayflower Hill Dr, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Bouton, Emma; Dolan, Mara; Meakem, Allison; Messer, Anna; Lefond, Ian; Roberts, J.

This paper presents the findings of a survey of 1532 Australian consumers and how they might respond to a food company's climate adaptation strategy. Three respondent archetypes, 'Eco-warriors' (n = 557), 'Undecideds' (n = 600) and 'Abdicators' (n = 375), were identified based on their perceptions of risks associated with climate change and their attitudes towards climate adaptation. Further analysis was carried out to understand how each group of respondents would respond to adaptation strategies employed by food companies. Based on the findings of this study, two main challenges are presented for food value chains: (1) translating consumer needs and preferences to niche opportunities arising from adaptation and (2) understanding how best to communicate adaptation benefits based on varying attitudes and information needs. By addressing these challenges, synergies between adaptation goals and competitive strategies in food value chains may be achieved.","[Lim-Camacho, Lilly] CSIRO Land & Water, 1 Technol Court, Pullenvale, Qld 4069, Australia; [Ariyawardana, Anoma; Somogyi, Simon] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia; [Lewis, Gemma K.] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Newnham Dr, Newnham, Tas 7250, Australia; [Crimp, Steven J.] CSIRO Agr, Clunies Ross St, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia; [Somogyi, Simon] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Business & Social Sci, Fac Agr, 6299 South St, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Ridoutt, Brad] CSIRO Agr, Bayview Ave, Clayton, Vic 3169, Australia; [Howden, Stuart Mark] Australian Natl Univ, Climate Change Inst, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Queensland; University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Dalhousie University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University,"Lim-Camacho, L (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, 1 Technol Court, Pullenvale, Qld 4069, Australia.",lilly.lim-camacho@csiro.au,"Lim-Camacho, Lilly/A-7502-2015; Howden, Stuart M/C-1138-2008; Crimp, Steven J/D-6995-2011; Ridoutt, Bradley George/D-3329-2011; Ariyawardana, Anoma/D-3585-2013","Lim-Camacho, Lilly/0000-0002-4897-1186; Howden, Stuart M/0000-0002-0386-9671; Crimp, Steven J/0000-0003-4068-573X; Ridoutt, Bradley George/0000-0001-7352-0427; Ariyawardana, Anoma/0000-0003-0947-9559; Lewis, Gemma/0000-0003-1195-024X; Somogyi, Simon/0000-0001-8558-1630",Australian Government Department of Agriculture 'Filling the Research Gap' Funding Program [1194456-215],Australian Government Department of Agriculture 'Filling the Research Gap' Funding Program(Australian Government),"This project received funding by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture 'Filling the Research Gap' Funding Program, Grant No. 1194456-215.

However, we still know little about how and why private actors engage in climate change adaptation, and to what extent they do so in ways that improve societal resilience. This article addresses these questions. It conceptualizes private adaptation as consisting of institutional, infrastructural and community-oriented responses to climate risks. It develops a political-economic framework about the drivers of private adaptation, where private adaptation is expected to be shaped by pressures exerted by governments, investors, and civil society actors. Empirically, the framework is explored by using an original dataset on the adaptation responses of the 37 largest mining companies worldwide. We select the mining sector as mineral extraction plays a critical role in the low-carbon transition, and can, at the same time, exacerbate climate vulnerability in extracting sites. The descriptive findings suggest that the majority of the investigated companies have set up procedures to assess climate impacts on business operations, integrated climate risks in water governance, and adapted their infrastructure. The explanatory results indicate that private adaptation is mainly driven by investor pressures, and not domestic regulations and civil society. By implication, companies rarely engage in community-oriented adaptation responses by cooperating with local communities in ways that would benefit these communities. Taken together, our findings help to better understand the limitations of private adaptation and barriers to achieve transformative change, and identify how private adaptation could help improve societal resilience.","[Gustafsson, Maria-Therese] Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Univ Vagen 10 F, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Rodriguez-Morales, Jorge E.; Dellmuth, Lisa M.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ Hist & Int Relat, Int Relat, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; Stockholm University,"Gustafsson, MT (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Univ Vagen 10 F, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",Maria-therese.gustafsson@statsvet.su.se,,,,,,,72,2,2,1,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

We identify ways to foreground adaptation in carbon removal policies and project designs and to incorporate carbon removal into adaptation efforts. Attempts at aligning adaptation and carbon removalmay genuinely increase adaptive capacity or introduce new vulnerabilities, depending on policy and project design. Based upon four case studies of addressing adaptation needs with adaptive carbon removal, we find that effective implementation is likely to hinge upon predictable climate policy, innovative technical policies such as rigorous life-cycle assessment, and project design with local ecological conditions in mind. We propose three simple principles for integrating carbon removal and adaptation: identify opportunities for adaptive carbon removal in planning, prioritize adaptive value of projects, and give credit for carbon removed.","[Buck, Holly J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Buck, Holly J.] Univ Buffalo, Dept Environm & Sustainabil, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Furhman, Jay] Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Morrow, David R.] Amer Univ, Inst Carbon Removal Law & Policy, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Sanchez, Daniel L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Frances M.] ClimateWorks Fdn, San Francisco, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of Virginia; American University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Buck, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.;Buck, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Buffalo, Dept Environm & Sustainabil, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",hbuck2@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,48,8,8,4,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-3330,2590-3322,,ONE EARTH,One Earth,OCT 23,2020,3,4,,,,,425,435,,10.1016/j.oneear.2020.09.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.09.008,,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RW3JZ,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000646423500012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Events with heavy rainfall will be more intense and occur more frequently. Rain floods will increase in magnitude and also occur more frequently. Extreme flooding and heavy rain will significantly impact the sediment dynamics in rivers. In the mountain areas, floods are often associated with erosion, transport and deposition of coarse sediment along the streams. These processes are related to bed load transport and pose a hazard in addition to the elevated water discharge and have to be included in management plans for river basins. This article studies the bed load delivery from sources that contribute the most to the sediment budget in the Gudbrandsdalslagen river basin during the large magnitude floods in 2011 and 2013. More than 100 debris slides and debris flow were triggered in the tributary river Veikleai by the heavy rain and snowmelt during these floods. The volume of the contribution from debris flows and erosion and deposition of the river bed was determined by subtracting digital elevation models acquired during repeated airborne LIDAR surveys. In the river Dorja the supply of sediment from a number of debris flows caused extensive aggradation and channel changes. In their new position, lateral erosion by these channels triggered slides on the adjacent slopes. The contributing volumes of debris flows, lateral erosion, and river bed erosion and deposition were determined from the LIDAR surveys. Relations obtained from studies of sediment transport in modern glacier rivers were used to obtain estimates of the ratio of bed load versus suspended load derived from the Pleistocene moraine deposits. Several monitoring stations using conventional methods for measuring bed load and suspended load recorded very large volumes of sediment delivery during both of the extreme floods. The results of the study may be used to identify necessary locations for check-dams and erosion protection works in order to adapt to climate change.","[Bogen, Jim] Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate, Dept Hydrol, Middelthuns Gate 29,POB 5091, N-0301 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate,"Bogen, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate, Dept Hydrol, Middelthuns Gate 29,POB 5091, N-0301 Oslo, Norway.",jbo.bogen@gmail.com,,,Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate,Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate(Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate),"This article is based on data collected as a part of the research project 'Klimaendringenes virkning pa Gudbrandsdalslagens sedimentbudsjett' (The impact of climate changes on the sediment budget of the river Gudbrandsdalslagen) funded by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate.

Greater effectiveness has been attributed to actions in the public sphere than to the actions of individuals. However, little is known about how climate literacy programs address the political aspects of mitigation and adaptation. The aim of this systematic literature review is to fill this gap and analyze how public-sphere actions on mitigation and adaptation are discussed in climate literacy programs in schools. Based on database searches following PRISMA guidelines we identified 75 empirical studies that met our inclusion criteria. We found that central aspects of climate policy such as the 1.5-degree limit, the IPCC reports, or climate justice are rarely addressed. Whilst responsibility for emissions is attributed to the public sphere, the debate about mitigation usually focuses on the private sphere. Climate change education does not, therefore, correspond to the climate research discourse. We show that effective mitigation and adaptation are based on public-sphere actions and thus conclude that effective climate education should discuss those public actions if it is to be effective. Hence, we propose that climate education should incorporate political literacy to educate climate-literate citizens.","[Kranz, Johanna] Res Inst Forest Ecol & Forestry Rhineland Palatin, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Impacts, D-67705 Trippstadt, Germany; [Schwichow, Martin] Univ Educ Freiburg, Dept Phys Educ, D-79117 Freiburg, Germany; [Breitenmoser, Petra] Zurich Univ Teacher Educ, Dept Primary Educ, CH-8090 Zurich, Switzerland; [Breitenmoser, Petra; Niebert, Kai] Univ Zurich, Inst Educ, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland",Freiburg University of Education; University of Freiburg; University of Zurich,"Kranz, J (corresponding author), Res Inst Forest Ecol & Forestry Rhineland Palatin, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Impacts, D-67705 Trippstadt, Germany.;Niebert, K (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Educ, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",johanna.kranz@klimawandel-rlp.de; martin.schwichow@ph-freiburg.de; petra.breitenmoser@phzh.ch; kai.niebert@uzh.ch,"Niebert, Kai/HHS-5259-2022; Breitenmoser, Petra Daniela/HIR-3824-2022","Niebert, Kai/0000-0002-7872-4688; Breitenmoser, Petra Daniela/0000-0001-8932-5052; Schwichow, Martin/0000-0001-9694-7183; Kranz, Johanna Ariane/0000-0002-6165-8004",,,,,213,5,5,13,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2022,14,7,,,,,,,4194,10.3390/su14074194,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14074194,,,44,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0K2CE,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000780600500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To partly fill this gap, this study empirically assesses the transformational adaptation to climatic hazards in two mangrove-dependent coastal fishing communities in Bangladesh: Mathurapur near the Sundarbans, and Batayan near Nijhum Dwip. The study uses data collected by semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and key informant interviews in 2018-2019. Results show that cyclones, floods, salinity intrusion and riverbank erosion adversely affect the communities. The study identifies five groups of transformational adaptation: system-wide (e.g., cyclone shelter), restructuring (e.g., concrete housebuilding and livelihood diversification), path-shifting (e.g., migration), innovative (e.g., technological development) and multi-scale (e.g., reforestation programmes). The study finds that transformational adaptations are more effective to avert the impacts of severe climatic hazards than the conventional ones. Effectiveness of the transformational adaptation can be improved further by reducing uncertainty in climate projections, increasing awareness, building sufficient cyclone shelters, technological innovation, relocating people from hazardous zones, enhancing coastal reforestation programme and providing more fund for the implementation of effective adaptation strategies.","[Islam, Md.

Pressing questions include: who resiliency is for, what it takes to maintain it, and the scale at which it takes place. The concept of perverse resilience, for example, proposes that resiliency for one sub-system may threaten the well-being of the overall system. In this article, I propose the related concept of perverse adaptation, where one actor or institution's adaptation to climate change in fact produces aftershocks and secondary impacts upon other groups. Drawing on ethnographic and sociolinguistic research in northern Arizona regarding artificial snowmaking at a ski resort on a sacred mountain, I elucidate resort supporters' and others' attempts to frame snowmaking as a sustainable adaptation to drought (and, implicitly, climate change). I counterpoise these framings with narratives from local activists as well as Dine (Navajo) individuals regarding the significant impacts of snowmaking on water supply and quality, sacred lands and ceremony, public health, and, ironically, carbon emissions. In so doing, I argue that we must interrogate resilience policies for their unexpected victims of adaptation.","[Dunstan, Adam] Univ North Texas, Anthropol, Denton, TX 76203 USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Dunstan, A (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Anthropol, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",adam.dunstan@unt.edu,,"Dunstan, Adam/0000-0003-4141-4296",Jacobs Research Funds; Charles Redd Center for Western Studies; David M.

Such knowledge can improve mitigation and adaptation strategies. This study addresses the limited understanding of how farmers appraise their private adaptive measures and influential factors. It uses data from structured interviews with 598 rice farmers in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Based on protection motivation theory, farmers' assessments of private adaptive measures were measured by perceived self-efficacy, perceived adaptation efficacy and perceived adaptation cost. Multiple regressions were used to understand significant factors affecting those assessments. Some demographic and socio-economic factors, belief in climate change, information and objective resources were found to influence farmers' adaptation assessments. It is shown that the sources and quality of information are particularly important. The improvement of both the accessibility and usefulness of local services (e.g. irrigation, agricultural extension, credit and health care) is deemed a necessity for successful adaptation strategies in the Mekong Delta. The paper also shows the application of PMT in measuring farmers' appraisals of private adaptive measures to climate change, thereby opening this area for further research.","[Hoa Le Dang; Li, Elton; Nuberg, Ian] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Adelaide, SA 5064, Australia; [Hoa Le Dang] Nong Lam Univ, Fac Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Bruwer, Johan] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Psychol, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia",University of Adelaide; Nong Lam University; Charles Sturt University,"Dang, HL (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Bldg 20,Room 38,Waite Campus, Adelaide, SA 5064, Australia.",danglehoa@yahoo.com; elton.li@adelaide.edu.au; ian.nuberg@adelaide.edu.au; jbruwer@csu.edu.au,"Bruwer, Johan/L-1280-2013","Bruwer, Johan/0000-0001-7568-605X; Dang, Hoa Le/0000-0002-5943-9515","AusAID; School of Agriculture, Food and Wine, the University of Adelaide","AusAID(Australian Aid (AusAID)); School of Agriculture, Food and Wine, the University of Adelaide","This paper is part of a PhD research at the University of Adelaide.

In many regions across Canada and worldwide, historical and continued injustices have worsened health among Indigenous Peoples. Global health crises such as climate change are most adversely impacting Indigenous communities, as their strong connection to the land means that even subtle changes in the environment can disproportionately affect local food and health systems. As we explore strategies for climate change preparedness and adaptation, Indigenous Peoples have a wealth of Traditional Knowledge to tackle specific climate and related health issues. If combined with digital citizen science, data collection by citizens within a community could provide relevant and timely information about specific jurisdictions. Digital devices such as smartphones, which have widespread ownership, can enable equitable participation in citizen science projects to obtain big data for mitigating and managing climate change impacts. Informed by a Two-Eyed Seeing approach, a decolonized lens to digital citizen science can advance climate change adaptation and preparedness efforts. This paper describes the 'Bridge Framework' for decolonizing digital citizen science using a case study with a subarctic Indigenous community in Saskatchewan, Canada.","[Bhawra, Jasmin] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, DEPtH Lab, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Bhawra, J (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, DEPtH Lab, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada.",jasmin.bhawra@usask.ca,,"Bhawra, Jasmin/0000-0001-9926-8442",Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),This research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship.,,67,1,1,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4698,,SOCIETIES,Societies,APR,2022,12,2,,,,,,,71,10.3390/soc12020071,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soc12020071,,,14,Sociology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Sociology,0Q9KP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000785228300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Some adaptation strategies applied in the context of developing countries, however, produce maladaptive outcomes, which are usually ignored in the planning phase of adaptation policies and programmes. This mixed methods study therefore explores adaptation strategies and the associated maladaptation outcomes of smallholder farmers in rural Ghana. The study administered questionnaire survey to 378 farmers and 41 key informants were interviewed. The major adaptation strategies of farmers included crop and livelihood diversification, agrochemicals application, and reduction in the number and size of meals. However, farmers' adaptation strategies result in maladaptation outcomes through the release of greenhouse gases, environmental degradation, and contamination of water bodies as well as resource conflicts and increasing pressure on lands, among others, which affect their capacity to respond to future climate change. Adaptation policy makers and development practitioners should prioritize the minimization of maladaptation outcomes through intensive review and modification of programmes prior to their implementation and extensive education on best practices among smallholder farmers.","[Asare-Nuamah, Peter] Univ Environm & Sustainable Dev, Somanya, Ghana; [Asare-Nuamah, Peter] Pan African Univ, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Dick-Sagoe, Christopher] Univ Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana; [Ayivor, Raymond] Univ Ghana, Accra, Ghana",University of Botswana; University of Ghana,"Asare-Nuamah, P (corresponding author), Univ Environm & Sustainable Dev, Somanya, Ghana.",pasare-nuamah@uesd.edu.gh,"DICK-SAGOE, CHRISTOPHER/J-4673-2015","DICK-SAGOE, CHRISTOPHER/0000-0001-5295-252X; ASARE-NUAMAH, PETER/0000-0002-3122-909X",African Union Commission through the Pan African University Scholarship,African Union Commission through the Pan African University Scholarship,This study was supported by the African Union Commission through the Pan African University Scholarship awarded to the first author.,,81,5,5,5,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-4645,2211-4653,,ENVIRON DEV,Environ.

However, the lack of climate-based design knowledge and techniques in existing urban landscape practice has challenged the implementation. This paper, therefore, introduced a climate-led urban landscape design method to overcome such a dilemma. This approach was results-oriented, and it adopted an integrated use of microclimate, thermal comfort, and GIS modelling and simulation tools. Through the scenarios comparison, this paper has assessed and figured out efficient landscape designs for microclimate and thermal comfort improvement in Ipoh, Malaysia. It showed that shading most determined outdoor thermal comfort, making effective street tree planting an essential measure in the tropical climate-led plan. Besides, this study found that wind did not positively influence thermal comfort due to site characteristic at a particular time, in contrast with other hot regions. In conclusion, developing climate-led landscape and greenery in urban design is a functional initiative for urban cooling and sustainable urban development. Furthermore, the application of modelling and simulation methods in urban landscape design can reduce the possibility of failure in practice, thereby promising urban efficiency in response to climate change.","[Teoh, Mei-Yee; Shinozaki, Michihiko] Shibaura Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Tokyo, Japan; [Saito, Kei] Tokyo City Univ, Fac Urban Life Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Said, Ismail] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Johor Baharu, Malaysia",Shibaura Institute of Technology; Tokyo City University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Teoh, MY (corresponding author), Shibaura Inst Technol, Koto Ku, 07R32,3-7-5 Toyosu, Tokyo 1358548, Japan.",na18504@shibaura-it.ac.jp,,"Saito, Kei/0000-0002-6534-052X; Shinozaki, Michihiko/0000-0002-5825-1342; TEOH, MEI YEE/0000-0003-2418-5962; Said, Ismail/0000-0003-0732-8757",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [19K04779]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19K04779] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) under Grant [19K04779];Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [19K04779];,,66,1,1,10,44,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1346-7581,1347-2852,,J ASIAN ARCHIT BUILD,J.

Adaptation is seen as a necessary means of addressing these inevitable climate change effects, some of which are projected to bring more frequent and severe precipitation resulting in floods. This threat of floods reinforced by rapid urbanization, resulting in urban flooding has become a looming threat to road transportation which disproportionally affects developing countries. There is an urgent need to adapt transport infrastructure to the anticipated climate change effects to minimize human as well as economic losses. In this paper, a consolidated review of literature on road transport-related climate change adaptation measures adopted across different countries around the world has been done, followed by the identification of barriers and adaptation challenges in developing countries such as India. Further, a novel methodological approach has been proposed for shaping adaptation policies in developing countries. It is aimed to enhance the resilience of transportation system specifically against urban flooding induced by climate change, reduce its impacts and strengthen the adaptive capacity of the system.","[Vajjarapu, Harsha; Verma, Ashish] Indian Inst Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Gulzar, Saqib] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi, India",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Vajjarapu, H; Verma, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.;Gulzar, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi, India.",vajjarapu06@gmail.com; ashishv@iisc.ac.in; saqibgulzarbhat@gmail.com,,"VERMA, ASHISH/0000-0002-2350-9681; Vajjarapu, Harsha/0000-0003-4214-2261",Indo-Norway research project Norges Research Council - Research Council of Norway [ITEN-001],Indo-Norway research project Norges Research Council - Research Council of Norway,"The authors acknowledge the opportunity to present the research work that forms the basis of this article at the 12th Transportation Planning and Implementation Methodologies for Developing Countries (TPMDC) Conference held at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai (India) from 19 to 21 December, 2016.

A livelihoods approach better enables an understanding of how employment in this sector is embedded in other social, cultural, economic, political and ecological structures and processes that shape gender inequities and how these might be reduced. We focus on four thematic areas - markets and migration, capabilities and well-being, networks and identities, governance and rights - as analytical entry points. These also provide a framework to identify research gaps and generate a comparative understanding of the impact of development processes and socioecological changes, including issues of climate change, adaptation and resilience, on gendered employment.

But, local climate adaptation planning is in its infancy. Early on, cities must decide whether to take a narrow-scope approach focused solely on reducing risks from climate impacts or to take a broad-scope approach embedding adaptation planning within wider ranging community concerns. They also must decide whether or not to formally involve their planning agency in adaptation planning. We used content analysis methods to assess a national sample of United States municipal plans. We find that cities with plans with a narrow-scope approach, focused on reducing risks, perform better in terms of plan integration and including more land use policies that can steer development out of hazardous areas.

Adaptive governance is an approach that promises to reduce uncertainty by improving the knowledge base for decision making. As uncertainty is an inherent feature of climate adaptation, adaptive governance seems to be a promising approach for improving climate adaptation governance. However, the adaptive governance literature has so far paid little attention to decision-making tools and methods, and the literature on the governance of adaptation is in its infancy in this regard. We argue that climate adaptation governance would benefit from systematic and yet flexible decision-making tools and methods such as participatory multicriteria methods for the evaluation of adaptation options, and that these methods can be linked to key adaptive governance principles.

Visitors to these such destinations respond through recreation substitution, altering when, where, and how they participate in outdoor pursuits. Understanding predictors of recreation substitution is important for destinations considering how to best adapt to climate change. Using visitor-intercept data (n = 1,398) we explored different visitor segments' intent to utilize recreation substitution in response to changing environmental conditions. Visitor segments characterized by low trip anticipation or a long travel distance were most likely to cancel their trips or travel elsewhere in pursuit of ideal recreation conditions. Spatial substitution was lower among visitors with higher degrees of destination loyalty, highlighting the value of communication strategies that foster connections to place. Targeted marketing to retain visitor segments likely to cancel trips, may minimize negative impacts of climate change on travel behavior.","[McCreary, Allie] Western Kentucky Univ, Sch Kinesiol Recreat & Sport, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA; [Seekamp, Erin; Larson, Lincoln R.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Raleigh, NC USA; [Smith, Jordan] Utah State Univ, Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Davenport, Mae A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",Western Kentucky University; North Carolina State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"McCreary, A (corresponding author), Western Kentucky Univ, Sch Kinesiol Recreat & Sport, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA.",allie.mccreary@wku.edu,"Smith, Jordan/GVU-3480-2022","Larson, Lincoln/0000-0001-9591-1269; McCreary, Allie/0000-0003-2332-3999; Seekamp, Erin/0000-0001-5082-1921","Minnesota Sea Grant, University of Minnesota [NA14OAR4170080]","Minnesota Sea Grant, University of Minnesota","This work was supported by Minnesota Sea Grant, University of Minnesota [grant number NA14OAR4170080].",,61,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2156-8316,2156-8324,,TOUR PLAN DEV,Tour.

Working with three African American communities on Marylands Eastern Shore, we systematically elicit local cultural knowledge on climate change and connect it with a scientific vulnerability framework. The results of this study show that: a given socialecological factor can substantially differ in the way in which it affects local vulnerability, even among communities with similar demographics and climate-related risks; and social and political isolation inhibits access to sources of adaptive capacity, thereby exacerbating local vulnerability.

Yet the possibility of abrupt climate change triggered by human perturbation of the climate system is used to support the position of both those who urge stronger and earlier mitigative action than is currently being contemplated and those who argue that the unknowns in the Earth system are too large to justify such early action. This paper explores the question of abrupt climate change in terms of its potential implications for society, focusing on the UK and northwest Europe in particular. The nature of abrupt climate change and the different ways in which it has been defined and perceived are examined. Using the example of the collapse of the thermohaline circulation (THC), the suggested implications for society of abrupt climate change are reviewed; previous work has been largely speculative and has generally considered the implications only from economic and ecological perspectives. Some observations about the implications from a more social and behavioural science perspective are made. If abrupt climate change simply implies changes in the occurrence or intensity of extreme weather events, or an accelerated unidirectional change in climate, the design of adaptation to climate change can proceed within the existing paradigm, with appropriate adjustments. Limits to adaptation in some sectors or regions may be reached, and the costs of appropriate adaptive behaviour may be large, but strategy can develop on the basis of a predicted long-term unidirectional change in climate. It would be more challenging, however, if abrupt climate change implied a directional change in climate, as, for example, may well occur in northwest Europe following a collapse of the THC. There are two fundamental problems for society associated with such an outcome: first, the future changes in climate currently being anticipated and prepared for may reverse and, second, the probability of such a scenario occurring remains fundamentally unknown. The implications of both problems for climate policy and for decision making have not been researched. It is premature to argue therefore that abrupt climate change-in the sense referred to here-imposes unacceptable costs on society or the world economy, represents a catastrophic impact of climate change or constitutes a dangerous change in climate that should be avoided at all reasonable cost. We conclude by examining the implications of this contention for future research and policy formation.","Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Hulme, M (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,"Hulme, Mike/F-9012-2010","Hulme, Mike/0000-0002-1273-7662",,,,,51,48,49,2,88,ROYAL SOC LONDON,LONDON,"6 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-503X,,,PHILOS T ROY SOC A,Philos.

Such studies are the next logical step in wheat climate change adaptation research, and they will require the evaluation of large numbers of genotypes. For practical reasons the preliminary studies are most likely to be conducted in controlled environments. There have been concerns that the root restriction related to container-grown plants can influence (1) the response to eCO(2), (2) the detection of genotypic variability for various traits of interest, and (3) the ability to find the genotypes most responsive to eCO(2). In the present study we evaluated two sizes of container - 1.4L pots and 7.5L columns - side-by side in a glasshouse environment and found that for 14 of 23 traits observed environment effects (ambient CO2, eCO(2) or eCO(2) and high temperature) were not consistent between plants grown in pots and in columns. More importantly, of the 21 traits showing genotypic variability, only 8 showed consistent genotype differences and rankings across both container types. Statistical analyses conducted separately for plants grown in pots or in columns showed different cultivars as being the most responsive to elevated CO2 and would thus, have led to different conclusions. This study is intended as a message of caution to controlled environment experimenters: using small containers can artificially create conditions that could either hide or overly express genotypic variability in some traits in response to eCO(2) compared with what might be expected in larger containers.","[Bourgault, Maryse; James, Andrew T.] CSIRO Agr Flagship, Queensland Biosci Precinct, 306 Carmody Rd, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Dreccer, M.

The objects contributed to adaptation measures by convening stakeholders, translating viewpoints and initiating collaborations.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviewed the literature to examine NELD and looked into currently available methodologies and their limitations. It reviewed governmental disaster reports and plans and interviewed with communities to understand NELD in each country's context. Findings - This paper indicates that NELDs are not sufficiently reported in the countries studied. Underestimation of NELD may lead to limited outcomes in disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA). NELD should be measured and integrated into decision-making, through capacity-building from local to national level. Research limitations/implications - This paper is based on the literature review and stakeholder consultations in the study countries. The results are specific to these countries. Readers may find them applicable to other country situations. Practical implications - NELD-related information is directly relevant for preparing countries to achieve their sustainable development, CCA and DRR objectives as suggested by the recent international frameworks such as sustainable development goals (SDGs), Paris Agreement and Sendai Framework for DRR. Social implications - This paper identifies several NELD indicators related to societal well-being in the study countries and beyond, and addressing them will have positive impact on the society. Originality/value - Addressing NELD is a recent topic under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and nothing much has been done on how countries can address NELD in their developmental, CCA and DRR approaches. This paper identifies the importance of integrating NELD into decision-making and the ways forward to researchers, governments and policymakers for addressing NELD.","[Chiba, Yohei; Shaw, Rajib; Prabhakar, Sivapuram] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Nat Resources & Ecosyst Serv Area, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Chiba, Yohei] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan",Kyoto University,"Chiba, Y (corresponding author), Inst Global Environm Strategies, Nat Resources & Ecosyst Serv Area, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan.;Chiba, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan.",y-chiba@iges.or.jp,"Chiba, Yohei/GWU-9847-2022; Shaw, Rajib/AAI-4834-2020","Shaw, Rajib/0000-0003-3153-1800",,,,,85,10,10,2,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Traditional knowledge (TK) plays a pivotal role in improving the adaptive capacity of such farmers to cope with these stressors. In India, most of the policies aiming to improve farmers' adaptive capacity are based on a top-down approach and barely consider farmers' TK. Policies can be made more inclusive by mainstreaming stakeholders' perspectives, an approach termed as knowledge co-production. Our study uses a knowledge co-production framework to (i) assess the current state of emphasis on TK and knowledge co-production processes in Indian policies on agricultural adaptation to climate change and associated environmental stressors, (ii) understand the status of TK-led knowledge co-production at the practice level, and (iii) assess the successes and gaps in incorporating TK in agricultural adaptation at the policy and practice levels to manage these stressors. Based on a systematic literature review, we found that despite emphasis on integration of TK, no Indian policy was successful in terms of stakeholder participation and in covering various dimensions of knowledge co-production. Most of the policies covered either two (knowledge gathering and application) or three (gathering, integration and application) dimensions. The term TK was also not clearly defined and it was unclear how to mainstream it into the process for successful outcomes. Co-production process was adjudged to be fairly successful at the practice level in some of the sectors (e.g., management of soil and water resources) where most of the dimensions were covered and stakeholders participated in various steps of co-production. There were significant differences in the success of co-production within (e.g., crop varieties) and between (e.g., crop and natural resource management) the sectors. We found a considerable gap at policy and practice levels on success of knowledge co-production. Insights from the study could help policy-makers to improve policies for the agricultural sector to better adapt to climate change and associated environmental stressors through the recognition and integration of farmers' TK.","[Singh, Ranjay K.; Zander, Kerstin K.] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Singh, Ranjay K.; Singh, Anshuman; Kumar, Arvind] Cent Soil Salin Res Inst, ICAR, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India; [Mathew, Supriya] Charles Darwin Univ, Menzies Sch Hlth Res, Darwin, NT, Australia",Charles Darwin University; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Soil Salinity Research Institute; Charles Darwin University; Menzies School of Health Research,"Singh, RK (corresponding author), Cent Soil Salin Res Inst, ICAR, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India.",ranjaysingh_jbp@rediffmail.com; anshumaniari@gmail.com; Kerstin.Zander@cdu.edu.au; supriya.mathew@menzies.edu.au; arvind.kumar2@icar.gov.in,"KUMAR, ARVIND/AAL-7845-2021; KUMAR, ARVIND/AAM-1553-2021; Zander, Kerstin/M-2888-2013","KUMAR, ARVIND/0000-0002-8162-1225; Zander, Kerstin/0000-0002-2237-1801","Department of Education, Government of Australia [BR14-003378]; ICAR-Central Soil Salinity, Karnal, Haryana [12-12/2015-IC-CG]","Department of Education, Government of Australia; ICAR-Central Soil Salinity, Karnal, Haryana","This article is dedicated to father of first author who passed away during the completion of this research work.

The institutional assessment approach employed is potentially useful for identifying adaptation policy implications in planning systems and is of relevance to ogoing research into local level adaptation. & x6458;(sic) (sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)& x6c14;(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)& x7ebf;?(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic).

In the United States, managed retreat is often sponsored by governments through acquiring properties in the aftermath of a major disaster event. This study empirically examined the institutional factors that influence government buyouts of floodplain properties across US counties, with a particular focus on local fiscal conditions and existing flood management practices. The empirical analysis drew on a nationwide panel data set of buyout projects funded through the federal Hazard Mitigation Grant Program over the period 1990-2016. Using a double-hurdle model, the authors found that counties with more property tax revenues and a lower fiscal reliance on property taxes have more postflood buyouts. Results also indicate a negative impact of flood insurance take-up rates and levee protection on a county's buyouts of flood-prone properties. These findings shed new light on the challenges for government buyouts and possible conflicts among different policy instruments in flood risk management.

The effects of these challenges are increasing surface runoff and insufficient drainage capacities, resulting in flooding, pollution and degradation of ecological and biological systems. Compared with traditional flood defence-oriented approaches, the concept of resilience enhances overall community capacity with regard to risk management through hazard and vulnerability assessment, and implementation of technical and non-technical adaptation measures. Fredrikstad, like many municipalities in Norway, faces significant water-related challenges; however, unlike many other municipalities, Fredrikstad has taken proactive action by introducing stormwater management into urban planning and development, guiding public and private sectors and end users to take integrated stormwater management measures through the implementation of a municipal master plan (2008-2028). This paper presents a multilevel approach to enhance municipal flood resilience from strategies to practices. The Fredrikstad case study could provide examples of political implementation and recommendations for other municipalities in Norway and worldwide for adaptation to climate change and urbanisation.","[Nie, Linmei] SINTEF Bldg & Infrastruct, Oslo, Norway; [Nie, Linmei] North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China",SINTEF; North China University of Water Resources & Electric Power,"Nie, LM (corresponding author), SINTEF Bldg & Infrastruct, Oslo, Norway.;Nie, LM (corresponding author), North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China.",,,,Research Council of Norway through the Building and Infrastructure Vulnerability and Adaptive Capacity to Climate Change (BIVUAC) project,Research Council of Norway through the Building and Infrastructure Vulnerability and Adaptive Capacity to Climate Change (BIVUAC) project,"The study presented in this paper was financially supported by the Research Council of Norway through the Building and Infrastructure Vulnerability and Adaptive Capacity to Climate Change (BIVUAC) project (July 2010 to June 2013).

Flood drainage systems are infrastructures essential in urban areas to control floods, which include retention ponds that can be used as innovative solutions adapted to climate changes and smart water grids to produce energy in a near future and to improve the drainage system elasticity. A catchment-scale water/energy management model is used for designing solutions by defining the characteristics of the urban area and the hydropower converters. The study area is based on AlcA cent ntara zone, in a district of Lisbon, a specific down-town zone close to the Tagus river, which has the backwater sea tidal influence. A solution based on the catchment of this area for extreme values of runoff induced by a significant climate changes event in these last years is analysed and then optimized in terms of energy production for different characteristic parameters. Finally, results are shown and discussed to reveal the most suitable solutions.","[Ramos, Helena M.] Univ Tecn Lisboa, CEHIDRO, Inst Super Tecn, Dept Civil Engn, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Teyssier, Charlotte] Engn Sch Cent Nantes, F-44321 Nantes 3, France; [Amparo Lopez-Jimenez, P.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Hydraul Engn & Environm Dept, Valencia 46022, Spain",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Nantes Universite; Ecole Centrale de Nantes; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Ramos, HM (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Lisboa, CEHIDRO, Inst Super Tecn, Dept Civil Engn, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",hr@civil.ist.utl.pt; palopez@gmmf.upv.es,"Ramos, Helena M./AAL-6836-2021; López-Jiménez, Petra Amparo/H-9943-2015; Ramos, Helena M/M-6098-2013; López-Jiménez, P.

We design three scenarios based on socioeconomic development and simulated the corresponding structure change of land use according to the three scenarios with different parameters. Then we simulate the different emission of CO2 under different scenarios based on the simulation results of structure change of land use. At last, we choose the most suitable scenario that could control the emission of CO2 best and obtain the relatively better land use structure change for adaption of climate change.

The alternative to the financially costly and practically impossible expansion of the monitoring network is the development of hydrological research stations and the implementation of new methods for calculating streamflow characteristics based on mathematical modeling. The data of the Kolyma Water-Balance Station, the first research basin in the world in a permafrost environment (1948-1997), and the process-based hydrological model Hydrograph are applied to simulate streamflow hydrographs in remote mountainous permafrost basins. The satisfactory results confirm that mathematical modeling may substitute or replace statistical approaches in the conditions of extreme data insufficiency. The improvement of the models in a changing climate requires the renewal of historical observations at currently abandoned research stations in Russian permafrost regions.

In this paper we assess if targeted investments in public data and information infrastructure can reduce entry points for political interference. We present a case study on Guatemala in which fertilizer distribution was accompanied by an effort of open data provision and transparency under the Zero Hunger Pact. For this case study, we used a mixed-method approach. We show that political interference was a significant determinant of fertilizer distribution in the 2012-2015 election period and to analyze the role that information and data played with this regard.

However, the projected future design rainfall intensity varies greatly depending on which climate model is applied. In this study, future rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves are projected using various combinations of climate models. Future Ensemble Average (FEA) is calculated using a total of 16 design rainfall intensity ensembles, and uncertainty of FEA is quantified using the coefficient of variation of ensembles. The FEA and its uncertainty vary widely depending on how the climate model combination is constructed, and the uncertainty of the FEA depends heavily on the inclusion of specific climate model combinations at each site. In other words, we found that unconditionally using many ensemble members did not help to reduce the uncertainty of future IDF curves. Finally, a method for constructing ensemble members that reduces the uncertainty of future IDF curves is proposed, which will contribute to minimizing confusion among policy makers in developing climate change adaptation policies.","[Kim, Kyungmin; Choi, Jeonghyeon] Pukyong Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst Sci, Environm Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Lee, Okjeong] Pukyong Natl Univ, Inst Environm Res, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Cha, Dong-Hyun] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Kim, Sangdan] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea",Pukyong National University; Pukyong National University; Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Pukyong National University,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea.",kmin1392@nate.com; jeonghyeon202@naver.com; lover1804@nate.com; dhcha@unist.ac.kr; skim@pknu.ac.kr,"Cha, Dong-Hyun/F-4901-2015","Cha, Dong-Hyun/0000-0001-5053-6741; Lee, Okjeong/0000-0001-5442-7024; Choi, Jeonghyeon/0000-0003-4803-654X",Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute [2016000200002],Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute,"This research was funded by Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute, grant number 2016000200002.",,66,7,7,3,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,JAN,2020,11,1,,,,,,,22,10.3390/atmos11010022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11010022,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,KQ3KU,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000516826200022,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a case study, we estimated impacts of climate change on potential grain maize yield up to the time horizon 2036-2065 for three climatic regions in Switzerland using - for the first time - three fundamentally different impact modelling approaches: a process-based, a statistical and an expert-based approach. The aim was to quantify uncertainties originating from climate model chains, downscaling weather generator choice, and impact model parameterization. We find that while estimated climate impacts on yields are subject to large uncertainties originating from both climate model chains and impact model approaches, estimates of changes in cropspecific climate limitations are less ambiguous. We conclude that by subtracting the layer of uncertainty related to the aggregation of different climate influences on yield estimates and by focusing on estimated changes in climate limitations, more decision-relevant information can be provided to support crop-specific adaptation planning.

Current shortcomings in involving an adequate number of scientists from developing countries and to propose approaches to address this issue have been addressed in this paper. Implications of the involvement to climate change adaptation and mitigation research have been discussed at length. Scientific output of scientists is an important indicator of their career growth and also significant motivator for enhancing participation in IPCC assessment process. Impact of involvement of scientists in IPCC in terms of their scientific output has been assessed. We have made a statistical analysis of the origin of experts in the past assessment reports to reflect the participation. Scientific output in the form of number of peer reviewed papers published has been obtained and statistical t-test carried out for the significant change.

Despite the potential for synergies, aligning SDG and climate adaptation efforts is inhibited by an inadequate understanding of the complex relationship between SDG targets and adaptation to impacts of climate change. Here we propose a framework to conceptualise how ecosystems and socio-economic sectors mediate this relationship, which provides a more nuanced understanding of the impacts of climate change on all 169 SDG targets. Global application of the framework reveals that adaptation of wetlands, rivers, cropland, construction, water, electricity, and housing in the most vulnerable countries is required to safeguard achievement of 68% of SDG targets from near-term climate risk by 2030. We discuss how our framework can help align National Adaptation Plans with SDG targets, thus ensuring that adaptation advances, rather than detracts from, sustainable development. Without targeted climate adaptation, impacts of climate change threaten achievement of all 169 SDG targets. Fuldauer et al. provide an actionable framework to assess these impacts and help systematically align national adaptation plans with the SDGs.","[Fuldauer, Lena I.; Thacker, Scott; Haggis, Robyn A.; Hall, Jim W.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Fuso-Nerini, Francesco] KTH Royal Inst Technol, KTH Climate Act Ctr, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Fuso-Nerini, Francesco] KTH Royal Inst Technol, KTH Div Energy Syst, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Nicholls, Robert J.] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of Oxford; Royal Institute of Technology; Royal Institute of Technology; University of East Anglia,"Fuldauer, LI (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",lenafuldauer@gmail.com,,"Fuldauer, Lena I./0000-0002-2113-3334; Hall, Jim W/0000-0002-2024-9191; Fuso Nerini, Francesco/0000-0002-4770-4051","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N509711/1, EP/N017064/1]",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"We appreciate the contributions of the Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council by grants (L.I.F.), EP/N509711/1 (L.I.F.), and EP/N017064/1 (J.W.H).

Future projections indicate that additional change is expected in the coming decades, forcing individuals and communities to respond and adapt. Current research efforts typically examine climate change effects and possible adaptations but fail to integrate agriculture and ecosystems. This failure to jointly consider these systems and associated externalities may underestimate climate change impacts or cause adaptation implementation surprises, such as causing adaptation status of some groups or ecosystems to be worsened. This work describes and motivates reasons why ecosystems and agriculture adaptation require an integrated analytical approach. Synthesis of current literature and examples from Texas are used to explain concepts and current challenges. Texas is chosen because of its high agricultural output that is produced in close interrelationship with the surrounding semi-arid ecosystem. We conclude that future effect and adaptation analyses would be wise to jointly consider ecosystems and agriculture. Existing paradigms and useful methodology can be transplanted from the sustainable agriculture and ecosystem service literature to explore alternatives for climate adaptation and incentivization of private agriculturalists and consumers. Researchers are encouraged to adopt integrated modeling as a means to avoid implementation challenges and surprises when formulating and implementing adaptation.","[Thayer, Anastasia W.; Vargas, Aurora; McCarl, Bruce A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Castellanos, Adrian A.; Winemiller, Kirk O.; Lacher, Thomas E.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Lafon, Charles W.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Roelke, Daniel L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77554 USA; [Lacher, Thomas E.] Texas A&M Univ, Ctr Coffee Res & Educ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Thayer, AW (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",anastasia.thayer@usu.edu; avarga5@tamu.edu; acastellanos@tamu.edu; clafon@geog.tamu.edu; mccarl@tamu.edu; droelke@tamu.edu; k-winemiller@tamu.edu; tlacher@tamu.edu,"McCarl, Bruce A/E-9445-2011; Roelke, Daniel L/B-5766-2008","Roelke, Daniel L/0000-0002-3166-3793; Castellanos, Adrian/0000-0002-3412-0487; /0000-0002-3912-7047","Texas A&M Grand Challenges Proposal Competition Building Climate Resilience: Seeking Sustainable Solutions for Water, Agriculture and Biodiversity in Arid Regions","Texas A&M Grand Challenges Proposal Competition Building Climate Resilience: Seeking Sustainable Solutions for Water, Agriculture and Biodiversity in Arid Regions","This research was funded by the Texas A&M Grand Challenges Proposal Competition Building Climate Resilience: Seeking Sustainable Solutions for Water, Agriculture and Biodiversity in Arid Regions.",,170,9,11,24,84,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,JAN,2020,8,1,,,,,,,10,10.3390/cli8010010,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli8010010,,,19,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,KL6CT,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000513510000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Smart-POD is a unique and innovative research project which provides an alternative to traditional classroom design. It proposes a rapid deployment building solution, temporary or permanent in its use, modular in design, flexible in set-up and self-sustaining in use, requiring minimal site preparation, and meeting all its energy demands from renewable energy sources. Its feasibility was tested by a design case study which investigated climatic adaptability based on the proposed approach. This approach uniquely combines balancing of energy demand and supply using renewable technologies and a bespoke low temperature thermal store. It further proposes to use an open source Building energy Management System (oBeMS) conceived in this research, to intelligently manage thermal, ventilation and humidity control strategies which adapt to the climate, season and weather in which the building is placed. The predicted performance of proposed system demonstrates potential for an effective diurnal climatic adaptability, enhanced by integrated passive design strategies, and intelligent modes of building control. The method of BIM integrated sustainable design analysis (SDA) and building management system (BMS) has also been deliberated, as a framework for exploring the integration of proposed building management system into smart building environments (SBEs).

These sources were combined with inspiration from adaptation processes in other jurisdictions and adjustments were made to fit Saipan's situation. Modifications were based on available knowledge or expertise, technical capacities, and local needs.

It argues that the overwhelming attention given to the logics of speed and urgency that underpin adaptation to climate change has restricted the capacity for geographers interested in risk and disasters to recognise distinct temporal perspectives and logics of action situated outside the open futures promoted by the concept of adaptation.

SWAT was calibrated to simulate runoff at six gauging stations within the basin. Using 1979-2008 as baseline, there is average increase in rainfall of 3.0% to 5.0%. Average rainfall in 2071-2100 is higher than 2041-2070 and 2011-2040 by 0.9% and 2.0%, respectively. Monthly runoff is projected to increase from February to August and decrease from September to January. Overall, the simulation reveals increased variability and increase of 12.0% in average annual runoff. The results give more insight into future water availability and provide quantitative data for incorporation into climate change adaptation policies for effective water resources management in the basin.","[Abubakari, Sulemana] Jiangxi Univ Engn, Fac Civil Engn, Xinyu 336600, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",,"Abubakari, S (corresponding author), Jiangxi Univ Engn, Fac Civil Engn, Xinyu 336600, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",abubakarisulemanaaz206@yahoo.com,,,,,,,57,0,0,0,0,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",2042-7808,2042-7816,,INT J HYDROL SCI TEC,Int.

Considering the different effects of climate change in Varamin city, one of the most important livestock ecosystems in Iran, design of an adaptation pattern to climate change for livestock breeders in this region is necessary. Based on the axial coding paradigm model in qualitative research, adaptation strategies used by livestock breeders were found. The theoretical basis for the structural model in the quantitative investigation was Ajzen's theory of planned behavior. The awareness variable derived from the results of the qualitative section was added to the model. The results indicate that awareness on attitude is the greatest driver of livestock breeders' adaptive behavior in the region. Awareness, attitude, social norms, and perceived behavioral control can predict 68% of the changes in the livestock breeders' climate change-related adaptive behavior. Eventually, the information and results of this study can help authorities, financial supporters, staff, and executive experts understand the situation of livestock breeders, enabling them to develop future plans and to make a more detailed choice about regulation at the macro level. Mixed-methods research, such as that used in this study, can produce a clearer, more societally relevant understanding of how the climate is changing and the human livelihood adaptations to these changes.","[Ahmadi, Mahmood; Najafabadi, Maryam Omidi] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Econ Agr Extens & Educ, Tehran, Iran; [Motamedvaziri, Baharak] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Forest Range & Watershed Management, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Najafabadi, MO (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Econ Agr Extens & Educ, Tehran, Iran.",m98ahmadi@yahoo.com; m.omidi@srbiau.ac.ir; bmvaziri@gmail.com,"Omidi Najafabadi, Maryam/AAU-1669-2021","Omidi Najafabadi, Maryam/0000-0003-1830-7660",,,,,77,1,1,3,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Models are needed that incorporate dynamic processes within coupled economic and physical systems for decision-makers, including when to retreat from hazardous areas. This paper presents a coupled geo-economic model of beach width and property value with exogenous sea level rise. Discrete dynamic programming identifies optimal beach nourishment and managed retreat strategies. As a new contribution, we treat expected damages as costs, which demonstrates that increased damage offsets some benefits of development along hazardous coastlines. The model identifies managed retreat as preferable to beach nourishment when damages exceed a threshold. Regret associated with retreat depends on sea level rise damages and the timeframe of analysis. Considering dynamic complexity of coastal systems, as this model does, may produce climate adaptation plans that better address community needs and reduce risk over timescales of interest.","[Cutler, Emma M.; Albert, Mary R.] Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, 14 Engn Dr, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [White, Kathleen D.] Us Army Corps Engineers, Headquarters, Engn & Construct, Washington, DC 20314 USA",Dartmouth College; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,"Cutler, EM (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, 14 Engn Dr, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",emma.m.cutler.th@dartmouth.edu,,,DOE [DE-SC0014664]; Dartmouth; USACE-IWR,DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Dartmouth; USACE-IWR,"This research was supported in part by an appointment to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Research Participation Program administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education through an interagency agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

We argue that heritage sites also provide an empirical record of past successes and failures in the ways that cities and settlements have responded to environmental shocks and stresses. The scientific analysis of the relevant archaeological remains can generate hypotheses on the range of factors that facilitated or hindered resilience and influenced successful and unsuccessful urban adaptations. This knowledge, in turn, may help illuminate the drivers of urban adaptations to climate change today.

In addition, we analysed the most widely used agricultural adaptation methods in these areas. The major threat to agriculture is salinity intrusion and water scarcity, which consequently leads to a shortage of irrigation water and yield reduction. The most common applied agricultural adaptation strategies are the use of salt-tolerant varieties and the adjustment of cropping calendars, as well as the use of water-saving technologies. It was found that there are many concepts that address individual problems, but a comprehensive and integrated concept for delta regions to adapt to climate change is still missing.","[Schneider, Pia; Asch, Folkard] Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Inst Agr Sci Trop, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Schneider, P (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Inst Agr Sci Trop, Stuttgart, Germany.",p_schneider@posteo.de,"Schneider, Pia/AAL-4154-2020","Asch, Folkard/0000-0001-6589-9916",,,,,95,37,40,7,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0931-2250,1439-037X,,J AGRON CROP SCI,J.

Yet there is limited understanding of what factors instigate and facilitate this scale of change. From a social science perspective, one key question remains: to what extent do agribusinesses need social capital to plan and implement large-scale, transformational adaptation options, compared with incremental-scale adaptations? Data drawn from Australian primary industries found that those undertaking transformational change had more far-reaching information and knowledge network connections yet less extensive social links to family, friends and colleagues.

Drawing on documentary evidence and the views of civil servants and local authority officials from the English West Midlands, this article explores the process through an examination of the inclusion of climate change indicators in the recent round of Local Area Agreements (LAAs), negotiated between central government and local authorities and Local Strategic Partnerships. Considerable popularity has been accorded these indicators nationally, but there are important variations in the pattern of take up. Moreover, significant uncertainties surround the contribution of local measures to reduce CO2 emissions and the targets attached to measures to adapt to climate change are seen as undemanding. Conversely, the impending Carbon Reduction Commitment will act as a powerful incentive for public bodies to cut CO2 emissions from their estates. Although potentially contributing to greater coherence in tackling climate change, achieving collective action through LAAs will prove problematic.","[Pearce, Graham; Cooper, Stuart] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Pearce, G (corresponding author), Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",g.r.a.pearce@aston.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,11,11,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0300-3930,,,LOCAL GOV STUD,Local Gov.

Increasing climatic variability poses further challenges. Therefore, ensuring agricultural sustainability necessitates a transformation of the production system to make it more productive, inputefficient and to lower the environmental footprint. Such a transformation requires system-wide actions and considerable changes in governance, policies, and institutions. On this pretext, we examined if existing climate-smart agriculture (CSA) can enhance adaptation to and mitigation of climate change and overall food security in India. We found that CSA can substantially contribute towards climate change adaptation, mitigation, and food security. Mainstreaming CSA practices into development planning through CSVs would create mutual benefits by generating evidences based on CSAs at local level, thereby contributing to the design of local adaptation plans of action (LAPA) and further feed information into state and national action plans on climate change.

Adaptation is necessary to build resilience of cities' response to climate change. Inland, coastal and mountainous cities face different climate risks ranging from storm surges, droughts, excessive rainfall, heat waves and cold waves. The impacts also range from flooding, storm surges, water scarcity and landslides. The urgency of climate change adaptation promises to revitalize practice in urban development around which innovations in planning, institutional readiness and community resilience are crucial to successful adaptation. Being an inland city, Kampala experiences increased frequency of floods with associated impacts on health, infrastructure and human settlements. Building on early and scalable adaptation measures is paramount to enable communities, institutions, urban authorities and different actors become climate ready while addressing the inherent challenges.

Computation highlighted a general increase in thermal resources in the European continent for crop groups II and III (C3 and C4 plants adapted to high or moderate temperatures), while a decline of thermal resources for crop group I (cold adapted C3) was highlighted in the Mediterranean area. The climate variability justifies a change in the potential latitudinal limits of different groups of crops, representing a fundamental step for crop adaptation to climate change.","[Mariani, L.; Parisi, S.

Research has only recently begun to cover these topics. This paper examines climate risks, adaptation response, carbon emission, and mitigation in Asian tourism by reviewing the state-of-the-art and identifying gaps in previous research and future directions. More work has been done on East, Southeast, and South Asia than on Central, West, and North Asia, but great differences exist among needed research topics in these subregions. While some progress has been made on impact assessments of climate change and carbon emissions estimations, analysis and action remain mismatched. Often, one tourism sector is analyzed in isolation and only general suggestions are given for climate change adaptation and mitigation. This therefore highlights research that can facilitate the integrated analysis of climate change to inform policymakers and the public.","[Fang, Yan] Beijing Sport Univ, Sch Leisure Sports & Tourism, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Trupp, Alexander] Sunway Univ, Sch Hospitality & Serv Management, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ma, Siyao] Univ Arkansas, Geosci Dept, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Beijing Sport University; Sunway University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Fang, Y (corresponding author), Beijing Sport Univ, Sch Leisure Sports & Tourism, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yanfang113@126.com,,"Hess, Janto S./0000-0002-9823-9890; Trupp, Alexander/0000-0003-1093-2824",,,,,158,0,0,6,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

While projects did provide desired tangible benefits to certain groups of actors, many of the most significant contributions to resilience were related to knowledge, networks, information, and greater engagement of citizens with the state. This emphasis on the capacity to learn and reorganize provides a counterpoint to ideas around implementation and mainstreaming normally promoted within climate change adaptation practice - and, importantly, can help enrich these practices to maximize their effectiveness.

We investigate this for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) work stream on addressing loss and damage (L&D). This paper presents evidence of current engagement and expectations, from official submissions to the UNFCCC, L&D literature, and relates this to experiences from the fields of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA). Results show a degree of 'vagueness' in outlining the role of the private sector with unclear conceptual boundaries of L&D, DRR and CCA posing challenges for stakeholders. Expectation that the private sector will support the emerging L&D framework through knowledge, skills and resource, particularly in developed countries, is apparent. Further clarity on expectations and the ability to deliver by the private sector is required.","[Surminski, Swenja] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, CCCEP, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Eldridge, Jillian] Univ London, CCCEP, Dept Geog Environm & Dev Studies, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London,"Surminski, S (corresponding author), Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, CCCEP, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.surminski@lse.ac.uk; j.eldridge@geography.bbk.ac.uk,,"Surminski, Swenja/0000-0003-1270-5545",Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Munich Re; UK's Economic and Social Research Council; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Munich Re; UK's Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, as well as the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, which is funded by the UK's Economic and Social Research Council and by Munich Re.",,53,6,6,1,7,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",1758-2083,1758-2091,,INT J GLOBAL WARM,Int.

However, this is often clouded by the large range of uncertainty resulting from a long chain of modeling activities. Despite progress made to improve climate models, downscaling methods, and hydrological models, uncertainties will remain. This paper proposes a framework to propagate and quantify the uncertainty from the different sources that can be applied at the full cascade but focuses on the climate-modeling component, i.e., different climate models and emissions scenarios. This framework is based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology, which is widely used in the hydrologic community but has not been applied as such to climate impact modeling.

Studies that focus on the factors that predict urban populations' strong supports for local climate adaptation policies are still lacking. Engaging environmental and public policy behavior and recognition justice approaches, we argue people's support for urban climate policies reveal certain vulnerable communities' lack of recognition in local adaptation decision-making processes. Using the 2011 Phoenix Area Social Survey, we focus on two climate adaptation policies: 1) increasing the number of trees planted along public streets, a nature-based solution; 2) engineering new paving materials that absorb less heat, a technology-oriented infrastructure configuration to deal with rising temperatures in the Phoenix Metro Area, Arizona. We found climate change beliefs and acknowledging climate change as a threat to people's households and ways of life are the strongest predictors supporting the two suggested local climate policies. While individuals other than non-Hispanic White background and who identify themselves as liberal strongly support a nature-based solution, people who are 41 to 56 years of age support a technology-oriented infrastructure configuration. Further studies must focus on the persistent power asymmetries and divergence in regulations spurred from the state and local governments that inhibit further climate actions through urban planning and design.","[Yazar, Mahir; York, Abigail] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ USA; [Yazar, Mahir] Univ Bergen, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Climate & Energy Transformat, Dept Geog, Bergen, Norway",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Bergen,"Yazar, M (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Inst Geog, Postboks 7802, NO-5020 Bergen, Norway.",Mahir.Yazar@uib.no,"Yazar, Mahir/HPH-3673-2023",,"National Science Foundation [DEB-1026865, DEB-1637590]; Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER)",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER),"This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number DEB-1026865 and DEB-1637590, Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) .",,95,4,4,6,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,JAN,2022,41,,,,,,,,101079,10.1016/j.uclim.2021.101079,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2021.101079,,JAN 2022,10,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,0N0SG,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000782557700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, turbulence causes concentration fluctuations, influencing different atmospheric processes such as deposition, chemical reactions, formation of low-volatile vapours, formation of new aerosol particles and their growth in the atmosphere, and the effect of aerosol particles on boundary-layer meteorology. In order to analyse the connections, interactions and feedbacks relating those different processes require a deep understanding of atmospheric turbulence mechanisms, atmospheric chemistry and aerosol dynamics. All these processes will further influence air pollution and climate. The better we understand these processes and their interactions and associated feedback, the more effectively we can mitigate air pollution as well as mitigate climate forcers and adapt to climate change. We present several aspects on the importance of turbulence including how turbulence is crucial for atmospheric phenomena and feedbacks in different environments. Furthermore, we discuss how boundary-layer dynamics links to aerosols and air pollution.

We find that large-scale farmers who participate in the irrigation project value more highly regulating NCP than small-scale farmers who have not adopted such technology, while the latter hold higher values for non-material NCP related to cultural identity and traditional knowledge and experience. These findings suggest that the adoption of large-scale irrigation technology is associated with a set of values that underestimate the long-term ecological effects of agricultural intensification and neglect the relevance of traditional farming in sustaining more ecologically and culturally diverse landscapes.","[Albizua, Amaia; Pascual, Unai] Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Parque Cient, Leioa, Spain; [Pascual, Unai] Ikerbasque, Basque Sci Fdn, Maria Diaz Haro 3, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [Pascual, Unai] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Bern, Switzerland; [Corbera, Esteve] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Barcelona, Spain",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of Basque Country; Basque Foundation for Science; University of Bern; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Albizua, A (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Parque Cient, Leioa, Spain.",amaia.albizua@bc3research.org; unai.pascual@bc3research.org; Esteve.Corbera@uab.cat,"Pascual, Unai/O-7946-2019; Albizua, Amaia/AAA-6326-2019; Albizua, Amaia/D-4840-2012; Corbera, Esteve/C-5368-2015","Pascual, Unai/0000-0002-5696-236X; Albizua, Amaia/0000-0001-8381-5288; Albizua, Amaia/0000-0001-8381-5288; Corbera, Esteve/0000-0001-7970-4411",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation program [MDM-2017-0714]; European Union [264465]; Postdoctoral Training of the Education Department of the Basque Government; Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Banco de Santander-Talent Retention Programme; ICTA's Maria de Maeztu Unit of Excellence [MDM-2015-0552],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation program; European Union(European Commission); Postdoctoral Training of the Education Department of the Basque Government; Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Banco de Santander-Talent Retention Programme; ICTA's Maria de Maeztu Unit of Excellence,Amaia Albizua and Unai Pascual acknowledge support by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation program MDM-2017-0714.

The growing need for nutritious and healthy food will increase the demand for fisheries products from marine sources, whose productivity is already highly stressed by excessive fishing pressure, growing organic pollution, toxic contamination, coastal degradation and climate change. Looking towards 2050, the question is how fisheries governance, and the national and international policy and legal frameworks within which it is nested, will ensure a sustainable harvest, maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and adapt to climate change. This paper looks at global fisheries production, the state of resources, contribution to food security and governance. It describes the main changes affecting the sector, including geographical expansion, fishing capacity-building, natural variability, environmental degradation and climate change. It identifies drivers and future challenges, while suggesting how new science, policies and interventions could best address those challenges.","[Rosenberg, Andrew A.] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Garcia, Serge M.] FAO, Fisheries & Aquaculture Management Div, I-00100 Rome, Italy",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Rosenberg, AA (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",garcia.sergemichel@gmail.com; arosenberg@conservation.org,"GARCIA, Serge Michel/D-6758-2012",,,,,,49,199,209,5,105,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

A growing body of evidence suggests that coastal ecosystems natural infrastructure can play an important role in reducing the vulnerability of people and property to these impacts. To effectively inform climate adaptation planning, experts often struggle to develop relevant local and regional information at a scale that is appropriate for decision-making. In addition, institutional capacity and resource constraints often limit planners' ability to incorporate innovative, scientifically based approaches into planning. In this paper, we detail our collaborative process in two coastal California counties to account for the role of natural infrastructure in climate adaptation planning. We used an interdisciplinary team of scientists, economists, engineers, and law and policy experts and planners, and an iterative engagement process to (1) identify natural infrastructure that is geographically relevant to local jurisdictional planning units, (2) refine data and models to reflect regional processes, and (3) develop metrics likely to resonate within the local decision contexts. Using an open source decision-support tool, we demonstrated that protecting existing natural infrastructure including coastal dunes and wetlands could reduce the vulnerability of water resource-related structures, coastal populations, and farmland most exposed to coastal flooding and erosion. This information formed part of the rationale for priority climate adaptation projects the county governments are now pursuing. Our collaborative and iterative approach, as well as replicable use of an open source decision-support tool, facilitated inclusion of relevant natural infrastructure information into regional climate adaptation planning processes and products. This approach can be applied in diverse coastal climate adaptation planning contexts to locate and characterize the degree to which specific natural habitats can reduce vulnerability to sea-level rise and storms.

Implementing adaptation strategies is thus crucial to secure future agricultural production and rural livelihoods. To support effective adaptation, it is necessary to understand how farmers, as primary land-use decision-makers, perceive and respond to climate change. We conducted semi-structured interviews to examine climate change adaptation behaviour by commercial grain and wine grape farmers in a water-scarce, recently drought-stricken agricultural region of South Africa's Western Cape. Specifically, we investigated (1) how farmers perceive climate change, (2) which factors influence their adaptive behaviour and (3) which adaptation strategies they apply in their farming practices, and whether these are medium to long-term or short-term coping strategies. Through the resulting discourses, we found that most farmers have observed long-term regional changes in climate, such as changes in rainfall patterns, increasing temperatures and extreme climatic events. Farmers' adaptive behaviour is influenced by previous experience of climatic stresses and internal factors, including risk perception, perceived adaptive capacity and cognitive biases. Institutional and biophysical constraints including perceived lack of government support and soil composition are external barriers to adaptation. Most farmers have implemented adaptive strategies on their farms, including alterations to soil and crop management, such as changes of harvest and planting time, crop rotations and water conservation techniques. However, farmers have planned fewer adaptive strategies to future impacts of climate change than current implemented strategies. Current strategies are mostly technological and address direct impacts of climate stressors, although climate change impacts go beyond the farm scale into society. These findings may have important implications for future policy making and climate change adaptation in this region, given the place-specific institutional and biophysical barriers identified by farmers, and the strategic importance of the Western Cape in South African agriculture.","[Talanow, Katharina; Martin-Lopez, Berta] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Eth & Transdisciplinary Sustainabil Res, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Topp, Emmeline N.; Loos, Jacqueline] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Topp, Emmeline N.] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Agroecol, Grisebachstr 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; Leuphana University Luneburg; University of Gottingen,"Topp, EN (corresponding author), Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",emmeline.topp@uni-goettingen.de,"Martin-Lopez, Berta/R-9397-2017; Talanow, Katharina/ABE-5920-2022","Martin-Lopez, Berta/0000-0003-2622-0135; ",German Research Foundation [LO 2323/1-1],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This study is funded by the German Research Foundation (grant number DFG, LO 2323/1-1.).",,66,26,26,10,34,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,1873-1392,,J RURAL STUD,J.

Implementing an ecosystem approach can contribute to climate change adaptation by improving ecosystem resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, by providing planning strategies and tools to monitor and assess the impacts of climate change on fisheries, and by relying on precautionary, flexible, and adaptive approaches that account for the uncertainties, surprises, unpredictability, and dynamism of ecosystems in a changing climate. In this article, I provide an overview of some key considerations framing the mandate and capacity of regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to implement ecosystem approaches in the context of climate change. The article first addresses the extent to which international law of the sea, and in particular the 1995 United Nations Fish Stock Agreement, endorses and implements an ecosystem approach to fisheries for the management of straddling and highly migratory stocks. It then addresses the barriers to more effective implementation of an integrated and adaptive ecosystem approach to fisheries in transboundary settings, including the decentralized and consensus-based nature of international law, stationary visions of ecosystems, and principles of certainty and stability. This analysis is then expanded to focus on specific challenges of adapting to climate-induced changes to transboundary stocks distribution and abundance. I address preparing and planning for climate change, responsive decision-making procedures, regulation of new fisheries, jurisdictional challenges, enhancing marine resilience, and revisiting allocation agreements, highlighting legal provisions and policy developments that may support or enhance the adaptive capacity of transboundary fisheries arrangements. I conclude that, despite some supportive legal provisions and practices, structural, legal, and political barriers severely hinder the pace and the scope of required governance and management responses to climate-induced changes to transboundary stocks.","[Engler, Cecilia] Dalhousie Univ, Schulich Sch Law, Halifax, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Engler, C (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Schulich Sch Law, Halifax, NS, Canada.",,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This is a product of the Ocean Canada Partnership funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,104,11,11,1,8,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

J,"Bose, PS",,,,"Bose, Pablo S.",,,Vulnerabilities and displacements: adaptation and mitigation to climate change as a new development mantra,AREA,,,English,Article,,,,,,environmental displacement; Bangladesh; climate change; adaptation/mitigation,CARBON; POLITICS,"The past decade has witnessed significant growth across the globe of domestic and international initiatives designed to ameliorate both existing and potential impacts of climate change. The threat of altered environments and possibility of mass migrations of people have spurred intensive planning as well as the commitment of considerable resources to addressing such threats. Indeed, the primacy of climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts and planning has become so pronounced that one might argue that this is a new and pre-eminent form of development in the international arena. As with previous developmental preoccupations such as progress, modernity, gender, microcredit, participation and good governance, climate change adaptation and mitigation is today a central part of the development mantra. In this paper I examine the 'climate change turn' in development work by focusing on the case of Bangladesh, a country often discussed in both scholarly literature and popular discourse as one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the possible effects of climate change. Images of rising waters, flooded fields and displaced farmers in the region have become an iconic symbol deployed during debates on climate change both locally and globally. As a result Bangladesh has emerged as a laboratory of sorts in which a series of national-level strategic plans, projects, programmes, trust funds and financing schemes are being designed and tested in partnership with international donors and development agencies, all built around the idea of climate change and resilience. Looking specifically at some of the most marginalised communities in Bangladesh -such as char dwellers and slum populations -I question in this paper what impact these efforts to combat climate change may have, in particular the possibility of being displaced not by climate change but rather by development processes meant to ameliorate its effects.","[Bose, Pablo S.] Univ Vermont, Dept Geog, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont,"Bose, PS (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Geog, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",pbose@uvm.edu,"Bose, Pablo/T-8941-2019",,,,,,65,19,21,1,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-0894,1475-4762,,AREA,Area,JUN,2016,48,2,,,,,168,175,,10.1111/area.12178,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/area.12178,,,8,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,DV2TM,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000382774400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Assessing the impact of climate change requires handling a large amount of data in the literature comprehensively. In this study, a text-based classification method and literature mapping were used to process the massive literature and map it according to its location. A total of 39,339 Chinese academic studies and 36,584 Chinese master's and doctoral theses, from 2000 to 2022, with evidence of the impact of climate change were extracted from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database. Our results show that the literature on climate change impacts has exploded during the last decades. This indicates that increasing attention to the intensified impact of climate change in China has been paid. More importantly, by mapping the geolocation of the literature into spatial grid data, our results show that over 36.09% of the land area shows clear evidence of climate change. Those areas contribute to 89.29% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and comprise 85.06% of the population in China. Furthermore, the studies we collected on the climate change impacts showed a huge spatial heterogeneity. The hotspot areas of research were generally located in developed regions, such as the BTH urban agglomeration and Yangtze River Economic Zone, major agricultural production areas such as Shandong and Henan, and ecologically fragile regions including Yunnan, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia. Considering the imbalance spatially of the evidence of climate change can help in a better understanding of the challenges in China imposed by climate change. Appraising the evidence of climate change is of great significance for adapting to climate change, which is closely related to the natural ecosystem services and human health. This study will provide policy implications for coping with climatic events and guide future research.","[Li, Keke; Wang, Zhen] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resource & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Cai, Bofeng] Chinese Acad Environm Planning, Ctr Climate Change & Environm Policy, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhen] Huazhong Agr Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Terr Spatial Governance, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong Agricultural University,"Wang, Z (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resource & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;Cai, BF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Environm Planning, Ctr Climate Change & Environm Policy, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China.;Wang, Z (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Terr Spatial Governance, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",caibf@caep.org.cn; sinoo@mail.hzau.edu.cn,"Wang, Zhen/V-2219-2019","Wang, Zhen/0000-0002-7902-4093","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42077060, 72074154]; Startup Fund for Distinguished Professors of Huazhong Agricultural University",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Startup Fund for Distinguished Professors of Huazhong Agricultural University,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 42077060 and 72074154), and the Startup Fund for Distinguished Professors of Huazhong Agricultural University.",,54,0,0,19,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The availability and sharing of knowledge and information is a basic requirement for the successful planning of the tourism sector regarding this phenomenon. Planning adaptation in the urban tourism sector is widely regarded as a collectively-based process. However, collaborative planning is far from being the standard. This study reports the results of a Modified Delphi Approach (MDA) among experts about the future of urban tourism in a context of adaptation to climate change in Porto Metropolitan Area (Portugal), considering the outdoor thermal conditions perspective. Using an expert panel, the study gathered their opinions to analyze the degrees of responsibility of the main sectorial entities at different territorial levels, the conditions of action in the transformation agenda and the measures to be implemented in the adaptation and mitigation process - according to priority and time horizon. Two rounds were carried out to apply the methodology between January and April 2021. The first questionnaire had the participation of 47 professionals. 34 out of the 47 professionals of the 1st round participated in the second questionnaire. The evidence from different stakeholders demonstrates that there is an ambiguous process of understanding the problem, information needs, and a weak interaction between actors - resources - tasks. The effectiveness and efficiency of collaborative planning and outlined goals by 2050 for adaptation of urban tourism sector to climate change can be hampered. Experts consider the creation of structural (tangible) measures to be fundamental. Among other results, it was found that most participants consider that the intervention is dependent on the guidelines issued by the government and municipal councils when it comes to defining a proposal for adapting the urban tourism sector to climate change. Despite this, the options for more sustainable practices must be based on three axes: (i) solutions based on the energy sector in the hotel industry (e.g., energy certification, prioritization of the use of renewable energy); (ii) improvement and expansion of green infrastructure for tourist enjoyment [e.g., creation of green areas (small additional pockets), namely in the center of Porto; and pedestrianization of central areas of the city] and (iii) network participation through the collaboration of various stakeholders with relevance in tourism and urban planning.","[Lopes, Helder Silva; Remoaldo, Paula C.] Univ Minho, Dept Geog, Landscape Heritage & Terr Lab Lab2PT, ICS, Guimaraes, Portugal; [Lopes, Helder Silva; Martin-Vide, Javier] Univ Barcelona, Dept Geog, IdRA Climatol Grp, FGH, Barcelona, Spain; [Ribeiro, Vitor] CIPAF Paula Frassinetti Res Ctr, ESE Paula Frassinetti, Porto, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Vitor] Univ Minho, Dept Geog, Landscape Heritage & Terr Lab Lab2PT, CIPAF,ICS, Guimaraes, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; University of Barcelona; Universidade do Minho,"Lopes, HS (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Dept Geog, Landscape Heritage & Terr Lab Lab2PT, ICS, Guimaraes, Portugal.",htsltiago@hotmail.com; premoaldo@geografia.uminho.pt; vitor.geografia@gmail.com; jmartinvide@ub.edu,"Lopes, Hélder/ADP-8422-2022","Lopes, Hélder/0000-0002-2931-5175","FCT Portugal [SFRH/BD/129153/2017, POCI 01 0145 FEDER 007528]; FCT; FEDER; Lab2PT - Landscapes, Heritage and Territory Laboratory [ICS-120/2017]; COMPETE2020 [AUR/04509]; University of Barcelona [D-014.550]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/129153/2017] Funding Source: FCT","FCT Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER(European Commission); Lab2PT - Landscapes, Heritage and Territory Laboratory; COMPETE2020; University of Barcelona; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","This research was funded by FCT Portugal, grant number SFRH/BD/129153/2017 and Lab2PT - Landscapes, Heritage and Territory Laboratory - AUR/04509 and FCT through national funds and when applicable FEDER's co-financing, in the aim/under the scope of the new-partnership agreement PT2020 and COMPETE2020- POCI 01 0145 FEDER 007528.

We estimate present-day subsidence rates for yet unmapped and well-known hotspots (e.g., -45 cm/year in Mexico City), and compute compaction volumes at >300 aquifer-systems (up to -60 hm(3)/year at Mexico City Metropolitan Area). InSAR-derived aquifer-system compaction generally correlates well with groundwater deficits, extractions and storage changes from management reports. Semi-theoretical relationships for the whole Central Mexico and hydrological-administrative regions VII, VIII, and XIII, enable the assessment of compaction rates and volumes resulting from groundwater exploitation.

Developing countries won an increase in finance for adaptation to climate change, but their demand for developed countries to recognise 'climate justice' and compensate them for the loss and damage that climate change is causing was rebuffed.

Through an adaptive capacities framework, we examine how farmers' adaptive capacities-contextualized within institutional and environmental conditions-can influence their decision to use cover crops. We use generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the relative importance of (i) internal variables-farmers' perceived capacity to act; (ii) external or objective resources-assets and entitlements; and (iii) contextual variables-the institutional and environmental context within which adaptation occurs, as predictors of farmers' use of cover crops. Our results suggest that several objective and perceived adaptive capacities are positively associated with farmers' decisions to use cover crops, and formal institutions such as risk management subsidies are correlated with lower use of cover crops.","[Gardezi, Maaz] South Dakota State Univ, Dept Sociol & Rural Studies, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; [Arbuckle, J.

The results reveal four primary climate change issues: organizational uncertainty; greater management complexity and cost risks associated with water and energy resources, and waste outputs. No revenue opportunities were evident. The results demonstrate that while most physical impacts are manageable, the primacy of commercial and operational imperatives determine organizational responses ahead of government climate policy, and any direct climate signal to adapt.

This paper explores the thematic coverage of research on climate change policies related to rural areas, rural development, and natural resource management in Latin America. A three-tier framework is proposed to analyse the selected literature. The results show that research studies have focussed on the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from forests, and adaptations to climate change in agriculture. There is little policy research on other vulnerable sectors (e.g., water and health) and emitting sectors (e.g., energy and industry) in the context of rural development. Our analysis highlights the various research gaps that deserve increased scientific attention, including: cross-sector approaches, multi-level governance, and the stages of policy adoption, implementation and evaluation. In addition, the selected literature has a limited contribution to theoretical discussions in policy sciences.","[Locatelli, Bruno; Fallot, Abigail; Le Coq, Jean-Francois; Sabourin, Eric] CIRAD, Agr Res Dev, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Locatelli, Bruno] CIFOR, Ctr Int Forestry Res, Lima 12, Peru; [Aldunce, Paulina] Univ Chile, Dept Environm Sci & Resource Management, Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR2, Santiago 8820000, Chile; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois; Tapasco, Jeimar] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Cali 76520000, Colombia; [Sabourin, Eric] Univ Brasilia, Ctr Sustainable Dev, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",CIRAD; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); Universidad de Chile; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Universidade de Brasilia,"Locatelli, B (corresponding author), CIRAD, Agr Res Dev, F-34398 Montpellier, France.;Locatelli, B (corresponding author), CIFOR, Ctr Int Forestry Res, Lima 12, Peru.",bruno.locatelli@cirad.fr; paldunce@uchile.cl; abigail.fallot@cirad.fr; jean-francois.le_coq@cirad.fr; eric.sabourin@cirad.fr; j.tapasco@cgiar.org,"Locatelli, Bruno/C-9957-2009; Aldunce, Paulina/T-2125-2017","Locatelli, Bruno/0000-0003-2983-1644; Aldunce, Paulina/0000-0002-1159-9333; SABOURIN, Eric/0000-0002-1171-2535; Fallot, Abigail/0000-0002-7526-6917","International Climate Initiative (IKI) of German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB); Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation; CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA); CGIAR","International Climate Initiative (IKI) of German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB); Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation; CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA)(CGIAR); CGIAR(CGIAR)","The funding partners that have supported this research include the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB), the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, and the CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA) with financial support from the CGIAR Fund.

Economics matters, since it addresses the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the costs of climate change impacts, and the economic factors that motivate individuals' behaviour and the behaviour of businesses. All of these are important in understanding the barriers to meeting targets and to successful adaptation, and in thinking about how these barriers can be lifted. We discuss the relative merits of market mechanisms such as carbon taxes and cap-and-trade, the cost of including additional targets, and the issue of counting carbon embedded in imported goods. An efficient way of achieving carbon reductions is to widen the scope of carbon trading to include forestry, transport and agriculture. Energy efficiency in businesses and households and adaptation to climate change are a priority, because the benefits will be felt in the short term and at the local level.","[Hanley, Nick; Brennan, Dervla] Univ Stirling, Econ Div, Sch Management, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Hanley, N (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Econ Div, Sch Management, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",,,"Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499",,,,,29,4,4,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1755-6910,1755-6929,,EARTH ENV SCI T R SO,Earth Environ.

This study aimed to understand smallholder farmers' perceptions of climate change, adaptation strategies and adaptive capacity in the semiarid Matungulu Sub-County, Eastern Kenya. A participatory approach, using three climate roundtables, was conducted to enhance community participation and understanding of climate change issues. The study showed that farmers' perceptions concerning climate change are influenced by past experiences of weather extremes that have affected production levels and farm incomes. The farmers have made strategic responses to manage risks posed by climate change. However, they face several challenges in adaptation such as inadequate technical knowledge, low financial resources and inadequate land size. Further, the study showed that climate roundtables is a successful participatory approach that can give effective insights for smallholder farmers to understand agricultural vulnerability, climate change and their adaptation strategies.","[Kichamu, Edith Afandi; Ziro, John Safari; Palaniappan, Gomathy; Ross, Helen] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kichamu, Edith Afandi] Minist Agr, Machakos, Kenya; [Ziro, John Safari] Minist Agr, Kwale, Kenya",University of Queensland,"Kichamu, EA (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.;Kichamu, EA (corresponding author), Minist Agr, Machakos, Kenya.",edith.kichamu@uq.net.au; John.safariziro@uq.net.au; g.palaniappan@uq.edu.au; helen.ross@uq.edu.au,"Ross, Helen/B-9585-2014","Ross, Helen/0000-0003-4439-6273",University of Queensland [43369861];  [ST000ED81],University of Queensland(University of Queensland); ,The study was funded by the first author's scholarship from Australia Awards (Grant No. ST000ED81) and University of Queensland (Grant No. 43369861).,,24,3,3,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

While traditional strategies for dealing with coastal hazards have often involved the hardening or armoring of shorelines, more recent research and practice have demonstrated the value and cost-effectiveness of living shorelines and other ecosystem-based strategies for coastal protection. To explore potential relationships among geographic exposure (waterfront vs. inland), shoreline condition (armored vs. natural), and hazard concerns, we surveyed 583 waterfront and inland residents in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We found that overall concern for coastal hazards was similar across waterfront and inland residents, as well as among residents with both armored and natural shorelines. However, concern for specific hazards differed across these groups. Waterfront residents were significantly more concerned about major hurricanes and erosion than inland residents. Conversely, inland residents were more concerned with drought and flooding than waterfront residents. Among waterfront residents, specific hazard concerns were similar between residents with natural and armored shorelines with two key exceptions. Residents with armored shorelines reported higher concern for erosion and sea level rise than residents with natural shorelines. Our results suggest that armored shorelines do not necessarily alleviate concerns about coastal hazards. In the context of balancing social and ecological objectives in addressing coastal hazards or adapting to climate change, understanding the perceptions and behaviors of coastal residents is essential for conserving and protecting coastal ecosystems along residential shorelines.","[Scyphers, Steven B.; Furman, Kelsi L.; Josephs, Lauren I.; Lynskey, Rebecca; Grabowski, Jonathan H.] Northeastern Univ, Coastal Sustainabil Inst, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA; [Beck, MichaelW.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Haner, Judy] Nature Conservancy, Alabama Coastal Program, Mobile, AL 36602 USA; [Josephs, Lauren I.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Fisheries Anim & Vet Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Keeler, Andrew G.] East Carolina Univ, Dept Coastal Studies, Wanchese, NC 27981 USA; [Landry, Craig E.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Powers, Sean P.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Webb, Bret M.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Civil Engn, Mobile, AL 36688 USA",Northeastern University; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of Rhode Island; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of South Alabama; University of South Alabama,"Scyphers, SB (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Coastal Sustainabil Inst, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA.",s.scyphers@northeastern.edu; mwbeck@ucsc.edu; furman.ke@husky.neu.edu; jhaner@tnc.org; lauren_josephs2@uri.edu; lynskey.r@husky.neu.edu; keelera@ecu.edu; clandry@uga.edu; spowers@disl.org; bwebb@southalabama.edu; j.grabowski@northeastern.edu,"Webb, Bret/AAI-3634-2021","Powers, Sean/0000-0002-4770-9944; Grabowski, Jonathan/0000-0003-4711-5481",National Science Foundation's SEES Fellowship Program [OCE-1215825],National Science Foundation's SEES Fellowship Program,This work was funded by the National Science Foundation's SEES Fellowship Program (OCE-1215825).,,32,11,11,0,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2019,11,23,,,,,,,6687,10.3390/su11236687,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11236687,,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KD9MV,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000508186400159,View Full Record in Web of Science

The cases underscore the importance of nature perception for the design of the project, and the role of daily recreational users as crucial for project legitimacy. Innovative projects might seem local, but often they are embedded in larger strategies and serve to flesh out such strategies and might even change them in a longer perspective.

This approach can be used to evaluate the likelihood of crossing identified thresholds of exposure, and to evaluate alternative adaptation strategies based on their ability to reduce sensitivity to projected changes in exposure and their robustness across uncertainty in future outcomes.

Here, we adapt an innovative statistical method that combines the latest generation of climate model simulations, global obser-vations, and local observations to reduce uncertainty in local temperature projections. By taking advantage of the tight links between local and global temperature, we can derive the local implications of global constraints. The model uncertainty is reduced by 30% up to 70% at any location worldwide, allowing to substantially improve the quantification of risks associated with future climate change.

In the policy subsystem, we identify a large proclimate change coalition and a smaller anticlimate change coalition. Member beliefs between rival coalitions diverge in regard to the cause, severity, and solutions needed to address climate change adaptation and mitigation issues. Both coalitions report similar levels of individual and organizational capacity to generate and analyze information and to engage in similar activities and strategies. This article contributes to the public policy literature by applying both Policy Analytical Capacity and the Advocacy Coalition Framework and by emphasizing individual, organizational, and subsystem levels in conducting a stakeholder analysis.","[Elgin, Dallas J.; Weible, Christopher M.] Univ Colorado, Sch Publ Affairs, Denver, CO 80202 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Elgin, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Sch Publ Affairs, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",,,"Elgin, Dallas/0000-0002-7684-7270",,,,,47,57,58,2,65,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1541-132X,,,REV POLICY RES,Rev.

It is one of the key causes of mortality and morbidity, resulting in 32.5% of outpatient visits and 48.8% of under 5-year-old hospital admissions. Future climate change may impact on this risk. This study aims at estimating the impact of climate variables and health facilities on malaria prevalence in Ghana using regional data from January 2012 to May 2017. This study links data at a regional level on malaria cases with weather data to evaluate the impact that changes in weather may have on malaria prevalence in Ghana. The results of fixed-effect modelling show that the maximum temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on malaria in the context of Ghana, and rainfall with a lag of two months has a positive statistically significant impact. Adapting to climate change in Ghana requires a better understanding of the climate-malaria relationship and this paper attempts to bridge this gap.","[Oheneba-Dornyo, Theresa Valerie; Maccagnan, Anna; Taylor, Timothy] Univ Exeter Med Sch, Royal Cornwall Hosp, European Ctr Environm & Human Hlth, Truro TR1 3HD, England; [Oheneba-Dornyo, Theresa Valerie] Ctr Global Hlth Secur & Diplomacy, 123 Slater St, Ottawa, ON K1P 5H2, Canada; [Amuzu, Setor] McGill Univ, Dept Human Genet, 3640 Univ St, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C7, Canada; [Amuzu, Setor] McGill Genome Ctr, 740 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 0G1, Canada; [Maccagnan, Anna] Univ Torino, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti De Martiis, Lungo Dora Siena 100, I-10153 Turin, Italy",Royal Cornwall Hospital; McGill University; University of Turin,"Taylor, T (corresponding author), Univ Exeter Med Sch, Royal Cornwall Hosp, European Ctr Environm & Human Hlth, Truro TR1 3HD, England.",anna.maccagnan@unito.it; timothy.j.taylor@exeter.ac.uk,,,University of Exeter; Commonwealth Shared Scholarship Commission,University of Exeter; Commonwealth Shared Scholarship Commission,The study was undertaken while TVO was a Master's student supported by funding of the University of Exeter and the Commonwealth Shared Scholarship Commission.,,60,2,2,4,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1420-2026,1573-2967,,ENVIRON MODEL ASSESS,Environ.

Two-thirds believed they will be personally affected by warming waters, but only half had plans to adapt. Those with adaptation plans demonstrated fundamentally different views of human agency in this system, observing greater anthropogenic threats, but also a greater ability to control the fishery through their own actions on the water and fisheries management processes. Lack of adaptation planning was linked to the view that warming waters result from natural cycles, and the expectation that technological advancements will help buffer the industry from warming waters.","[McClenachan, Loren] Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, 5351 Mayflower Hill Dr, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Scyphers, Steven; Grabowski, Jonathan H.] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA",Colby College; Northeastern University,"McClenachan, L (corresponding author), Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, 5351 Mayflower Hill Dr, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",lemcclen@colby.edu; s.scyphers@northeastern.edu; j.grabowski@northeastern.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Grabowski, Jonathan/0000-0003-4711-5481",NOAA Climate Program Office [NA15OAR4310135]; Colby College Environmental Studies Program,NOAA Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Colby College Environmental Studies Program,"This research was supported by the NOAA Climate Program Office (Grant #NA15OAR4310135) and the Colby College Environmental Studies Program.

We found that farmers have achieved organizational resilience to extreme weather patterns during the decade to 2014 that is benign to belief in climate change; that adaptation to climate change can be anticipatory; and that social relationships in rural communities are instrumental to building organizational resilience. The implication for farmers and policy-makers is that resilience can be built by local members of rural communities in places that are familiar to them-a phenomenon we introduce as community sensegiving.

Rawls (1971) argues that principles of justice, in particular those for assigning basic rights and duties of social cooperation, should be selected from an original position as though by (imaginary) agents who do not know their position in society. This paper adapts Rawls' notion of original position and applies it to the international context required to address climate change. From this perspective it is argued the agents would endorse the current consensus not to allow global warming to exceed 2 A degrees C. They would also find that rich industrial countries, having contributed disproportionately to the causes of climate change, should reduce their emissions faster than developing countries and they should help developing countries to adopt non-carbon energy sources, to adapt to climate change, and to recover from its harms.

Less than half of respondents were concerned about climate change and sought suitable adaptation measures to alleviate its impacts. Improving information on climate change and introducing early warning systems could improve the adaptive capacity of pangasius farmers, in particularly for those farmers, who were not concerned yet. Farmers relied strongly on technical support from government agencies, but farmers in the coastal provinces did not express the need for training by these institutions.

There is a regular round of activities associated with the seasons and anything which influences operating seasons is likely to have substantial consequences for tourism businesses. Atmospheric conditions influence both whether or not people will participate as well as the quality of the experience. In marine coasts, wetland recreations may be threatened by rising sea levels but recreation in inland water bodies may be affected more by deficiencies rather than superabundance of water. Marinas and recreational boating are harmed by extremes of both high and low water, particularly the latter which is the most likely situation under global climate change. Two main groups can be considered with respect to the potential to adapt to climate change. These are the participants themselves and the businesses which cater to them.

Due to sustained heavy downpours, the summer of 2020 was the second wettest on record over Northeast Indian subcontinent since 1901. Here, we find that this orographically anchored extreme rainfall event was largely associated with the anomalous anticyclone (AAC) over the Indo-Northwest Pacific region and La Nina-induced Walker circulation intensification. The overall effect of anthropogenic forcings contributed little to the occurrence probability of this event, because the warming and wetting effects of greenhouse gases were almost negated by anthropogenic aerosols. Climate models project a prominent increasing trend of such extreme event under future greenhouse-induced warming due to increase in atmospheric water vapor and 2020-like AAC frequency. Our findings thus call for scaling up climate change adaptation efforts for increasingly extreme persistent rainfall in highly populated but low-resilience South Asian developing countries.","[Tang, Haosu; Wang, Jun; Hu, Kaiming; Huang, Gang; Wang, Ya; Tang, Bin] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East Asia, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res CMSR,Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tang, Haosu; Huang, Gang; Wang, Ya; Tang, Bin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chowdary, Jasti S.] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Minist Earth Sci, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Wang, Ziyue] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM); Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","Hu, KM; Huang, G (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East Asia, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res CMSR,Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Huang, G (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hkm@mail.iap.ac.cn; hg@mail.iap.ac.cn,"huang, gang/D-6427-2012; Jasti, S Chowdary/GRY-5010-2022","huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856; Jasti, S Chowdary/0000-0003-4300-7715; wang, ya/0000-0003-1527-5413; Tang, Haosu/0000-0002-2924-0126","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060500]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41831175, 42175040, 41775086]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program [2019QZKK0102]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS [2021072]",Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS,"This work is supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20060500), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41831175, 42175040, 41775086), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program (2019QZKK0102), and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS (2021072).",,53,1,1,10,12,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

Yet, dominant modern systems are already in crisis. Case study examples from research across global, continental and regional scales are used to argue that gaps between sustainability goals and outcomes are already significant. Analyses of global food security and lost diversity; human migration in Asia; and natural resource management systems in core and remote regions of Australia indicate that climate change forms only part of a failing relationship between people and the environment. There is a need to transform socio-ecosystems so that they become resilient in the context of broader learning on environmental uncertainty, variability, change and risk. Such transformations will occur both in situ, to ensure that local environments are not further degraded or people entrenched in failing systems, and ex situ, as people, systems and infrastructure become increasingly mobile to deal with changing circumstances.","Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Bardsley, DK (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",douglas.bardsley@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,136,10,10,4,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

It is having a new life in the context of debates over climate change, particularly as it becomes more significant in public discourse and policy. In this third and final progress report, I identify ways in which geographers and others are currently using the concept of adaptation, tracing both continuities and discontinuities with its earlier heritage. Three differences that warrant attention are the new mitigation/adaptation binary, the deliberate and conscious nature of climate change adaptation, and the fact that the stimuli to which we are adapting are complex assemblages comprising more-than-climate. To 'retrofit' the concept for twenty-first-century conditions, we should avoid the limitations of some past uses, and enhance its operation with new techniques and approaches. I identify four threads in recent geographic research that enhance the retrofit: cultural research around climate; emphasis on everyday practices; attention to the contingencies of scale; and more-than-human/more-than-nature theoretical conceptualizations.","[Head, Lesley] Univ Wollongong, GeoQuEST Res Ctr, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Head, Lesley] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong,"Head, L (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, GeoQuEST Res Ctr, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",lhead@uow.edu.au,,"Head, Lesley/0000-0002-5114-7614",,,,,76,74,78,2,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-1325,1477-0288,,PROG HUM GEOG,Prog.

This article examines farmland management choices and evaluates the income strategies made in climate change scenarios to ensure resilience. A Heckman probit model and a Ricardian revenue function are applied to information generated from 215 farms sampled in western and northern Cameroon. Economic factors, as well as geographic factors, are shown to influence the likelihood of perceiving and adapting to climate change. Climate influences revenue both in linear and quadratic forms, with temperature and rainfall significant in key farming seasons. The marginal impacts of climate are positive, whilst revenues decrease with summer temperature. Farm revenue is shown to be elastic for spring temperature but inelastic for summer temperature. A warming of 1.5 degrees C leads to declines in revenue of about 4.3% without adaptation. When warming is increased to 2.5 degrees C losses are shown to increase by 7.3%. These losses are lower when adaptation is considered.","[Molua, Ernest L.] Univ Buea, Fac Agr & Vet Med, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Buea, Cameroon",,"Molua, EL (corresponding author), Univ Buea, Fac Agr & Vet Med, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Buea, Cameroon.",emolua@yahoo.com,,"MOLUA, ERNEST/0000-0001-8724-6035",,,,,91,1,1,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1037-1656,2204-0536,,RURAL SOC,Rural Soc.,MAY 4,2022,31,2,,,,,115,135,,10.1080/10371656.2022.2086223,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10371656.2022.2086223,,MAY 2022,21,Sociology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Sociology,4I3CI,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000820669500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While local-level actions are essential to adaptation, state and federal governments can play a substantial role in adaptation. In this paper, we investigate local perspectives on state-level flood mitigation policies in Vermont as a means of analysing what leads top-down adaptations to be effective in mobilizing local action. Drawing on interviews with town officials, we delineate local-level perspectives on Vermont's top-down policies and use those perspectives to develop a conceptual framework that presents the 'fit' between top-down policies and the local-level context as comprised of three components: Receptivity, Ease of Participation, and Design. We explain how these components and their interactions influence local-level action. This analysis points to how careful consideration of the components of 'fit' may lead to greater local-level uptake of top-down adaptation policies.","[Paul, Mark] Duke Univ, Samuel DuBois Cook Ctr Social Equ, Durham, NC USA; [Milman, Anita] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",Duke University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Milman, A (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",amilman@eco.umass.edu,,,"United States Geological Survey [G11AP20085]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture; Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station; Department of Environmental Conservation [MAS00023]","United States Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station; Department of Environmental Conservation","The project described in this publication was supported by the United States Geological Survey [grant number G11AP20085]; the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station and the Department of Environmental Conservation under Project No. MAS00023.",,47,5,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Focusing on community businesses, a web-based survey obtained information on hurricane preparedness and risk perceptions in Sarasota County, Florida. A model of current precautionary action that utilized previously identified business characteristics predictive of business preparedness and post-disaster recovery, a spatial variable indicating storm surge exposure, and items measuring the risk perception and information-seeking behavior of business owners explained a majority of the variance in current levels of preparedness. Use of online risk information sources and the geographic distribution of customers and were the strongest predictors of preparedness. Results indicate that the adaptive capacity of businesses may vary significantly with types of businesses, locations, and socio-cognitive characteristics of business owners. To encourage overall community resilience, risk communication efforts should be targeted based on specific elements that predict business preparedness. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Population is rarely mentioned in policy debates on climate change. Studies in the past decade have added significantly to understanding the mechanisms and complexity of population and climate interactions. In addition to the growth of total population size, research shows that changes in population composition (i.e. age, urban-rural residence, and household structure) generate substantial effects on the climate system. Moreover, studies by the impact, vulnerability and adaptation (IAV) community also reveal that population dynamics are critical in the near term for building climate change resilience and within adaptation strategies.

This study adopts the Driscoll-Kraay method that simultaneously tackles heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, and contemporaneous correlation issues. We find an inverted U relationship between stock market capitalization (SMC) and environmental degradation. We propose an extended environmental Kuznets curve based on SMC while energy intensity, industrialization, and urbanization increase emissions in sample countries. The quadratic method, SLM test, and derivative graphing detect the consensus of the inverted U relationship. The weak-negative SMC2 coefficient reveals that the dangerous impact of capitalization declines gradually and finally curbs the environmental degradation challenges. The relationship is strong in highly polluted countries with overvalued stock markets. The study catches no policy synergies between the growing stock market and increased carbon emissions. Stock market capitalization should be integrated into climate change adaptation strategies at national and regional levels, primarily to address the dark effect of environmental degradation.","[Azeem, Aamir; Naseem, Muhammad Akram] Univ Lahore, Lahore Business Sch, Lahore 55150, Pakistan; [Azeem, Aamir; Ul Hassan, Naveed; Butt, Ijaz; Aslam, Muhammad Toseef] Virtual Univ Pakistan, Dept Management Sci, Lahore 54000, Pakistan; [Ali, Shahid] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Jadoon, Atif Khan] Univ Punjab, Sch Econ, Lahore 54000, Pakistan",University of Lahore; Virtual University of Pakistan; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Punjab,"Ali, S (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",aamirazeem@vu.edu.pk; iqra4ever@gmail.com; naveed.hassan@vu.edu.pk; ijaz.butt@vu.edu.pk; toseefaslam@vu.edu.pk; shahidali24@hotmail.com; atifkhaneco@pu.edu.pk,"Ali, Shahid/AAE-6195-2022","Ali, Shahid/0000-0001-9242-2136",,,,,28,1,1,4,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

It also throws light on how understanding structural vulnerability can help to emphasize social justice concerns while adapting to climatic risks. The research, using qualitative methods, examines complex intersections between a multitude of factors such as climate change, agrarian distress, exclusionary patterns of urbanization and the resultant lack of recognition that shapes and reshapes the vulnerability of a certain group of people.

However, the majority of this literature focuses on the issue of climate change mitigation in a developed country context, and there is little published material regarding communication in a developing country and adaptation context. Similarly, despite community-based approaches to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction increasing in the Pacific Islands region, there is very limited guidance on how to effectively communicate climate change in a way that enhances people's resilience. This paper documents the experiences of organisations, including local and international non-government and faith-based organisations, governments, regional technical organisations and donor agencies in communicating climate change for adaptation in the Pacific region. Three key climate change communication challenges are highlighted and suggestions made for overcoming them based on results from interviews, a focus group discussion and an online forum. Finally, recommendations are made for good practice guidance in climate change communication that is empowering and culturally relevant.","[McNaught, Rebecca] Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, Port Vila, Efate, Vanuatu; [Cooper, Andrew] La Trobe Univ, Balwyn North, Vic 3104, Australia",La Trobe University,"McNaught, R (corresponding author), Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, POB 3041, Port Vila, Efate, Vanuatu.",mcnaught@climatecentre.org,"McNaught, Rebecca/AAF-2668-2020","McNaught, Rebecca/0000-0002-9393-6398",,,,,50,32,33,1,55,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

In this paper we discuss several policy options for increasing GHG mitigation on public lands. These range from an extension of current policy by generating supplemental mitigation on public lands in an effort to meet national emissions reduction goals, to full participation in an offsets market by allowing GHG mitigation on public lands to be sold as offsets either by the overseeing agency or by private contractors. To help place these policy options in context, we briefly review the literature on GHG mitigation and public lands to examine the potential for enhanced mitigation on federal and state public lands in the United States. This potential will be tempered by consideration of the tradeoffs with other uses of public lands, the needs for climate change adaptation, and the effects on other ecosystem services.","[Olander, Lydia P.; Cooley, David M.; Galik, Christopher S.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Inst Environm Policy Solut, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Olander, LP (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Inst Environm Policy Solut, POB 90335, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",lydia.olander@duke.edu,"Galik, Christopher/AAK-9488-2020","Galik, Christopher/0000-0002-0356-1861",Linden Trust,Linden Trust,"We would like to thank the Linden Trust for Conservation for their support of this work; Rob Doudrick, David Moulton, Jim Morrison, Ann Ingerson, and Aaron Jenkins for their helpful comments on earlier drafts.",,61,14,14,1,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

We discuss key methodological issues in estimating causal relationships and largely focus on natural experiments that exploit variation in climate over time. Using a hierarchical meta-analysis that allows us to both estimate the mean effect and quantify the degree of variability across 55 studies, we find that deviations from moderate temperatures and precipitation patterns systematically increase conflict risk. Contemporaneous temperature has the largest average impact, with each 1 sigma increase in temperature increasing interpersonal conflict by 2.4% and intergroup conflict by 11.3%.

Analysis of MODIS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index from 2000 to 2018 reveals differences in drought and vegetation responses in Northern versus Southern California (NorCal vs SoCal, see definition in section ). The greatest declines in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were focused in the SoCal, while NorCal appears not severely affected thus far. It appears that both the strength of drought and the sensitivity of the vegetation to drought are larger in SoCal. The exacerbated aridity in SoCal is a trend extending throughout the past and present century. The spatial differences in hydroclimatology and vegetation responses are important considerations for statewide climate change adaptation-with SoCal potentially facing greater challenges.","[Dong, Chunyu; MacDonald, Glen M.; Willis, Katherine; Gillespie, Thomas W.; Okin, Gregory S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Dong, Chunyu; MacDonald, Glen M.; Gillespie, Thomas W.; Okin, Gregory S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Williams, A.

Labor governments have often provided rhetorical support but have fought over whether industry policy represents a new protectionism or market-enhancing development policy. The Coalition in opposition and in office has generally opposed the idea of industry policy, but has continued to support ad hoc and costly policy interventions. Australia's 20 years without a recession has disguised the need to reconsider industry policy and questions of economic diversity. This article argues that dealing with problems of economic structure - particularly resource dependence and climate change adaptation - requires a revitalisation of the industry policy debate. It tracks the theory and practice of industry policy in Australia and concludes that advocates for industry policy must formulate new policy ideas outside the framework of the traditional divide between intervention and free markets.","[Conley, Tom; van Acker, Elizabeth] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Polit & Publ Policy, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Conley, T (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Polit & Publ Policy, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",,,,,,,,88,15,15,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1036-1146,,,AUST J POLIT SCI,Aust.

The aim of this article is to develop a multihazard risk assessment on a regional scale based on existing information that can be repeated over time and space and that will be useful during decision-making processes. This assessment was conducted in Dosso (Niger), the region most hit by flooding in the country, with the highest hydroclimatic risk in West Africa. The assessment characterizes the climate, identifies hazards, and analyzes multihazard risk over the 2011-2017 period for each of the region's 43 municipalities. Hazards and risk level are compared to the intervention areas and actions of 6 municipal development plans and 12 adaptation and resilience projects. Over the past seven years, heavy precipitation and dry spells in the Dosso region have been more frequent than during the previous 30-year period. As many as 606 settlements have been repeatedly hit and 15 municipalities are classified as being at elevated-to-severe multihazard risk. The geographical distribution of the adaptation and resilience projects does not reflect the risk level.

An important element shaping farmers' adaptation decisions and their vulnerability is their respective land tenure system. Especially land tenure security can strongly influence farmers' incentives for adapting to climate change. We review the literature to understand to what extent tenure security and other land tenure characteristics affect farmers' ability to withstand climate change and how climate change is operationalised. 106 mostly peer reviewed studies are examined using thematic network analysis and a network of interactions between land tenure and climate change in farming contexts is devised. The results show that three main interactions link land tenure systems and climate change with regard to agricultural livelihoods: (i) land tenure characteristics influence farmers' adaptation uptake, type and intensity, (ii) certain tenure settings contribute to vulnerability of different socio-demographic groups in agricultural systems, e.g. women, migrants and indigenous communities, and (iii) the perception of tenure security itself is affected by climate change. Yet, the concept of tenure security is poorly defined in most studies, at times resulting in misleading conclusions and leaving important research gaps with regard to optimal land tenure incentives for farmers' adaptation response. Climate change is often simplistically integrated into the assessments, without validation and analysis of longer term trends. None of the studies reviewed provides a comprehensive and systematic treatment of the multiple dimensions linking climate change and land tenure. Further exploration and empirical validation of the connection between land tenure and climate change in agricultural systems is thus warranted. This should include a more critical engagement with the exigencies of climate change response for agricultural systems, such as the need for flexible approaches to deal with climatic uncertainty. The results of this review are relevant for informing adaptation policy, where sustainable land governance has an integral role to play. Designing smart land tenure interventions based on improved understanding of (local) interactions between land tenure and climate can support farmers in effectively addressing the adverse effects of climate change.","[Murken, Lisa; Gornott, Christoph] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Gornott, Christoph] Univ Kassel, Agroecosyst Anal & Modelling, D-34109 Kassel, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Universitat Kassel,"Murken, L (corresponding author), Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",murken@pik-potsdam.de,"Gornott, Christoph/ABI-8107-2020","Gornott, Christoph/0000-0003-3933-3358; Murken, Lisa/0000-0002-0971-9746",,,,,135,7,6,8,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

This study estimates these costs and assesses the relationships between prevalent diseases and climate adaptation at the household level using survey data from 420 households. An ingredients-based approach was used to estimate the cost of health and adaptation, and a Probit regression model was used to analyze the relationship between prevalent diseases and climate adaptation costs. Household direct curative costs are the highest among health cost components. Two-thirds of total health costs are direct costs for households. On average, 15.90% of household income is used for direct cost of health care. The climate hazard cost among afflicted households is estimated to be high. In addition, diseases like malaria, typhoid and jaundice, their costs, climate awareness program, droughts, family size and loss of per capita income are more likely to raise the cost of climate adaptation. The occurrence of gastritis, prevalence of diarrhea and cold waves are less likely to affect the cost.

We used this framework to identify regions with contrasting hydroclimatic change during the past 50years in Sweden. This analysis revealed three distinct regions: the mountains, the forests, and the areas with agriculture. Each region responded markedly different to recent climate and anthropogenic changes, and within each region, we identified the most sensitive subregions. These results highlight the need for regional differentiation in climate change adaptation strategies to protect vulnerable ecosystems and freshwater resources. Further, the Budyko curve moved systematically towards its water and energy limits, indicating augmentation of the water cycle driven by changing vegetation, climate and human interactions. This finding challenges the steady state assumption of the Budyko curve and therefore its ability to predict future water cycles.

This study presents a geographic visualization approach involving lay audiences to address these challenges. VisAdapt (TM) is a web-based visualization tool designed to improve Nordic homeowners' understanding of climate change vulnerability and to support their adaptive actions. VisAdapt is structured to enable individual users to explore several climate change impact parameters, including temperature and precipitation, for their locations and to find information on specific adaptation measures for their house types and locations. The process of testing the tool included a focus group study with homeowners in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden to assess key challenges in geographic visualization, such as the level of interactivity and information. The paper concludes that geographic visualization tools can support homeowners' climate adaptation processes, but that certain features, such as downscaled climate information are a key element expected by users. Although the assessment of interactivity and data varied both across countries and user experience, a general conclusion is that a geographic visualization tool, like VisAdapt, can make climate change effects and adaptation alternatives tangible and initiate discussions and collaborative reflections.

Practices that build soil organic matter on agricultural lands also increase soil water holding capacity, potentially reducing climatic water deficit (CWD), increasing actual evapotranspiration (AET) and increasing groundwater recharge (RCH). We developed nine spatially-explicit land use and conservation scenarios (2001-2100) in the LUCAS land use change model to address two questions for California working lands (cropland and rangeland): How does land use change limit opportunities to manage soils for hydrologic climate adaptation benefits? To what extent and where can soil management practices increase climate adaptation on protected working lands? Hydrologic benefits [Sigma(Delta CWD, Delta AET, Delta RCH)] due to soil management were simulated in the Basin Characterization Model (a state-wide water balance model) for two Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate models. LUCAS simulated land conversion and new conservation easements with potential for maximum hydrologic benefits. Climate drove differences in lost potential for water benefits due to urbanization (33.9-87.6 m(3) x 10(6)) in 2050. Conflict between development pressure and potential hydrologic benefits occurred most in Santa Clara County in the San Francisco Bay Area and Shasta County in Northern Sacramento Valley. Hydrologic benefits on easements were similar in magnitude to losses from development. Water savings from management of California Land Conservation (a.k.a. Williamson) Act contract lands were an order of magnitude greater, totaling over 460 m(3) x 10(6) annually in a drier climate by 2050. Few counties provide most benefits because of soil properties, climate and land area protected. The increase in hydrologic benefits varies by agricultural practice and adoption rate, land use type and configuration, and terms of conservation agreements. The effectiveness of programs designed to improve climate adaptation at county to state scales will likely increase by taking this variability into consideration.","[Byrd, Kristin B.; Sleeter, Benjamin] US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Alvarez, Pelayo; Creque, Jeffrey] Carbon Cycle Inst, Petaluma, CA USA; [Flint, Lorraine; Flint, Alan] US Geol Survey, Calif Water Sci Ctr, Sacramento, CA USA; [Cameron, Richard] Nature Conservancy, San Francisco, CA USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Nature Conservancy,"Byrd, KB (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",kbyrd@usgs.gov,,"Byrd, Kristin/0000-0002-5725-7486; Cameron, David/0000-0001-7750-9049; Sleeter, Benjamin/0000-0003-2371-9571",California Natural Resources Agency; US Geological Survey Land Change Science Program,California Natural Resources Agency; US Geological Survey Land Change Science Program(United States Geological Survey),"We thank the State of California Department of Conservation, Division of Land Resource Protection for providing access to the Williamson Act lands geodatabase and statistics on land protection programs that aided scenario development.

Strategic plans (n = 39) were assessed using plan content analysis in order to understand whether regional planning leads to adaptation action by municipalities. Framed through an institutional resilience lens, we find that regional policy guidance is critical for initiating the uptake of municipal climate adaptation; however, lack of granular adaptation policies informed by appropriate climate data constrains implementation in practice. Through collaboration and leveraging strengths of different levels of government, adaptation barriers can be addressed and the quality of adaptation policies improved.","[Bonnett, Nicole L.; Birchall, S.

Perceptions from coastal Bangladesh,LOCAL ENVIRONMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate adaptation; coastal Bangladesh; gender differences; female-headed farming households; Kalapara,,"While people around the world are increasingly facing various climate-related stresses, women with limited resources in low income developing societies are often at a greater risk largely because of their pre-existing constraints on social, economic, political, and cultural resources and opportunities. In this paper, we investigate how gender differences influence farmers' access to various resources that are critical for local climate adaptation in coastal Bangladesh. As one of the most climate-vulnerable regions in not only the country but the world, coastal Bangladesh is experiencing a significant increase in sea level rise, tropical cyclones, storm surges, coastal flooding, coastal erosions as well as unpredictable rainfall patterns. All of these climate related stresses directly contribute to the region's increasing exposure to saltwater intrusion in coastal lands and freshwater sources. While a majority of the previous research has focused on community-based climate adaptation, there has been limited attention on how gender differences shape local farmers' climate adaptation strategies. Using mixed-methods research, this article highlights the ways in which male-headed and female-headed farming households have differential access to locally available adaptation resources along with associated constraints or opportunities for adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies vary substantially. Our findings suggest female-headed farms are less likely to sell their farmland or migrate away in search of non-farm income due to normative gendered expectations and socio-cultural restrictions. Therefore, female farmers are forced to pursue in-place farming adaptation strategies with limited external resources while relying on informal social networks for weather and climate information.","[Ahmed, Saleh] Boise State Univ, Sch Publ Serv, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Kiester, Elizabeth] Albright Coll, Sociol, Reading, PA 19612 USA",Idaho; Boise State University,"Ahmed, S (corresponding author), Boise State Univ, Sch Publ Serv, Boise, ID 83725 USA.",salehahmed@boisestate.edu,,"Ahmed, Saleh/0000-0002-5064-1389",NOAA [NA13OAR4310184]; USAID,NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This research was funded by the NOAA [grant number NA13OAR4310184] for the International Research and Applications Project (IRAP), with contributions from USAID.",,41,4,4,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,MAY 4,2021,26,5,,,,,650,665,,10.1080/13549839.2021.1916901,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2021.1916901,,APR 2021,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,RX9KJ,,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000642524800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the same time, despite knowing that successful adaptation will be contingent on societal factors just as much as on technical ones, there has been very little research into social perceptions of adaptation technologies. To address this gap, I undertake an interdisciplinary synthesis of stable beliefs and values about technology-those that are less susceptible to change across different situations-from five major but hitherto disconnected theoretical perspectives on perceptions of technology: the psychometric paradigm, the technology control dilemma, cultural theory, technology acceptance models, and responsible innovation. Four common dimensions of perception were identified: knowledge of technology, scope of technological projects, impacts of technology, and trust in the control of technology. These dimensions can be used to develop a concept of and framework for social readiness, whereby aspects of adaptation technologies that are likely to be perceived negatively or positively, and by whom, can be identified. This is by no means a panacea to the challenges of adaptation implementation, but one that contributes to and would join in constructive exchange with wider efforts to evaluate adaptation technologies. I end this review by discussing the need for bridging the gap between opposing epistemic cultures that favor different styles of knowledge production around adaptation technology perception.

Historical blocks are usually built and designed based on the social environment and climatic conditions at that time; therefore, they generally contain the construction techniques relevant to dealing with the local climate. The study aims to study the microclimate characteristics of a historic conservation area in a severe cold region and to explore how it attempted to achieve climate adaptation. Taking the Chinese-Baroque historic conservation area in Harbin as an example, this paper analyzed and studied the climate adaptability technology and excavated the suitable technology for the block to deal with a severe cold climate through research, field measurements, and numerical simulation. The results showed that compared with a certain modern urban area in the city, the Chinese-Baroque historic conservation area had better ability to resist wind and cold. The compact layout of the block could reduce heat loss and keep out the cold by effectively resisting the cold wind from permeating inside. Compared with the T-shaped and L-shaped courtyards, the rectangular courtyard occupies the largest proportion and a rectangular courtyard enclosed by buildings on all sides had better windbreak performance. Furthermore, when the courtyard space was enclosed by four sides and the courtyard width was the same, when the plane aspect ratio was smaller, the maximum wind speed of the inner courtyard was smaller. The squares in the block had a good performance in cold resistance. At the same scale, the higher the degree of enclosure of the square, the lower the internal wind speed.

Between 2011 and 2013, we combined farmer participatory research approaches, remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) to (1) understand the contribution of CNRPs to household food and income in Dendenyore and Ushe smallholder communities in Hwedza District, eastern Zimbabwe and (2) assess changes of the CNRPs in both space and time, and their implications on climate change adaptation. Across study sites, wetlands and woodlands were ranked as the most important CNRPs. Extraction and use patterns of products from the different pools differed among households of different resource endowment. Resource-constrained households (RG3) sold an average of 183 kg household(-1) year(-1) of wild loquats fruits (Uapaca kirkiana), realising about US$48, while resource-endowed farmers (RG1) had no need to sale any. The RG3 households also realised approximately US$70 household(-1) year(-1) from sale of crafts made from water reeds (Phragmites mauritianus). Empirical data closely supported communities' perceptions that CNRPs had declined significantly in recent years compared with two to three decades ago. More than 60 % of the respondents perceived that the availability of natural resources drawn from wetlands and woodlands, often used for food, energy and crafts, has decreased markedly since the 1980s. Classification of land cover in a GIS environment indicated that CNRPs declined between 1972 and 2011, supporting farmers' perceptions. Overall, woodlands declined by 37 % in both communities, while the total area under wetlands decreased by 29 % in Ushe, a drier area and 49 % in Dendenyore, a relatively humid area. The over-reliance in CNRPs by rural communities could be attributed to continued decline in crop yields linked to increased within-season rainfall variability, and the absence of alternative food and income sources. This suggests limited options for rural communities to adapt to the changing food production systems in the wake of climate change and variability and other challenges such as declining soil fertility. There is therefore a need to design adaptive farm management options that enhance both crop and livestock production in a changing climate as well as identifying other livelihood alternatives outside agriculture to reduce pressure on CNRPs. In addition, promotion of alternative sources of energy such as solar power and biogas among rural communities could reduce the cutting of trees for firewood from woodlands.","[Chagumaira, Christopher; Rurinda, Jairos; Nezomba, Hatirarami; Mtambanengwe, Florence; Mapfumo, Paul] Univ Zimbabwe, Soil Fertil Consortium Southern Africa SOFECSA, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, POB MP 167, Harare, Zimbabwe",University of Zimbabwe,"Mapfumo, P (corresponding author), Univ Zimbabwe, Soil Fertil Consortium Southern Africa SOFECSA, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, POB MP 167, Harare, Zimbabwe.",paulmapfumo@gmail.com,"Chagumaira, Christopher/AAI-7239-2020; Mtambanengwe, Florence/AAX-4571-2021","Chagumaira, Christopher/0000-0003-0590-0350; Mtambanengwe, Florence/0000-0002-8250-9075","IDRC/DFID-Climate Change Adaptation in Africa [104140]; Soil Fertility Consortium for Southern Africa (SOFECSA); Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [A/11/95775]; Global Change SysTem for Analysis, Research and Training (START) International","IDRC/DFID-Climate Change Adaptation in Africa; Soil Fertility Consortium for Southern Africa (SOFECSA); Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Global Change SysTem for Analysis, Research and Training (START) International","This study was part of the IDRC/DFID-Climate Change Adaptation in Africa funded (Grant 104140) project 'Lack of resilience in African smallholder farming: Exploring measures to enhance the adaptive capacity of local communities to pressures of climate change' led by the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) and implemented under the auspices of the Soil Fertility Consortium for Southern Africa (SOFECSA).

This first generation of adaptation plans provides useful information regarding how institutions are framing the issue of adaptation and the range of processes that are recognized as being part of an adaptation response. To better understand adaptation planning among developed nations, a set of 57 adaptation plans from Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States was evaluated against a suite of 19 planning processes identified from existing guidance instruments for adaptation planning. Total scores among evaluated plans ranged from 16% of the maximum possible score to 61%, with an average of 37%. These results suggest adaptation plans are largely under-developed. Critical weaknesses in adaptation planning are related to limited consideration for non-climatic factors as well as neglect for issues of adaptive capacity including entitlements to various forms of capital needed for effective adaptation. Such gaps in planning suggest there are opportunities for institutions to make better use of existing guidance for adaptation planning and the need to consider the broader governance context in which adaptation will occur. In addition, the adaptation options prescribed by adaptation plans reflect a preferential bias toward low-risk capacity-building (72% of identified options) over the delivery of specific actions to reduce vulnerability. To the extent these findings are representative of the state of developed nation adaptation planning, there appear to be significant deficiencies in climate change preparedness, even among those nations often assumed to have the greatest adaptive capacity.","[Preston, Benjamin L.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Westaway, Richard M.] IMS Consulting, Bristol, Avon, England; [Yuen, Emma J.] CSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship, Aspendale, Vic, Australia",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Preston, BL (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, 1 Bethel Valley Rd,POB 2008,MS 6301, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",prestonbl@ornl.gov,"Yuen, Emma J/G-5110-2012; Preston, Benjamin L/B-9001-2012; Westaway, Richard/S-3483-2017","Preston, Benjamin L/0000-0002-7966-2386; Westaway, Richard/0000-0001-6102-1540",Julius Career Award; CSIRO,Julius Career Award; CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),This work was supported through a Julius Career Award granted to the lead author by the CSIRO as well as support from the CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship.

The Pacific islands, including Fiji, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Objective: The three major health impacts of climate change in Fiji explored in this study were dengue fever, diarrhoeal disease, and malnutrition, as they each pose a significant threat to human health. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent the Fiji National Climate Change Policy, and a selection of relevant sectoral policies, account for these human health effects of climate change. Design: The study employed a three-pronged policy analysis to evaluate: 1) the content of the Fijian National Climate Change Policy and to what extent health was incorporated within this; 2) the context within which the policy was developed; 3) the relevant processes; and 4) the actors involved. A selection of relevant sectoral policies were also analysed to assess the extent to which these included climate change and health considerations. Results: The policy analysis showed that these three health impacts of climate change were only considered to a minor extent, and often indirectly, in both the Fiji National Climate Change Policy and the corresponding National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, as well as the Public Health Act. Furthermore, supporting documents in relevant sectors including water and agriculture made no mention of climate change and health impacts. Conclusions: The projected health impacts of climate change should be considered as part of reviewing the Fiji National Climate Change Policy and National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, and the Public Health Act. In the interest of public health, this should include strategies for combating dengue fever, malnutrition, and water-borne disease. Related sectoral policies in water and agriculture should also be revised to consider climate change and its impact on human health. Approaches to include health aspects of climate change within sectoral and climate change specific policies should be encouraged, via a number of mechanisms, such as the Health in All Policies approach. Future research could support the Fiji health sector in developing climate change and health programmes.","[Morrow, Georgina] Charite, Inst Trop Med & Int Hlth, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Bowen, Kathryn] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Australian National University,"Morrow, G (corresponding author), Charite Tropeninst, Spandauer Damm 130,Haus 10, D-14050 Berlin, Germany.",gmorrow22@gmail.com,,"Bowen, Kathryn/0000-0002-2125-1963",Rotary International,Rotary International,This study was partly funded by Rotary International through an Ambassadorial Scholarship awarded to Georgina Morrow.,,60,4,4,3,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,1654-9880,,GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION,Glob.

As an alternative for conventional electricity systems, renewable energies are considered to be an important policy tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore, they play an important role in climate change mitigation strategies. Renewable energies, however, may also play a crucial role in climate change adaptation strategies because they can reduce the vulnerability of energy systems to extreme events. The paper examines whether policy-makers in Israel tend to focus on mitigation strategies or on adaptation strategies in renewable energy policy discourse. The results indicate that despite Israel's minor impact on global greenhouse gas emissions, policy-makers focus more on promoting renewable energies as a climate change mitigation strategy rather than an adaptation strategy. These findings shed light on the important role of international influence-which tends to emphasize mitigation over adaptation-in motivating the domestic policy discourse on renewable energy as a coping method with climate change.","[Eitan, Avri] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Adv Sch Environm Studies, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Eitan, A (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Adv Sch Environm Studies, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel.",avri.eitan@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Eitan, Avri/0000-0003-1533-5279",David Amiran Scholarship of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,David Amiran Scholarship of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,This paper was supported by the David Amiran Scholarship of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.,,115,15,15,4,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2021,13,6,,,,,,,3170,10.3390/su13063170,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13063170,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RV4TV,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000645828000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using dendrochronological data in red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.)-dominated forests in northern Minnesota, USA, we examined growth responses before and after understory prescribed fires between 1960 and 1970 to assess whether repeated burning influences growth responses of overstory trees and vulnerability of overstory tree growth to drought. We found no difference in tree-level growth vulnerability to drought, expressed as growth resistance, resilience, and recovery, between areas receiving prescribed fire treatments and untreated forests. Annual mortality rates during the period of active burning were also low (less than 2%) in all treatments.

The agency has promoted the use of numerical models of aquifer behavior as a management tool, as presented in this work, which has served to anticipate the effects of the abstractions planned for the period 2015-2021 on the Gorgoton spring and on the flow of the Segura river as it passes through the aquifer.","[Alhama, I; Garcia-Ros, G.] Tech Univ Cartagena, Civil Engn Dept, Paseo Alfonso XIII 52, Cartagena 30203, Spain; [Alhama, F.] Tech Univ Cartagena, Appl Phys Dept, Paseo Alfonso XIII 48, Cartagena 30203, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Alhama, I (corresponding author), Tech Univ Cartagena, Civil Engn Dept, Paseo Alfonso XIII 52, Cartagena 30203, Spain.",ivan.alhama@upct.es; gonzalo.garcia@upct.es; paco.alhama@upct.es,"García-Ros, Gonzalo/AFL-9644-2022","García-Ros, Gonzalo/0000-0002-2837-7358; Alhama Manteca, Ivan/0000-0002-3284-2232",,,,,20,3,3,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

In addition to discussing the climate-related concerns associated with the emergence of violence, this paper considers how tackling the environmental crisis in MENA will improve living standards and lead toward sustainable development. As a supplement to a range of secondary data, a small selection of individuals who have escaped the recent conflicts have been interviewed. Because this potential sample pool is small, and the ongoing violence precludes fieldwork in the MENA region, this study provides only a preliminary exploration of the topic. A more detailed study is desirable, if and when it is feasible to conduct such research. As a potential adaptation to climate change in the region, permaculture is presented through illustrations of its capabilities for redressing some of the underlying causes of violence in the MENA region.","[Karim, M.

Adaptive responses of small farmers in the border village of San Ignacio, Sonora, Mexico, who are increasingly vulnerable to climate change, water scarcity, and changing labor markets were studied. Gender differences in production sites translate into diverse vulnerabilities and adaptive strategies. Local capacities and initiatives should be a focus of research and policy to avoid viewing women and men as passive in the face of global change.

Consequently, to raise environmental resilience and sustain human wellbeing, we need to overhaul the policy-making process towards a 'holistic approach'. The nexus approach has proven a valuable tool for identifying gaps and incoherencies in current policies, for understanding major interlinkages across sectors and scales, and for promoting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nevertheless, a 'silo approach' to decision making currently prevails, thus achieving cross-sectoral and cross-scale harmonization still remains a challenge in policy-making. In response to this challenge, the next step in the science-policy-practice interface is to integrate the nexus approach in the 'climate services' arena, in order to support integrated policies. Climate services embody a bridge between researchers and stakeholders, and by supporting integrated policies they will ensure synergies between sectors and scales, reduce potential trade-offs, and enable co-benefits.","[Tudose, Nicu Constantin; Marin, Mirabela] Natl Inst Res & Dev Forestry Marin Dracea INCDS, Voluntari 077190, Ilfov County, Romania; [Cremades, Roger] Wageningen Univ & Res, Leeuwenborch Bldg, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Cremades, Roger] Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany; [Broekman, Annelies; Sanchez-Plaza, Anabel] CREAF, Ctr Recerca Ecol & Aplicac Forestals, E-08193 Catalonia, Spain; [Mitter, Hermine] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Dept Econ & Social Sci, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Marin, Mirabela] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov 500036, Romania","National Research & Development Institute in Forestry Marin Dracea; Wageningen University & Research; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Transylvania University of Brasov","Tudose, NC (corresponding author), Natl Inst Res & Dev Forestry Marin Dracea INCDS, Voluntari 077190, Ilfov County, Romania.",cntudose@yahoo.com,"Constantin, Tudose Nicu/L-7866-2013","Constantin, Tudose Nicu/0000-0002-4814-8886; Marin, Mirabela/0000-0002-4509-8051; Broekman, Annelies/0000-0002-8961-0467; Sanchez-Plaza, Anabel/0000-0001-6676-5119; Cremades, Roger/0000-0002-4514-2462",project CLISWELN - ERA4CS; BMBF (DE); UEFISCDI (RO); BMBWF (AT); FFG (AT); MINECO (ES); European Union [690462],"project CLISWELN - ERA4CS; BMBF (DE)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); UEFISCDI (RO)(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI)); BMBWF (AT); FFG (AT); MINECO (ES); European Union(European Commission)","The authors acknowledged the financial support from the project CLISWELN funded by ERA4CS.

Along their tracks, TCs mix up cold water, which can further affect their intensity. Because of the adoption of lower-resolution ocean models, previous modeling studies on the TC response to greenhouse warming underestimated such oceanic feedbacks. To address the robustness of TC projections in the presence of mesoscale air-sea interactions and complex coastal topography, we conduct greenhouse warming experiments using an ultrahigh-resolution Earth System Model. We find that a projected weakening of the rising branches of the summer Hadley cells suppresses future TC genesis and TC-generated ocean cooling. The forced response is similar to recent observational trends, indicating a possible emergence of the anthropogenic signal beyond natural variability levels. In the greenhouse warming simulations, landfalling TCs intensify, both in terms of wind speed and associated rainfall. Our modeling results provide relevant information for climate change adaptation efforts.","[Chu, Jung-Eun; Lee, Sun-Seon; Timmermann, Axel; Wengel, Christian; Yamaguchi, Ryohei] Inst Basic Sci IBS, Ctr Climate Phys, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Chu, Jung-Eun; Lee, Sun-Seon; Timmermann, Axel; Wengel, Christian; Yamaguchi, Ryohei] Pusan Natl Univ, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Stuecker, Malte F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Stuecker, Malte F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Institute for Basic Science - Korea (IBS); Pusan National University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Lee, SS; Timmermann, A (corresponding author), Inst Basic Sci IBS, Ctr Climate Phys, Busan 46241, South Korea.;Lee, SS; Timmermann, A (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Busan 46241, South Korea.",sunseonlee@pusan.ac.kr; axel@ibsclimate.org,"Timmermann, Axel/Y-2799-2019; Timmermann, Axel/F-4977-2011; Stuecker, Malte Fabian/H-6304-2011; Yamaguchi, Ryohei/HKV-4527-2023; Chu, Jung-Eun/CAJ-4573-2022","Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; Stuecker, Malte Fabian/0000-0001-8355-0662; Yamaguchi, Ryohei/0000-0002-7800-5798; CHU, JUNGEUN/0000-0003-2088-4758; Lee, Sun-Seon/0000-0001-7403-6485","Institute for Basic Science (IBS) [IBS-R028-D1, 11172]",Institute for Basic Science (IBS),"This research was supported by the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) IBS-R028-D1.

In both communities, increasing hazards and risks are associated with climate change-making the communities some of the first to be identified as environmental migrants or climate refugees. In both cases, what residents, researchers, and other stakeholders fear is that a large disaster will take lives and destroy critical infrastructure, causing communities to be displaced. However, we argue that migration pressures as a result of habitual disasters and increasing hazards interact with other migration pressures on the ground. In the lived experiences of residents, forced displacements and voluntary migrations are not so easily separated but are complex decisions made by individuals, families, and communities in response to discourses of risk, deteriorating infrastructure, and other economic and social pressures. Ultimately, residents make choices under constrained inventories of possibility and climate change adaptation and disaster mitigation strategies must consider these complex lived experiences in order to be successful.","[Marino, Elizabeth] Oregon State Univ Cascades, Anthropol & Sustainabil, Bend, OR 97701 USA; [Lazrus, Heather] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO USA; [Lazrus, Heather] Univ Colorado, Dept Anthropol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Oregon State University; Oregon State University Cascades; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Marino, E (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ Cascades, Anthropol & Sustainabil, Bend, OR 97701 USA.",,,,National Science Foundation [0713896],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Elizabeth Marino is an Assistant Professor of Anthropology and Sustainability at Oregon State University-Cascades.

The empirical results suggest that, for various model settings and climate change scenarios, long-run adaptations should mitigate one-third to one-half of the damages of warming on crop profits by the end of this century. These findings support the basic argument of the hedonic approach that omitting long-run adaptations will dramatically overestimate the potential damage of climate change.

Previous research projected that under climate change, natural snow cover will become inadequate at 65% of sites in the Australian ski resorts by 2020. Resorts plan to compensate for reduced snowfall through additional snowmaking. For the six main resorts, however, this would require over 700 additional snow guns by 2020, requiring similar to US $100 million in capital investment, and 2,500-3,300 ML of water per month, as well as increased energy consumption. This is not practically feasible, especially as less water will be available. Therefore, low altitude ski resorts such as these may not be able to rely on snowmaking even for short-term adaptation to climate change.

Much of what it has achieved as a field of academic enquiry can be linked back to issues of integrated assessment modelling. This paper shows that the standard approach is going through a major change in scope as of the last five years. The conventional focus on determining optimal mitigation paths based on modelling the social cost of carbon is being enlarged to embrace promising new waves of research. These are: (1) the economics of insurance against catastrophic risks; (2) the economics of trade and climate; and (3) the economics of climate change adaptation. The paper helps to bridge the gap between economics and climate policy by showing that the analytical toolkit of climate change economics has shifted towards more realistic representations of climatic policy.

Based on an observational design, causal connections between the occurrence and patterns of extreme events and related road infrastructure impacts are analyzed. The hazard mapping case study in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg combines traffic information and data on the June 2013 extreme precipitation in Germany. It examines the precipitation occurrence and road infrastructure impact characteristics in Baden-Wurttemberg and identifies spatiotemporal hazard patterns.

The analysis examines conditions in eight temperate, industrialized countries (Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland). The identification strategy exploits cross-country and cross-household variations by matching geocoded households with climate data. Our findings suggest that households respond to excess heat by purchasing and using air conditioners, leading to increased electricity consumption. Households on average spend 35%-42% more on electricity when they adopt air conditioning. Through an illustrative analysis, we show that climate change and the growing demand for air conditioning are likely to exacerbate energy poverty. The number of energy poor who spend a high share of income on electricity increases, and households in the lowest income quantile are the most negatively affected.","[Randazzo, Teresa; De Cian, Enrica; Mistry, Malcolm N.] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiarnenti Climat, Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Randazzo, T (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ, Cannaregio 873-B, I-10121 Venice, Italy.",teresa.randazzo@unive.it; enrica.decian@unive.it; malcolm.mistry@unive.it,"Randazzo, Teresa/AGZ-6630-2022; DE CIAN, Enrica/AAA-1237-2021","DE CIAN, Enrica/0000-0001-7134-2540; Mistry, Malcolm/0000-0003-3345-6197; Randazzo, Teresa/0000-0001-7524-9191",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [756194],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)),"This paper has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 756194 (ENERGYA).

Delivering climate change adaptation in cities in the first instance requires addressing immediate infrastructure and service provision needs, because increasing climate change resilience in cities also requires improving the delivery of services to all citizens. However, there is a risk that climate change discourses facilitate the deployment of technocratic, expert-led forms of planning, particularly when climate change is used as an excuse to facilitate the intervention of international planning consultants who most often know little about the local context of planning. This paper advocates instead approaches to climate change action that harness opportunities on the ground to engage with the creative potential that urban citizens already have and to draw attention to the need to develop planning skills from within the city.","UCL, Bartlett Fac Built Environm, Dev Planning Unit, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Broto, VC (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Fac Built Environm, Dev Planning Unit, 34 Tavistock Sq, London, England.",v.castanbroto@ucl.ac.uk,"Broto, Vanesa Castan/AAF-4485-2021",,,,,,23,17,17,0,10,LIVERPOOL UNIV PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"4 CAMBRIDGE ST, LIVERPOOL L69 7ZU, ENGLAND",1474-6743,1478-3401,,INT DEV PLANN REV,Int.

It is also important for climate change adaptation, as well as mitigation policies on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). Men and women relate to and use the forest differently and so may experience the effects of climate change and REDD+ policies differently. Investigations through semi-structured interviews and document reviews in three countries of the region revealed that women have had limited participation in discussions on issues of climate change or REDD+. There is some evidence that gender consideration will become part of future national REDD+ strategies.

Climate change is threatening Bangladesh's food production. Predicting future precipitation changes is crucial for smart agricultural planning and adapting to climate change. Kharif-II (Mid-July-Mid-October) is one of the crop seasons of Bangladesh when most crops depend on precipitation, especially rice production. This study attempted to create precipitation maps of Bangladesh divided into two reference periods (1970-2000 and 2010-2018) and mid-century (2040-2060) for July to October by projecting precipitation results from 19 global climate models of CMIP5 and comparing reference periods precipitation with mid-century precipitation. The study adopts different geospatial techniques to assemble and analyze climate data, generate precipitation maps for July to October, and compute precipitation data division-wise. Throughout the Kharif-II period, precipitation will increase in mid-century except in August, where monthly precipitation will have a chance to fall compared to the reference period. The study also reveals that the Mymensingh division will experience a dramatic increase in precipitation along with Sylhet, and Rajshahi will also see some rise in precipitation in mid-century (2040-2060) than the two reference periods (1970-2000 and 2010-2018).","[Aziz, Md.

A case study applied in the city of Sao Paulo, considered a representative project of the sector and cases with energy efficiency adaptation measures for three climate scenarios, considering climate change. The integrated approach highlighted the importance of the initial selection of materials, considering their associated impacts as well as the thermal and energy performance of the building during its life time, and the importance of climate change for the operational phase of the building. With the Sustainability Index in the Energy Life Cycle, large reductions were obtained comparing cases with adaptation measures to current practice.

The analysis was built from the premise that livestock offers substantial opportunities for food security and sustainable development if adaptation to climate change is appropriated. In examining 126 suitable peer-reviewed publications we discovered five research gaps: (1) a lack of research in Asia and South America; (2) a lack of mutual investigation and linkages between impacts and adaptation; (3) a lack of emphasis on mixed crop-livestock systems; (4) a lack of emphasis on monogastric livestock; and (5) an underrepresentation of quantitative methods including yield impact models. The findings suggest that the research on climate change impacts and adaptation in livestock systems needs to move beyond certain geographical contexts and consider key vulnerability priorities, particularly from developing countries. It is pivotal that research begins to jointly look at climate change impacts and the livestock keepers' adaptation to draw out policy implications and to effectively target support for impact-specific adaptation options. Only if such evidence is established, adaptation will be appropriated accordingly to the needs of the livestock sector, and provision for the growing demand of animal-based products will be secured.","[Escarcha, Jacquelyn F.; Lassa, Jonatan A.; Zander, Kerstin K.] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia",Charles Darwin University,"Escarcha, JF (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia.",Jacquelyn.Escarcha@cdu.edu.au; jonatan.lassa@cdu.edu.au; Kerstin.Zander@cdu.edu.au,"Lassa, Jonatan/D-2205-2017; Lassa, Jonatan/M-6112-2019; Zander, Kerstin/M-2888-2013","Lassa, Jonatan/0000-0002-8432-842X; Lassa, Jonatan/0000-0002-8432-842X; Escarcha, Jacquelyn/0000-0003-4607-2117; Zander, Kerstin/0000-0002-2237-1801","Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia","Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia","This paper was conducted as part of a PhD project financially supported by Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia.",,90,46,48,6,33,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,SEP,2018,6,3,,,,,,,54,10.3390/cli6030054,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli6030054,,,17,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,GY2TJ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000448396100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

With effective adaptation management, climate change could lead to increased agricultural productivity. Yet if concurrent challenges are left unaddressed, productivity losses may impede gains. Thus, adaptation to climate change is key both to avoid negative consequences and to benefit from opportunities. This paper conducts the first systematic literature review of scientific and grey literature on climate change related opportunities and challenges in Nordic agriculture, resulting in a complex overview of required adaptation actions. The synthesis on suggested adaptation policies and measures shows that farm based adaptation measures appear to be more abundant and more discussed than policy driven adaptation in the scientific literature. This paper identifies a knowledge gap regarding the complexity of adaptation needs and trade-offs in the Nordic agricultural sector. In conclusion, although the agricultural sector in the Nordic region is facing certain benefits from climate change, this review demonstrates profound challenges related directly to climate change. The synthesis of suggested adaptation actions furthermore indicates that adaptation involve trade-offs, however, increased knowledge on this subject is required. Failing to address these challenges might impede Nordic agriculture's potential gains from climate change in a long-term perspective.","[Wirehn, Lotten] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Wirehn, L (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",lotten.wirehn@liu.se,,"Wirehn, Lotten/0000-0003-4014-1441",Nordic Top-level Research Initiative Sub-programme 'Effects Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change'; Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2013-1557],Nordic Top-level Research Initiative Sub-programme 'Effects Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change'; Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"This paper is a deliverable of the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR), which was funded by the Nordic Top-level Research Initiative Sub-programme 'Effects Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change'.

Creating comfortable and healthy indoor environments is a major consideration for designing smart homes. As handheld devices become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, this paper proposes an innovative use of smart handheld devices (SHD), using MIT App Inventor and fuzzy control, to perform the real-time monitoring and smart control of the designed intelligent windowsill system (IWS) in a smart home. A compact weather station that consists of environment sensors was constructed in the IWS for measuring of indoor illuminance, temperature-humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and outdoor rain and wind direction. According to the measured environment information, the proposed system can automatically send a command to a fuzzy microcontroller performed by Arduino UNO to fully or partly open the electric curtain and electric window for adapting to climate changes in the indoor and outdoor environment. Moreover, the IWS can automatically close windows for rain splashing on the window. The presented novel control method for the windowsill not only expands the SHD applications, but greatly enhances convenience to users. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the IWS, a laboratory prototype was built and confirmed experimentally.","[Wang, Jing-Min; Yang, Ming-Ta; Chen, Po-Lin] St Johns Univ, Dept Elect Engn, 499,Sec 4,Tam King Rd, New Taipei 25135, Taiwan",,"Wang, JM (corresponding author), St Johns Univ, Dept Elect Engn, 499,Sec 4,Tam King Rd, New Taipei 25135, Taiwan.",jimmy@mail.sju.edu.tw; mtyang@mail.sju.edu.tw; a87875169@gmail.com,,"Wang, Jing-Min/0000-0002-0678-4737",,,,,29,14,14,5,49,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,APR,2017,17,4,,,,,,,830,10.3390/s17040830,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s17040830,,,14,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,EU1YU,28398266,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000400822900171,View Full Record in Web of Science

A better knowledge of how temperature affects population health is important not only to the scientific community, but also to the decision-makers who develop and implement early warning systems and intervention strategies to mitigate the health effects of extreme temperatures(1,2). The temperature-health relationship is also of growing interest as climate change is projected to shift the overall temperature distribution higher(3,4). Previous studies have examined the relative risks of temperature-related mortality, but the absolute measure of years of life lost is also useful as it combines the number of deaths with life expectancy. Here we use years of life lost to provide a novel measure of the impact of temperature on mortality in Brisbane, Australia. We also project the future temperature-related years of life lost attributable to climate change. We show that the association between temperature and years of life lost is U-shaped, with increased years of life lost for cold and hot temperatures. The temperature-related years of life lost will worsen greatly if future climate change goes beyond a 2 degrees C increase and without any adaptation to higher temperatures. This study highlights that public health adaptation to climate change is necessary.","[Huang, Cunrui; Barnett, Adrian G.; Tong, Shilu] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia; [Huang, Cunrui; Barnett, Adrian G.; Tong, Shilu] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia; [Wang, Xiaoming] CSIRO, CSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship, Melbourne, Vic 3190, Australia; [Wang, Xiaoming] CSIRO, CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3190, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Queensland; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Huang, CR (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia.",huangcunrui@hotmail.com,"Wang, Xiaoming/A-3804-2008; Huang, Cunrui/ABI-3312-2020; Barnett, Adrian/I-9850-2012; Wang, Xiaoming/A-3804-2008","Wang, Xiaoming/0000-0002-6648-0057; Barnett, Adrian/0000-0001-6339-0374; Wang, Xiaoming/0000-0002-1088-8862",QUTPRA; CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship; National Health and Medical Research Council,QUTPRA; CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"C.H. was supported by a QUTPRA scholarship and CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship Collaboration Fund.

The Ecosystem Approach (EA) is a promising approach for understanding and managing the occurring shifts in the Arctic marine ecosystems. Based on our analysis, we find that assessments conducted by international and regional instruments and institutions, most notably the Arctic Council, as well as the wealth of Indigenous knowledge present in the region, provide valuable starting points for the implementation of EA in the Arctic. Yet, mechanisms for translating knowledge into joint coordinated and integrated action in accordance with EA are currently lacking. Our analysis suggests that incremental steps can be taken now to promote the implementation of EA, while working to establish a more comprehensive governance framework. In our view, bottom-up initiatives may provide the most promising avenue for promoting the application of EA in the region under the current geopolitical circumstances. Support by civil society, Indigenous and conservation organizations, as well as global momentum will be necessary to coordinate, finance and elevate community-driven initiatives. Other opportunities we identify for advancing EA is to engage with sectoral management bodies and to advance EA through climate change adaptation measures.","[Wienrich, Nicole] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies IASS, Arctic Governance & Ocean Governance Grp, Potsdam, Germany; [Buschman, Victoria Qutuuq] Univ Alaska, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Buschman, Victoria Qutuuq] Greenland Inst Nat Resources, Nuuk, Greenland; [Coon, Catherine] Bur Ocean Energy Management, Dept Interior, Anchorage, AK USA; [Fuller, Susanna] Oceans North, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Hennicke, Janos] Fed Agcy Nat Conservat, Head Div, Putbus, Germany; [Humrich, Christoph] Univ Groningen, Dept Int Relat & Int Org, Groningen, Netherlands; [Prip, Christian] Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, Lysaker, Norway; [Wenzel, Lauren] NOAA, Natl Marine Protected Areas Ctr, Silver Spring, MD USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Greenland Institute of Natural Resources; United States Department of the Interior; University of Groningen; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Wienrich, N (corresponding author), Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies IASS, Arctic Governance & Ocean Governance Grp, Potsdam, Germany.",nicole.wienrich@iass-potsdam.de,,"Humrich, Christoph/0000-0002-2914-7001; Buschman, Victoria Qutuuq/0000-0002-0781-642X","German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) through the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) [351983100A]; R&D project on marine conservation in the Arctic - German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) through the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) [351983100A]","German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) through the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN); R&D project on marine conservation in the Arctic - German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) through the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN)","NWs work on this paper was funded by an R&D project on marine conservation in the Arctic, funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) through the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) (grant agreement no. 351983100A).",,46,0,0,3,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

However, the term 'community' in CBA has been frequently used without rigorous reflection on its own meaning, boundary and governance, assuming that a moral license is intuitively granted. The article sets out to critically examine, through a study of the UNDP-GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP), how the concept of community is framed within the paradigm of CBA in Ethiopia and to what extent Ethiopian peasants articulate a shape of community that they consider they belong to. This article contributes to the field of community development in general, and specifically CBA, by exploring a fundamental difference between the governmental construction of community and the practices of community governance by citizens on the ground. Overall, I argue that communities are neither an actor nor a place, but the outcomes of a complex set of power-laden relationships, built on the unique mix of norms, customs, history and private interests. Community boundaries are therefore fluid with heterogeneity inside, and the individual perceptions of the community tend to be idiosyncratic. However, the definition of a community is frequently imposed upon in CBA practice, rather than generated by the groups themselves.","[Chung, Jin-ho] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Transport Studies Unit, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford,"Chung, JH (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Transport Studies Unit, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",jin-ho.chung@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,"Chung, Jin-ho/0000-0002-3587-7676",,,,,71,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This study aimed to analyze projected changes in length of rainy season (LRS), and rainfall extreme indices at the Vea catchment, Ghana. The analysis was performed using high-resolution simulated rainfall data from Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model under moderate greenhouse gas emission scenario for the period 2020-2049 relative to 1981-2010 period. LRS was computed from the difference between rainfall onset and cessation dates, and its trends were assessed using Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator. Annual rainfall intensity and frequency indices were computed. Results showed an increase in mean LRS from 168 to 177 days, which was at a rate of 1 day/year in the future (2020-2049). The LRS increase would be more significant at northern and south-western parts of the catchment. Rainfall intensity and frequency indices are projected to increase at spatial scale across the catchment. Projected changes in rainfall extremes could increase the frequency and intensity of drought and flood events. Thus, it is necessary to integrate suitable climate change adaptation measures such as rainwater harvesting, flood control measures, and development of early warning systems in the planning process by decision-makers at the catchment.","[Larbi, Isaac] Univ Environm & Sustainable Dev, Sch Sustainable Dev, Dept Water Resources & Sustainable Dev, Somanya, Ghana; [Larbi, Isaac; Kwawuvi, Daniel] Univ Abomey Calavi, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Climate Change & Water Resources, Cotonou 03, Benin; [Enoch, Bessah] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, Kumasi, Ghana; [Nyamekye, Clement] Koforidua Tech Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Koforidua, Ghana; [Amuzu, Joshua] West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, CSIR Off Complex,PMB CT 504, Cantonments Accra 0233, Ghana; [Okafor, Gloria C.] Nigeria Maritime Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Gbaramatu, Delta State, Nigeria; [Asare, Yaw Mensah] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geomat Engn, Kumasi, Ghana",University of Abomey Calavi; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Larbi, I (corresponding author), Univ Environm & Sustainable Dev, Sch Sustainable Dev, Dept Water Resources & Sustainable Dev, Somanya, Ghana.;Larbi, I (corresponding author), Univ Abomey Calavi, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Climate Change & Water Resources, Cotonou 03, Benin.",talarbi18@yahoo.com,"AMUZU, Joshua/AAG-2781-2022; AMUZU, Joshua/AFK-3993-2022; Nyamekye, Clement/AAK-1863-2020; Okafor, Gloria Chinwendu/I-7659-2018; Larbi, Isaac/GNH-5792-2022","AMUZU, Joshua/0000-0001-6612-3028; AMUZU, Joshua/0000-0001-6612-3028; Nyamekye, Clement/0000-0002-7719-796X; Okafor, Gloria Chinwendu/0000-0002-2417-713X; Larbi, Isaac/0000-0001-8748-0649; Kwawuvi, Daniel/0000-0002-5068-3386",Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); West African Science Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL),Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); West African Science Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL),The authors sincerely appreciate the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and West African Science Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL; www.wascal.org) for providing financial support to the first author.

Yet, whether and to what extent climate change influences tourism in island countries with tropical weather has not been fully understood. Here, we seek to fill this gap by evaluating the role of climate variables and climate-related extreme events on the number of international tourists in Indonesia empirically. A panel dataset of 5 provinces in Indonesia, which accounted for more than 80 percent of international tourists traveling to Indonesia between 2008 and 2018, was used to perform a feasible generalized least square (FGLS) regression. Consistent with previous findings, the empirical results show that both temperature and relative humidity particularly explain the variations in the number of international tourists in Indonesia. Every 1% increment of temperature and relative humidity is associated with a decrease in the number of international tourists in Indonesia by 1.37% and 0.59%, respectively. This study also suggests that the effect of climate change and climate-related extreme events is not homogeneous among tourists from different regions.

This research describes a participatory integrated assessment process aimed at exploring the options, opportunities, necessary capacities and implications for institutional co-operation and innovation in the Iberian Peninsula under High-End Climate Change (HECC). Using in-depth interviews and a novel participatory research approach, different scenario narratives and pathways about the future of Iberia have been identified using Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Special attention is given to the knowledge and policy options needed to implement cross-border organizational changes and co-operation mechanisms that would support the Integrated Climate Governance of the Tagus and Guadiana river basins. We show that a wealth of institutional innovation pathways and specific options and solutions exist not only to reduce GHG emissions (mitigation) and the negative impacts of climate change (adaptation), but, above all, to generate new forms of social-ecological system interactions aligned with sustainability (transformation). In particular, and depending on which scenario contexts unfold in the future in Iberia, different kinds of institutional and governance capacities and clusters of solutions may be needed in order to achieve transformation.","[David Tabara, Joan; Cots, Francesc] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Pedde, Simona; Kok, Kasper] Wageningen Univ & Res, Soil Geog & Landscape Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Holscher, Katharina; Frantzeskaki, Niki] Erasmus Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dutch Res Inst Transit, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Lovanova, Anastasia] Potsdam Inst Climate Change Impact Res, Telegraphenberg A31, D-14437 Potsdam, Germany; [Lourenco, Tiago Capela] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Etherington, John] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit Sci, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Wageningen University & Research; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Universidade de Lisboa; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Tabara, JD (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",joandavid.tabara@uab.cat; xesco45@hotmail.com; simona.pedde@wur.nl; holscher@fsw.eur.nl; kasper.kok@wur.nl; lobanova@pik-potsdam.de; tcapela@fc.ul.pt; n.frantzeskaki@drift.eur.nl; john.etherington@uab.es,"Lourenço, Tiago Capela/B-4947-2008; Frantzeskaki, Niki/AAN-1044-2021","Lourenço, Tiago Capela/0000-0002-8796-5993; Frantzeskaki, Niki/0000-0002-6983-448X; Pedde, Simona/0000-0002-4227-4013; Tabara, J.

These risks require responses from cities to improve their resilience. Policymakers need to understand current adaptation spend to plan comprehensively and effectively. Through the measurement of spend in the newly defined 'adaptation economy', we analyse current climate change adaptation efforts in ten megacities. In all cases, the adaptation economy remains a small part of the overall economy, representing a maximum of 0.33% of a city's gross domestic product (here referred to as GDPc). Differences in total spend are significant between cities in developed, emerging and developing countries, ranging from 15 pound million to 1,600 pound million. Comparing key subsectors, we demonstrate the differences in adaptation profiles. Developing cities have higher proportional spend on health and agriculture, whereas developed cities have higher spend on energy and water. Spend per capita and percentage of GDPc comparisons more clearly show disparities between cities. Developing country cities spend half the proportion of GDPc and significantly less per capita, suggesting that adaptation spend is driven by wealth rather than the number of vulnerable people. This indicates that current adaptation activities are insufficient in major population centres in developing and emerging economies.","[Georgeson, Lucien; Maslin, Mark; Poessinouw, Martyn] UCL, Dept Geog, Pearson Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Poessinouw, Martyn; Howard, Steve] KMatrix Ltd, Greetham House, Greetham LE15 7NF, Rutland, England",University of London; University College London,"Georgeson, L (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Geog, Pearson Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",lucien.georgeson.13@ucl.ac.uk,,"Maslin, Mark/0000-0001-9957-3463",ESRC; NERC [ES/J500185/1]; Royal Society; GLA; Defra; BIS; Economic and Social Research Council [1335713] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J500185/1] Funding Source: UKRI,"ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Royal Society(Royal Society of London); GLA; Defra(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); BIS; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","The authors would like to thank S.

The present study aims to assess the potential drought hazard at present, as well as determine future different climate change scenarios based on the data of monthly precipitation and temperature. Drought is defined using the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index. The probability density function of SPEI was used to create the drought hazard index (DH), which provides a comprehensive overview of the frequency and intensity of drought events. The statistical downscale method was used to convert the regional climate model output grid data into meteorological station data for the near future (2020-2050) under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The results showed that in the baseline (1981-2010), DH is much serious in Jilin compared with Henan. In the near future (2020-2050), DH increases in the case of RCP8.5, and the increased scale is larger in Henan. In the case of RCP4.5, the DH will be flat with baseline in Jilin and slightly increase in Henan. DH may relieve in case of RCP2.6. The results can help to optimize agriculture allocation and policy making with regard to climate change adaptation.","[Zhang, Qi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Appl Meteorol, Jiangsu Key Lab Agr Meteorol, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiquan] NE Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Northeast Normal University - China,"Zhang, JQ (corresponding author), NE Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.",zhangjq022@nenu.edu.cn,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41501553, 41571491, 31400416]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu [BK20150898]; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST [2014r052]; National Key Technology R&D Program of China [2011BAD32B00-04]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST; National Key Technology R&D Program of China(National Key Technology R&D Program),"This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 41501553, 41571491 and 31400416, the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu under Grant No. BK20150898, the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST under Grant No. 2014r052 and National Key Technology R&D Program of China under Grant No. 2011BAD32B00-04.",,23,31,33,3,61,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Although climate change is clearly a global problem, many of the solutions will be implemented at the local level. To explore this issue, the aim of this research was to examine regional variation in climate change response across New South Wales (NSW). To this end, between September 2010 and September 2011, we reviewed publicly available council and regional documentations for all NSW councils. The indicators of response examined were based on the NSW Greenhouse Plan (2005). These were awareness-raising, emissions reduction and adaptation planning. It was found that councils were undertaking many practical projects to fulfil the goals of this plan. As a result, they are abating significant quantities of emissions. Adaptation is progressing through the development of risk-based climate change adaptation plans. Councils are addressing particular areas of management, such as water management, assisted by guidelines which incorporate consideration for climate change as part of best practice. While overall responses to this threat are progressing, a distinct urban bias in action has been observed, due to biases in policy and funding arrangements.","[Fallon, Dale S.

The electric power sector is the foundation of economic activity as well as a core participant in the adaptation and mitigation of climate change. Therefore, in the context of climate change, it is crucial for the stable operation of the national economy for power sector to cope with different climate change risks and improve their adaptability to climate change. In this paper, listed power companies in China are selected as samples to analyse the impact of climate change risk on the financial performance of the power system's supply and transmission -distribution sides. The empirical results show a significant positive correlation between climate change risks and the financial performance of listed electric power companies. The rainfall index and drought index positively impact the financial performance of listed electric power companies. The cryogenic freezing index has a negative impact on the financial performance of listed electric power companies., which is further analysed and proved that a cryogenic freezing disaster will cause the regional breakdown of the power system. The operating cost ratio and the proportion of clean energy supply play a mediating effect on the correlation between the comprehensive climate risk index and the return on equity of companies. To increase electric power companies' ability to adapt to climate change, climate change risks should be integrated into the risk man-agement framework, and the company's financial performance can be improved by optimizing the energy mix and constructing safe lines. The government can promote the transformation of electric power companies by launching green financial tools.","[Sun, Yongping] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst State Governance, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yongping; Zou, Ya] Hubei Univ Econ, Ctr Hubei Cooperat Innovat Emiss Trading Syst, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yongping; Jiang, Jingning] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zou, Ya] Hubei Univ Econ, Accounting Sch, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ying] State Grid Shiyan Elect Power Supply Co, Shiyan, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Hubei University of Economics; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Hubei University of Economics,"Yang, Y (corresponding author), State Grid Shiyan Elect Power Supply Co, Shiyan, Peoples R China.",yangying95129@163.com,"Sun, Yongping/HLX-8943-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [72074069],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Acknowledgment This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 72074069) .

First, we need to understand the processes that mediate perceptions of environmental change and the behavioural responses at the levels of the individual and the local population. Second, we should take into account the process of production and dissemination of global and national climate information and models to regional and local populations, especially small farmers. We discuss the sociocultural and environmental diversity of small farmers in the Amazon and their susceptibility to climate change associated with drought, flooding and accidental fire. Using survey, ethnographic and archival data from study areas in the state of Para, we discuss farmers' sources of knowledge and long-term memory of climatic events, drought and accidental fire; their sources of climate information; their responses to drought and fire events and the impact of changing rainfall patterns on land use. We highlight the challenges of adaptation to climate change created by the influence of migration and family turnover on collective action and memory, the mismatch of scales used to monitor and disseminate climate data and the lack of extension services to translate large-scale forecasts to local needs. We found that for most farmers, memories of extended drought tend to decrease significantly after 3 years. Over 50% of the farmers interviewed in 2002 did not remember as significant the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drought of 1997/1998. This helps explain why approximately 40% of the farmers have not changed their land-use behaviours in the face of the strongest ENSO event of the twentieth century.","[Brondizio, Eduardo S.; Moran, Emilio F.] Indiana Univ, Dept Anthropol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Brondizio, Eduardo S.; Moran, Emilio F.] Indiana Univ, Anthropol Ctr Training & REs Global Environm Chan, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Brondizio, Eduardo S.; Moran, Emilio F.] Indiana Univ, Ctr Study Inst Populat & Environm Change, Bloomington, IN 47406 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Brondizio, ES (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Anthropol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",ebrondiz@indiana.edu,"Brondizio, Eduardo/R-7643-2019; Moran, Emilio/T-7456-2019",,,,,,31,87,99,2,65,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

The term 'systems' refers to the supportive economic and social systems as well as agricultural industries. The aim of the study was to evaluate how the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems is supported given the anticipated challenges of climatic changes. The conceptual framework of adaptive capacity was employed to evaluate progress towards improving adaptation and resilience. Eight key indicators of adaptive capacity formed the evaluative criteria, and were applied to a wide range of publicly available documents relevant to the Western Australian rangelands. Progress towards building adaptive capacity was also evaluated by classifying the documents as 'aspirational', 'in action' or 'assessed'. The institutional support for adaptive capacity was found to be adequate, as there was sufficient evidence that relevant institutions were providing mechanisms for social, economic and environmental adaptation in the face of climate change. The viability of the agricultural systems of the Western Australian rangelands has been in decline for some time and, therefore, the degree to which efforts to improve adaptive capacity have been successful was difficult to assess. There were methodological limitations of this research due to the limited breadth of available data and subjectivity within the data analysis process, which may have inhibited the accuracy of the findings and recommendations. Also difficulties inherent in quantifying social, economic and environmental processes at differing geographic and temporal scales, were apparent. This raises important questions regarding the extent to which the literature is able to appropriately reflect actual adaptation within the rangelands, and the extent to which stakeholders (community, pastoralists and regional organisations) perceive that adequate institutional support is being provided.","[Shawa, Ellena; Witt, G.

This progress report provides a reading of contemporary research on vulnerability to climate change through a political economic lens. It interprets the research as explaining the interplay between ideas about vulnerability, the institutions that create vulnerability, and those actors with interests in vulnerability. It highlights research that critiques the idea of vulnerability, and that demonstrates the agency of those at risk as they navigate the intersecting, multi-scalar and teleconnected institutions that shape their choices in adapting to climate change. The report also highlights research that is tracking the way powerful institutions and interests that create vulnerability are themselves adapting by appropriating the cause of the vulnerable, depoliticising the causes of vulnerability, and promoting innovations in finance and markets as solutions.

This paper uses a careful designed household survey in South China that considers an exogenous shock of drought, to determine whether the presence of natural and planted forests near rice-producing villages can reduce the adverse effects of drought on rice yield. After controlling for local climate and water infrastructure, we find robust evidence that natural forests and not planted forests have significant positive effects on rice yield, due to their influence on the availability of water for irrigation. Although drought hinders farmers' access to irrigation, which negatively affects rice yield, forests near villages provide protection for rice against drought. These findings support the adoption of forest ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) to cope with climate change and enhance food security.","[Wang, Yangjie; Chen, Xiaohong] Cent S Univ, Resource Conserving & Environm Friendly Soc, Sch Business, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yangjie; Chen, Xiaohong] Cent S Univ, Ecol Civilizat Collaborat Innovat Ctr Hunan Prov, Sch Business, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jikun] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiaohong] Hunan Univ Commerce, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Central South University; Central South University; Peking University; Hunan University of Technology & Business,"Huang, JK (corresponding author), Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, 4th Floor,Wangkezhen Bldg,5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"chen, xia/GXM-5435-2022; chen, xia/GYR-3948-2022; chen, xi/GXH-3653-2022",,"Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research [ADP/2010/070]; National Natural Science Foundation of China in China [71503276, 71790615, 71333013, 71431006, 71873148]; Ministry of Science and Technology [2012CB955700]; Ministry of Education [16JZD013]","Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research; National Natural Science Foundation of China in China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Ministry of Education","We acknowledge the financial support from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ADP/2010/070), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71503276, 71790615, 71333013, 71431006, 71873148) in China, the Ministry of Science and Technology (2012CB955700), and the Ministry of Education (16JZD013) for research in different provinces of this study.",,70,6,7,10,56,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

The adaptation policy entails the accumulation of a particular sort of capital that will eliminate or reduce the catastrophic damage of an abrupt climate change when (and if) it occurs. The occurrence date is uncertain. The policy problem involves balancing the tradeoffs between the (certain) investment cost prior to occurrence and the benefit (in reduced damage) that will be realized after the (uncertain) occurrence date. For stationary economies the optimal adaptation capital converges monotonically to a steady state. In most cases, investment begins immediately. However, if the initial adaptation capital exceeds a pre-specified threshold level, which lies above the optimal steady state, investment is delayed while the capital stock decreases (due to depreciation) and commences only when it reaches this threshold level. For growing economies the optimal adaptation capital stock approaches the maximal economic level above which further accumulation is ineffective.","[Tsur, Yacov] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Withagen, Cees] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HAV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Withagen, C (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HAV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",tsur@agri.huji.ac.il; cwithagen@feweb.vu.nl,,,,,,,18,15,15,0,26,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Ultimately models should elicit 'projected equilibrium', when achievements match expectations. Should we support this tendency, or should we set moral limits for the sake of freedom of choice of all generations? How should we view adaptation to climate change in the context of intergenerational ethics? Taking the Stern review as a background, this paper suggests that the use of fully integrated models for policy-making meets ethical difficulties and is caught up in paradoxes. The more we consider a long-term future, the more modelling should be disentangled and split into separate scenarios. It is also suggested that the focus of modelling should not be on maximisation of per capita consumption, but on how ecological capacities and human capabilities can be maintained or developed over time.","PREG X, Lab Econometrie, Dept Humanites & Sci Sociales, F-75005 Paris, France",heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM),"Godard, O (corresponding author), PREG X, Lab Econometrie, Dept Humanites & Sci Sociales, 1 Rue Descartes, F-75005 Paris, France.",olivier.godard@shs.polytechnique.fr,,,,,,,43,3,3,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-0188,1743-2790,,INTERDISCIPL SCI REV,Interdiscip.

A way to improve the quality of climate impact assessments is to increase the science-stakeholder collaboration, and in a two-way dialog link empirical experience and impact modelling with policy and strategies for sustainable management. In this paper we give a brief overview of different ecosystem modelling methods, discuss how to include ecological and management aspects, and highlight the importance of science-stakeholder communication.

Traditional geothermal modeling relied on the so-called n-factor approach where the ground surface temperature was represented as the air temperature multiplied by some factor to account for ground surface effects. The application of surface energy balance formulations where the effects of the building including long wave radiation can be incorporated, allows for a more accurate representation of the geothermal regime under the structure. In considering the impact of climate warming on the performance of raised buildings in permafrost terrain, the use of a surface energy balance in the geothermal model is considered to be a more rigorous and technically preferable approach to addressing this problem. This paper addresses the use of a surface energy balance formulation in the geothermal analysis of raised buildings construction in permafrost terrain and its impact on the long-term geothermal regime. Specifically, the impact of building construction on the underlying geothermal regime have direct implication to the ongoing discussion regarding the need for climate change adaptation to address potential foundation capacity degradation in light of climate warming. Both existing field data and geothermal modeling results presented in this paper demonstrate that ground temperatures under a raised building cool over time and become colder than the ground remote from the building. When long-term climate warming is considered, the ground temperatures at depth do warm, but after 20years of climate warming the ground temperatures under the building are still not warmer than the initial ground temperatures remote from the building.","[Oswell, J.

However, a strikingly prominent greening is expected to occur on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau until the end of this century. Future warming can not only exacerbate the difficulties of vegetation conservation and restoration in vulnerable ecological regions, also threaten these new croplands, stymieing ambitions to increase crop production in China.

We discuss the relevance of the resilience concept in the tourism industry and recommend that tourists' experiences should be enhanced by applying the findings of research on tourists' motivations and landscape perception and developing more adaptation-oriented research. The findings suggest that the glacier tourism industry can reduce its vulnerability to climate change through increased collaboration between tourism operators and climate and tourism researchers.","[Salim, Emmanuel; Ravanel, Ludovic; Deline, Philip; Gauchon, Christophe] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, CNRS, Edytem, Le Bourget Du L, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie,"Salim, E (corresponding author), Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, CNRS, Edytem, Le Bourget Du L, France.",emmanuel.salim@univ-smb.fr,"Salim, Emmanuel/AAM-8059-2020; Salim, Emmanuel/GLU-6113-2022; Deline, Philip/AFR-6521-2022","Salim, Emmanuel/0000-0003-4182-9395; ",Labex ITEM [ANR 10-LABX-0050]; ALCOTRA n342 AdaPT Mont Blanc project,Labex ITEM; ALCOTRA n342 AdaPT Mont Blanc project,This work was supported by Labex ITEM: [Grant Number ANR 10-LABX-0050]; ALCOTRA n342 AdaPT Mont Blanc project: [Grant Number Interreg V-A Italy-France 2014-2020 program].,,96,16,16,7,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1502-2250,1502-2269,,SCAND J HOSP TOUR,Scand.

In this multidisciplinary setting, actors, from their different backgrounds, frame both issues and solutions differently. To resolve conflicts, it is important to recognize - and to not ignore the existence of contending social framings. A better understanding is needed of how actors frame issues and solutions in integrated river basin management. To gain this better understanding, semi-structured interviews were conducted with Dutch river basin management actors following Sense-making methodology. Three challenges were identified where respondents framed both the issue and solution differently: (1) creating flexibility in a controlled river system; (2) sustaining the integrated approach in the maintenance of floodplains; and (3) formulating future river basin management policies to adapt to climate change. Cultural Theory was subsequently used to analyse how respondents construct perspectives towards these challenges. The analysis showed how actors use different rationalities in constructing these perspectives. As an implication, it is important for actors to recognize and acknowledge these perspectives in integrated river basin management decision-making. New tools, embedded in learning environments, are needed to facilitate exchanging and understanding actors' perspectives.","[den Haan, R. J.; van der Voort, M.

Design/methodology/approach - Vulnerability was assessed using the Vulnerability to Resilience and the Climate Vulnerability and Capacity frameworks. Findings - The major indicators and drivers of vulnerability were identified as droughts, flash floods, poor soil fertility and out-migration leaving female-and child-headed households. From sensitivity analysis, it was shown that different areas within the district considered different biophysical and socioeconomic indicators to climate change and variability. They also considered different vulnerability indicators to influence the decisions for adaptation to climate change and variability. Originality/value - The results of this study indicate that the area and cropping systems are greatly exposed and are sensitive to climatic change stimuli, as shown by the decline in main cereal grain yield. These results also showed that there is a need to define and map local area vulnerability as a basis to recommend coping and adaptationmeasures to counter climate change hazards.","[Jiri, Obert; Mafongoya, Paramu L.; Chivenge, Pauline] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Scottsville, South Africa; [Jiri, Obert] Univ Zimbabwe, Fac Agr, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Chivenge, Pauline] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Zimbabwe; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT),"Jiri, O (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Scottsville, South Africa.;Jiri, O (corresponding author), Univ Zimbabwe, Fac Agr, Harare, Zimbabwe.",obertjiri@yahoo.co.uk,"Chivenge, Pauline/AAF-9976-2019",,"National Research Foundation of South Africa through the Research Chair: Agronomy and Rural Development, University of KwaZulu- Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa","National Research Foundation of South Africa through the Research Chair: Agronomy and Rural Development, University of KwaZulu- Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa","This study was funded by the National Research Foundation of South Africa through the Research Chair: Agronomy and Rural Development, University of KwaZulu- Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",,43,1,1,1,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

We refer to these arrangements as 'meta-organisations' that comprise many autonomous component organisations tackling adaptation. The meta-organisations set standards, define purposes, and specify appropriate means-ends criteria for delivering adaptation. Using empirical data from the three cases, Nepal, Pakistan and Ghana, the study identifies and analyses six attributes of the meta and component organisational structures. We argue that organisational structures are crucial to understanding adaptation, specifying policy and implementation. Our analysis demonstrates that while each country promotes similar objectives, the emerging structures are quite distinct, shaped by country-specific attributes and issues that lead to different outcomes. Nepal's priority for a formal process has come at the cost of delayed implementation. Pakistan's devolved approach lacks legitimacy to scale up the process nationally. Ghana's use of existing decentralised structures and budgets relegates adaptation below other development priorities. These divergent structures arise from the different needs for legitimacy and accountability, and the relative priority attached to adaptation against other needs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Eight East and West African cities were included in the review: Accra, Addis Ababa, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Douala, Kampala, Ibadan and Nairobi. The review focuses on urban livelihoods, ecosystem services and urban policy responses as pathways to mediating climate change. Literature on UPAF indicates emerging consensus on the potential of UPAF in adaptation, but less agreement with respect to mitigation of climate change. African cities are implementing several measures including UPAF to address issues of development, reduce inequality and move towards low emissions development strategies. This calls for integrated urban development that supports green growth to harness economic opportunities with social and environmental benefits. The review reveals that through UPAF, the potential for mitigation and adaptation of climate change can address some development deficit issues and transform institutions at the city-regional level by leveraging good UPAF practices.","[Lwasa, Shuaib; Mugagga, Frank] Makerere Univ, Sch Forestry Environm & Geog Sci, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Climat Sci, Kampala, Uganda; [Wahab, Bolanle] Univ Ibadan, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Simon, David] Univ London, Dept Geog, Royal Holloway, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Connors, John P.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Griffith, Corrie] Arizona State Univ, Int Project Off, IHDP Urbanizat & Global Environm Change Project, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Makerere University; University of Ibadan; University of London; Royal Holloway University London; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Lwasa, S (corresponding author), Makerere Univ, Sch Forestry Environm & Geog Sci, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Climat Sci, Kampala, Uganda.",shuaiblwasa@gmail.com,"Lwasa, Shuaib/G-3723-2014; Mugagga, Frank/AAA-2937-2021; Wahab, Bolanle/AAE-9806-2020","Lwasa, Shuaib/0000-0003-4312-2836; mugagga, frank/0000-0002-8426-0736; Simon, David/0000-0002-3164-4138","Global Systems Analysis, Research and Training (START); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1229429] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Global Systems Analysis, Research and Training (START); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This was prepared following research with support of several individuals.

An empirical analysis was conducted in Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, the three countries that share the Pantanal, which identified the hybrid basis of the policy framework under construction, in the sense that it actually combines elements of various institutional responses included in the proposed typology. Important factors that seem to undermine the efficacy of institutional responses in addressing climate change in the region are the strong influence of the agribusiness sector and the still relatively low importance of the Pantanal for national environmental policy-making.

Another category that refers to measures that address more than one category of climate change was also added. The evaluation of the identified adaptation options was based on a self-administered semi-structured questionnaire. The identified adaptation measures were graded according to the following criteria: efficiency of the measure, urgency of implementing the measure, usefulness of implementation irrespective of climate change, technical difficulty, contribution to climate change adaptation, economic viability and social acceptance.

At the same time, there are growing concerns on when intervention is most appropriate, the transaction costs of coordination, and the adequacy of institutional capacity at local levels, especially in developing countries. This article examines entry points and mechanisms for integrating concerns with climate change into local development planning in Cambodia. An institutional ethnography of the planning process indicates that subnational planning is participatory and flexible; and thus, provides plausible entry points to integrate climate change concerns. Case study methods applied to two externally supported, climate-resilient development projects identify promising mechanisms and strategies, as well as obstacles to integration. A vulnerability reduction assessment tool and top-up grant scheme both included promising deliberative and participatory elements from which lessons for future and elsewhere can be drawn. At the same time, key stakeholders concede that local integration more widely is hampered by multiple obstacles, including weak institutional capacity, low community participation, and lack of resources and incentives. Addressing these challenges requires political commitments for good governance, capacity development, and additional resources.","[Dany, Va] Bond Univ, Gold Coast, Australia; [Dany, Va] Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Dept Environm, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Lebel, Louis] Chiang Mai Univ, Unit Social & Environm Res, Fac Social Sci, Chiang Mai, Thailand",Bond University; Chiang Mai University,"Dany, V (corresponding author), Bond Univ, Gold Coast, Australia.;Dany, V (corresponding author), Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Dept Environm, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.",,,,,,,,68,6,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1541-132X,1541-1338,,REV POLICY RES,Rev.

The natural resource portfolio literature includes applications in fisheries, forestry, agriculture, spatial planning, invasive pest and disease surveillance, climate change adaptation, and biodiversity conservation, among others. We contribute to this growing literature by proposing a set of essential questions to guide the development and implementation of empirical port folios for natural resource management that deal with (1) the nature and objectives of the portfolio manager, (2) the definition of assets to be included in the portfolio, (3) the way in which returns and risk are measured and distributed, and (4) the definition of constraints in the programming problem. The approach is illustrated using landings data from the Colombian Pacific, a data limited fishery, to set catch limits in fisheries at the ecosystem level. We also develop a set of constraints in the programming problem to simulate potential policy options regarding resource sustainability and social equity. The resulting efficient catch portfolios can be used to optimize the flow of provisioning ecosystem services from this fishery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Still, actionable policy that meets ambitious goals of equitable, efficient and efficacious action has fallen woefully short of requirements. Mainstreaming of climate policy into existing development planning has been suggested as a way out of this impasse. India's central anti-poverty scheme, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has become part of the 'mainstreamed' policy agenda. It is the largest Public Works Programme in the world today but has not been subjected to sufficient research scrutiny for its climate role. The paper attempts to fill this knowledge gap. It locates the climate-development role of the MGNREGA before subjecting it to a critical evaluation. It argues that conceptually, the MGNREGA meets basic normative requirements for mainstreamed adaptation action but that functional and methodological limitations prevent it from taking on a more purposeful role. Though the scheme is not transformative in nature, it can become part of a multi-pronged strategy to reduce vulnerability to climate change in India and possibly other developing countries.","Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragr, N-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Adam, HN (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragr, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",hans.adam@nmbu.no,"Adam, Hans/AAG-7786-2021","Adam, Hans/0000-0001-9810-5262",,,,,64,17,17,1,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

However, in the countries of the Congo Basin forests receive very little attention in national planning and policies. Climate change is not currently considered in decisions and long-term forest management plans in these countries. This paper demonstrates that: (1) Congo Basin forests are needed for adaptation because they can help to decrease human vulnerability to climate change; and (2) Congo Basin forest management practices need to be adapted to accommodate climate change because these forests are vulnerable to climate change. A framework for facilitating adaptation in forestry is discussed and a review of adaptive actions presented. The paper recommends the adoption of sustainable forest management approach that includes a climate change focus. Such management should not only avoid any adverse effects on the forest resources and conservation of biodiversity, but also provides opportunities for greater, more sustainable rural development and poverty alleviation through income generation and employment opportunities.

The results indicate that the grassland will show a steadily upgrowing trend under the coordinated environmental sustainability (CES) scenario. Compared to the CES scenario, the rate of increase in grassland cover is lower, while the rate of increase in urban land cover will be higher under the rapid economic growth (REG) scenario. Although the conversion from cropland to grassland will reduce the energy flux, the expansion of urban area and decreasing of forestry area will bring about more energy flux. As a whole, the energy flux of near surface will obviously not change under the CES scenario, and the climate therefore will not be possible to be influenced greatly by land cover change. The energy flux under the REG scenario is higher than that under the CES scenario. Those research conclusions can offer valuable information for the land use planning and climate change adaptation in the semiarid grassland area of China.","[Jiang, Qun'ou; Zhang, Wei] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Tang, Chengcai] Beijing Int Studies Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Beijing 100024, Peoples R China; [Ma, Enjun] China Univ Geosci, Sch Math & Phys, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Yongwei] Hubei Univ, Fac Resources & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430062, Hubei, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University; Beijing International Studies University; China University of Geosciences; Hubei University,"Jiang, QO (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",jiangqo.dls@163.com,"Tang, Chengcai/AAB-5615-2022","Tang, Chengcai/0000-0001-5845-1881","New Teachers' Scientific Research Program; Beijing Forestry University [BLX2012044]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2010CB950900]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [TD2011-03]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71225005, 41171434, 41071343]",New Teachers' Scientific Research Program; Beijing Forestry University; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by the New Teachers' Scientific Research Program funded by Beijing Forestry University (no.

These impacts can get even worse due to potential climate change impacts. The urban areas of the Simeto River Valley (SRV), the largest river valley in Sicily (Italy), have been repeatedly hit by intense rainfall events in the last decades that lead to urban flooding, causing several damages and, in some instances, threats to population. In this paper, we present the results of a 10-question survey on climate change and risk perception in 11 municipalities of the SRV carried out within the activities of the LIFE project SimetoRES, which allowed to collect 1143 feedbacks from the residents. The survey investigated: (a) the level of worry about climate change in relation to extreme storms, (b) elements of urban flooding risk preparedness: the direct experience of the residents during heavy rain events, their trust in a civil protection regional alert system, and their knowledge of the correct behavior in case of flood, and (c) the willingness of citizens to implement sustainable drainage actions for climate change adaptation in their own municipality and real estates. The results show that more than 52% of citizens has inadequate knowledge of the correct behavior during flooding events and only 30% of them feel responsible for mitigation of flooding risk. There is a modest willingness by the population to support the construction of sustainable urban drainage infrastructures. A statistical cross-analysis of the answers to the different questions, based on contingency matrices and conditional frequencies, has shown that a greater worry about climate change has no significant impact either on the behavior of people in dangerous situations occurring during flooding events or on the willingness to support financially sustainable solutions. These results suggest that to build a higher worry about climate change and related urban flooding risk is not sufficient to have better preparedness, and that more direct educative actions are necessary in the area.","[Nanni, Paola; Peres, David J.; Musumeci, Rosaria E.; Cancelliere, Antonino] Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, I-95123 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Nanni, P (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",paola.nanni@unict.it; djperes@dica.unict.it; rosaria.musumeci@unict.it; antonino.cancelliere@unict.it,,"Nanni, Paola/0000-0001-5422-3697; Musumeci, Rosaria Ester/0000-0002-1022-0571",EU project LIFE SimetoRES [IT-LIFE17_CCA_IT_000115]; municipality of Paterno; municipality of Ragalna; municipality of SantaMaria di Licodia; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of the University of Catania,EU project LIFE SimetoRES; municipality of Paterno; municipality of Ragalna; municipality of SantaMaria di Licodia; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of the University of Catania,"Thiswork has been partly funded by the EUproject LIFE SimetoRES (IT-LIFE17_CCA_IT_000115), whose partners are the municipalities of Paterno, Ragalna, SantaMaria di Licodia and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of the University of Catania.",,65,4,4,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9276,,RESOURCES-BASEL,Resources-Basel,MAR,2021,10,3,,,,,,,25,10.3390/resources10030025,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources10030025,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,RE5FM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000634179800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there are big differences between the statistics of rainfall extremes obtained using future rainfall time series produced from various climate models. Such large uncertainties create a la of confusion in establishing climate change adaptation measures. Looking at future rainfall extremes at a particular site yields increasing trends in some climate models and decreasing trends in others. The spatial patterns of rate of change in rainfall extremes also vary widely, depending on the climate model. As a result, they often do not gain the public's trust. We believe that this difficulty in obtaining credibility does not come from a lack of theory or technique, but from an approach that persuades the public of uncertain future rainfall extremes. In this study, we employed a novel approach to integrate a co-variate of the not-stationary Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) - Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) model identified at each site with its future projection information for obtaining future rainfall extreme ensembles. Rainfall extremes are obtained from the observed rainfall time series using the POT method, and the scale parameter among GPD parameters are applied as a function of surface air temperature (SAT) or dew-point temperature (DPT). M this time, the threshold of the POT series is set to match the results of frequency analysis of the annual maximum series and the POT series for each site as much as possible. The behavior of future rainfall extremes is analyzed by inputting the future SAT or DAT produced from various climate models into the non-stationary frequency model using the co-variate. As a result of comparing the rainfall extremes obtained using the future rainfall time series directly with the future rainfall extremes obtained indirectly using the proposed method, it was found that the proposed approach projected future design rainfall depths with much less variation between climate models. The spatial pattern of rate of change was also consistent regardless of climate model. The proposed method is expected to contribute to the public's confidence in future rainfall extremes under climate change scenarios and to be of practical help in formulating reasonable climate change adaptation policies.","[Lee, Okjeong] Pukyong Natl Univ, Environm Res Inst, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Sim, Inkyeong] Pukyong Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst Sci Major Environm Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Kim, Sangdan] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea",Pukyong National University; Pukyong National University; Pukyong National University,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea.",skim@pknu.ac.kr,,"Sim, Inkyeong/0000-0002-4018-2625; Lee, Okjeong/0000-0001-5442-7024",Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) - Ministry of Environment [83073]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [NRF2019R1A2C1003114],"Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) - Ministry of Environment(Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI)Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)",This work is supported by the Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) grant funded by the Ministry of Environment (83073).

Psychologists have an important role to play in developing interventions and communication strategies to help people understand and cope with climate change impacts. Through a review of the literature, we identify three guiding insights for strategies to promote adaptive coping and resilience to climate change stress. First, it is unlikely that one single correct or best way of communicating about adaptive coping with climate change exists, but there are established best practices communicators can follow. Second, in implementing these best practices, practitioners must attend to the impact of variability in the nature of different kinds of stress caused by climate change, as well as individual differences in how people chronically respond to stressors. Third, because individuals, communities, and ecosystems are interconnected, work on adaptive coping to climate change must address individual coping in the context of community and ecosystem resilience. These insights from psychological science can be leveraged to promote human flourishing despite increasing stressors posed by climate change.","[Mah, Andrea Y.

Using data from 710 households in Ghana, we showed that only 33 and 15% of cocoa producing families acquire sufficient income from cocoa to reach 'living income' according to World Bank assumptions with respectively actual yields with a farmgate price of 3435 $ t(-1 )and double yields with a farmgate price of 1150 $ t(-1). Besides price and yield incentives, agroforestry for climate change adaptation and preservation of other ecosystem services (e.g. greenhouse gas mitigation) should be promoted, while recognizing that farmer's willingness to invest in tree planting links with informal rights for trees and customary tenure systems. Finally, extension services and communal measures that mediate overall wellbeing should be complementary measures. In conclusion, we advocate for a interdisciplinary science-based approach that respects specific contextual socio-political systems to intensify cocoa production.","[Boeckx, Pascal; Bauters, Marijn] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Green Chem & Technol, Isotope Biosci Lab, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Dewettinck, Koen] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Food Technol Safety & Hlth, Food Struct & Funct Res Grp, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"Boeckx, P (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Green Chem & Technol, Isotope Biosci Lab, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Pascal.Boeckx@ugent.be,"Dewettinck, Koen/AAE-7086-2019","Dewettinck, Koen/0000-0002-5984-932X",OECD Co-operative Research Programme: Biological Resource Management for Sustainable Agricultural Systems,OECD Co-operative Research Programme: Biological Resource Management for Sustainable Agricultural Systems(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),"The concept for this paper was developed at the workshop on Climate Change, Reactive Nitrogen, Food Security and Sustainable Agriculture that took place in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, on 15-16 April 2019, and which was sponsored by the OECD Co-operative Research Programme: Biological Resource Management for Sustainable Agricultural Systems.",,42,5,6,2,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

The EU's common agricultural policy (CAP) has evolved from rules which supported the farming sector after years of famine and has become oriented towards looking at environmental aspects. The CAP policies oriented towards optimizing natural resource use, residue management, antimicrobial use reduction, the decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and animal welfare, need educational programs linked to the environmental problems. In this context, veterinarians are experts in animal production, welfare, food safety, and its technology and in public health under the One Health concept. Unfortunately, they are barely trained in environmental aspects, which would help them to understand and face the consequences of climate change in the rural world. Veterinarians must be able to quantify the effects of animal production in the environment by using different analysis tools, which need to be included in their learning programs. In addition, they must be able to optimize the use of natural resources, minimize GHG emissions, and manage the risks associated with climate change. Environmental concerns have become priority issues over the last third of the 20th century. The EU's common agricultural policy (CAP) has gone from rules which supported the farming sector after years of famine to being oriented towards looking at environmental aspects.

In semi-arid pastoral regions, extreme drought is harmful to livestock production and to vulnerable human communities and livelihoods. In this study, we considered extreme drought in semi-arid regions and investigated climate adaptations taken by the local vulnerable households and their effects on livestock production. We first analyzed the characteristics of spatio-temporal variation of extreme drought in Hulun Buir, Inner Mongolia, China, during 1980-2015 by using the FAO Penman-Monteith model and then applied stochastic frontier analysis to evaluate the technical efficiency of livestock production of 126 pasturing households. We further explored the effects of climate adaptations to extreme drought on the technical efficiency of livestock production. The results showed that the average frequency of extreme drought in Hulun Buir was 4.6 month/year and displayed a decreasing trend varying from southwest to northeast during 1980-2015. Based on the survey data, the average technical efficiency of livestock production of the local households was 0.530 in 2015, which could be greatly improved. The adaptations of the households significantly positively increased the technical efficiency of livestock production. Purchasing more forage and selling more livestock were the two most frequently adopted and effective adaptive measures for the response of vulnerable households in Hulun Buir to extreme drought risks. Further policy options were provided to improve livestock production as well as rangeland protection and restoration for coping with extreme drought in the context of climate change in semi-arid pastoral regions.

Their adaptation strategies, which are critical for food security, are oftentimes influenced by their risk-taking attitude. This study examines whether experiencing climatic shocks (defined here as drought events) shapes farmers' risk aversion. The study addresses two crucial questions: 1) how do drought events alter risk preferences among smallholder farmers; and 2) how long does the impact last? Using a panel survey from Zambia and high spatial resolution climate data, we infer the average Arrow-Pratt and downside risk aversion coefficients from the moment of the distribution of crop production. We find that, on average, the sampled farmers are risk averse. Furthermore, farmers who experienced a drought in the previous year become more risk averse, while farmers who experienced recurring droughts within the previous three years become even more risk averse. These results have implications on adaptation to climate change.","[Mulungu, Kelvin] Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol icipe, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kimani, Mumbi E.] Univ Witwatersrand, Penn State Univ, Sch Int Affairs, Sch Econ & Finance, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Sarr, Mare] Penn State Univ, Sch Int Affairs & Alliance Educ Sci Engn & Design, Cape Town, South Africa",International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE); University of Witwatersrand,"Mulungu, K (corresponding author), Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol icipe, Nairobi, Kenya.",kmulungu@icipe.org,,,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR); Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia; Government of the Republic of Kenya,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res); Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia; Government of the Republic of Kenya,Kelvin Mulungu gratefully acknowledges the financial support for this research by the following organizations and agencies: the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR); the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia; and the Government of the Republic of Kenya.

Wetlands are, however, currently grossly underrepresented in global environmental models. In this paper, we explore the required functionality of a generic model of the effects of climate and land-use changes on wetlands ecosystem services worldwide. We briefly review existing models to identify elements which can be combined to compile a generic wetland model. The proposed global wetland model should be integrated into and receive data from existing hydrology and climate models. Wetland delineation can be based on local hydrological and topographical conditions and verified with global wetland databases. We conclude that an integrated approach combining hydrology, biogeochemistry and vegetation for wetlands is not available yet, however, useful building blocks exist that can be combined.","[Janse, Jan H.] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, POB 30314, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands; [Janse, Jan H.; van Wijk, Dianneke; Mooij, Wolf M.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, POB 50, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Dam, Anne A.; Hes, Edwin M.

The Umm Er Radhuma is a karstified limestone aquifer, extending over 1.6aEuro ($) over bar Mio. km(2) in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Both epigene and hypogene karstification contributed to the genesis of what is today the most prolific aquifer in the region. Besides man-made abstractions, even the natural outflows are higher than the small recharge (natural storage depletion). The Umm Er Radhuma shows that large aquifers in arid regions are never in steady state (where inflows equal outflows), considering Quaternary climate history.

The costs of climate-sensitive health outcomes responsive to meteorological or seasonal patterns are among the least studied of those risks. In this article we describe how cost valuation analyses that relate climate-sensitive health outcomes to damages in economic terms can illuminate the costs of inaction on the climate crisis and the economic savings of addressing this problem. We identify major challenges to expanding the application of climate-health valuation research and suggest solutions to overcome these obstacles to better characterize the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes and health disparities. The projected health and economic harms of climate-sensitive risks could be enormous if climate change continues to accelerate and communities are not prepared to reduce or prevent their impact. Expanded valuation of climate-sensitive health outcomes can inform policies that slow climate change and promote stronger investments in health-protective climate change adaptation efforts.,"[Limaye, Vijay S.; Constible, Juanita; Knowlton, Kim] Nat Resources Def Council, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Max, Wendy] Univ Calif San Francisco, Hlth Econ, Dept Social & Behav Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Max, Wendy] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Hlth & Aging, San Francisco, CA USA; [Knowlton, Kim] Columbia Univ, Environm Hlth Sci, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY USA",University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Columbia University,"Limaye, VS (corresponding author), Nat Resources Def Council, New York, NY 10011 USA.",vlimaye@nrdc.org,,"Limaye, Vijay/0000-0003-3118-6912",,,,,55,9,9,4,13,PROJECT HOPE,BETHESDA,"7500 OLD GEORGETOWN RD, STE 600, BETHESDA, MD 20814-6133 USA",0278-2715,,,HEALTH AFFAIR,Health Aff.,DEC,2020,39,12,,,,,2098,2104,,10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01109,http://dx.doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01109,,,7,Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Health Care Sciences & Services,PC0MT,33284700,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000596704700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We found that, for temperature, datasets are comparable and climate impacts are thus considered robust. Important discrepancies arise in the precipitation indicators. Of the CIIs analysed in this study, the hydrological CIIs differ most so they should be used with care. These differences are probably caused by model uncertainty (hydrological model, HM; global climate model, GCM), ensemble size and model selection.

We quantify fluvial flood risk due to changing climate in a mixed-use watershed in Michigan, USA. We apply two approaches to project future climate change: an ensemble of temperature and precipitation perturbations on the historical record and an ensemble of global and regional climate models. We incorporate climate projections into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to estimate daily streamflow, then quantify flood risk using indices related to flood probability, duration, magnitude, and frequency. Results indicate rising temperatures may counteract small increases in precipitation, likely due to increased evapotranspiration. Climate model data without bias correction used in SWAT produced reasonable future streamflow changesd-similar to the perturbation of historical climatedtherefore retaining the predicted change in the flood frequency distribution. This work advances the application of climate models in SWAT for flood risk evaluation at watershed scales. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The diversity of service producers, users, and policy arenas has created a highly heterogeneous data- and information-oriented service landscape, and the authors contend that the domain of climate services requires efforts toward agreed structures and forms of conceptualization, operationalization, and evaluation. It is proposed here that qualitative classification be applied into climate change adaptation products, services, and systems to better guide research, policy, and practice with a clear terminology and analysis framework. This differentiation allows the pinpointing of critical challenges associated with the production and application of climate-relevant information, as well as the identification of suitable metrics to assess the impact of climate services.

This should be particularly true in the nation's extensive coastal zone, much of which is subject to increasing rates of sea level rise, coastal erosion, increasing numbers of increasingly powerful storms, and saltwater intrusion.

This article examines the specific role of insurance and other financing programs in coastal adaptation strategies. Insurance operates primarily to mitigate risk. The article focuses specifically on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is now driven by coastal catastrophes and is close to bankruptcy; Florida's decision to provide state-financed insurance to coastal property owners in the wake of the 2004-2005 hurricane season; and, conversely, the decisions of other states to use state and federal financing instead to facilitate coastal adaptation, including buyouts of transitioning coastal properties.","[Craig, Robin Kundis] Univ Utah, SJ Quinney Coll Law, 383 South Univ St, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Craig, RK (corresponding author), Univ Utah, SJ Quinney Coll Law, 383 South Univ St, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",robin.craig@law.utah.edu,"Craig, Robin Kundis/U-7318-2018; Craig, Robin Kundis/GPX-3135-2022","Craig, Robin Kundis/0000-0003-2120-9543; Craig, Robin Kundis/0000-0003-2120-9543",Albert and Elaine Borchard Fund for Faculty Excellence; Quinney Foundation,Albert and Elaine Borchard Fund for Faculty Excellence; Quinney Foundation,"This research was made possible, in part, through generous support from the Albert and Elaine Borchard Fund for Faculty Excellence and through the Quinney Foundation's funding of my research assistant, Catherine Danley.",,50,23,23,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The assessment of vulnerability of natural and built coastal infrastructure to sea level rise is used to demonstrate the advantages of this method for climate change adaptation planning and decision-making. As with most real world datasets the probability distribution of individual variables in CanCoast may be skewed; this can significantly impact the resulting vulnerability index depending on the calculation method employed. The primary advantage of using a geometric mean is that the index output will remain within the original range and maintain the distributional characteristics of the input variables. This can reduce the need for subjective expert opinion in the process of assessing the vulnerability index.

To answer this question, we develop an assessment framework capturing key attributes of engagement and use it to evaluate peer reviewed ARV articles with a focus on gender published since 2006 (n = 123). Results indicate an increase in ARV studies with a gender focus over this period, with the level of gender engagement also increasing. There are a relatively equal numbers of studies categorized as engaging gender at a high, medium, and low level, with studies from Sub-Saharan Africa consistently exhibiting high levels of gender engagement.

While a small number of green roofs have been constructed in Australia, most are roof gardens or intensive green roofs. Despite their potential as a climate change adaptation and mitigation tool and their widespread use in the northern hemisphere, there are very few examples of extensive green roofs in Australia. One of the major barriers to increasing the prevalence of extensive green roofs in Australia is the lack of scientific data available to evaluate their applicability to local conditions. Relying on European and North American experience and technology is problematic due to significant differences in climate, available substrates and plants. This paper examines green roofs in Australia, discusses the challenges to increasing their use and the major information gaps that need to be researched to progress the industry in Australia.

A companion cropping system known as 'push-pull' overcomes these constraints while providing additional soil fertility and forage grass benefits to smallholder farmers. To ensure the technology's long-term sustainability in view of the current and further potential aridification as a consequence of climate change, drought-tolerant crops, Brachiaria cv mulato (border crop) and greenleaf desmodium (intercrop), have been identified and incorporated into a 'climate-adapted push pull'. The aims of the current study were to evaluate effectiveness of the new system (i) in integrated control of striga and stemborer pests and (ii) in improving maize grain yields, and to evaluate farmers' perceptions of the technology to assess potential for further adoption. 395 farmers who had adopted the technology in drier areas of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania were randomly selected for the study. Each farmer had a set of two plots, a climate-adapted push pull and a maize monocrop. Seasonal data were collected in each plot on the number of emerged striga plants, percentage of maize plants damaged by stemborers, plant height and grain yields. Similarly, farmers' perceptions of the benefits of the technology were assessed using a semi-structured questionnaire. There were highly significant reductions in striga and stemborer damage to maize plants in the climate-adapted push pull compared to the maize monocrop plots: striga levels were 18 times lower and stemborer levels were 6 times lower. Similarly, maize plant height and grain yields were significantly higher. Mean yields were 2.5 times higher in companion planting plots. Farmers rated the climate-adapted push pull significantly superior in reducing striga infestation and stemborer damage rates, and in improving soil fertility and maize grain yields. These results demonstrate that the technology is effective in controlling both weeds and pests with concomitant yield increases under farmers' conditions. It thus provides an opportunity to improve food security, stimulate economic growth, and alleviate poverty in the region while making agriculture more resilient to climate change.

Although dryland expansion has been widely investigated in previous studies, there is a lack of quantitative evidence supporting human-induced changes in dryland extent. Here, using multiple observational datasets and model simulations from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, we employ both correlation-based and optimal fingerprinting approaches to conduct quantitative detection and attribution of dryland expansion. Our results show that spatial changes in atmospheric aridity (i.e., the aridity index defined by the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) between the recent period 1990-2014 and the past period 1950-74 are unlikely to have been caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, it is very likely (at least 95% confidence level) that dryland expansion at the global scale was driven principally by GHG emissions. Over the period 1950-2014, global drylands expanded by 3.67% according to observations, and the dryland expansion attributed to GHG emissions is estimated as similar to 4.5%. Drylands are projected to continue expanding, and their populations to increase until global warming reaches similar to 3.5 degrees C above preindustrial temperature under the middle- and high-emission scenarios. If warming exceeds similar to 3.5 degrees C, a reduction in population density would drive a decrease in dryland population. Our results for the first time provide quantitative evidence for the dominant effects of GHG emissions on global dryland expansion, which is helpful for anthropogenic climate change adaptation in drylands. Significance StatementIn the past decades, global drylands have been reported to show changes in space and time, based on atmospheric aridity (i.e., aridity index defined by the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration). Using two detection and attribution methods, the spatial change patterns of atmospheric aridity between 1990-2014 and 1950-74 are unlikely to be driven by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, whereas the temporal expansion of global drylands (i.e., 3.67% from 1950 to 2014) is principally attributed to GHG emissions (contribution: similar to 122%). Quantitative evidence from the detection and attribution analysis supports the dominant role of greenhouse gas emissions in global dryland expansion, which will increase the population suffering from water shortages under future warming unless climate adaptation is adopted.","[Feng, Shuyun; Gu, Xihui; Luo, Sijia; Liu, Ruihan; Kong, Dongdong] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Feng, Shuyun] Beijing Normal Univ, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disaster, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xihui] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Hubei Key Lab Yangtze Catchment Environm Aquat Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xihui; Slater, Louise J.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Gu, Xihui] Lanzhou Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Western Ecol Safety, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xihui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Xian, Peoples R China; [Gulakhmadov, Aminjon] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Res Ctr Ecol & Environm Cent Asia, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Gulakhmadov, Aminjon] Natl Acad Sci Tajikistan, Inst Water Problems Hydropower & Ecol, Dushanbe, Tajikistan; [Li, Jianfeng] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiang] China Univ Geosci, Natl Engn Res Ctr Geog Informat Syst, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China","China University of Geosciences; Beijing Normal University; China University of Geosciences; University of Oxford; Lanzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Earth Environment, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Academy of Sciences of Republic of Tajikistan; Institute of Water Problems, Hydropower Engineering & Ecology; Hong Kong Baptist University; China University of Geosciences","Gu, XH; Kong, DD (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China.;Gu, XH (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Hubei Key Lab Yangtze Catchment Environm Aquat Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China.;Gu, XH (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England.;Gu, XH (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Western Ecol Safety, Lanzhou, Peoples R China.;Gu, XH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Xian, Peoples R China.",guxh@cug.edu.cn; kongdongdong@cug.edu.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0605603]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41901041]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [lzujbky-2021-kb12]; fund for State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment [SKLLQG2108]; Key Laboratory of Environmental Change and Natural Disaster, Ministry of Education, Beijing Normal University [12800-312230014]; China Scholarship Council; U.K. Research and Innovation [MR/V022008/1]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); fund for State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment; Key Laboratory of Environmental Change and Natural Disaster, Ministry of Education, Beijing Normal University; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); U.K. Research and Innovation(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI))","This study is supported by the National Key R & D Program of China (Grant 2018YFA0605603), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 41901041), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (lzujbky-2021-kb12), and the fund for State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment (Grant SKLLQG2108).

Today, many bioenergy cropping systems (BCS) are suboptimal due to either social-ecological threats or technical limitations. In addition, the competition for land between bioenergy-crop cultivation, food-crop cultivation, and biodiversity conservation is expected to increase as a result of both continuous world population growth and expected severe climate change effects. This study investigates how BCS can become more social-ecologically sustainable in future. It brings together expert opinions from the fields of agronomy, economics, meteorology, and geography. Potential solutions to the following five main requirements for a more holistically sustainable supply of biomass are summarized: (i) bioenergy-crop cultivation should provide a beneficial social-ecological contribution, such as an increase in both biodiversity and landscape aesthetics, (ii) bioenergy crops should be cultivated on marginal agricultural land so as not to compete with food-crop production, (iii) BCS need to be resilient in the face of projected severe climate change effects, (iv) BCS should foster rural development and support the vast number of small-scale family farmers, managing about 80% of agricultural land and natural resources globally, and (v) bioenergy-crop cultivation must be planned and implemented systematically, using holistic approaches. Further research activities and policy incentives should not only consider the economic potential of bioenergy-crop cultivation, but also aspects of biodiversity, soil fertility, and climate change adaptation specific to site conditions and the given social context. This will help to adapt existing agricultural systems in a changing world and foster the development of a more social-ecologically sustainable bioeconomy.","[Von Cossel, Moritz; Wagner, Moritz; Lask, Jan; Magenau, Elena; Bauerle, Andrea; Lewandowski, Iris; Winkler, Bastian] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Biobased Prod & Energy Crops 340b, Fruwirthstr 23, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Von Cossel, Viktoria; Warrach-Sagi, Kirsten; Wulfmeyer, Volker] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Phys & Meteorol 120, Garbenstr 30, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Elbersen, Berien; Staritsky, Igor; Van Eupen, Michiel] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Earth Informat, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Iqbal, Yasir] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Biosci & Biotechnol, Changsha 410128, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Jablonowski, Nicolai David] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Bio & Geosci, IBG Plant Sci 2, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Jablonowski, Nicolai David] Forschungszentrum Julich, Bioecon Sci Ctr BioSC, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Happe, Stefan] Univ Kiel, Inst Anim Breeding & Husb, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Fernando, Ana Luisa] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Ciencias & Tecnol Biomassa, MEtRICs, Campus Caparica, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Scordia, Danilo; Cosentino, Salvatore Luciano] Univ Catania, Dipartimento Agricoltura Alimentaz & Ambiente Di3, I-95123 Catania, Italy",University Hohenheim; University Hohenheim; Wageningen University & Research; Hunan Agricultural University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; University of Kiel; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University of Catania,"Von Cossel, M (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Biobased Prod & Energy Crops 340b, Fruwirthstr 23, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",moritz.cossel@uni-hohenheim.de; mowagner@uni-hohenheim.de; jan.lask@uni-hohenheim.de; elena.magenau@uni-hohenheim.de; a.bauerle@uni-hohenheim.de; vikoca@web.de; kirsten.warrach-sagi@uni-hohenheim.de; berien.elbersen@wur.nl; igor.staritsky@wur.nl; michiel.vaneupen@wur.nl; yasir.iqbal1986@gmail.com; n.d.jablonowski@fz-juelich.de; stefanhappe78@gmail.com; ala@fct.unl.pt; dscordia@unict.it; sl.cosentino@unict.it; volker.wulfmeyer@uni-hohenheim.de; iris_lewandowski@uni-hohenheim.de; b.winkler@uni-hohenheim.de,"Iqbal, Yasir/I-2855-2019; Von Cossel, Moritz/I-6596-2019; Wagner, Moritz/HQZ-4198-2023; Cosentino, Salvatore L/F-7318-2011; Fernando, Ana Luisa/I-2796-2012; Jablonowski, Nicolai David/AAA-8672-2022","Iqbal, Yasir/0000-0003-1253-204X; Von Cossel, Moritz/0000-0002-1132-3281; Cosentino, Salvatore L/0000-0001-7076-8777; Fernando, Ana Luisa/0000-0001-9270-3982; Jablonowski, Nicolai David/0000-0002-5298-5521; Bauerle, Andrea/0000-0003-2777-4092; Warrach-Sagi, Kirsten/0000-0003-2572-8527; Winkler, Bastian/0000-0003-1496-3740; Lewandowski, Iris/0000-0002-0388-4521; Lask, Jan/0000-0002-9356-8505","European Union [727698]; University of Hohenheim; Bioeconomy Science Center (BioSC); Ministry of Innovation, Science and Research within the framework of the NRWStrategieprojekt BioSC [313/323-400-002 13]","European Union(European Commission); University of Hohenheim; Bioeconomy Science Center (BioSC); Ministry of Innovation, Science and Research within the framework of the NRWStrategieprojekt BioSC","This research received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 727698 and the University of Hohenheim.

This uncertainty arises from many sources, cascades and accumulates in risk estimates. A prominent trend to incorporate this uncertainty in adaptation planning is through adaptive approaches such as the dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP). We present a quantitative DAPP application for coastal erosion management to increase its utilisation in this field. We adopt an approach in which adaptation objectives and actions have continuous quantitative metrics that evolve over time as conditions change. The approach hinges on an adaptation information system that comprises hazard and impact modelling and systematic monitoring to assess changing risks and adaptation signals in the light of adaptation pathway choices. Using an elaborated case study, we force a shoreline evolution model with waves and storm surges generated by means of stochastic modelling from 2010 to 2100, considering uncertainty in extreme weather events, climate variability and mean sea-level rise. We produce a new type of adaptation pathways map showing a set of 90-year probabilistic trajectories that link changing objectives (e.g., no adaptation, limit risk increase, avoid risk increase) and nourishment placement over time. This DAPP approach could be applied to other domains of climate change adaptation bringing a new perspective in adaptive planning under deep uncertainty.","[Toimil, A.; Losada, I.

An increase in natural hazards, such as floods and storm waves, is likely to have a devastating impact on small islands' coastlines, severely affecting targeted sustainable development. Coastal erosion, notably human-induced erosion, has been an ongoing threat to small island biodiversity, resources, infrastructure, and settlements, as well as society at large. In the context of climate change, the problem of coastal erosion and the debate surrounding it is gaining momentum. Before attributing associated impacts to climate change, current human activities need to be analysed, focusing not only on geomorphological and climatological aspects, but also on political and traditional cultural frameworks. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the social-political-ecological systems analysis for adaptation strategies, and thus for future sustainable development. Coastal use is based on human constructs of the coast, as well as local perceptions and values ascribed to the coast. We use the case study of Anjouan, Comoros to differentiate between constructive and destructive practices on the coast, from both a mental and technical perspective. Beach erosion is described as more than a resource problem that manifests itself locally rather than nationally. Divergent political scales of interest impact future development as much as local action. Local action is not least framed by mental contribution and attribution of coasts as places for living, recreation and resource use. The present case study demonstrates that mental constructs of coasts as valuable areas can, in some cases, lead to the protection and preservation of beaches by initiatives of collective action. At the same time, local communities see the negative impacts of sand mining as causes of coastal erosion and, therefore, it is difficult to mobilize them to adapt to climate change and sea level rise.","[Ratter, Beate M.

Given the persistence of significant undernourishment despite regional development efforts, this paper attempts to analyse and explain food insecurity in the Puno region in terms of food availability and food sovereignty. The purpose was to estimate the per capita caloric nutritional coverage and to determine the percentage contribution of food groups to the caloric availability in different climate change situations (normal, flood, drought), based on the Food Balance Sheet developed by FAO. Official information mainly from the Direccion Regional Agraria de Puno was used. The analysis revealed that the productive potential for food security and sovereignty of the Puno region depends mostly on climatic behavior, which becomes very critical during the last years. The caloric nutritional coverage in the Puno region during a climatologically normal year, reaches only 60% of the theoretical caloric needs of one person per day, with a caloric deficit of 40%. Even more, a year with excessive rainfalls generates a food calories dependence of 60%, while a year of drought generates 87%. The food groups that contribute most to the caloric availability are tubers, cereals and red meats. However, the proportions of the supply vary substantially according to the particular behavior of rainfalls, either in a normal year, with excessive rainfalls and/or in a drought situation. Results revealed a deficit of 1,000kcal per capita per day in the Puno region even during normal years (750mm of water layer), which can be resolved in a great part doubling the regional production of potato and quinoa, achieving a nutritional coverage of 95% of the nutritional requirements. These results must be considered to implement public policies focused in redress the caloric imbalance and adaptation to climate change in the Puno region.","[Gonzales-Valero, Wilfredo] Direcc Reg Agr Puno, Jr Moquegua 264, Puno, Peru",,"Gonzales-Valero, W (corresponding author), Direcc Reg Agr Puno, Jr Moquegua 264, Puno, Peru.",willygv2@yahoo.es,,"GONZALES VALERO, WILFREDO/0000-0003-1435-4793",,,,,26,1,1,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2048-3694,,,FOOD ENERGY SECUR,Food Energy Secur.,MAY,2018,7,2,,,,,,,e00134,10.1002/fes3.134,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fes3.134,,,11,Agronomy; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,GI4QJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000434356000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Urban landscapes are vulnerable to such changes due to the concentrated population and socio-economic values in cities. Feasible adaptation requires better flood risk quantification and assessment of appropriate adaptation actions in term of costs and benefits. This paper presents an economic assessment of three prevailing climate adaptation options for urban drainage design in a Danish case study, Odense. A risk-based evaluation framework is used to give detailed insights of the physical and economic feasibilities of each option. Estimation of marginal benefits of adaptation options are carried out through a step-by-step cost-benefit analysis. The results are aimed at providing important information for decision making on how best to adapt to urban pluvial flooding due to climate impacts in cities.","[Zhou, Q.; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, K.] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Halsnaes, K.] Riso DTU, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Zhou, Q (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Bldg 113, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",qiaz@env.dtu.dk,"Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/J-7792-2012; Halsnæs, Kirsten/E-8722-2017","Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/0000-0002-6221-9505; Halsnæs, Kirsten/0000-0001-9106-9190",,,,,28,15,15,0,54,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0273-1223,1996-9732,,WATER SCI TECHNOL,Water Sci.

In this study, we construct a unique long-duration pseudo-panel dataset from nationally representative households in Vietnam to investigate factors behind farmer's choices to adopt soil and water conservation techniques to adapt to climatic change. Since farmers' adoption decisions are inherently dynamic, a dynamic probit model was estimated. We find that weather shocks and long-run changes in tem-perature are significant determinants of farmers' choices. The decision to make new investments in adaptation practices in subsequent periods is confirmed to be strongly influenced by the past adoption decision. Farmer's experience, farm size, and access to weather and output price information are also associated with households that apply conservation measures. These findings suggest that policies aiming at promoting climate-resilient strategies should pay attention to farmers' adaptation behavior and the persistence of choices in farmers' decision-making processes. Policies should target improving farmers' access to information with a special focus on market-and weather-related information to enhance farmers' adaptive capacity to better cope with ongoing climatic uncertainty.","[Duc, Kien Nguyen] Hue Univ, Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Dev Studies, 99 Ho Dac St, Hue City, Vietnam; [Duc, Kien Nguyen; Ancev, Tiho; Randall, Alan] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Randall, Alan] Ohio State Univ, Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Hue University; University of Sydney; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Duc, KN (corresponding author), Hue Univ, Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Dev Studies, 99 Ho Dac St, Hue City, Vietnam.",ndkien@hueuni.edu.vn,"Duc, Kien Nguyen/X-3957-2019","Duc, Kien Nguyen/0000-0001-7757-6225; Ancev, Tihomir/0000-0002-3521-7782",Sustainable Mekong Research Network [SUMERNET 100099208]; Strong Research Group Program of Hue University; Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [504.05-2020.302]; Australian Awards,Sustainable Mekong Research Network; Strong Research Group Program of Hue University; Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)(National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED)); Australian Awards,Parts of the paper have been presented at the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES) Annual Conference and at the DRSD2021 sponsored by the Sustainable Mekong Research Network for All (SUMERNET 100099208).

There is a rich literature outlining the theoretical and conceptual evolution of co-production, and experiences of it in a variety of decision contexts - in different sectors and at different scales. However, the extent to which the producers of climate services have engaged with this literature varies. Reflecting the emerging interest and application, particularly in developing countries, this paper reviews the co-production literature to distil some key principles to inform climate services. Whilst we aim to be neither comprehensive nor prescriptive, these principles can inform a normative and pragmatic approach to co-produced climate services. A co-produced climate service product should be decision-driven, process-based and time-managed. The process of co-producing a climate service should be inclusive, collaborative and flexible. Illustrations are also provided of how these principles may be engaged in practice. Evaluation of these emerging examples will help further inform co-production of climate services.","[Vincent, Katharine] Kulima Integrated Dev Solut Pty Ltd, Postnet Suite H79,Private Bag X9118, ZA-3200 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Vincent, Katharine] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Architecture & Planning, Private Bag X3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Daly, Meaghan] Univ New England, Dept Environm Studies, 11 Hills Beach Rd, Biddeford, ME 04005 USA; [Scannell, Claire; Leathes, Bill] Met Off, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",University of Witwatersrand; University of New England - Maine; Met Office - UK,"Vincent, K (corresponding author), Kulima Integrated Dev Solut Pty Ltd, Postnet Suite H79,Private Bag X9118, ZA-3200 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",katharine@kulima.com; mdaly8@une.edu; claire.scannell@metoffice.gov.uk; bill.leathes@metoffice.gov.uk,"Vincent, Katharine/L-5669-2019","Vincent, Katharine/0000-0003-3152-1522",Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme - UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID); Future Climate for Africa UMFULA project; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/M020010/1]; UK Government's DFID; NERC [NE/M020010/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme - UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID); Future Climate for Africa UMFULA project; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); UK Government's DFID; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was carried out in part under the Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme, which is funded by the UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID); and in part under the Future Climate for Africa UMFULA project, with financial support from the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), grant ref NE/M020010/1, and the UK Government's DFID.

Data were collected by questionnaire from participants at a climate change and forestry workshop, sponsored by the Canadian Climate Impacts and Adaptation Research Network Forest Sector and the McGregor Model Forest held in Prince George, British Columbia in February 2003. These forestry experts were somewhat concerned about the impacts of climate change, and they appeared unlikely to oppose strategies for preparing for and adapting to climate change. The respondents felt that the effects of climate change on forests and forest-based communities are not well understood by the general public or forest managers. They also felt that there is a relatively high level of uncertainty about the effects of climate change, especially with respect to forest-based communities. These results have important implications, including reinforcement of the need for greater awareness of climate change risks and for increased research and monitoring effort targeted at reducing levels of uncertainty about future impacts at local scales.","Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, No Forestry Ctr, Social Sci Res Grp, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada",Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service,"Williamson, TB (corresponding author), Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, No Forestry Ctr, Social Sci Res Grp, 5320-122 St, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada.",twilliam@nrcan.gc.ca,"Parkins, John/M-2702-2016","Parkins, John/0000-0002-8005-0934",,,,,31,46,46,1,28,CANADIAN INST FORESTRY,MATTAWA,"C/O CANADIAN ECOLOGY CENTRE, PO BOX 430, 6905 HWY 17 W, MATTAWA, ONTARIO P0H 1V0, CANADA",0015-7546,1499-9315,,FOREST CHRON,For.

Analytic solutions in this study are different from the nature of research reported earlier. Constructed solutions are represented graphically and show parabolic, multisoliton, periodic, dark, and bright solitons and progressive behaviors. The profiles of solitons could have some implications for port and coastal architecture. Additionally, conserved vectors demonstrate that the system is integrable.

However, there is an extremely large uncertainty in the future Sahel rainfall projections made by current climate models. In this study, we find a close relationship between the future Sahel rainfall projections and present rainfall simulation biases in South Asia and the western North Pacific in summer, using the historical simulations and future projections of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This future-present relationship can be used to calibrate Sahel rainfall projections since historical simulation biases can be much more reliably estimated than future change. The accordingly calibrated results show a substantial increase in both precipitation and precipitation minus evaporation in the future Sahel, in comparison with the multimodel ensemble (MME) result. This relationship between the historical rainfall bias and future Sahel rainfall projection is suggested to lie with the different schemes of convective parameterization among models: some schemes tend to result in both overestimated (underestimated) historical rainfall in South Asia (the western North Pacific) and enhanced future Sahel rainfall projection, while other schemes result in the opposite.","[Yan, Yuhan; Lu, Riyu] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Yuhan; Lu, Riyu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Chaofan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Lu, RY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Lu, RY (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lr@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Li, Chaofan/D-2735-2017; yan, yuhan/HPG-3263-2023","Li, Chaofan/0000-0001-5157-5427; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41320104007, U1502233, 41775083]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank the four anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Adaptive reuse of buildings is a form of sustainable urban regeneration, as it extends the building's life and avoids demolition waste, encourages reuses of the embodied energy and also provides significant social and economic benefits to the society. Thus, it embraces the different dimensions of sustainability. However, the debates over which sustainability factors are key, and how to address them all in practice, remain unresolved. This study begins with an intensive literature review of the factors that contribute to the goal of sustainable development in the conservation of built heritage. This is followed by in-depth interviews with practitioners who have participated in adaptive reuse projects in Hong Kong. These interviews confirm the reliability of the shortlisted sustainability factors. More importantly, this paper examines the challenges in incorporating a sustainability framework into adaptive reuse projects. The authors stress that the framework for achieving sustainable, low carbon adaptive reuse should be viewed more holistically, integrating social, economic, environmental, urban and political policies.

This examination is situated within the context of Georgetown, Guyana, after disastrous flooding in 2005 led the Red Cross to deploy VCAs as a method for participatory climate adaptation. The article focuses on the circulation of narratives about the ordinary, which are used by VCA trainees to cultivate ethical responses to flood hazards and the use of water management equipment. It is argued that participatory climate adaptation can be understood as not simply a mode of governance, but rather as a model for reimagining the ordinary. While other scholarship on participatory climate adaptation addresses how daily life is informed by the political and ideological dynamics of such projects, this article focuses on the ordinary from the view of mobile'' climate adaptation technologies. From this perspective, VCA trainees take action but often times rely on sheer intuition to create knowledge practices in an attempt to navigate crisis in the everyday. In turn, they learn that while the VCA may nourish alternative forms of expertise, it is no easy or fool-proof solution for climate adaptation.","[Vaughn, Sarah E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Anthropol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Vaughn, SE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Anthropol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sev83@berkeley.edu,,"Vaughn, Sarah/0000-0001-7127-0575",,,,,38,2,2,1,2,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",1948-8327,1948-8335,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

The complexity of climate change's likely impacts, such as increased flooding, has widened the scope of information necessary to take action. This is particularly the case in valuable low-lying coastal regions, which host many competing interests, and where there is a growing need to draw from varied fields in the risk-based management of flooding. The rising scrutiny over science's ability to match expectations of policy actors has called for the integration of stakeholder and scientific knowledge domains. Focusing on the Broads - the United Kingdom's largest protected wetland - this study looked to assess future flood risk and consider potential adaptation responses in a collaborative approach. Interviews and surveys with local stakeholders accompanied the development of a hydraulic model in an iterative participatory design, centred on a scientist-stakeholder workshop. Knowledge and perspectives were shared on processes driving risk in the Broads, as well as on the implications of adaptation measures, allowing for their prioritisation. The research outcomes highlight not only the challenges that scientist-stakeholder integrated assessments of future flood risk face, but also their potential to lead to the production of useful information for decision-making.","[Pasquier, Ulysse; He, Yi] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Few, Roger; Goulden, Marisa C.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Hooton, Simon] Broads Authority, Yare House,62-64 Thorpe Rd, Norwich NR1 1RY, Norfolk, England; [Hiscock, Kevin M.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Pasquier, U (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",u.pasquier@uea.ac.uk,"Pasquier, Ulysse/AAS-2409-2020; He, Yi/F-7885-2011; Few, Roger/AAT-3914-2021","He, Yi/0000-0002-3014-3964; Few, Roger/0000-0001-6653-1400; Pasquier, Ulysse/0000-0002-8390-9062",,,,,38,23,23,2,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

By using bibliometric and text mining methods, the authors conducted a knowledge map analysis of the research on cities and climate change. Moreover, this article attempts to identify the research hotspots and research gaps in this field. The following findings are distilled. First, research in this field is rapidly emerging, and the current research distribution is extremely uneven. China and the US contributed 36% of total paper output. Second, previous research focused on six topics: Impact of Climate Change and Urbanization, Urban Climate Change Adaptation, Urban Heat Island Effect, Urban Greenhouse Emission, Urban Climate Change and Water, and Urban Energy Systems. The first two topics are currently the most popular directions of research. Third, empirical research shows positive interest in big cities, while climate change research in small and medium-sized cities has been neglected.

We propose that the Venus representation relates to human adaptation to climate change. During this period, humans faced advancing glaciers and falling temperatures that led to nutritional stress, regional extinctions, and a reduction in the population. We analyzed Paleolithic figurines of women with obesity to test whether the more obese figurines are from sites during the height of the glacial advance and closer to the glacial fronts. Figurines are less obese as distance from the glaciers increases. Because survival required sufficient nutrition for child-bearing women, we hypothesize that the overnourished woman became an ideal symbol of survival and beauty during episodes of starvation and climate change in Paleolithic Europe.","[Johnson, Richard J.; Lanaspa, Miguel A.] Univ Colorado, Div Renal Dis & Hypertens, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Fox, John W.] Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Anthropol, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; American University of Sharjah,"Johnson, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Div Renal Dis & Hypertens, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",richard.johnson@ucdenver.edu,,"Johnson, Richard/0000-0003-3312-8193",NIH [1RO1DK108408],NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),This work was supported in part by NIH 1RO1DK108408.,,14,6,6,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1930-7381,1930-739X,,OBESITY,Obesity,JAN,2021,29,1,,,,,11,15,,10.1002/oby.23028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/oby.23028,,DEC 2020,5,Endocrinology & Metabolism; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Endocrinology & Metabolism; Nutrition & Dietetics,PH6PV,33258218,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000594369800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Investigations were performed to determine how climatic variability influences irrigation and whether this adaptive measure actually reduces producers' vulnerability to climate change. We used a simultaneous equations model with endogenous switching to account for the heterogeneity in the decision of whether to use adaptive measures. We compared the expected land values under the actual and counterfactual cases of farm households that either adapt or do not adapt to climate change. Simulation results show that irrigation can be an effective tool for counteracting the harmful effects of climate change. The income of farmers tends to increase on lands where irrigation technologies are practiced.

For each event, problems in urban areas occurred as the capacity of the existing drainage systems were exceeded. Adaptation to climate change is necessary but also very challenging as urban drainage systems are characterized by long technical lifetimes and high, unrecoverable construction costs. One of the most important barriers for the initiation and implementation of the adaptation strategies is therefore the uncertainty when predicting the magnitude of the extreme rainfall in the future. This challenge is explored through the application and discussion of three different theoretical decision support strategies: the precautionary principle, the minimax strategy and Bayesian decision support. The reviewed decision support strategies all proved valuable for addressing the identified uncertainties, at best applied together as they all yield information that improved decision making and thus enabled more robust decisions.","[Gregersen, I.

The authors deploy the symposium's three-dimensional framework to describe and evaluate developments within two distinct policy sectors (forestry/climate change adaptation and mitigation) at several levels of governance (bi-national, national, and sub-national) to explore the nature and operation of the emerging governance arrangements, and assessing and measuring change within these arrangements over time. Drawing on four contemporary case studies from the US and Canada, New Zealand, British Columbia and Alaska, the authors discern little evidence of a generalized, linear trend from government to governance. Instead, they conclude, across institutional, political and regulatory dimensions of governance, a more variegated and diverse picture emerges. Their analysis also lends support for the Trubek and Trubek (2007) hypothesis that emerging governance arrangements typically interact with extant ones through modalities of rivalry, complementarity and transformation.","[Doelle, Meinhard] Dalhousie Univ, Schulich Sch Law, Marine & Environm Law Inst, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Smith, Jennifer; Tollefson, Chris] Univ Victoria, Fac Law, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Wellstead, Adam] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Social Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Dalhousie University; University of Victoria; Michigan Technological University,"Doelle, M (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Schulich Sch Law, Marine & Environm Law Inst, Halifax, NS, Canada.",,,,,,,,56,24,24,1,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0033-3298,1467-9299,,PUBLIC ADMIN,Public Adm.,,2012,90,1,,,,,37,55,,10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.02006.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.02006.x,,,19,Political Science; Public Administration,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law; Public Administration,911KL,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000301715600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

It does so by addressing explicitly the changing composition of the population by level of educational attainment, taking into account new evidence about the effect of educational attainment in reducing significantly the vulnerability of populations to climatic challenges. This evidence, which has inspired a new generation of socio-economic climate change scenarios, is summarized. While the earlier IPCC-SRES (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) scenarios only included alternative trajectories for total population size (treating population essentially as a scaling parameter), the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) in the new scenarios were designed to capture the socio-economic challenges to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and include full age, sex, and education details for all countries.","[Lutz, Wolfgang; Striessnig, Erich] Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital IIA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",,"Lutz, W (corresponding author), Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital IIA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",striess@iiasa.ac.at,,"Striessnig, Erich/0000-0001-5419-9498",,,,,32,11,12,2,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0032-4728,1477-4747,,POP STUD-J DEMOG,Popul.

In the future, when global warming is expected to increase, autonomous adaptation to climate change via international electricity markets inducing reallocations of power generation may not be sufficient to prevent supply disruptions anymore. Furthermore, the consequent changes of supply patterns and electricity prices might cause an undesirable redistribution of wealth both between individual power suppliers and between suppliers and consumers. This study ascertains changes in European power supply patterns and electricity prices caused by on-going global warming as well as the associated redistribution of wealth for different climate change scenarios.

Drawing from the political science and international relations literature, we use the policy regime construct to characterize U.S. federal policies and programs that drive and enable climate adaptation at the local scale. While the regime construct has been used to evaluate the international governance of climate change mitigation, it has not been used in the context of climate adaptation. We find that numerous federal policies are used by localities to pursue adaptation objectives. We find that local adaptation initiatives based on federal policy tend to be non-prescriptive, are situational in their application, utilize common policy tools, and adopt a de-centered mode of governance. While a truly sustainable and resilient society may entail fundamental transformation, we suggest that such a paradigm shift might be constructively cultivated through the blueprint laid out in the 17 case studies examined here-using existing know-how and tools. Based on our analysis and characterization of a federal climate adaption policy regime, we propose that the enterprise of climate services may need to move beyond existing models of co-production to embrace an 'apprenticeship' model, immersing technical information providers in the milieu of policy and governance in order that they might learn to recognize factors that influence the applicability, usefulness, and uptake of climate products and services.","[Herrick, Charles] NYU, Washington Ctr, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Vogel, Jason] Univ Washington, Climate Impacts Grp CIG, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",New York University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Herrick, C (corresponding author), NYU, Washington Ctr, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",cherrickdc@gmail.com; jmvogel@uw.edu,,"Vogel, Jason/0000-0001-8279-3312",,,,,70,2,2,4,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2022,14,13,,,,,,,8135,10.3390/su14138135,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14138135,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2W2JN,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000824356700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, global warming is expected to increase both the frequency and the intensity of tropical cyclones. Also, the country still lacks in good quality data and information that can offer enhanced services to effectively design coastal defense systems and adapt to climate changes. This study developed a storm surge inundation model and database using the available tropical cyclones' database and simulated inundation for the past 31 cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, near the coastal regions of Bangladesh. The model uses a suite of Delft3D hydrodynamic and Delft Dashboard cyclone models. The model was calibrated and validated for two major cyclones, namely Sidr and Aila, using the available data for different bed roughness, track sources, and wind drag coefficient conditions. The results suggested that spatially varying bed roughness and wind varying drag conditions provide a more reliable prediction of inundation over the coast. The results also show that historical track data from Indian Meteorological Department optimize the model performances. The inundation database indicates that depending on the intensity and location, tropical cyclones can cause the maximum inundation of 1-5 m in the coastal lands of Bangladesh. More than 70% of the storms lead to the maximum inundation of more than 2 m, and about 25 and 7% of the storms can cause the maximum inundation of more than 3 and 4 m, respectively. The study also discusses the potential applications and shares insights on the implications of the inundation database that can offer improved information for enhanced climate services in Bangladesh. The database can be advanced with information about sectoral loss and damage as well as citizen science that will not only provide necessary information to design coastal protection structures and emergency measurements but also contribute to build long-term climate adaptation plans in the data-scarce region.","[Rezaie, Ali Mohammad] Univ Asia Pacific, Dept Civil Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Haque, Anisul] Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Inst Water & Flood Management, Dhaka, Bangladesh",University of Asia Pacific (UAP); Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET),"Rezaie, AM (corresponding author), Univ Asia Pacific, Dept Civil Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",rezaie06buet@gmail.com,,"Rezaie, Ali/0000-0001-5583-6268; Haque, Bazle/0000-0002-0836-3864",ESPA Deltas project [NEJ0027551],ESPA Deltas project,"The authors acknowledge the research support from the ESPA Deltas project (Grant reference code: NEJ0027551).

The review of literature shows that climate change will have a significant impact on agriculture, primarily through its effect on crop yields. The extent of predicted impacts highly depends on the crop, the CO2 fertilization effect assumption and adaptation abilities. Market response to the production shocks resulting from climate change will lessen the impacts on agricultural production predicted by natural scientists. On adaptation, the government's major efforts have been in the developing new technologies, reforming extension system and enhancing institutional capacity. Farmers do adapt to climate change, but their adaptation measures cannot fully offset the negative impacts of climate change.

Observations already indicate an average increase in temperature of between 0.2 and 0.8 degrees C; when projected, this increases further to between 3.0 and 4.0 degrees C. Of greater concern, however, is the late onset, early cessation dates of rainfall and reduction of length of growing period (LGP) which are now locally negatively impacting agriculture in the region.

This article reviews the body of legal scholarship on managed retreat. It provides a general overview of the prevailing themes, before examining the extent the literature informs policy design matters, with a focus on how the law can affect retreat; when removal from vulnerable land should occur; and criteria for constructing a policy response.

Groundwater's untapped potential related to various aspects of human development involves (a) water supply for irrigation and domestic purposes; (b) climate change adaptation and hydrological resilience; (c) hydrogeological storage of CO2; and (d) access to (renewable) energy.

More specifically, we focus on how multiple interests in land in Kampala influenced processes associated with the resettlement of people within the context of trying to reduce exposure to disaster risks. In this instance, authorities seeking to resettle people were more inclined to negotiate than impose resettlement and these negotiations opened up the possibilities for more equitable outcomes to emerge, such as staying in their existing communities.

We show that strong viability selection against the brown morph occurs, but only under snow-rich winters. As winter conditions became milder in the last decades, selection against the brown morph diminished. Concurrent with this reduced selection, the frequency of brown morphs increased rapidly in our study population during the last 28 years and nationwide during the last 48 years. Hence, we show the first evidence that recent climate change alters natural selection in a wild population leading to a microevolutionary response, which demonstrates the ability of wild populations to evolve in response to climate change.","[Karell, Patrik; Brommer, Jon E.] Univ Helsinki, Bird Ecol Unit, Dept Biosci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Valkama, Jari] Univ Helsinki, Ringing Ctr, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Karell, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Bird Ecol Unit, Dept Biosci, POB 65,Viikinkaari 1, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",patrik.karell@helsinki.fi,"Brommer, Jon E/C-3613-2008","Brommer, Jon E/0000-0002-2435-2612; Karell, Patrik/0000-0003-0297-125X; Valkama, Jari/0000-0002-0393-7320","Academy of Finland [1118484, 1131390]",Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"This is report number 9 of Kimpari Bird Projects (KBP).

In the absence of committed efforts to curtail anthropogenic emissions below intermediate levels (SSP2-4.5), climate model projections indicate a rapidly increasing risk of the PNW regularly experiencing 2021-like extreme summer temperatures, with a 50% chance of yearly occurrence by 2050. The 2021 summer temperatures experienced across the PNW provide a benchmark and impetus for communities in historically temperate climates to account for extreme heat-related impacts in climate change adaptation strategies.","[Heeter, Karen J.; Cook, Edward R.] Columbia Univ, Tree Ring Lab Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, 61 Rte 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Harley, Grant L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Earth & Spatial Sci, 875 Perimeter Dr MS3021, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Abatzoglou, John T.] Univ Calif Merced, Sch Engn, 5200 N Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Anchukaitis, Kevin J.] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, 1064 Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Coulthard, Bethany L.; Dye, Laura A.] Univ Nevada, Dept Geosci, 4505 Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89119 USA; [Homfeld, Inga K.] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Geog, Saarstr 21, D-55122 Mainz, Germany",Columbia University; Idaho; University of Idaho; University of California System; University of California Merced; University of Arizona; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Heeter, KJ (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Tree Ring Lab Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, 61 Rte 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",kheeter@ldeo.columbia.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [AGS-2002524, AGS-1803995, BCS-1759629]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was supported by National Science Foundation under AGS-2002524, AGS-1803995, and BCS-1759629.

There are number of factors that influence the extent to which farmers in a particular location adopt CSA technologies. This study applied a participatory assessment method to assess farmers' preferences and willingness-to-pay for selected CSA practices and technologies in diverse rainfall zones. The study found that farmers' preferences for CSA technologies are marked by some commonalities as well as differences according to their socio-economic characteristics and rainfall zones. The most preferred technologies by local farmers were crop insurance, weather-based crop agro-advisories, rainwater harvesting, site-specific integrated nutrient management, contingent crop planning and laser land levelling. The results also indicate that furriers' preferences and willingness-to-pay are influenced by technologies and their cost of implementation. This study shows the potential for using a participatory CSA prioritization approach to provide information on climate change adaptation planning at local level. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Under a pilot study, first maps of estimated permafrost distribution in Kullu district, Himachal Pradesh, India have been produced, using a combination of simple topographic and climatic principles, more sophisticated numerical modelling, and mapping of permafrost indicators. Overall, 9% (420 sq. km) of the land area in Kullu is classified as permafrost terrain, extending down to as low as similar to 4200 m amsl in isolated instances. Between similar to 4200 and 5000 m amsl, permafrost underlies a surface area comparable in size to that overlaid by glacier ice. Hence, permafrost is identified as a significant component of the local cryosphere. These results now provide a scientific basis for assessing the wide-ranging potential impacts, hazards and risk associated with warming and thawing of frozen ground, with relevance for climate change adaptation studies across the entire Himalaya.","[Allen, S.

Many public works projects focus on environmental protection. VUP also promotes risk reduction activities related to food security and related health or nutrition issues. With increasing weather-related hazards and possibly climate change, administrators recognise the need to 'climate-proof' VUP in a manner that integrates social protection with disaster risk management, climate change adaptation and food security.

Here, we implement an approach to identify locally appropriate adaptation options by tapping into the experiential knowledge base of local forest practitioners while at the same time, building capacity within this community to implement the results. We engaged 30 forest practitioners who are involved with the implementation of a regional forest management plan in identifying climate change vulnerabilities and evaluating alternative adaptation options.

The high dependence on agriculture and allied sectors makes many countries vulnerable to the climate change phenomenon. There is a gap in macro and micro-level understanding of climate change. Thoughtful farmers' perceptions and impacts of climate change on farming are fundamental for developing various mitigation and adaptation strategies. Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to understand the pattern of climate variability, farmers' perceptions about climate change, and farmers' adaptation strategies based on their socio-cultural background in the villages of Goa, on the west coast of India. The results reveal that about 62% of the sampled farmers have experienced climate change in terms of meteorological indicators such as increased average temperature, decreased total rainfall, delayed onset of monsoon, and an increase in the length of the summer season. The temperature trend analysis (0.009 degrees C/year) validated farmers' perceptions, while the perception of rainfall differed (-1.49 mm/year). Farmers are convinced that climate change has affected their farming (declining crop and livestock productivity, water depletion, and other related farm operations). They strive to adapt to climate change through crop diversification, an integrated crop-livestock system, contingency crop planning, and the adaptation of new crops and varieties. This study could be helpful for policymakers to establish a climate-resilient agriculture system by ensuring timely availability of farm inputs, accurate weather forecasting, and encouraging insurance products for crop and livestock enterprises, which will help farmers cope with the changing climate to enhance their income and economic wellbeing. Further, adaption of integrated farming, agroforestry, and indigenous technical knowledge is imperative to combat the ill effects of climate change.","[Reddy, Krishna Viswanatha; Reddy, D.

We synthesize evidence across multiple studies that confirms the overwhelming preponderance of in-country and short distance rather than international migration in climate change hotspots in Asia and Africa. The emerging findings highlight the critical importance of addressing immobility and the intersecting social determinants that influence who can move and who cannot in development policy.

Partly in response to the historical exclusion of women's knowledge, there has been increasing effort among first-world actors to seek out women's knowledge. This trend is apparent in efforts to mainstream gender in climate change negotiation. Here, one is told that women's superior knowledge about how to adapt to climate change makes them poised to help solve and overcome this daunting challenge. Pulling from the work of Miranda Fricker, I argue that such claims risk epistemically objectifying women. To illuminate the risk of women's epistemic objectification in climate change discourse, I offer a feminist analysis of current efforts to seek women's environmental knowledge, cautioning throughout that such efforts must reflect just epistemic relations.","Rhodes Coll, Philosophy, Memphis, TN 38112 USA",,"Tuvel, R (corresponding author), Rhodes Coll, Philosophy, Memphis, TN 38112 USA.",tuvelr@rhodes.edu,,,,,,,48,4,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0887-5367,1527-2001,,HYPATIA,Hypatia,SPR,2015,30,2,,,,,319,336,,10.1111/hypa.12141,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/hypa.12141,,,18,Philosophy; Women's Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Philosophy; Women's Studies,CG6JH,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000353405900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We discuss the findings from the focus groups held with 104 small-holder farmers from mountain areas. Farmers in the study area regard the impacts of climate hazards on their livelihood as significant but largely prioritize short-term solutions over long-term protective measures, which potentially increase their vulnerability over time. The study provides insights on local decision processes and potential pathways for discussing climate information with farmers.

Unless we can achieve a significant reduction in emissions, the global mean surface temperature will continue to rise to a dangerous level. Adverse outcomes of this warming will include extreme weather events, a deterioration of food, water and air quality, decreased food security, and an increase in vector-borne infectious disease. Political and economic instability as well as mass population migration will result in reduced access to healthcare resources. Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change will be key determinants of humanity's survival in the face of this existential crisis. Women will be more adversely affected by climate change than men, and pregnant persons will be particularly vulnerable. Particular differential impacts on women include higher heat and particulate-related morbidity and mortality; pregnancy risks including preterm birth, fetal growth lag, hypertensive disorders; and mental health impacts.

Agriculture practices will have to adapt to climate change, and also help to mitigate this effect using, among other strategies, forest conservation and management. Silvopastoral systems have been adopted in tropical climate livestock areas but their benefits on thermal comfort and reproductive performance of beef cows are not completely known. Therefore, our aims were to compare the microclimate of silvopastoral and intensive rotational unshaded grazing systems in different months and to evaluate physiological variables (Exp. 1 and 2), metabolism, and in vitro embryo production (Exp. 2) in crossbred beef females. Our hypothesis is that the silvopastoral system can improve the thermal comfort of beef heifers and cows and, consequently, also improve dry matter intake, body weight gain, and in vitro embryo production when compared to the unshaded rotational grazing system. In Exp 1, the silvopastoral system decreased body temperature and increased welfare and performance of heifers. In Exp. 2, the silvopastoral system enhanced the body weight but did not affect metabolism and the general reproductive performance, but increased the recovery rate of oocytes in primiparous cows.","[Lemes, Amanda Prudencio; Camplesi, Annelise Carla; Gimenes, Lindsay Unno] Univ Estadual Sao Paulo Julio de Mesquita Filho, Fac Ciencias Agr & Vet, Rod Prof Paulo Donato Castellane S-N, BR-14884900 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; [Garcia, Alexandre Rossetto; Macedo Pezzopane, Jose Ricardo] Embrapa Pecuaria Sudeste, Rod Washington Luiz,Km 234,POB 339, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Brandao, Felipe Zandonadi] Univ Fed Fluminense, Rua Vital Brazil 64, BR-24230340 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Watanabe, Yeda Fumie] Vitrogen, Av Coronel Jose Nogueira Terra 203, BR-14140000 Cravinhos, SP, Brazil; [Cooke, Reinaldo Fernandes] Texas A&M Univ, 400 Bizzell St, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Sponchiado, Mariana; Binelli, Mario] Univ Florida, POB 110910, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Paro de Paz, Claudia Cristina] Inst Zootecnia, Rod Carlos Tonani,Km 94, Sertaozinho, SP, Brazil",Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); Universidade Federal Fluminense; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Instituto de Zootecnia,"Garcia, AR (corresponding author), Embrapa Pecuaria Sudeste, Rod Washington Luiz,Km 234,POB 339, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",alexandre.garcia@embrapa.br,"Paz, Claudia Cristina Paro/E-8791-2012; Pezzopane, José Ricardo/AAG-7792-2021; Garcia, Alexandre Rossetto/G-1477-2012","Paz, Claudia Cristina Paro/0000-0002-7267-4552; Pezzopane, José Ricardo/0000-0001-5462-6090; Garcia, Alexandre Rossetto/0000-0002-3354-1474","State University of SAo Paulo; FAPESP [2015/26627-5, 2019/04528-6]; CoordenacAo de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES) [001]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development-CNPq [307757/2019-6]; Embrapa (Pecus Network) [01.10.06.001.05.07]; Embrapa (Precision Agriculture Network) [11.14.09.001.03.03]",State University of SAo Paulo; FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); CoordenacAo de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development-CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Embrapa (Pecus Network)(Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA)); Embrapa (Precision Agriculture Network),"The authors thank to the State University of SAo Paulo, to Embrapa (Pecus Network, Grant 01.10.06.001.05.07; Precision Agriculture Network, Grant 11.14.09.001.03.03) and FAPESP for the financial support (Process 2015/26627-5; Process 2019/04528-6).

It is essential to construct robust, cost-efficient and well-maintained road networks to react to uncertain events. Laser imaging detection and ranging technology (LiDAR) can measure the topography. By constructing spur roads based on the watercourse map estimated from the digital elevation model taken by LiDAR, the change of watercourses could be followed by using LiDAR after construction and spur road failures were surveyed to evaluate the road planning process. The route was selected to avoid watercourses using stable points such as natural bench. The roads crossing the watercourses were protected from surface runoff by dispersal drainage systems. The route and dispersal drainage systems effectively prevented runoff from soil erosion from a cut slope. The height of the cut slope and the stability of the natural slope were key for routing and selecting drainage systems. Spur roads with functional dispersal drainage systems at appropriate places are expected to improve the ability of water conservation in mountainous forests, which could contribute to keeping them as the 'green infrastructure' and adapting to climate change.","[Yoshida, Mika] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Tennno Dai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan; [Sakurai, Rin] Univ Miyazaki, Fac Agr, Dept Forest & Environm Sci, Miyazaki, Japan; [Sakai, Hideo] Japan Woody Bioenergy Assoc, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tsukuba; University of Miyazaki,"Yoshida, M (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Tennno Dai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan.",yoshida.mika.kf@u.tsukuba.ac.jp,,"SAKURAI, Rin/0000-0001-6382-702X",University of Tokyo Chichibu Forest; Suntory Natural Water Sanctuary,University of Tokyo Chichibu Forest; Suntory Natural Water Sanctuary,This work was supported by Research grant from the joint project between the University of Tokyo Chichibu Forest and Suntory Natural Water Sanctuary,,32,4,4,1,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1494-2119,1913-2220,,INT J FOREST ENG,Int.

Then the static land cover data in the WRF were replaced, and thereafter the modified WRF model was used to explore the impacts of land cover change on the near-surface temperature in the North China Plain in year 1992 and year 2005. The results indicated that the land cover change in the North China Plain, which was characterized by the regional urbanization, had led to significant changes in the near-surface temperature, increasing the regional near-surface temperature by 0.03 degrees C/year on average. The spatial pattern of the climate change basically corresponded to that of the land cover change; for example, the temperature increased most significantly in the regions mainly consisting of cities and built-up area. Besides, there were some variations in the degree and range of influence of the land cover change on the temperature among seasons. The result can provide important theoretical support for the adaptation to climate change, scientific land cover change management, and land use planning.","[Qu, Ruijie; Cui, Xiaolin] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geomat, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Qu, Ruijie] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yan, Haiming; Zhan, Jinyan] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Ma, Enjun] China Univ Geosci, Sch Math & Phys, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing Normal University; China University of Geosciences,"Zhan, JY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zhanjy@bnu.edu.cn,"zhan, jinyan/GYU-4910-2022",,Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2010CB950904]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41071343],"Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))",This research was financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant no. 2010CB950904) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 41071343).,,15,25,25,2,42,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-9309,1687-9317,,ADV METEOROL,Adv.

Design/methodology/approach - The research was made by interviewing those seashore residents whose households are most influenced by sea coast erosion along the entire coastline of Latvia in the areas where erosion rate is projected to be at least 6 m until the year of 2025. Findings - Half of the interviewees consider hard coast defense structures as an effective adaptation measure to the sea coast erosion in households concerned. The other half would not support that because of either long-term ineffectiveness or other unwilling consequences. Retreat as a strategy is acceptable only for quite a small part of interviewees.

The workshop also concluded that results of vulnerability and adaptation assessments should be presented to policy makers and the public and that assessments continue to be undertaken to improve our understanding of the issue.","NOAA,NATL WEATHER SERV,WIA,SILVER SPRING,MD 20910; UNIV PHILIPPINES,LOS BANOS,PHILIPPINES; NAMIRA,MANILA,PHILIPPINES; CAMBER CORP,WASHINGTON,DC 20005; US COUNTRY STUDIES PROGRAM,WASHINGTON,DC 20585; ASIAN DEV BANK,ORTIGAS CTR,PASIG CITY,METRO MANILA,PHILIPPINES; INST NACL INVEST AGR,CIFOR,MADRID 28040,SPAIN; UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT GEOG,LAB COASTAL RES,COLLEGE PK,MD 20742; HAGLER BAILLY CONSULTING INC,BOULDER,CO 80306",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of the Philippines Open University; Asian Development Bank; Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Amadore, L (corresponding author), PAGASA,1424 QUEZON AVE,QUEZON 1100,PHILIPPINES.",,,,,,,,0,17,18,0,15,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0049-6979,,,WATER AIR SOIL POLL,Water Air Soil Pollut.,SEP,1996,92,1-2,,,,,1,12,,,,,,12,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,VM538,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:A1996VM53800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper adopts a qualitative approach to explore the encountered adaptation barriers. Smallholder farmers, Agricultural Technical and Extension Services (AGRITEX) officers, and the traditional leadership fraternity were randomly selected from the district's 22 rural wards as study participants. Data were solicited using focus group discussions and face-to-face interviews that were corroborated by researcher observation methods. The data were analysed using thematic content analysis of key perspectives drawn from smallholder farmers, traditional leaders, and extension officers who work with farmers. What was unveiled is an assortment of barrier dynamics related to climate, finance, infrastructure, generational change, water resources, inefficient bureaucracy, gender inequality, and health barriers. Vensim PLE 7.3 software was used to illustrate barrier components as they act together to cripple smallholder farmers' efforts to raise their adaptive capacity. Adaptation barriers are complex and, therefore, cannot be addressed using policies that are fragmented. The paper recommends a multidimensional approach by policy makers to analyse adaptive barriers to build more climate resilience within smallholder farmer communities.","[Chingombe, Wisemen] Univ Mpumalanga, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Private Bag X11283, ZA-1200 Mbombela, South Africa; [Musarandega, Happwell] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Private Bag X1314, ZA-5700 Alice, South Africa",University of Fort Hare,"Chingombe, W (corresponding author), Univ Mpumalanga, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Private Bag X11283, ZA-1200 Mbombela, South Africa.",Wisemen.Chingombe@ump.ac.za; hmusarandega@gmail.com,,"Chingombe, Wisemen/0000-0001-7203-4822",University of Fort Hare,University of Fort Hare,"This research formed part of the baseline research activities led by Wisemen Chingombe from 2016 to 2020.

Nevertheless, the magnitude of the climate-induced impacts on traditional communities is not yet fully understood for evidence-based policy formation. Hence, this study aims (i) to analyze the perception of local people towards climate change, (ii) to investigate the perception of local communities toward traditional dietary habits, and (iii) to explore the changes observed in socio-cultural beliefs system due to dietary shift. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 75 in-depth qualitative interviews. The results of the grounded theory approach show that climate change has a localized meaning. Further, environmental change has significantly affected local food choices, which have an implication on the customary belief system attached to the local communities, irrespective of the socio-demography of the communities. The current study concludes that traditional knowledge is significant in addressing the issue of climate change. Therefore, the local society's socio-ecological beliefs must be integrated for effective food security and climate change adaptation strategies.","[Das, Suraj; Mishra, Anindya Jayanta] Indian Inst Technol IIT Roorkee, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee,"Das, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol IIT Roorkee, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sdas@hs.iitr.ac.in,,,"University Grants Commission, India","University Grants Commission, India(University Grants Commission, India)","This work was supported by University Grants Commission, India.",,52,0,0,3,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Using the Dormaa West District in Ghana as a case study, data were obtained from 190 household participants across randomly selected five communities; five focus group discussions and interviews with four planning and climate agencies. Both quantitative and qualitative techniques were employed to analyse the collected data. The results showed evidence of climate change with widespread impacts on local livelihood, particularly food production. There is evidence of unpredictable precipitation and warming temperatures over the past two decades with a high degree of variability. Key adaptive response measures included reliance on remittances, engaging in secondary livelihoods (e.g. driving and petty trading), and adjusting growing and harvesting seasons. Unfortunately, these measures were ad hoc, reactionary and unsustainable. The incorporation of farmer-based adaptation strategies into development and management plans, stakeholder participation, collaborations and partnerships are imperative in finding effective and sustainable adaptive response measures.","[Addaney, Michael; Asibey, Michael Osei; Akudugu, Jonas Ayaribilla] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Planning & Sustainabil, POB 214, Sunyani, Ghana; [Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Addaney, M (corresponding author), Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Planning & Sustainabil, POB 214, Sunyani, Ghana.",michael.addaney@uenr.edu.gh,"Asibey, Michael Osei/P-2396-2016","Asibey, Michael Osei/0000-0002-5534-2695; Addaney, Michael/0000-0003-4351-1241; cobbinah, patrick/0000-0003-2522-9293; Akudugu, Jonas/0000-0001-5876-6787",,,,,73,5,5,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,DEC 2,2021,26,12,,,,,1461,1479,,10.1080/13549839.2021.1978411,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2021.1978411,,SEP 2021,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,XA6NZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000697641800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, a methodology is proposed to investigate future rainfall extremes using future surface air temperature (SAT) or dew point temperature (DPT). The non-stationarity of rainfall extremes is reflected through non-stationary frequency analysis using SAT or DPT as a co-variate. Among the parameters of generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, the scale parameter is applied as a function of co-variate. Future daily rainfall extremes are projected from 16 future SAT and DPT ensembles obtained from two global climate models, four regional climate models, and two representative concentration pathway climate change scenarios. Compared with using only future rainfall data, it turns out that the proposed method using future temperature data can reduce the uncertainty of future rainfall extremes outputs if the value of the reference co-variate is properly set. In addition, the confidence interval of the rate of change of future rainfall extremes is quantified using the posterior distribution of the parameters of the GEV distribution sampled using Bayesian inference.","[Seo, Jiyu; Won, Jeongeun; Choi, Jeonghyeon] Pukyong Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst Sci, Environm Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Lee, Jungmin] Land & Housing Inst, Dept Construct & Technol Res, Daejeon 34047, South Korea; [Jang, Suhyung] K Water Inst, Water Resources Res Ctr, Daejeon 34045, South Korea; [Lee, Okjeong] Pukyong Natl Univ, Sch Integrated Sci Sustainable Earth & Environm D, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Kim, Sangdan] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea",Pukyong National University; Pukyong National University; Pukyong National University,"Lee, O (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Sch Integrated Sci Sustainable Earth & Environm D, Busan 48513, South Korea.",gu426@naver.com; wjddms8960@naver.com; jeonghyeon202@naver.com; andrew4502@lh.or.kr; kwaterjang@kwater.or.kr; lover1804@nate.com; skim@pknu.ac.kr,,"Won, Jeongeun/0000-0001-8944-8642; Lee, Okjeong/0000-0001-5442-7024; Choi, Jeonghyeon/0000-0003-4803-654X",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) [NRF-2019R1A2C1003114]; Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute (KEITI) [2019002950004],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute (KEITI),This research was funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) (grant no.

ANOVA technique was used to validate the quantitative statistics of the results. Results showed that the COVID-19 era caused more harm to agricultural production leading to a drastic reduction in agricultural yields, food supply chain, and agricultural inputs and materials in the area. There was a forceful drop in availability, affordability, accessibility, stability, and utility of agricultural inputs and materials in the area as compared to the period prior to the pandemic which showed significant increases in agricultural yields and the food supply chain. The perception of respondents to climate change was recorded as a major threat affecting food security in the area.

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) 2015-2030 is a global strategy for reducing the risks of disasters. It has 4 priorities by which Priority 2 calls for strengthening disaster risk governance (DRG). We find that this short paper critically analyzes progress, challenges and strategies to strengthen DRG. We find that there is enormous progress for DRG planning and implementation at the international, regional and national level, mostly in terms of formation of organizations and networks for DRR. We call for increasing the capacity of local actors through providing more resources, data and capacity for decision making. We propose four strategies to deal with future complexities and uncertainties in DRR: reduce the underlying vulnerability as the root cause of disasters; be inclusive/leave no-one behind: focus on vulnerable groups, migrants and displaced; governing urban disaster risks; governing climate change adaptation and mitigation; and governing for resilience: towards adaptive and transformative governance.","[Djalante, Riyanti] United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil UNU IAS, Tokyo, Japan; [Lassa, Shuaib] Makarere Univ, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Climat Sci, Kampala, Uganda",United Nations University; Makerere University,"Djalante, R (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil UNU IAS, Tokyo, Japan.",djalante@unu.edu,,,,,,,95,18,18,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-0617,,,PROG DISASTER SCI,Prog.

This is particularly noteworthy considering the climate change phenomenon, vis a vis sea-level rise, the urgent need for adaptation, efforts aiming for sustainable use of coastal areas, and the recent focus in academic circles on marine spatial planning. Most literature (including grey literature) on artificial islands appears in the engineering and geology disciplines and is focused on energy extraction, i.e., oil and gas. Yet some coastal nations are intent on solving problems of lack of space and other resource shortages through construction of near-shore artificial islands for myriad uses, including commercial, residential and transportation infrastructure. This paper presents a limited review of the policy literature about planning and construction of artificial islands. It reflects what repercussions artificial islands portend for marine conservation, sustainability and, most importantly, how climate change adaptation is highlighted or neglected in spatial solutions addressed by the building of nearshore artificial islands. The Israeli situation, where tenders have been recently published calling for planning and building of islands in the Mediterranean Sea, serves as an example.","[Portman, Michelle E.] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Kiryat HaTechn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Portman, ME (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Kiryat HaTechn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",mep@technion.ac.il,,,,,,,45,2,2,4,9,GESELLSCHAFT ERDKUNDE BERLIN,BERLIN,"ARNO-HOLZ-STR 14, BERLIN, 12165, GERMANY",0013-9998,,,ERDE,ERDE,,2019,150,3,,,SI,,158,168,,10.12854/erde-2019-430,http://dx.doi.org/10.12854/erde-2019-430,,,11,"Geography; Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Physical Geography; Geology,JL6RF,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000495656700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

First, we summarize and critique the CCRA1 approach, and second describe the steps taken in the CCRA2 approach in detail, providing examples of how each was applied in practice. Novel elements of the approach include assessment of both present day and future vulnerability, a focus on the urgency of adaptation action, and a structure focused around systems of receptors rather than conventional sectors. Both stakeholders and reviewers generally regarded the approach as successful in providing advice on current risks and future opportunities to the UK from climate change, and the fulfilment of statutory duty.

This new method emulates the interrelated complexity of the parts of an ecosystem with the intent to design buildings that are more efficient, effective and holistic. Ecomimetics refers to the design of buildings that mimic ecosystem processes and functions. This approach provides potential opportunities for climate change adaptation and mitigation by optimizing the use of resources in buildings. One challenge to the application of ecomimetics in architecture is the lack of systematic methods supported by scientific research, which may prevent development in this field. A theoretical basis and the initial development of an ecomimetic design method is presented, with a description of each step of the design process. Ecological systems are selected for functional properties that match architectural design goals, and then design tools are used to abstract and transfer those properties to architectural systems. The design tools integrated in the method are from the fields of ecological engineering, systems dynamics and architecture. The case of the Eastgate Center in Harare, Zimbabwe, is used to illustrate the method.","[Garcia-Holguera, Mercedes; Clark, O.

This article examines these questions through a case study examination of local weather prediction methods and adaptive strategies to ongoing weather-related variability by groundwater-dependent, irrigating farmers in Rajasthan, India. Conducted in 2009 and 2011, the work finds, first, that farmers rely on multiple local methods of weather prediction, which, along with multiple and often conflicting social and ecological factors, inform their cropping decisions. Second, these prediction methods and associated cropping strategies interact with a number of strategies to mitigate weather and agrarian variability more generally, such as new cropping strategies, seasonal migration, and market articulations. The article advances our thinking about what climate change, as yet another (but perhaps unique) agrarian perturbation, means for farmers' livelihoods. It concludes with a discussion of the implications of the analysis for formal climate change adaptation strategies and related ongoing groundwater policy.","Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Birkenholtz, T (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",trevbirk@rci.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,68,17,17,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0033-0124,1467-9272,,PROF GEOGR,Prof. Geogr.,AUG,2014,66,3,,,,,354,362,,10.1080/00330124.2013.821721,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00330124.2013.821721,,,9,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,AJ4XV,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000337684100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) ensures that the prospective benefits of interventions are being realized and it helps to improve the design of future projects and programmes. This paper is the first empirical assessment of M&E frameworks used by development cooperation agencies for projects and programmes with adaptation-specific or adaptation-related components. It analyses documents for 106 projects across 6 bilateral development agencies. The analysis finds that Result Based Management, the Logical Framework Approach and the accompanying logframe are the most common M&E approaches used for adaptation. In applying these approaches, the long-term perspective of most adaptation initiatives means that it is particularly important to clearly differentiate between outcomes, outputs and activities. In addition, M&E frameworks for adaptation should combine qualitative, quantitative and binary indicators. Baselines for these indicators should be specified to improve understanding of progress. Significant challenges remain in relation to dealing with shifting baselines, attribution and time lags between interventions and outcomes.","[Lamhauge, Nicolina; Lanzi, Elisa; Agrawala, Shardul] OECD, Environm Directorate, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Lamhauge, N (corresponding author), OECD, Environm Directorate, Paris, France.",nicolina.lamhauge@oecd.org,,,,,,,14,11,11,3,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

However, when the first issue of EuroChoices appeared in 2001, the CAP was again immersed in profound changes, in 'a paradox: a CAP reform without budget, WTO or food safety crisis'. The article underlines the different factors, including the key role played by the Commissioner Franz Fischler, which explain the radical changes in the CAP which took place in the first years of this century. Fischler's mandate marked several steps in the advancement of the modernisation of the CAP and confirmed the road towards its market orientation. The 'CAP medical check' promoted by his successor, the Danish Commissioner Marian Fischer-Boel, deepened the reform process and even extended it to the sugar, milk and wine sectors. The time had then come to tackle more decisively other challenges such as the mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the imbalance in the food chain or the differences in public support to farmers across different European countries.","[Azcarate, Tomas Garcia] CSIC, Inst Econ Geog & Demog, IEGD, Madrid, Spain; [Azcarate, Tomas Garcia] CEIGRAM, Madrid, Spain","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Economia, Geografia y Demografia (IEGD); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Centro de Estudios e Investigacion para la Gestion de Riesgos Agrarios Medioambientales CEIGRAM","Azcarate, TG (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Econ Geog & Demog, IEGD, Madrid, Spain.;Azcarate, TG (corresponding author), CEIGRAM, Madrid, Spain.",tomasgarciaazcarate@gmail.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1478-0917,1746-692X,,EUROCHOICES,EurChoices,AUG,2021,20,2,,,,,54,57,,10.1111/1746-692X.12318,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1746-692X.12318,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture,UJ6CZ,,Green Published,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000691372700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examined personal perception and motivation to mitigate and adapt to climate change among the university students in the capital city of Pakistan. We divided the respondents into social sciences, applied sciences and natural sciences, using logistic regression analysis. The results indicated that students who perceive severity, benefits from preparation, and have more information about climate change were 1.57, 4.98 and 1.63 times more likely to take mitigation and 147,1.14 and 1.17 times more likely to take adaptation measures, respectively.

Currently, the production of vegetables, such as lettuce, poses a greater challenge in managing effective water irrigation, due to their sensitivity to water shortage. Crop growth models, such as AquaCrop, play an important role in exploring and providing effective irrigation strategies under various environmental conditions. The objectives of this study were (i) to parameterise the AquaCrop model for lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. crispa L.) using data from farmers' fields in Cambodia, and (ii) to assess the impact of two distinct full and deficit irrigation scenarios in silico, using AquaCrop, under two contrasting soil types in the Cambodian climate. Field observations of biomass and canopy cover during the growing season of 2017 were used to adjust the crop growth parameters of the model. The results confirmed the ability of AquaCrop to correctly simulate lettuce growth. The irrigation scenario analysis suggested that deficit irrigation is a silver bullet water saving strategy that can save 20-60% of water compared to full irrigation scenarios in the conditions of this study.","[Ket, Pinnara; Oeurng, Chantha] Inst Technol Cambodia, Fac Hydrol & Water Resources Engn, POB 86, Phnom Penh 12156, Cambodia; [Ket, Pinnara; Degre, Aurore] Univ Liege, BIOSE, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Passage Deportes 2, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Garre, Sarah] Univ Liege, TERRA, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Passage Deportes 2, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Hok, Lyda] Royal Univ Agr, Fac Agron, Dept Soil Sci, POB 2696, Phnom Penh 12401, Cambodia",University of Liege; University of Liege,"Ket, P (corresponding author), Inst Technol Cambodia, Fac Hydrol & Water Resources Engn, POB 86, Phnom Penh 12156, Cambodia.;Ket, P (corresponding author), Univ Liege, BIOSE, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Passage Deportes 2, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.",ket.pinnara@gmail.com; sarah.garre@uliege.be; oeurng_chantha@yahoo.com; hoklyda@rua.edu.kh; aurore.degre@uliege.be,"Garré, Sarah/H-3655-2019","Garré, Sarah/0000-0001-9025-5282; Ket, Pinnara/0000-0002-1338-6059; Degre, Aurore/0000-0001-6912-6136","Belgian university cooperation programme, ARES-CCD (La Commission Cooperation au Developpement de l'Academie de Recherche et d'Enseignement superieur)","Belgian university cooperation programme, ARES-CCD (La Commission Cooperation au Developpement de l'Academie de Recherche et d'Enseignement superieur)","This study was funded by the Belgian university cooperation programme, ARES-CCD (La Commission Cooperation au Developpement de l'Academie de Recherche et d'Enseignement superieur).",,100,7,8,3,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2018,10,5,,,,,,,666,10.3390/w10050666,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10050666,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GJ3LO,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000435196700132,View Full Record in Web of Science

Various studies dealt with the impact of physical activity, clothing, and environmental factors on CBT regulation under terrestrial conditions. However, the effects of weightlessness on human thermoregulation are not well understood. Specifically, studies, investigating the effects of long-duration spaceflight on CBT at rest and during exercise are clearly lacking. We here show that during exercise CBT rises higher and faster in space than on Earth. Moreover, we observed for the first time a sustained increased astronauts' CBT also under resting conditions. This increase of about 1 degrees C developed gradually over 2.5 months and was associated with augmented concentrations of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, a key anti-inflammatory protein. Since even minor increases in CBT can impair physical and cognitive performance, both findings have a considerable impact on astronauts' health and well-being during future long-term spaceflights. Moreover, our findings also pinpoint crucial physiological challenges for spacefaring civilizations, and raise questions about the assumption of a thermoregulatory set point in humans, and our evolutionary ability to adapt to climate changes on Earth.","[Stahn, Alexander C.; Opatz, Oliver; Maggioni, Martina A.; Steinach, Mathias; von Ahlefeld, Victoria Weller; Schlabs, Thomas; Mendt, Stefan; Koralewski, Eberhard; Roecker, Lothar; Kirsch, Karl A.; Gunga, Hanns-Christian] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Stahn, Alexander C.; Opatz, Oliver; Maggioni, Martina A.; Steinach, Mathias; von Ahlefeld, Victoria Weller; Schlabs, Thomas; Mendt, Stefan; Koralewski, Eberhard; Roecker, Lothar; Kirsch, Karl A.; Gunga, Hanns-Christian] Humboldt Univ, Freie Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Stahn, Alexander C.; Opatz, Oliver; Maggioni, Martina A.; Steinach, Mathias; von Ahlefeld, Victoria Weller; Schlabs, Thomas; Mendt, Stefan; Koralewski, Eberhard; Roecker, Lothar; Kirsch, Karl A.; Gunga, Hanns-Christian] ChariteCrossOver CCO, Berlin Inst Hlth, Ctr Space Med & Extreme Environm, Inst Physiol, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Stahn, Alexander C.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Div Sleep & Chronobiol, 1019 Blockley Hall,423 Guardian Dr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Werner, Andreas] German Air Force, Ctr Aerosp Med, Aviat Physiol Training Ctr, Aviat Physiol Diagnost & Sci, Steinborner Str 43, D-01936 Konigsbruck, Germany; [Maggioni, Martina A.] Univ Milan, Dept Biomed Sci Hlth, Via Luigi Mangiagalli 31, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Moore, Alan] Lamar Univ, Dept Hlth & Kinesiol, Beaumont, TX 77710 USA; [Crucian, Brian E.; Smith, Scott M.] NASA, Johnson Space Ctr, Biomed Res & Environm Sci Div, Houston, TX 77058 USA; [Zwart, Sara R.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Prevent Med & Community Hlth, 301 Univ Blvd, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Trippel, Tobias] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Charite Med Klin, Kardiol, Augustenburger Pl 1, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Koch, Jochim] Dragerwerk AG & Co KGaA, Moislinger Allee 53-55, D-23558 Lubeck, Germany; [Chouker, Alexander] Hosp Univ Munich, Dept Anaesthesiol, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Reitz, Guenther] DLR, Inst Luft & Raumfahrtmed, Abt Strahlenbiol, D-51147 Cologne, Germany; [Reitz, Guenther] Czech Acad Sci, Nucl Phys Inst, Dept Radiat Dosimetry, Na Truhlarce 39-64, Prague 18000 8, Czech Republic; [Shang, Peng] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Special Environnm Biophys, Key Lab Space Biosci & Biotechnol, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Berlin Institute of Health; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; University of Milan; Texas State University System; Lamar University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER; University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Dragerwerk; University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Czech Academy of Sciences; Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Gunga, HC (corresponding author), Charite Univ Med Berlin, Berlin, Germany.;Gunga, HC (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Freie Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.;Gunga, HC (corresponding author), ChariteCrossOver CCO, Berlin Inst Hlth, Ctr Space Med & Extreme Environm, Inst Physiol, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",hanns-christian.gunga@charite.de,"Reitz, Guenther/ABC-8921-2021; Maggioni, Martina Anna A/M-2931-2016; Stahn, Alexander/HJI-0059-2023; Maggioni, Martina Anna/P-1351-2019; Schlabs, Thomas/F-1695-2013","Maggioni, Martina Anna A/0000-0002-6319-8566; Stahn, Alexander/0000-0002-4030-4944; Maggioni, Martina Anna/0000-0002-6319-8566; Mendt, Stefan/0000-0001-8227-9655; Schlabs, Thomas/0000-0001-5504-3460; TRIPPEL, TOBIAS DANIEL/0000-0001-8575-0019; Dr. Werner, Andreas/0000-0001-9719-5139","DLR [50WB0724, 50WB1030]; ESA [50WB0724, 50WB1030]",DLR(Helmholtz AssociationGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR)); ESA(European Space Agency),"We wish to express our deep thanks to each astronaut for participating in this study.

Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)). A meta-analysis study by Ford et al (2014 Environ. Res. Lett. 9 104005) has assessed the volume, scope and geographic distribution of reported in the English language peer-reviewed literature initiatives for adaptation to climate change in the Arctic. Their analysis highlights the reactive nature of the adopted policies with a strong emphasis on local and community-level policies mostly targeting indigenous population in Canada and Alaska. The study raises concerns about the lack of monitoring and evaluation mechanism to track the success rate of the existing policies and the need for long-term strategic planning in adaption policies spanning international boundaries and including all groups of population.","Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Loboda, TV (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, 2181 LeFrak Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",loboda@umd.edu,,,,,,,6,8,8,3,63,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

In this article, we discuss how risk is understood in the context of climate change, which presents particularly confounding, long-term, and pervasive threats to society and ecosystems. We review theoretical approaches to risk as applied to climate change and policy responses to climate change, focusing especially on the perspectives of individuals, governments, and firms with respect to traditional decision analysis frameworks. We also evaluate the peculiar role of uncertainty in climate debates and how it affects decision making; the origins and nature of the various uncertainties; and how uncertainty is represented, framed, and, at times, wielded by scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the media, politicians, and others.

This paper attempts to evaluate the operationalization of the Indonesian Climate Change Trust Fund (ICCTF) as a climate financing prototype in terms of fund mobilization, nature of projects, equity and inclusion, alignment and mainstreaming. This study was conducted through review of relevant and recent literature on climate change governance and financing, supported with information retrieved from relevant official documents as well as interviews of key persons. Our study found the ICCTF most effective in alignment with national development plans and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It has implemented climate change adaptation programmes with the principles of equity and inclusion of various stakeholders. The ICCTF has however struggled to efficiently mobilize funds owing largely to technical ambiguities especially in its legal and institutional frameworks, it therefore yet to be utilized to its maximum potentials.","[Sheriffdeen, Muhammad] IPB Univ Bogor, Grad Program Nat Resource & Environm Management, Java, Indonesia; [Sheriffdeen, Muhammad; Abubakar, Hauwa Kulu Aliyu] Univ Ilorin, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Ilorin, Nigeria; [Nurrochmat, Dodik Ridho] IPB Univ Bogor, Fac Forestry & Environm, Dept Forest Management, Java, Indonesia; [Perdinan] IPB Univ Bogor, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Geophys & Meteorol, Java, Indonesia",University of Ilorin,"Sheriffdeen, M (corresponding author), Sekretariat PS PSL Gedung Sekolah Pascasarjana, Bogor 16144, Indonesia.",sheriph307@gmail.com,"Nurrochmat, Dodik Ridho/GPK-2336-2022","Nurrochmat, Dodik Ridho/0000-0002-4876-8612",Government of Indonesia,Government of Indonesia(Ministry of Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (RISTEK)),"The authors sincerely send gratitude and acknowledgement to the Government of Indonesia for providing a scholarship opportunity at IPB University Bogor, through the Kemitraan Negara Berkembang (KNB).

This special issue on knowledge systems for urban resilience explores the social practices that produce, validate, circulate, and use information, data, and expertise to enable institutions to adapt to the unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions of the Anthropocene. We are particularly interested in the relationship between the social organization of knowledge production and ways that cities can build urban resilience to extreme weather events associated with climate change. Through a combination of conceptual and case study analyses of how knowledge systems work in cities, we argue that building adaptive capacity requires changing the practices, rules, expectations, and underlying power relations in the production and use of knowledge.","[Feagan, Mathieu; Hobbins, Robert] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Matsler, Marissa] Cary Inst Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, NY USA; [Meerow, Sara] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Munoz-Erickson, Tischa A.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Int Inst Trop Forestry, Rio Piedras, PR USA; [Munoz-Erickson, Tischa A.] Int Urban Field Stn, Rio Piedras, PR USA; [Gim, Changdeok; Miller, Clark A.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Future Innovat Soc, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Feagan, M (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",mfeagan@asu.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Meerow, Sara/J-8037-2019; Hobbins, Robert/AAH-4736-2019; Matsler, Marissa/AAU-9436-2020","Hobbins, Robert/0000-0001-9882-665X; Matsler, Marissa/0000-0003-3294-1991; Meerow, Sara/0000-0002-6935-1832","National Science Foundation [1444755, 1737626]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are thankful for the National Science Foundation's support for the Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network (project #1444755), as well as the SCC-Planning: Building Resilient Coastal Cities Through Smart and Connected Communities (project #1737626).",,42,11,11,5,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Departing from a set of governance problems and emergent goals, such as sustainability or climate change adaptation faced by an estuarine case study area, Ria de Aveiro, in Portugal, this article assesses the adequacy of alternative governance models under the existing water resources legal framework and traditional political culture. It shows that apart from the centrally-based compliance model, all other alternatives require high degrees of institutional reforms. Moreover, although the model based on a dedicated new agency, long preferred by many users of Ria de Aveiro, is the most understandable and focused, it does not assure the pursuance of adaptability or collaboration, which are considered essential for estuary governance. As it relies on collective action and multi-level and multi-agent contexts, estuarine governance may require a new institutional design. Where one begins a process of institutional change, however, is not a simple issue to address and demands a deeper analysis, particularly on the types of required institutional changes, as well as on their impacts on policy and decision-making outcomes over estuarine environments and associated socio-ecological networks.","[Fidelis, Teresa] Univ Aveiro, Dept Environm & Planning, Res Unit Governance Competitiveness & Publ Polici, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Teles, Filipe] Univ Aveiro, Dept Social Polit & Terr Sci, Res Unit Governance Competitiveness & Publ Polici, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Roebeling, Peter] Univ Aveiro, Dept Environm & Planning, Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Riazi, Fayaz] Univ Aveiro, Dept Environm & Planning, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Fidelis, T (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Environm & Planning, Res Unit Governance Competitiveness & Publ Polici, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",teresafidelis@ua.pt; teresafidelis@ua.pt; peter.roebeling@ua.pt; fayaz.riazi@ua.pt,"Fidélis, Teresa/F-2677-2012; Roebeling, Peter/G-6233-2011; Teles, Filipe/M-4582-2013","Fidélis, Teresa/0000-0002-6594-2571; Roebeling, Peter/0000-0002-2421-9299; Teles, Filipe/0000-0002-5059-368X; Riazi, Fayaz/0000-0001-5935-4485","Research Unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policies (GOVCOPP) - European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) through COMPETE 2020 [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-008540]; national funds through the Foundation for Science and Technology/Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education (FCT/MCTES); Center for Environmental and Marine Studies (CESAM) [UID/AMB/50017/2019]; FEDER within the PT2020 Partnership Agreement and Compete 2020","Research Unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policies (GOVCOPP) - European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) through COMPETE 2020; national funds through the Foundation for Science and Technology/Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education (FCT/MCTES); Center for Environmental and Marine Studies (CESAM); FEDER within the PT2020 Partnership Agreement and Compete 2020","The authors are grateful for the valuable contributions of the experts involved in the focus group exercises.

Climate change is affecting New Zealand through changes in precipitation patterns, increases in temperature, changes to the frequency and duration of droughts, sea level rise, and the increased occurrence of extreme events. These impacts highlight the vulnerability of key economic activities, communities, and infrastructure. As environmental and socioeconomic vulnerability varies with place, local level climate change policies are important tools to increase resilience when faced with a changing climate. The research survey, targeted towards local elected representatives, unpacks local scale climate change planning efforts across the country, as well as decision-maker perceptions of barriers and motivations in the area of climate change planning. Findings suggest that increasing local-scale responses hinges on public perception of the urgency of climate change, which is heavily influenced by national priorities. Furthermore, support for national level responses is limited by a collective view of climate change as an issue of an uncertain future, rather than one of present concern. Thus, the inclination to act at the local level is to some extent undermined by slow national action.","[Archie, Kelli M.; Flood, Stephen] Victoria Univ Wellington, CCRI, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, PoB 600, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Archie, Kelli M.; Chapman, Ralph] Victoria Univ Wellington, Environm Studies, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, PoB 600, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Flood, Stephen] Univ Coll Cork, MaREI Ctr Marine & Renewable Energy, Environm Res Inst, Ringaskiddy, County Cork, Ireland",Victoria University Wellington; Victoria University Wellington; University College Cork,"Archie, KM (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, CCRI, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, PoB 600, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.;Archie, KM (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Environm Studies, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, PoB 600, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.",kelli.archie@vuw.ac.nz,,"Archie, Kelli/0000-0001-9348-8073; Flood, Stephen/0000-0001-8206-737X",,,,,76,11,11,2,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-4645,2211-4653,,ENVIRON DEV,Environ.

The objective of this review is to explore the intimate connections between ecohydrological processes and water-related ecosystem services in human-dominated ecosystems in the Anthropocene. We synthesize current literature to illustrate the importance of understanding the ecohydrological processes for accurately quantifying ecosystem services under different environmental and socioeconomic settings and scales. Our synthesis focuses on managed ecosystems that are dominated by humans and explores how ecological processes affect the tradeoffs and synergies of multiple ecosystem services. We identify research gaps in studying ecological processes mainly including energy, carbon, water, and nutrient balances to better assess and quantify ecosystem services that are critical for sustaining natural resources for future generations. To better assess ecosystem services, future ecohydrological studies need to better account for the scaling effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors exerted on evapotranspiration and other water supply and demand processes. Future studies should focus on the bidirectional interactions between hydrological functions and services and human actions to solve real world problems such as water shortages, ecological degradation, and climate change adaptation.","[Sun, Ge; Hallema, Dennis] USDA ARS, Eastern Forest Environm Threat Assessment Ctr, Southern Res Stn, 920 Main Campus Dr Suite 300, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA; [Hallema, Dennis] US DOE, Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA; [Asbjornsen, Heidi] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Oak Ridge Associated Universities; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge Institute for Science & Education; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Sun, G (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Eastern Forest Environm Threat Assessment Ctr, Southern Res Stn, 920 Main Campus Dr Suite 300, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA.",gesun@fs.fed.us,"Sun, Ge/ABF-6673-2020","Hallema, Dennis/0000-0003-1384-5435","USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station, the Joint Fire Science Program [14-1-06-18]; US Forest Service Research Participation Program; Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) under DOE [DE-AC05-06OR23100]","USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station, the Joint Fire Science Program; US Forest Service Research Participation Program; Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) under DOE","Financial support for this study was provided by the USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station, the Joint Fire Science Program (project number 14-1-06-18), and the US Forest Service Research Participation Program administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) through an interagency agreement between the US Department of Energy (DOE) and the USDA Forest Service.

Hence, this article answers the question: How do governments and policymakers frame policy in relation to climate change, droughts, and floods and what governance structures facilitate adaptation? This research interrogates and analyzes through content analysis, supplemented by semi-structured qualitative interviews, the policy response to climate change, drought, and flood in relation to agricultural producers in four case studies in river basins in Chile, Argentina, and Canada. First, an epistemological explanation of risk and uncertainty underscores a brief literature review of adaptive governance, followed by policy framing in relation to risk and uncertainty, and an analytical model is developed. Pertinent findings of the four cases are recounted, followed by a comparative analysis. In conclusion, recommendations are made to improve policies and expand adaptive governance to better account for uncertainty and risk. This article is innovative in that it proposes an expanded model of adaptive governance in relation to risk that can help bridge the barrier of uncertainty in science and policy.","[Hurlbert, Margot] Univ Regina, Dept Justice Studies & Sociol & Social Stu, CL 235,3737 Wascana Pkwy, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Hurlbert, Margot; Gupta, Joyeeta] Univ Amsterdam, GID, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gupta, Joyeeta] UNESCO, IHE Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands",University of Regina; University of Amsterdam; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education,"Hurlbert, M (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Dept Justice Studies & Sociol & Social Stu, CL 235,3737 Wascana Pkwy, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",margot.hurlbert@uregina.ca,"Gupta, Joyeeta/L-8672-2013; mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020","Gupta, Joyeeta/0000-0003-1424-2660",International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This research was made possible by researchers participating in the Vulnerability to Climate Extremes in the Americas project (see http://www.parc.ca/vacea/), the International Research Initiative on Adaptation to Climate Change (IRIACC) funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).
