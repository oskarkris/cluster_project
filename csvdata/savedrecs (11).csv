This study presents an indicator-based impact assessment framework at NUTS-2 level for the European Union that quantifies potential regional changes in weather-related hazards: heat stress in relation to human health, river flood risk, and forest fire risk. This is done by comparing the current (baseline) situation with two future time periods, 2011-2040 and 2041-2070. The indicator values for the baseline period are validated against observed impact data. For each hazard, the method integrates outcomes of a set of coherent high-resolution regional climate models from the ENSEMBLES project based on the SRES A1B emission scenario, with current and projected non-climatic drivers of risk, such as land use and socio-economic change. An index of regional adaptive capacity has been developed and compared with overall hazard impact in order to identify the potentially most vulnerable regions in Europe. The results show strongest increases in impacts for heat stress, followed by forest fire risk, while for flood risk the sign and magnitude of change vary across regions. A major difference with previous studies is that heat stress risk could increase most in central Europe, which is due to the ageing population there. An overall assessment combining the three hazards shows a clear trend towards increasing impact from climaterelated natural hazards for most parts of Europe, but hotspot regions are found in eastern and southern Europe due to their low adaptive capacities. This spatially explicit assessment can serve as a basis for discussing climate adaptation mainstreaming, and priorities for regional development in the EU. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, regional sea level rise (SLR), with very large uncertainty, complicates the situation for stakeholders seeking recommendations for climate adaptation plans. The purpose of this study is to examine the change of the storm surge and wind wave components of the water level due to climate change in a low tidal range Koge Bay near the entrance of the Baltic Sea. Under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario RCP8.5, we employed a regional climate model (HIRHAM) forced wave model (WAM) and focused on the wave model results during the storm surge conditions (exceeding 20 years storm surge events) and stormy conditions (exceeding 90th percentile of wave heights). We find that the change in both wave height and period in the future is negligible under stormy conditions. Nevertheless, under storm surge conditions when considering SLR, the simulated wave height is projected to double in the near future (mid-century) under RCP 8.5, and the wave period may also increase by about 1.5 seconds. This is because some high significant wave height events in the future are associated with the storm surge events when considering SLR. The findings suggest that the combined effects of mean sea level rise, storm surge and waves are likely to increase the risk to a bay with geography and exposure comparable to Koge Bay. As a result, the future plan for climate engineering protection should place a premium on the additional wave energy protection associated with storm surges.","[Su, Jian; Murawski, Jens; Nielsen, Jacob W.

The transport of cool air from rural surroundings into the city by local winds during nighttime is important for the alleviation of the urban heat island intensity and heat load in particular. A simple statistical method, which objectively identifies urban thermal hot spots and areas of rural cold air formation from thermodynamic urban climate model simulations is described and applied to Aschaffenburg, a medium-sized town located in hilly terrain in south-central Germany. The delimitated hot spots and nocturnal cold air formation areas are influenced by local land cover, and also by the surrounding landscape heterogeneity, surface energy exchange and atmospheric mixing processes. The results illustrate limitations of hot spot or cool spot estimation methods based purely on the analysis of classified land cover data. Nocturnal backward airflow trajectories from thermal hot spots in the city and forward trajectories from rural areas with substantial cold air formation are calculated to determine which cold air formation areas are contributing to ventilation and advective cooling of thermal hot spots. It is found that nocturnal ventilation mechanisms are not bound to municipal boundaries, which highlights the need for regional cooperation in urban climate adaptation. The described method provides guidance to urban and regional planners in order to protect important cold air formation areas, e.g., from urban sprawl, and it can be applied to study impacts of planning scenarios. Options for improvement or extension of the method are discussed.","[Steigerwald, Florian; Kossmann, Meinolf; Schau-Noppel, Heike; Buchholz, Saskia] Deutsch Wetterdienst, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany; [Steigerwald, Florian; Panferov, Oleg] TH BingenUniv Appl Sci, D-55411 Bingen, Germany",,"Kossmann, M (corresponding author), Deutsch Wetterdienst, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany.",meinolf.kossmann@dwd.de,,,,,,,47,2,2,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,AUG,2022,11,8,,,,,,,1330,10.3390/land11081330,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11081330,,,23,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4B3RB,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000845698000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our literature review shows that urban gardens provide opportunities for physical activity and allow people to consume homegrown fruit and vegetables. Urban gardens may also reduce stress levels of gardeners and improve social cohesion. In this way, they can help to prevent health problems. Good quality of urban soil and the functioning of soil ecosystems are indispensable prerequisites for these. We developed a framework that shows how ecosystem health and human health are interconnected in urban gardening, by placing it in the context of urban green space management and valuation. This study yields a set of indicators, which can be used to assess soil ecosystem services and health impacts. They may provide a basis for the evolving dialogue in decision-making processes and partnership activities in urban management. Recognizing the potential effects and discussing what is important to whom, might be enough to find synergies. Importantly, the initiators of urban gardens are often citizens, who seek support from other stakeholders. The social network established by gardens may contribute to health-enabling, cohesive communities involved with their living environment. To maximize health benefits, it is useful to make the urban gardens accessible to many people. This study suggests that urban gardens deserve a position in urban green space management as they may help to address societal challenges like urbanization, health and well-being in aging populations and climate adaptation.

To go beyond the traditional approaches for coastal vulnerability appraisal, a Multi-dimensional Coastal Vulnerability Index (MDim-CVI) - integrating a composite set of physical, environmental and socio-economic indicators - is proposed to rank Italian coastal provinces according to their relative vulnerability to extreme sea level scenarios, in 2050. Specifically, information on hazard-prone areas, potentially inundated by sea level rise and extreme water levels (under the RCP8.5 climate scenario) is combined with indicators of geomorphic vulnerability (e.g. elevation, distance from coastline, shoreline evolution trend) exposure, and adaptive capacity (e.g. sensible segments of the population, GDP, land use patterns). The methodology is applied to a reference timeframe, representing current climate and land use condition, and a future scenario for the year 2050, integrating both climate projections and data simulating potential evolution of the environmental and socio-economic systems. Results show that most vulnerable provinces are located in the North Adriatic, the Gargano area and other Southern parts of Italy, mostly due to the very high vulnerability scores reported by climate-related indicators (e.g. extreme sea level). The number of vulnerable provinces as well as the magnitude of vulnerability is expected to increase in the future due to the worsening of climate, environmental, and socio-economic conditions (e.g. land use variations and increase of the elderly population). These outcomes can timely inform integrated coastal zone management and support climate adaptation planning. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

To uncover dynamic features and main drivers for the city-level energy consumption, a comprehensive and systematic city-level total energy consumption accounting approach was established and applied in China's megacity, which has the highest industrial electricity consumption. Compared with previous studies, this study systematically analyzes drivers for energy consumption based on industrial and residential perspectives. Additionally, this study analyzes not only the mechanisms by which population size, economic growth, and energy intensity affect energy consumption but also the effects of population and industry structural factors. According to the extended Logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method, the main conclusions drawn from this research are as follows: (1) The total energy consumption of Suzhou presented an overall increasing trend, with 2006-2012 as a rapid growth stage and 2013-2016 as a moderate growth stage. (2) The energy consumption structure was mainly dominated by coal, which was followed by outsourced electricity and natural gas. (3) Scale-related factors have dominated changes in energy consumption, and structural and technological factors have had profound effects on energy consumption in different development periods. (4) Population size and economic output were the main drivers for increments in industrial energy consumption, whereas energy intensity and economic structure performed the important curbing effects. The income effect of urban residents was the biggest driver behind the increase in residential energy consumption, whereas energy intensity was the main limiter. These findings provide a scientific basis for an in-depth understanding of the determinants of the evolution of urban energy consumption in China's megacity, including similar cities or urban areas in the developing world.","[Wang, Changjian; Wang, Yang; Ye, Yuyao; Lin, Xiaojie] Guangdong Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geog, Guangdong Open Lab Geospatial Informat Technol &, Key Lab Guangdong Utilizat Remote Sensing & Geog, Guangzhou 510070, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Xinhua Coll, Dept Resources & Urban Planning, Guangzhou 510520, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gengzhi] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xinlin] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Sch Geog Geomat & Planning, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiaojie] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Guangzhou 510090, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhongwu] Shanxi Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Linfen 041000, Shanxi, Peoples R China","Guangdong Academy of Sciences; Guangzhou Institute of Geography, Guangdong Academy of Sciences; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Jiangsu Normal University; Guangdong University of Technology; Shanxi Normal University","Wang, CJ (corresponding author), Guangdong Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geog, Guangdong Open Lab Geospatial Informat Technol &, Key Lab Guangdong Utilizat Remote Sensing & Geog, Guangzhou 510070, Peoples R China.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Xinhua Coll, Dept Resources & Urban Planning, Guangzhou 510520, Peoples R China.;Zhang, ZW (corresponding author), Shanxi Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Linfen 041000, Shanxi, Peoples R China.",wwwangcj@126.com; wangfei09@mails.ucas.ac.cn; hgzhi3@mail.sysu.edu.cn; wyxkwy@163.com; smilezhang89@163.com; yeyuyao@gdas.ac.cn; linxj01@126.com; zhangzhongwu69@163.com,,,"GDAS Special Project of Science and Technology Development [2020GDASYL-20200301003, 2020GDASYL-20200102002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41501144]; GDAS' Project of Science and Technology Development [2016GDASRC0101, 2017GDASCX-0101, 2018GDASCX-0101, 2018GDASCX-0403, 2019GDASYL-0302001]",GDAS Special Project of Science and Technology Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); GDAS' Project of Science and Technology Development,"This work was supported by the GDAS Special Project of Science and Technology Development (2020GDASYL-20200301003, 2020GDASYL-20200102002), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41501144), the GDAS' Project of Science and Technology Development (2016GDASRC0101, 2017GDASCX-0101, 2018GDASCX-0101, 2018GDASCX-0403, 2019GDASYL-0302001).",,72,2,2,7,33,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2021,13,2,,,,,,,764,10.3390/su13020764,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13020764,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PY0PD,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000611751300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To explore the coupling effects of temperature, humidity, and air movement on human thermal response in summer, two long term field studies were conducted in Beihai (a typical hot-humid region in China) and Turpan (a typical hot-arid region in China), from which 610 and 1080 valid datasets were obtained respectively. Results show that the residents of hot-arid regions have higher tolerance to hot-environment compared with residents of hothumid regions. Within the same temperature range, the residents of hothumid regions want cooler temperatures compared with the residents of hot-arid regions. The variation in RH does not have much influence on human thermal sensation, thermal comfort and thermal acceptability in hothumid climates. However, in hot-arid climates, humidity shows an opposite effect on the thermal sensation of the human body in different thermal environments. In a slightly warm environment (30 degrees C-35 degrees C), humidity has no significant effect on thermal sensation. In an extremely hot-environment (>35 degrees C), an increase in humidity may negatively affect thermal sensation. Meanwhile, in hot-humid regions, when the operative temperature was lower than 33.5 degrees C, the mean thermal sensation was significantly reduced by increasing air velocity. When the operative temperature exceeded 33.5 degrees C, increasing air velocity could significantly reduce mean thermal sensation only when the air velocity exceeded 1.0 m/s. However, a slight increment in air velocity can significantly improve thermal sensation in an extremely dry environment.

It is thus essential for countries to gain an understanding of critical infrastructure vulnerability to current and future climate-related threats, in order to develop effective climate adaptation strategies. The first requisite step towards implementing these strategies, before any detailed analysis can commence, is high-level vulnerability or risk assessments. The work in this paper is concerned with such high-level assessments, however the framework presented is GIS-based, facilitating modelling of geographical variability in both climate and asset vulnerability within a country. This permits the identification of potential climate change risk hotspots across a range of critical infrastructure sectors. The framework involves a number of distinct steps. Sectoral information matrices are developed to highlight the key relationships between the infrastructure and climate threats. This information is complemented with sectoral maps showing, on an asset-level, the potential geospatial impacts of climate change, facilitating initial quantification of the vulnerable portions of the infrastructure systems. Finally, the approach allows for development of multi-sectoral semi-quantitative risk ranking maps that account for the geographical proximities of various assets from different critical infrastructure sectors which are vulnerable to a specific climate threat. The framework is presented in the paper and applied as a case study in the context of Irish critical infrastructure. The case-study identified for instance, potentially substantial increases in fluvial flooding risk for Irish critical infrastructure, while the multi-sectoral risk ranking maps highlighted a number of Ireland's urban and rural areas as climate change risk hotspots. These high-level insights are likely to be useful in informing more detailed assessment, and initiating important conversations relating to a region's critical infrastructure cross-sectoral risk.","[Hawchar, Lara; Ryan, Paraic C.] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn, Discipline Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Cork, Ireland; [Naughton, Owen] Inst Technol Carlow, Dept Built Environm, Carlow, Ireland; [Nolan, Paul] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Irish Ctr High End Comp ICHEC, Galway, Ireland; [Nolan, Paul] Met Eireann, Res & Applicat Div, Dublin, Ireland; [Stewart, Mark G.] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Infrastruct Performance & Reliabil, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Ryan, Paraic C.] Univ Coll Cork, MaREI Ctr, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork; South East Technological University (SETU); Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Met Eireann - Ireland; University of Newcastle; University College Cork,"Ryan, PC (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork UCC, Discipline Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Coll Rd, Cork, Ireland.",paraic.ryan@ucc.ie,,"Nolan, Paul/0000-0003-0629-9771; Ryan, Paraic/0000-0003-3767-8096; Stewart, Mark/0000-0001-6887-6533; Naughton, Owen/0000-0001-9616-0022","Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Ireland under the EPA Research Programme","Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Ireland under the EPA Research Programme","This work was supported by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Ireland under the EPA Research Programme 2014-2020.",,76,12,12,13,41,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

The survey included micrometeorological measurements and a longitudinal questionnaire. The thermal comfort and adaptability of southern Chinese (people from Changsha and Guangzhou) and northern Chinese (people from Xi'an) in Xi'an were studied from the three aspects of psychological, physiological, and behavioral differences. The results of similar studies in other regions were compared with those of this study. Regarding psychological differences, northerners were more adapted to Xi'an's climate than southerners, with an expected temperatures of 20.7celcius and 24.1celcius for northerners and for southerners, respectively. Regarding physiological differences, the neutral temperature of the northern population was 22.12celcius, while that of the southern population was 21.12celcius. The neutral temperature for the southern population in Xi'an is similar to that of northern people living in Xi'an. Regarding behavioral differences, northerners were more likely than southerners to maintain their thermal comfort by adjusting their clothing when they experienced a change in the outdoor environment. This study not only indicates that there were differences regarding the thermal comfort of people originating different regions but also provided support for fully explaining the mechanism of climate adaptation of human thermal comfort. In addition, this work provides basic data regarding formulating outdoor thermal comfort standards and provided data support for personalized thermal comfort.","[Feng, Wei] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Jing, Wenqiang; Zhang, Jin; Luo, Wei; Qin, Zeming] Xian Eurasia Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Xian 710055, Peoples R China; [Zhen, Meng] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Dept Architecture, Xian 710049, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Jing, WQ (corresponding author), Xian Eurasia Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.",jing_wenqiang@163.com,,,"NSFC General Project [51808440]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2021M692564]; Opening Fund of Key Laboratory of Interactive Media Design and Equipment Service Innovation, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism [20205]; Scientific Research Platform of Eurasia University [2022XJPT01]","NSFC General Project; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Opening Fund of Key Laboratory of Interactive Media Design and Equipment Service Innovation, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism; Scientific Research Platform of Eurasia University","The study was supported by the NSFC General Project (grant number 51808440), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant number 2021M692564), and the Opening Fund of Key Laboratory of Interactive Media Design and Equipment Service Innovation, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (grant number 20205, the The Innovation Team of Eurasia University of Xi'an Eurasia University (2021XJTD01), and the Scientific Research Platform of Eurasia University (2022XJPT01).",,50,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

For instance, the discipline can describe the linkage between the environment and people and the effects of environmental change on local groups of people in a Delta country such as Bangladesh. However, the imperial philosophy of modernity that dominates the discipline and which is evident in the Sociology department at the University of Dhaka (UofD) underscores a considerable distance between academic conceptualizations of local perspectives on issues such as climatic change and the actual views of the local people of Bangladesh. Grounded on this assertion, this paper explores a question: What are the challenges for Sociology to represent Delta people and protect their social justice? The paper depends on the content analysis of sociological practices at UofD: imperial modernity and climatic adaptation. The findings of the paper argue that Sociology has been failing to represent the local meanings of climatic change due to the domination of imperial conceptualizations of modernity. Climate finance conceptualized by a Western perspective, and Sociology, as a discipline, fails to represent locally contextualized meanings related to climate finance; thus, the marginalized groups of people are increasingly facing survival challenges responsible for climate apartheid. Only a decolonized Sociology can challenge this imperial domination and play an effective role in reducing the discipline's gap of understanding of the local people and in promoting social justice in Delta Bangladesh.","[Hossen, M.

However, one challenge in adaptation is the uncertainty surrounding climate change projections generated by general circulation models (GCMs). This uncertainty has been addressed in different ways. For example, some researchers use ensembles of GCMs to generate probabilistic climate change projections, but these projections can be highly sensitive to assumptions about model independence and weighting schemes. Because of these issues, others argue that robustness-based approaches to climate adaptation are more appropriate, since they do not rely on a precise probabilistic representation of uncertainty. In this research, we present a new approach for characterizing climate change risks that leverages robust decision frameworks and probabilistic GCM ensembles. The scenario discovery process is used to search across a multi-dimensional space and identify climate scenarios most associated with system failure, and a Bayesian statistical model informed by GCM projections is then developed to estimate the probability of those scenarios. This provides an important advancement in that it can incorporate decision-relevant climate variables beyond mean temperature and precipitation and account for uncertainty in probabilistic estimates in a straightforward way. We also suggest several advancements building on prior approaches to Bayesian modeling of climate change projections to make them more broadly applicable. We demonstrate the methodology using proposed water resources infrastructure in Lake Tana, Ethiopia, where GCM disagreement on changes in future rainfall presents a major challenge for infrastructure planning.","[Shortridge, Julie E.] Virginia Tech, Biol Syst Engn, 155 Ag Quad Lane, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Zaitchik, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Earth & Planetary Sci, 3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Johns Hopkins University,"Shortridge, JE (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Biol Syst Engn, 155 Ag Quad Lane, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",jshortridge@vt.edu,"Zaitchik, Benjamin/AAB-3298-2020","Zaitchik, Benjamin/0000-0002-0698-0658; Shortridge, Julie/0000-0003-1612-5740",NSF-ICER [1624335],NSF-ICER,"The authors would like to acknowledge the Ethiopian Ministry of Water and Energy, the Tana Sub Basin Organization, and the International Water Management Institute for providing the data and models on which this analysis was based.

In this study, a spatially explicit statistical model framework was integrated with empirical stream temperature data (approximately four million bi-hourly recordings) and high-resolution climate and land surface data to estimate monthly stream temperatures and potential change under future climate scenarios in the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem, USA and Canada (72,000 km(2)). Moderate and extreme warming scenarios forecast increasing stream temperatures during spring, summer, and fall, with the largest increases predicted during summer (July, August, and September). Additionally, thermal regimes characteristic of current August temperatures, the warmest month of the year, may be exceeded during July and September, suggesting an earlier onset and extended duration of warm summer stream temperatures. Models estimate that the largest magnitude of temperature warming relative to current conditions may be observed during the shoulder months of winter (April and November). Summer stream temperature warming is likely to be most pronounced in glacial-fed streams where models predict the largest magnitude (> 50%) of change due to the loss of alpine glaciers. We provide the first broad-scale analysis of seasonal climate effects on spatiotemporal patterns of stream temperature in the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem for better understanding climate change impacts on freshwater habitats and guiding conservation and climate adaptation strategies.","[Jones, Leslie A.; Muhlfeld, Clint C.] US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, West Glacier, MT 20192 USA; [Jones, Leslie A.] Univ Montana, Dept Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Jones, Leslie A.] Univ Alaska Achorage, Alaska Ctr Conservat Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Muhlfeld, Clint C.] Univ Montana, Flathead Lake Biol Stn, Polson, MT 59860 USA; [Marshall, Lucy A.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Jones, LA (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, West Glacier, MT 20192 USA.;Jones, LA (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Achorage, Alaska Ctr Conservat Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",lajones12@alaska.edu; cmuhlfeld@usgs.gov; lucy.marshall@unsw.edu.au,,"Jones, Leslie/0000-0002-4953-7189; Marshall, Lucy/0000-0003-0450-4292","National Science Foundation [DGE-1313190]; US Fish and Wildlife Services, Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative; USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Fish and Wildlife Services, Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative; USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under a Graduate Research Fellowship for L.

As an indicator of rice quality, we adopted the heat stress index HD_m26, which is related to the decreased percentage of first grade rice due to high temperature, calculated as the cumulative temperature within 20 days after the heading date. We used a process-based rice growth model to assess the effect. We implemented the model for the period 1981-2100, and shifted the transplanting dates at 7-day intervals from -70 to +70 days from the standard transplanting date. The estimated yield was categorized into three classes with different degrees of quality degradation risk according to values of HD_ m26. Relative to the current transplanting date, nationwide total production was estimated to increase slightly in most climate change scenarios, although the proportion of production with quality degradation risk may increase with the rise in temperature. It may be possible to avoid this increased risk while maintaining total production by selecting an optimum transplanting date in consideration of both yield and quality. However, a large decrease in yield was found in some areas, suggesting that the current rice producing regions in Japan would become separated into suitable and unsuitable areas as temperatures increase.","[Ishigooka, Yasushi; Kuwagata, Tsuneo; Nishimori, Motoki] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, 3-1-3 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Fukui, Shin] Waseda Univ, Fac Human Sci, 2-579-15 Mikajima, Tokorozawa, Saitama 3591192, Japan; [Hasegawa, Toshihiro] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Tohoku Agr Res Ctr, 4 Akahira, Morioka, Iwate 0200198, Japan; [Kondo, Motohiko] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Dept Biosphere Resources Sci, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan; Waseda University; National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan; Nagoya University,"Ishigooka, Y (corresponding author), Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, 3-1-3 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan.",isigo@affrc.go.jp,"Hasegawa, Toshihiro/H-8211-2019","Hasegawa, Toshihiro/0000-0001-8501-5612; Fukui, Shin/0000-0003-4452-2559","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology); Ministry of the Environment (Comprehensive Research on Climate Change Impact Assessment and Adaptation Policies); Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Development of Technologies for Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries)","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology); Ministry of the Environment (Comprehensive Research on Climate Change Impact Assessment and Adaptation Policies); Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Development of Technologies for Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Institute of Crop Science, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, and the Production, Marketing and Consumption Statistics Division, Minister's Secretariat, MAFF, for providing the CSCS datasets.

Drawing insights from three agrarian societies in the semi-arid region of Ghana using qualitative research methods, the study reports how people currently deal with climate variability as insight on how they will deal with climate change in the future. The findings indicate wide gender inequality in decision making processes and land access resulting from patriarchal local customs and institutions that shape adaptation responses of different vulnerable social groups to climatic or non-climatic stressors. Different adaptation practices of groups indicate that both climatic and non-climatic stressors shape the kind of responses that groups adopt. From the current adaptation practices, efforts to improve adaptation to future climate change at local levels must give attention to the nexus of both climatic and non-climatic stressors, gender, differential vulnerabilities and other subjectivities that produce a particular adaptation practice in a given place.

However, they have yet to be commonly used by communities, scientists, practitioners and policy makers. We believe that local and indigenous knowledge needs to be integrated with science before it can be used in policies, education, and actions related to disaster risk reduction and climate change. This paper presents a process for integrating local and indigenous knowledge related to hydro-meteorological hazards and climate change with science, developed through a project implemented among coastal and small island communities in Indonesia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste. The process involves observation, documentation, validation, and categorization of local and indigenous knowledge, which can then be selected for integration with science. This process is unique in that it allows communities to (1) identify knowledge that can be integrated with science, which could then be further disseminated for use by scientists, practitioners and policy-makers, and (2) safeguard and valorize those that cannot be scientifically explained. By introducing a process that can be used in other communities and countries, we hope to promote the use of local and indigenous knowledge to enable communities to increase their resilience against the impacts of climate change and disasters.

The existing urban development model of a mixed and compact city is to be mainly maintained because the urban density or building typology does not influence the spread of Covid-19. But the pandemic has made it clear how important green space and recreation areas are for inner city residential areas. This green space also becomes more important regarding climate adaptation measures to provide cooler air and ventilation. In the framework of the Leipzig Charter of the EU, the German ministry for building adopted the memorandum on Urban Resilience in May 2021. Resilience in this context means that we should not only repair the damage of disasters but also adapt to future crises and make our cities more resilient and sustainable. For this, we need to strengthen preventive strategies in urban development planning connected with urban renewal approaches and ask for extended city models. Planning shapes the future, including counteracting undesirable scenarios with preventive planning. In this sense, future planning and disaster control have common objectives-they take an interdisciplinary approach to prepare for future change, they want to anticipate and prevent danger, protect and expand the infrastructure, and serve the common good. In this article, I will point out how integrated urban development concepts should be extended with aspects of urban resilience, and which city models are important for the future.","[Kurth, Detlef] Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, Chair Urban Planning, Kaiserslautern, Germany",University of Kaiserslautern,"Kurth, D (corresponding author), Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, Chair Urban Planning, Kaiserslautern, Germany.",detlef.kurth@ru.uni-kl.de,,,,,,,14,0,0,4,4,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-7635,,,URBAN PLAN,Urban Plan.,,2022,7,4,,,,,90,95,,10.17645/up.v7i4.5803,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v7i4.5803,,,6,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,5X1OC,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000878374600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effective regulation of wave run-up heights depends on the accuracy of predictions made by the forecasting model and on understanding the relation between incident wave characteristics, SBs' geometry, and their configuration. This paper proposes models based on the Artificial neural network (ANN) and the Response surface methodology (RSM) to predict the maximum wave run-up heights over a series of rubble mound and caisson-type SBs under varying incident wave conditions. The data for the ANN and RSM models are obtained through physical modeling in the laboratory flume. The objectives of the study are to (1) provide robust tools for the prediction of the maximum wave run up under complex wave-structure interactions; (2) explore the optimum conditions for reducing the maximum run-up height and examine the interdependence of wave-structure characteristics; and (3) investigate the run-up prediction efficacy of the ANN and RSM models. Assessment of the prediction quality of the ANN and RSM models reveals that both techniques establish powerful tools for wave run-up prediction; however, the former offers a slightly better statistical performance. Well-trained ANN model such as Multi-layer perceptron and well-tested statistical methods have considerable potential for application in the development of climate adaptive coastal resilience plans because of their rapid and robust predictive capability.","[Rehman, Khawar] Ghulam Ishaq Khan Inst Engn Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Topi 23460, Swabi, Pakistan; [Khan, Hammad] Ghulam Ishaq Khan Inst Engn Sci & Technol, Fac Mat & Chem Engn, Topi 23460, Swabi, Pakistan; [Cho, Yong-Sik] Hanyang Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Hong, Seung Ho] Hanyang Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea",GIK Institute Engineering Science & Technology; GIK Institute Engineering Science & Technology; Hanyang University; Hanyang University,"Hong, SH (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea.",khawar.rehman@giki.edu.pk; hammad@giki.edu.pk; ysc59@hanyang.ac.kr; sehong@hanyang.ac.kr,"Cho, Yong-Sik/P-2091-2015","Rehman, Khawar/0000-0002-8468-8986",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea Government (MSIP) [2015R1A2A1A15054097],"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea Government (MSIP)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)",This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIP) (No.2015R1A2A1A15054097).,,36,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

Most of the predictions of energy consumption in buildings are based on fixed values related to the internal thermal ambient and pre-established operation hypotheses, which do not reflect the dynamic use of buildings and users' requirements. Spain is a clear example of such a situation. This study suggests the use of an adaptive thermal comfort model as a predictive method of energy consumption in the internal thermal ambient, as well as several operation hypotheses, and both conditions are combined in a simulation model: the Adaptive Comfort Control Implemented Model (ACCIM). The behavior of ACCIM is studied in a representative case of the residential building stock, which is located in three climate zones with different characteristics (warm, cold, and mild climates). The analyses were conducted both in current and future scenarios with the aim of knowing the advantages and limitations in each climate zone. The results show that the average consumption of the current, 2050, and 2080 scenarios decreased between 23% and 46% in warm climates, between 19% and 25% in mild climates, and between 10% and 29% in cold climates by using such a predictive method. It is also shown that this method is more resilient to climate change than the current standard.

Because humans inhabit environments that can be seen as extreme from the perspective of respiratory function, nasal cavity shape is expected to show climatic adaptation. This study examines the relationship between modern human variation in the morphology of the nasal cavity and the climatic factors of temperature and vapor pressure, and tests the hypothesis that within increasingly demanding environments (colder and drier), nasal cavities will show features that enhance turbulence and air-wall contact to improve conditioning of the air. We use three-dimensional geometric morphometrics methods and multi-variate statistics to model and analyze the shape of the bony nasal cavity of 10 modern human population samples from five climatic groups. We report significant correlations between nasal cavity shape and climatic variables of both temperature and humidity. Variation in nasal cavity shape is correlated with a cline from cold dry climates to hot humid climates, with a separate temperature and vapor pressure effect. The bony nasal cavity appears mostly associated with temperature, and the nasopharynx with humidity. The observed climate-related shape changes are functionally consistent with an increase in contact between air and mucosal tissue in cold dry climates through greater turbulence during inspiration and a higher surface-to-volume ratio in the upper nasal cavity.

In many cities, heat stress is projected to increase. Urban green spaces are considered as an important resource to strengthen the resilience of city dwellers. We conducted a questionnaire survey in two structurally distinct parks in Leipzig, Germany, on hot summer days in 2019. We assessed the respondents? activity patterns, satisfaction with the existing infrastructure, heat-related health impairment, changes in park use during heat waves and evaluation of the role of parks in coping with heat stress. We found that the old-grown, tree-rich park was used significantly more frequently for experiencing nature, while the newer, less tree-rich park developed on a former railway-brownfield site was used more often for socializing and having BBQs and picnics. Satisfaction with available drinking fountains and public toilets was generally low and satisfaction with lighting was assessed less satisfactory in the old-grown park. Safety was assessed as satisfactory in general but significantly less satisfactory by female respondents. The heat stress summary score indicating heat-related health impairment was significantly higher for participants in the newer park. A high share of respondents stated that they used parks during heat waves as frequently as usual in the summer (46 %), while some respondents stated that they adapted their park use behaviour (18 %), e.g., by coming later in the evening. Regarding the participants? responses about the role of parks under summer heat conditions, we matched 138 statements to several regulating and cultural ecosystem services, and we found cooling and recreation to be mentioned most often. We concluded that green space planning should diminish usage barriers, such as insufficient lighting and insufficient sanitary infrastructure, to ensure equal park use opportunities for all city dwellers. Specific local environmental and sociocultural conditions, changing environments and climate adaptation must be considered. To maintain ecological processes and functions and to cope with climate change, urban planning should preserve older parks with a large amount of tree coverage while respecting demands for particular built infrastructure.","[Kabisch, Nadja; Kraemer, Roland; Masztalerz, Oskar; Hemmerling, Jan; Puffel, Catharina; Haase, Dagmar] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Kabisch, Nadja] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Kraemer, Roland] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Monitoring & Explorat Technol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Puffel, Catharina] Inst Ecol Econ Res, Potsdamer Str 105, D-10785 Berlin, Germany; [Haase, Dagmar] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Kabisch, N (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",nadja.kabisch@geo.hu-berlin.de,"Kraemer, Roland/D-5369-2015; Kabisch, Nadja/ABE-6198-2020","Kraemer, Roland/0000-0001-7115-833X; Kabisch, Nadja/0000-0002-8925-4423","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LN1705A]; City of Leipzig, Department for Urban Green and Waters","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); City of Leipzig, Department for Urban Green and Waters","This work was carried out within the research project 'Environmental-health Interactions in Cities (GreenEquityHEALTH) - Challenges for Human Well-being under Global Changes' (2017-2022) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), funding code: 01LN1705A.

However, as cities renew themselves through urban redevelopment and climate-adaptation, opportunities arise to improve people's access to urban green areas that can be informed by modeling the network of urban open spaces. Recent research identified the need for multi-criteria indices of access to urban green spaces. Including open spaces such as empty lots, ground- and air-spaces surrounding buildings, and spaces associated with roads and other linear features can improve planning for urban greenspaces by identifying areas of opportunity for additional greening. Further, the gradient of interconnections among open spaces can be used to prioritize urban greening locations to build green networks. We modelled all open-space connections across 605 km(2)in Seoul, population 10.3 million, using Omniscape, a landscape connectivity model. We combined the resulting open-space connectivity map with distance-based indices for existing urban parks and street trees. Combining these criteria permits rank-prioritization of locations where new green spaces would most improve residents' access. We found 2910 of 3375 (86.2%) locations where urban green spaces already exist within 300 m for city residents. Of the remaining 465 locations, 276 are in areas with the lowest-open space connections. For urban street trees, 44.3% of the 2588 km of the city's major roads are already planted with street trees. Of the remainder, 210 km (8.1%) are located in the areas with the least connections to green spaces. Nine new urban parks would provide relief for the most highly-impacted areas, where the flow of open space is lowest and where no green spaces are available within 300 m. The integration of a spatial model typically used for conservation assessments with city planning provides useful additional context for building urban health.","[Thorne, James H.; Boynton, Ryan M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Choe, Hyeyeong] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Ecol Landscape Architecture Design, Chunchon 24341, South Korea; [Boynton, Ryan M.; Lee, Dong Kun] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture, Seoul 08826, South Korea",University of California System; University of California Davis; Kangwon National University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Choe, H (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Ecol Landscape Architecture Design, Chunchon 24341, South Korea.",jhthorne@ucdavis.edu; hychoe@kangwon.ac.kr,,"Choe, Hyeyeong/0000-0003-2130-1622; Boynton, Ryan/0000-0002-3952-2573",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2019R1G1A1005770],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT),The authors thank Dr Brad McRae and Dr Carrie Schloss at The Nature Conservancy for use of their codes.

Thus, the objective of this study was to construct an agricultural zoning for climate risk (ZARC) for bamboo using meteorological elements spatialized by neural networks. Climate data included air temperature (T-AIR, degrees C) and rainfall (P) from 4947 meteorological stations in Brazil from the years 1950 to 2016. Regions were considered climatically apt for bamboo cultivation when T-AIR varied between 18 and 35 degrees C, and P was between 500 and 2800 mm year(-1), or P-WINTER was between 90 and 180 mm year(-1). The remainder of the areas was considered marginal or inapt for bamboo cultivation. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network with a multilayered backpropagation training algorithm was used to spatialize the territorial variability of each climatic element for the whole area of Brazil. Using the overlapping of the T-AIR, P, and P-WINTER maps prepared by MLP, and the established climatic criteria of bamboo, we established the agricultural zoning for bamboo. Brazil demonstrates high seasonal climatic variability with T-AIR varying between 14 and 30 degrees C, and P varying between < 400 and 4000 mm year(-1). The ZARC showed that 87% of Brazil is climatically apt for bamboo cultivation. The states that were classified as apt in 100% of their territories were Mato Grosso do Sul, Goias, Tocantins, Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo, Sergipe, Alagoas, Ceara, Piaui, MaranhAo, Rondonia, and Acre. The regions that have restrictions due to low T-AIR represent just 11% of Brazilian territory. This agroclimatic zoning allowed for the classification of regions based on aptitude of climate for bamboo cultivation and showed that 71% of the total national territory is considered to be apt for bamboo cultivation. The regions that have restrictions are part of southern Brazil due to low values of T-AIR and portions of the northern region that have high levels of P which is favorable for the development of diseases.","[de Oliveira Aparecido, Lucas Eduardo; da Silva Cabral de Moraes, Jose Reinaldo; Soares, Sabrina dos Santos; Silva Costa, Cicero Teixeira; Mesquita, Daniel Zimmermann] Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Mato Grosso Sul, Campus Navirai, Navirai, MS, Brazil; [Rolim, Glauco de Souza; de Meneses, Kamila Cunha; da Silva Barbosa, Aline Michelle] Sao Paulo State Univ, Dept Exact Sci, BR-14884900 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; [Martorano, Lucieta Guerreiro; do Amaral, Eufran Ferreira; Bardales, Nilson Gomes] Embrapa Eastern Amazon, Trav Dr Eneas Pinheiro S-N, Belem, Para, Brazil",Universidade Estadual Paulista; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA),"Aparecido, LED (corresponding author), Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Mato Grosso Sul, Campus Navirai, Navirai, MS, Brazil.",lucas-aparecido@outlook.com,"Martorano, Lucieta Guerreiro/O-4719-2018; de Meneses, Kamila Cunha/AAK-9546-2020; da Silva Cabral de Moraes, José Reinaldo/V-5898-2019; DE OLIVEIRA APARECIDO, LUCAS EDUARDO/Y-3502-2019","Martorano, Lucieta Guerreiro/0000-0003-3893-3781; de Meneses, Kamila Cunha/0000-0001-9200-5260; da Silva Cabral de Moraes, José Reinaldo/0000-0002-8567-4893; DE OLIVEIRA APARECIDO, LUCAS EDUARDO/0000-0002-4561-6760; Barbosa, Aline Michelle da Silva/0000-0001-8336-2645",,,,,23,2,3,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

The release of ineffective agents should be avoided, as these add to the costs and risks of biological control without contributing to its benefits. While the principles of host-specificity testing and risk assessment for weed biological control agents have been extensively debated and refined, there has been less attention given to assessing the probable efficacy of agents prior to release. This reluctance to undertake pre-release efficacy assessment (PREA) is probably based on concerns that it will both add to the cost of screening biological control agents and introduce a risk of wrongly rejecting effective agents. We used a project simulation model to investigate the implications of using PREA as an additional filter in the agent selection process. The results suggest that, if it can be done at a lower cost than host-specificity testing, the use of PREA as the first filter can make agent selection more cost-effective than screening based on host-specificity alone. We discuss examples of PREA and potential approaches. The impact of biocontrol agents is a function of their range, abundance, and per-capita damage. While it will always be difficult to predict the post-release abundance of biological control agents from pre-release studies, some estimates of potential range can be obtained from studies of climatic adaptation. For agents that affect the vegetative growth or survival of their target weeds, experimental measurement of per-capita damage is feasible and can contribute to a reduction in the numbers of ineffective agents released. The Anna Karenina principle states that success in complex undertakings does not depend on a single factor but requires avoiding many separate causes of failure. We suggest that, in biological control of weeds, the use of agents that are not sufficiently damaging is one such cause that can be partially avoided by the use of pre-release efficacy assessment.

These impacts vary between households, localities and individuals of the same household due to a diversity of livelihood strategies and differing needs. The aim of this study, therefore, was to understand how gender may highlight vulnerability to climate change through a combination of complex and interlinked factors that results in different vulnerabilities for men and women. The study was conducted in three rain-fed localities of Pakistan's Punjab that represented three different climatic zones namely high rainfall, mid rainfall and low rainfall. The qualitative research method was employed with the help of 30 key informant interviews (15 women, 15 men) that were undertaken to understand gender roles, responsibilities and livelihood strategies. Finding of the study revealed that there is an increased frequency and duration of extreme climatic events and natural disasters with great uncertainty about the rate of change. Women stands on the frontline of these disasters to bear its impacts but with limited and restricted access to human, financial and natural capitals, and this is driving an expanded vulnerability to climate change in study area. Overall, women were culturally and socially dependent on men in a way that increased vulnerability to climate change. It was observed that women empowerment could play an important role in building the resilience toward climate change; hence, voices of women need to be raised and heard. Women groups should be established in each community where they can come and discuss about their issues and suggest possible solutions. Overall, there is a need in improvement of livelihoods and strengthening the adaptation capacity by ensuring women's access, control and ownership of resources. Women involvement should be considered in developing climate adaptation strategies and policies.","[Habib, Nusrat] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Alauddin, Mohammad; Cramb, Rob] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Habib, N (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",n.habib@uq.edu.au,,"Alauddin, Mohammad/0000-0003-2510-882X; Habib, Nusrat/0000-0001-5258-0148",,,,,63,2,2,5,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1886,,,COGENT SOC SCI,Cogent Soc.

The proposed seawall will terminate close to lower wealth, predominantly minority communities. These communities are identified as environmental justice (EJ) communities due to their history of inequitable burdens of industrial and urban pollution and proximity to highways and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated Superfund sites. The present study documents community concerns and opinions related to the proposed seawall, existing flooding problems, and other issues. The project was guided by knowledge co-production and participant-observation approaches and included interviews with community members, collection of locality-specific data, GIS mapping to visualize key issues, development of an ArcGIS Story Map, and participation in public meetings. Community concerns are reported in the voices of community members and fell into eight major themes: community connections, drainage, impacts of road infrastructure, displacement, increasing vulnerability, sense of exclusion and isolation, mistrust of government, and civic engagement. Community members were significantly engaged in the study and are the owners of the results. As one of the first US East Coast cities pursuing major structural adaptation for flooding, Charleston is likely to become a model for other cities considering waterfront protection measures. We demonstrate the importance of meaningful engagement to ensure that climate adaptation will benefit all, including marginalized communities, and have as few unintended negative consequences as possible. Bringing more people to the table and creating vibrant, long-term partnerships between academic institutions and community-based organizations that include robust links to governmental organizations should be among the first steps in building inclusive, equitable, and climate resilient cities.","[Taylor, Judith] Coll Charleston, Masters Environm & Sustainabil Studies Program, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Levine, Norman S.] Coll Charleston, Lowcountry Hazards Ctr, Dept Geol & Environm Geosci, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Muhammad, Ernest] Lowcountry Alliance Model Communities, N Charleston, SC 29405 USA; [Porter, Dwayne E.] Univ South Carolina, Arnold Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Watson, Annette M.] Coll Charleston, Dept Polit Sci, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Sandifer, Paul A.] Coll Charleston, Ctr Coastal Environm & Human Hlth, Charleston, SC 29424 USA",College of Charleston; College of Charleston; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; College of Charleston; College of Charleston,"Sandifer, PA (corresponding author), Coll Charleston, Ctr Coastal Environm & Human Hlth, Charleston, SC 29424 USA.",taylorj4@g.cofc.edu; sandiferpa@cofc.edu,,"Sandifer, Paul/0000-0002-1255-1470",National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [P01ES028942]; US Environmental Protection Agency [EQ-1-680],National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)); US Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency),Partial support for the research was provided by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences under award number P01ES028942 and the US Environmental Protection Agency under award number EQ-1-680.,,66,0,0,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The present study focuses on sediment texture within the beach-dune systems corresponding to an arcuate and a straight beach of Bakkhali and Talsari region, respectively. Multivariate statistical approach has been used to identify the end members and their proportion contributing to the grain size composition of the beach-dune system. To support the end members with a meaningful geological significance, discriminant analysis for depositional environments and CM plot for its dynamics are substantiated. The beach-dune system of Bakkhali shows appreciable homogenization of samples as compared to the Talsari region. In the Bakkhali beach an average of 0.238 m/year erosion and average rate of accretion is 0.423 m/year while in Talsari beach it is 0.238 m/year and 0.302 m/year, respectively. The end-member (EM) modelling showed relatively high contributions of medium- to fine-sand (ranging similar to 2.0 to 3.5 Phi) along with a minor amount of fines. Our study clarifies that grain size population exerts the primary control on erosion-accretion whilst hydraulic effects of wave and wind contribute to its spatial distribution. Since the particular size is lost from the system which needs to be replenished otherwise it disturbs the beach equilibrium. This study also bears its importance for beach nourishment as the end member analysis serves as a guide to replenish a beach with the required types of sediment grain sizes and search for its specific source areas. This work will also pave the way for advanced coastal resilience programs and climate adaptation planning and provide a platform for policymakers, technological innovators, the industry and researchers for coastal hazard mitigation and will ensure decision-makers regarding the execution of the plans on the ground.","[Sinha, Subhajit; Mondal, Subhronil; Hansda, Sonu] Univ Calcutta, Dept Geol, 35 Ballygunge Circular Rd, Kolkata 700019, W Bengal, India; [Mondal, Sushanta Kumar] Sidho Kanho Birsha Univ, Dept Phys, Ranchi Rd, Purulia 723104, W Bengal, India; [Mondal, Subhronil] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res IISER, Dept Earth Sci, Kolkata 741246, W Bengal, India; [Patra, Uttam Kumar] JK Coll, Dept Geog, Purulia 723101, W Bengal, India",University of Calcutta; Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) - Kolkata,"Sinha, S (corresponding author), Univ Calcutta, Dept Geol, 35 Ballygunge Circular Rd, Kolkata 700019, W Bengal, India.",subho.ecstasy@gmail.com,,"patra, uttam kumar/0000-0002-2840-1530",,,,,62,0,0,4,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

J,"Rossel, RAV; Bouma, J",,,,"Rossel, Raphael A. Viscarra; Bouma, Johan",,,Soil sensing: A new paradigm for agriculture,AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NITROGEN; LANDSCAPE; AUSTRALIA,"Last century, during the 'Green Revolution' the use of synthetic fertilizers contributed to increased agricultural production. However, their use did not reflect local soil and water conditions because recommendations were developed for larger agro-ecological zones. They only focused on increased productivity, neglecting any adverse environmental consequences. Largely, this legacy remains and recommendations are still made using top-down' procedures based on limited data and generic, empirical relations between soil nutrient contents, fertilization rates and yields. Using soil sensors in agriculture can fundamentally change this approach by allowing innovative 'bottom-up' approaches that characterize local soil and environmental conditions in space and time, improving the efficiency of production to maximize farm incomes and minimize environmental side effects. The sensed information can be used to build site-specific databases of relations between soil and plant condition and growth. Recent technological developments in sensing coupled with ongoing advances in information and communication technologies have given ground to a renewed interest in soil sensing and its use in different applications at different spatial scales. Soil sensing can facilitate the measurement and monitoring of the soil's physical and biochemical attributes (e.g. nutrients, water) to better understand their dynamics, their interactions with the environment while considering their large spatial heterogeneity. The new sensing methods can also be used to effectively monitor soil organic carbon and be central to the adoption of best agronomic practices that also allow carbon sequestration and a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, sensing can help us to better articulate the potential of soil to meet the world's needs for food, fiber, climate adaptation and environmental sustainability allowing the design and implementation of innovative management practices and policy aimed at sustainable development.

Effects of this practice on bush bean yield have not been fully evaluated with respect to input use and compatibility when intercropped with maize. An on-farm trial managed by smallholder community members was conducted to assess the influence of various soil fertility management options and cropping systems on the yield of two bush bean genotypes (SER45 and SER83) in two agro-ecological zones of Malawi. The farmer-managed trials were laid out in split-plot design, with the bean genotypes as main plots and a combination of the soil fertility management options (i.e., no input, manure, fertiliser and fertiliser + manure) and cropping systems (i.e., sole crop and intercrop) as subplots. The trials were affected by terminal drought and dry spells, but results show that manure and fertiliser application enhanced the resilience of the drought-tolerant bean genotypes. The genotype SER45 was responsive to manure application in the sole crop, giving a 44.4% yield increase over no-manure application. In sole cropping with fertiliser plus manure, bean yields improved by 40.1% for SER45 and 78.3% for SER83 relative to the no-input control. Although sole cropping had higher bean yields, the treatment with manure and fertiliser had a higher land equivalence ratio for intercrop of 1.54 for SER45 and 1.32 for SER83 over sole cropping. These results show that, under smallholder farmer management, the climate adaptability of bush bean genotypes could be enhanced by the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilisers in maize-bean intercrop. The combined application also enhances whole-farm productivity of the common maize-bean intercrop practice than monocrop, hence is of benefit to most low-input smallholder farmers of SSA.","[Ndengu, Gift; Mponela, Powell; Chataika, Barthlomew; Desta, Lulseged Tamene; Chirwa, Rowland] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, POB 158, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Chataika, Barthlomew] Ctr Coordinat Agr Res & Dev Southern Africa CCARD, Private Bag 00357, Gaborone, Botswana; [Sileshi, Gudeta G.] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Plant Biol & Biodivers Management, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Addis Ababa University,"Mponela, P (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, POB 158, Lilongwe, Malawi.",p.mponela@cgiar.org,"Mponela, Powell/E-4710-2016","Mponela, Powell/0000-0003-4269-0663",USAID Feed the Future's Africa RISING program; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [INV-005460]; grant conditions of the Foundation,USAID Feed the Future's Africa RISING program(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationCGIAR); grant conditions of the Foundation,"USAID Feed the Future's Africa RISING program funded the field trials.

In this study, statistical downscaling algorithms, based on both weather regimes and past analogues, are operated for 18 Israeli rain gauges with an altitude ranging between -200 and similar to 1,000 m above sea level (ASL). To project seasonal precipitation over Israel and its hydrologic basins, the algorithms are applied to six Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models for the end of the 21st century, according to the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The downscaled models can capture quite well the seasonal precipitation distribution, though with underestimation in winter and overestimation in spring. All models display a significant reduction of seasonal precipitation for the 21st century according to both scenarios. The winter reductions for the end of the century and the RCP8.5 scenario are found to be similar to 22 and similar to 37% according to the weather regimes and the analogues downscaling methods, respectively. Spring reductions are found to be similar to 10-20% larger than winter reductions. It is shown that the projected reduction results from a decrease in the frequency of the rain-bearing systems, as well as a decrease in the average daily precipitation intensity. The areas with the largest reductions in seasonal precipitation are found over the central mountains, the Mediterranean coastal area, and the Sea of Galilee hydrologic basins, which are the main fresh-water aquifers and reservoirs of Israel. The statistical downscaling methods applied in this study can be easily transferred to other regions where long-term data sets of observed precipitation are available. This study and others may serve as a basis for priority and policy setting toward better climate adaptation with associated uncertainties related to the methods used and nonstationary of the climate system.","[Hochman, Assaf] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Dept Tropospher Res, Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Kunin, Pavel; Alpert, Pinhas; Harpaz, Tzvi] Tel Aviv Univ, Porter Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Dept Geophys, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Harpaz, Tzvi; Saaroni, Hadas] Tel Aviv Univ, Porter Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Dept Geog & Human Environm, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Rostkier-Edelstein, Dorita] Israel Inst Biol Res, Dept Appl Math, Environm Sci Div, Ness Ziona, Israel; [Rostkier-Edelstein, Dorita] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fredy & Nadine Herrmann Inst Earth Sci, Edmond J Safra Campus, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Tel Aviv University; Tel Aviv University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Hochman, A (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Dept Tropospher Res, Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.",assaf.hochman@kit.edu,,"Rostkier-Edelstein, Dorita/0000-0003-2191-1236",Israel Science Foundation (ISF) [1123/17]; Water Authority of Israel; cooperation in the international virtual institute DESERVE (Dead Sea Research Venue) - German Helmholtz Association,Israel Science Foundation (ISF)(Israel Science Foundation); Water Authority of Israel; cooperation in the international virtual institute DESERVE (Dead Sea Research Venue) - German Helmholtz Association,"The authors thank the Tel-Aviv University President and Mintz foundation.

This threatens the equilibrium of the socio-ecosystems where they are located and on which they depend: underground water resources are exploited with a disregard for sustainability; land is reclaimed from wetlands or lagoons; built-up areas, both formal and informal, grow without adequate urban planning. Together, all these forces can result in land surface deformation, subsidence or even uplift, which can increase risk within these already fragile socio-ecosystems. In particular, in the case of land subsidence, the risk of urban flooding can increase significantly, also considering the contribution of sea level rise driven by climate change. Monitoring such fast-changing environments is crucial to be able to identify key risks and plan adaptation responses to mitigate current and future flood risks. Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful tool to monitor land deformation with high precision using relatively low-cost technology, also thanks to the open access data of Sentinel-1, which provides global observations every 6 days at 20-m ground resolution. In this paper, we demonstrate how it is possible to monitor land subsidence in urban coastal areas by means of permanent scatterer interferometry and Sentinel-1, exploiting an automatic procedure based on an integration of the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS). We present the results of PSI analysis over the cities of Banjul (the Gambia) and Lagos (Nigeria) showing a comparison of results obtained with TerraSAR-X, Constellation of Small Satellites for the Mediterranean Basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) and Environmental Satellite advanced synthetic aperture radar (Envisat-ASAR) data. The methodology allows us to highlight areas of high land deformation, information that is useful for urban development, disaster risk management and climate adaptation planning.","[Cian, Fabio; Carrera, Lorenzo] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Cian, Fabio] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Delgado Blasco, Jose Manuel] Univ Jaen, Grp Invest Microgeodesia, Jaen 23071, Spain",The World Bank; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Universidad de Jaen,"Cian, F (corresponding author), World Bank Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Cian, F (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",fcian@worldbank.org; josemanuel.delgadoblasco@gmail.com; lcarrera@worldbank.org,"Blasco, Jose Manuel Delgado/AAM-6983-2020","Delgado Blasco, Jose Manuel/0000-0003-0098-3046",Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery under the CityCORE Africa Project [P166688]; Africa DRM Programmatic Approach (Strengthening Climate and Disaster Risk Management in Sub-Saharan Africa) [P150835],Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery under the CityCORE Africa Project; Africa DRM Programmatic Approach (Strengthening Climate and Disaster Risk Management in Sub-Saharan Africa),"This research was supported by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery under the CityCORE Africa Project (P166688), a subtask of the Africa DRM Programmatic Approach (Strengthening Climate and Disaster Risk Management in Sub-Saharan Africa, P150835).",,67,36,36,1,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,MAR 12,2019,9,3,,,,,,,124,10.3390/geosciences9030124,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences9030124,,,32,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,HT3DX,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000464445300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, N-2 losses might dominate total gaseous nitrogen (N) losses. Knowledge on N losses is key for the development of climate-adapted management that balances agronomic and environmental needs. Hence, we quantified all gaseous N losses from a montane grassland in Southern Germany both for ambient climatic conditions and for a climate change treatment (+2 degrees C MAT, -300mm MAP). Monthly measurements of soil N-2 emissions of intact soil cores revealed that those exceeded by far soil N2O emissions and averaged at 350 +/- 101 (ambient climate) and 738 +/- 197 mu gN m(-2) h(-1) (climate change). Because these measurements did not allow to quantify emission peaks after fertilization, an additional laboratory experiment was deployed to quantify the response of NH3, NO, N2O, and N-2 emissions in sub daily temporal resolution to a typical slurry fertilization event (51kgN ha(-1)). Our results revealed that total N gas losses amounted to roughly half of applied slurry-N. Surprisingly, N-2 but not NH3 dominated fertilizer N losses, with N-2 emissions accounting for 16-21kg or 31-42% of the applied slurry-N, while NH3 volatilization (3.5kg), N2O (0.2-0.5kg) and NO losses (0-0.2kg) were of minor importance. Though constraining annual N-2 loss remained uncertain due to high spatiotemporal variability of fluxes, we show that N-2 losses are a so far overlooked key component of the N balance in montane grasslands, which needs to be considered for developing improved grassland management strategies targeted at increasing N use efficiency.","[Zistl-Schlingmann, Marcus; Feng, Jinchao; Kiese, Ralf; Stephan, Ruth; Zuazo, Pablo; Willibald, Georg; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus; Dannenmann, Michael] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Environm Res IMK IFU, Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Feng, Jinchao; Wang, Changhui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS","Dannenmann, M (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Environm Res IMK IFU, Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",Michael.dannenmann@kit.edu,"Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/A-8081-2013; Dannenmann, Michael/A-7278-2013","Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/0000-0001-9499-6598; Dannenmann, Michael/0000-0001-5924-7612; Kiese, Ralf/0000-0002-2814-4888; Stephan, Ruth/0000-0002-9044-4814",Helmholtz-BMBF TERENO initiative; BMBF SUSALPS project; FORKAST project of the Bavarian government; DFG research unit DASIM,Helmholtz-BMBF TERENO initiative; BMBF SUSALPS project(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); FORKAST project of the Bavarian government; DFG research unit DASIM(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work was funded by the Helmholtz-BMBF TERENO initiative, the BMBF SUSALPS project and the FORKAST project of the Bavarian government.

The impacts of the early urbanization process and the rapid development of the international metropolis on the interactive development of spatial zoning, urban climate, and urbanization in the main region of Shanghai are studied. This study has important practical and methodological implications with respect to two major themes in the current urban planning area of China, specifically, the construction of new urbanization and the changes in urban climate adaptation. Through the experiences of the human activities model from ecology, factors are selected based on the effects of climate on four dimensions, namely, economy, urban construction, ecological, and environment, where the weight of each index is determined by the coefficient of the variation method and the important spatial factors influencing the climate effect are screened out. The four important influential factors are population density, road density, built-up areas, and the green coverage ratio of spatial distribution. A quantitative analysis determined that there exists a consistent relationship between urban climate factors and the four urbanization spatial factors. Based on urbanization classification that considered each factor evaluation along with integrated analyses and statistical correlation analyses of the spatial grid index using ArcGIS software, the urban space partition level is identified, and urban spatial zoning strategies based on the co-movement of urban climate system are put forward. Combined with the zoning study of land use and the urban heat island distribution pattern, the spatial zoning strategy of controlling urbanization intensity based on the urban climate system is proposed. This research will guide the integration of the urbanization spatial structure and urban climate system toward rational development in Shanghai city.","[Jiang, Yunfang; Hou, Luyao; Ning, Yuemin] East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Ctr Modern Chinese City Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yunfang] East China Normal Univ, Inst Innovat & Strateg Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Shi, Tiemao] Shenyang Jianzhu Univ, Inst Ecol Urbanizat & Green Bldg, Shenyang 110168, Liaoning, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; East China Normal University; Shenyang Jianzhu University,"Jiang, YF (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Ctr Modern Chinese City Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Jiang, YF (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Inst Innovat & Strateg Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Shi, TM (corresponding author), Shenyang Jianzhu Univ, Inst Ecol Urbanizat & Green Bldg, Shenyang 110168, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",yfjiang@re.ecnu.edu.cn; jwang@sat.ecnu.edu.cn; tiemaos@sjzu.edu.cn; ymning@re.ecnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51108182, 51578344]; Ministry of Education in China [16JJD790012]; Institute for Innovation and Strategic Studies of ECNU [40500-10203-542500/034/003]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education in China(Ministry of Education, China); Institute for Innovation and Strategic Studies of ECNU","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China project (Grant Nos. 51108182 and 51578344), the Key base Project of Humanities and Social Sciences from Ministry of Education in China (16JJD790012).

The recently developed Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) create a framework for the study of climate-related scenario outcomes. Their five narratives span a wide range of worlds that vary in their challenges for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Here we provide background on the quantification that has been selected to serve as the reference, or 'marker', implementation for SSP2. The SSP2 narrative describes a middle-of-the-road development in the mitigation and adaptation challenges space. We explain how the narrative has been translated into quantitative assumptions in the IIASA Integrated Assessment Modelling Framework. We show that our SSP2 marker implementation occupies a central position for key metrics along the mitigation and adaptation challenge dimensions. For many dimensions the SSP2 marker implementation also reflects an extension of the historical experience, particularly in terms of carbon and energy intensity improvements in its baseline. This leads to a steady emissions increase over the 21st century, with projected end-of-century warming nearing 4 degrees C relative to preindustrial levels. On the other hand, SSP2 also shows that global mean temperature increase can be limited to below 2 degrees C, pending stringent climate policies throughout the world. The added value of the SSP2 marker implementation for the wider scientific community is that it can serve as a starting point to further explore integrated solutions for achieving multiple societal objectives in light of the climate adaptation and mitigation challenges that society could face over the 21st century.

Furthermore, most studies on the subject make use of general, vague, and confusing terminology. This paper suggests a new innovative conceptual framework (the Resilient City Planning Framework or RCPF) that addresses the critical question of what cities and their urban communities should do in order to move towards a more resilient state in the future. Accordingly, the RCPF takes complexity and uncertainty into account. It is affected by a multiplicity of economic, social, spatial, and physical factors and its planning involves a wide range of stakeholders. RCPF is a network of four interlinked concepts that together, provide a comprehensive understanding of City Resilience. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Along with the Great Lakes, this vast area generates similar to US 370 billion of U.S. gross domestic product, 617 billion in sales and 2.6 million jobs each year. These ocean and coastal ecosystems also provide many important non-market services including subsistence food provisioning, health benefits, shoreline protection, climate regulation, conservation of marine biodiversity, and preservation of cultural heritage. As climatic changes occur, these benefits or ecosystem services may be significantly reduced or in some cases enhanced. These services are also under an array of pressures including over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution, and land use changes that occur simultaneously in synergistic, multiplicative, or antagonistic ways. This results in direct and indirect impacts that are often unpredictable across spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss a set of indicators designed in close collaboration with the U.S. National Climate Indicators System. Tracking the impacts via indicators will be essential to ensure long-term health of the marine environment and sustain the benefits to stakeholders who depend on marine ecosystem services.","[Clay, Patricia M.; Colburn, Lisa L.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 166 Water St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Howard, Jennifer] Conservat Int, Ctr Oceans, 2011 Crystal Dr, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Busch, D.

Collective and bargaining approaches were used in collecting individual and intra-household-level data of 120 pairs of spouses in Southeast Nigeria; husbands and wives were interviewed separately. Focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and household surveys were used to elicit responses from the respondents. Quantitative data for the study were analyzed using percentage, mean scores, and multinomial logit regression analysis. Results of the study revealed that 90% of the wives were more food insecure than their husbands (79.2%). The respondents noted that the observed changes in the climate contributed immensely to their food insecurity situation. To cope with food insecurity, a slightly higher proportion (47.3% and 14.2%) of wives adopted on-farm and non-farm strategies, respectively, while men (39.8%) adopted more off-farm strategies (38.5%). Additionally, results of the multinomial logit regression revealed that market distance and credit access significantly influenced the choice of husbands' and wives' engagement in off-farm livelihood strategy; sourcing information on climate change issues significantly influenced women's choice of engagement in off-farm/non-farm strategy; and receiving remittances significantly influenced men's choice of engagement in non-farm strategy. The study concluded that, although women play crucial roles in addressing food insecurity within their households, gender-specific obstacles typically impede their abilities to cope with climate-induced food insecurity.","[Anugwa, Ifeoma Q.; Agwu, Agwu E.] Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Extens, Nsukka, Enugu State, Nigeria; [Suvedi, Murari] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Babu, Suresh] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Nigeria; Michigan State University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Anugwa, IQ (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Extens, Nsukka, Enugu State, Nigeria.",Ifeoma.irohibe@unn.edu.ng,"Anugwa, Ifeoma/AAD-2893-2021","Anugwa, Ifeoma/0000-0002-9179-8008; Ekwe Agwu, Agwu/0000-0002-6842-0955",United States Agency for International Development through the Norman E.

Moreover, it becomes well-established in major areas of agricultural researches and across the broad spectrum of agricultural techniques especially in specific sectors of scientific frontiers, including soil quality, irrigation scheduling, water resource distribution, crop productivity, tillage management, climate adaptation, and environment monitoring, etc. This paper reviews the research developments and integrated applications of precision irrigation in typical domains of mechanism and performance, covering key aspects such as process optimization, schedule modelling, and effectiveness evaluation, indicating that advanced irrigation optimization methods support higher productivity of crop field and better environmental conditions of soil; Current schedule modelling techniques provide a set of instructive demonstrations and heuristic descriptions for the working principles of precision irrigation and the quantitative assessments of irrigation productivity; The novel investigation on effectiveness evaluation is extremely significant to obtain higher infiltration efficiency, simultaneously to achieve the optimized irrigation qualities for water balance condition, soil water redistribution, and soil moisture uniformity so that the effectiveness quality of irrigation infiltration could be improved remarkably. It is concluded that precision irrigation owns an outstanding collaborating capability and possesses much better working advancement in typical calibration indexes of cultivation accuracy and infiltration efficiency, meanwhile, a high agreement between the predicted and actual irrigation effectiveness could be expected. This novel irrigation review concentrating on the conceptual and systematic progress should be promoted constructively to improve the quality uniformity for precision irrigation and its constructive influences in different applications, and to facilitate the integrated management of agricultural production by higher irrigation efficiency consequently.","[Liang, Zhongwei; Liu, Xiaochu; Xiao, Jinrui; Liu, Changhong] Guangzhou Univ, Guangdong Engn Res Ctr High Efficient Util Water, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Liang, Zhongwei; Liu, Xiaochu; Xiao, Jinrui; Liu, Changhong] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Liang, Zhongwei; Liu, Xiaochu] Guangzhou Univ, Adv Inst Engn Sci Intelligent Mfg, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China",Guangzhou University; Guangzhou University; Guangzhou University,"Liang, ZW (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.",liangzhongwei@gzhu.edu.cn; gdliuxiaochu@gzhu.edu.cn; xjr@gzhu.edu.cn; changhongliu@gzhu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51975136, 51575116, U1601204, 52075109]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB2000501]; China National Spark Program [2015GA780065]; Science and Technology Innovative Research Team Program in Higher Educational Universities of Guangdong Province [2017KCXTD025]; Innovative Academic Team Project of Guangzhou Education System [1201610013]; Special Research Projects in the Key Fields of Guangdong Higher Educational Universities [2019KZDZX1009]; Science and Technology Research Project of Guangdong Province [2017A010102014, 2016A010102022]; Science and Technology Research Project of Guangzhou [201707010293]; Guangzhou University Research Project [YJ2021002]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; China National Spark Program; Science and Technology Innovative Research Team Program in Higher Educational Universities of Guangdong Province; Innovative Academic Team Project of Guangzhou Education System; Special Research Projects in the Key Fields of Guangdong Higher Educational Universities; Science and Technology Research Project of Guangdong Province; Science and Technology Research Project of Guangzhou; Guangzhou University Research Project,"The authors acknowledge the funding received from the following science foundations: National Natural Science Foundation of China (51975136, 51575116, U1601204, 52075109), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFB2000501), China National Spark Program (2015GA780065), the Science and Technology Innovative Research Team Program in Higher Educational Universities of Guangdong Province (2017KCXTD025), the Innovative Academic Team Project of Guangzhou Education System (1201610013), the Special Research Projects in the Key Fields of Guangdong Higher Educational Universities (2019KZDZX1009), the Science and Technology Research Project of Guangdong Province (2017A010102014, 2016A010102022), the Science and Technology Research Project of Guangzhou (201707010293), and Guangzhou University Research Project (YJ2021002), which are all appreciated for supporting this work.

This is the final step of the logistics process that unites the product with its new owner. We present and explain challenges of science-guided adaptation at the local level, and how this is an equivalent 'last mile' challenge for climate adaptation. Technical summary The 'last mile' issue, a term used in transportation planning, describes the movement of people and goods from a transportation hub to a final destination, a local place such as a home or a shop. This is the critical final step of the logistics process that unites the product with its new owner, and the point of the value chain. This analogy aptly describes the last steps between presenting scientific evidence of climate change to decision-makers for use in local adaptation and planning. Climate change data (observational and model simulation data e.g. climate change projections and predictions) remain under-utilised, especially by local institutions and actors for which adaptation is a priority. The assumptions and assertions of the classical data-information-knowledge-wisdom are challenged, and a derivative form of the information hierarchy is proposed. Elements of the classical information hierarchy are offset by four balancing elements of access (to data); usability (of information); governance (of knowledge) and politics (of wisdom). These balancing elements and their relatedness coincide with newer models of innovation relating to the interaction between different stakeholders across the different levels of governance, the inclusion of stakeholder expectations, transparency and accountability.

The evolution of UGS is obvious in the study area, where UGS loss (42.83 km(2)) > UGS extension (4.99 km(2)) > UGS exchange (2.61 km(2)). UGS loss affects forest/grass > water > wetland. Furthermore, the area defined as high temperature zones increased by 23.11 km(2) in 2013, twice as much as that in 1993. However, the influence of UGS on the urban thermal environment differs by type and evolution: water has the greatest cooling effect, followed by wetland and forest/grass, and UGS loss (8.67 degrees C) > UGS exchange (4.00 degrees C) > UGS extension (2.90 degrees C) > UGS unchanged (2.45 degrees C). Finally, the vegetation and cooling index classified the mechanism of temperature response induced by different types of UGS evolution. The evolution of UGS loss usually simulated the movement of the corresponding pixel from the low land surface temperature and high vegetation coverage to the opposite situation. Regression analyses demonstrated that the effect of elevated land surface temperature generated from the reduction of water and forest/grass reached 0.81 degrees C and 0.72 degrees C, respectively, in 20 years, indicating that the loss of a significant amount of UGS during urbanization was the primary influence on the urban thermal environment. This study may provide more useful information for researchers and decision-makers engaged in urban planning, urban regeneration, and sustainable land development, especially focusing on the issues of climate adaption and the urban heat island (UHI) effect mitigation.","[Cai, Yuanbin] Fuzhou Univ, Coll Environm & Resources, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yanhong; Tong, Chuan] Fujian Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Humid Subtrop Ecogeog Proc, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yanhong; Tong, Chuan] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yanhong] Fuzhou Univ, Zhicheng Coll, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China",Fuzhou University; Fujian Normal University; Fujian Normal University; Fuzhou University,"Tong, C (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Humid Subtrop Ecogeog Proc, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Tong, C (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China.",tongch@fjnu.edu.cn,,,Fujian Education Research Project [JT180021]; Social Science Planning Project of Fujian [FJ2016C033],Fujian Education Research Project; Social Science Planning Project of Fujian,This study is support by the Fujian Education Research Project (JT180021) and Social Science Planning Project of Fujian (NO.

Urban greenery is capable of mitigating the UHI by creating microclimates that are lower in temperature than their surroundings, which are known as urban cooling islands (UCI). Previous studies have proved the effectiveness of UCI from different perspectives. However, a specific optimal level of landscape patch size at a regional scale that can be implemented by urban planners has not been identified. In this study, we estimated the optimal patch size in seven selected hot-humid Asian cities with the help of Google Cloud Computing, Python Programming, as well as spatial and statistical analysis. A two-tier (two optimal patch sizes) distribution of the threshold value of efficiency (TVoE) of urban trees in this region was found. Eight landscape-level indexes were used to explore the variance of TVoE. The percentage of landscape (PLAND), edge density (ED), mean landscape shape index (Shape_MN), mean fractal dimension (FRAC_MN), largest patch index (LPI), and mean Euclidian nearest-neighbor distance (ENN_MN) were found to have no significant correlation with TVoE. While the average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI_MN) and average background temperature (BGT_MN) were found to be highly associated with the variance in TVoE. Further, a concept model that can simulate the effects of NDVI_MN and BGT_MN was also proposed. These findings extend the understanding of the UCI effect of urban trees as well as providing a basis for scientific climate adaption planning in this region.","[Yu, Zhaowu; Vejre, Henrik] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Fan, Huiying; Liu, Tsz Yiu; Liu, Tsz Ying; Hung, Carmem Huang] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Environm & Sustainabil, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Gaoyuan] Xiamen Univ, Sch Architecture & Civil Engn, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",University of Copenhagen; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Xiamen University,"Yu, ZW (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark.",asflsyfan@gmail.com; zhyu@ign.ku.dk; yanggaoyuanl@outlook.com; tyliuaa@connect.ust.hk; tyliuab@connect.ust.hk; chhungab@connect.ust.hk; hv@ign.ku.dk,", Zhaowu/E-8032-2016; Gaoyuan, Yang/HKO-4087-2023; Fan, Huiying/GRR-4677-2022; Vejre, Henrik/P-7142-2014",", Zhaowu/0000-0003-4576-4541; Vejre, Henrik/0000-0002-6820-0389; Yang, Gaoyuan/0000-0002-9652-1323; Yang, Gaoyuan/0000-0001-9735-6529",Natural Science Foundation of China [41471150]; Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC),Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),"This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 41471150), in part by the Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC).

However, little research has reviewed how it affects plant performances in different climatic regions. This study aims to analyse published research on green roof growing medium across world's climate zones. Findings are structured according to Koppen-Geiger climate classification, aiming to investigate the prevalence of research conducted in different climate zones. Results from full-scale studies and laboratory or greenhouse experiments were reviewed. The later were included as they provide systematic knowledge on the effect of individual factors on system performances although cannot provide climate specific information. Studies discussed effects of major substrate components and depths on plant survival and establishment using standard test procedures. Results showed that most research in the subject were in temperate (group C climate classification), continental (group D) and dry climates (group B), respectively. Considerable number of investigations was conducted in controlled laboratory or greenhouse environments. Based on the results, future green roof research and guidelines should consider climate specifications of the region in designing growing medium, depths and attribute of green roof substrates in order to ensure enhanced plant performance. Especially, for more fragile but less investigated dry climate, considerations should be made to tackle heat fluctuations and drought stress by enhancing water holding capacity and thermal isolation of the substrate. To move forward, sustainable building solutions as a part of future urban forms, climate-adaptive green roof systems should be included into future research, practice and guidelines.

We analyzed the coastal defense policy in three Wadden Sea countries, The Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark. We looked at policy development in relationship to the anticipated climate change. We combined literature research on legislation and management with interviews of 11 decision makers in the areas of coastal defense and land-use planning policy. We found that coastal defense policy relies mainly on dikes and sand nourishments in the current defense strategy. In anticipation of climate change, some efforts are being made to develop alternative solutions. Land-use planning is involved in flood defense to a limited extent only. As long as budgets and technical solutions can keep the Wadden Sea region safe from major flood disasters, we found it unlikely that any fundamental policy shift will occur.

Climatic variables for these localities were generated using a climatic surface model developed with data from existing meteorological stations. These estimates of temperature, rainfall and seasonal variability were strongly correlated with latitude, so that the different climatic factors covaried. Extemal measurements (body, tail and ear length) and body mass were strongly correlated with condylo-basal skull length which was taken as a more reliable measure of body size. Geographical variation in body size was significantly correlated with latitude, temperature and seasonality although these correlations appeared to be largely the result of a positive relationship between size and rainfall. In contrast, temperature apparently had little effect on morphology as there were no clear correlations between temperature and the size of appendages (tail or ear length). Rainfall might be more important than ambient temperature as a factor influencing body size in small fossorial and semi-fossorial mammals which spend most of their lives in warm subteffanean microhabitats. Meanwhile, the smaller body size of pouched mice from localities with lower rainfall may represent an adaptation to reduce total energy requirements in arid and semi-arid areas where primary production and food availability is low.","UNIV PRETORIA,RES INST,PRETORIA 0002,SOUTH AFRICA; DURBAN NAT SCI MUSEUM,DURBAN 4001,SOUTH AFRICA; TRANSVAAL MUSEUM,DEPT MAMMALS,PRETORIA 0002,SOUTH AFRICA",University of Pretoria,,,"Taylor, Peter/N-3172-2019; Taylor, Peter/E-8655-2011","Taylor, Peter/0000-0001-9048-7366; Taylor, Peter/0000-0001-9048-7366; Ellison, George/0000-0001-8914-6812",,,,,34,27,27,1,11,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0960-7447,,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

The river has long been over-allocated. Climate models project runoff losses of 5-20 % from the basin by mid-21st century due to human-induced climate change. Recent work has shown that decreased snow albedo from anthropogenic dust loading to the CO mountains shortens the duration of snow cover by several weeks relative to conditions prior to western expansion of the US in the mid-1800s, and advances peak runoff at Lees Ferry, Arizona, by an average of 3 weeks. Increases in evapotranspiration from earlier exposure of soils and germination of plants have been estimated to decrease annual runoff by more than 1.0 billion cubic meters, or similar to 5% of the annual average. This prior work was based on observed dust loadings during 2005-2008; however, 2009 and 2010 saw unprecedented levels of dust loading on snowpacks in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB), being on the order of 5 times the 2005-2008 loading. Building on our prior work, we developed a new snow albedo decay parameterization based on observations in 2009/10 to mimic the radiative forcing of extreme dust deposition. We convolve low, moderate, and extreme dust/snow albedos with both historic climate forcing and two future climate scenarios via a delta method perturbation of historic records. Compared to moderate dust, extreme dust absorbs 2 x to 4 x the solar radiation, and shifts peak snowmelt an additional 3 weeks earlier to a total of 6 weeks earlier than pre-disturbance. The extreme dust scenario reduces annual flow volume an additional 1% (6 % compared to pre-disturbance), a smaller difference than from low to moderate dust scenarios due to melt season shifting into a season of lower evaporative demand. The sensitivity of flow timing to dust radiative forcing of snow albedo is maintained under future climate scenarios, but the sensitivity of flow volume reductions decreases with increased climate forcing. These results have implications for water management and suggest that dust abatement efforts could be an important component of any climate adaptation strategies in the UCRB.","[Deems, J.

Potential, accounting and recommendations",BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT,,,German,Article,,,,,,,SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; SEQUESTRATION; SYSTEMS; STOCKS; BIOMASS; METAANALYSIS; EMISSIONS; FOREST; SINKS,"Agroforestry has long been appreciated for having a great potential for increasing and, above all, permanently storing carbon in the biomass and the soil. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU), the European Commission and Parliament recognise agroforestry as a very suitable option in the fight against the climate crisis and in adaptation to its impacts. Of recent interest is financing such climate adaption with market-based instrument like climate- or carbon certificates. In light of the upcoming EU Carbon Farming-Directive, the Fit-for-55-debate as well as the revision of the CAP and LULUCF-mechanisms, there is an urgent need for some guidelines for climate certificates within agroforestry measures and which role these may play in the future. The carbon reduction potential and accounting principles in agroforestry outlined in this article cover four sectors - comparable to other land use-based strategies. 1) above-ground biomass, 2) belowground biomass, 3) the soil, and 4) the up- and downstream sector. The recommendations cover ten frequently discussed topics and concerns, namely 1) additionally, 2) quantifiability, 3) displacement effects, 4) contribution to food security, 5) additional emissions, 6) longevity and durability, 7) traceability, 8) transaction and opportunity costs, 9) synergies and compromises with other goals, and 10) security, trust and transparency. If the recommendations developed are taken into account, the authors conclude that the climate protecting and mitigation services of agroforestry in the form of carbon reduction potential can and should be rewarded by climate or carbon certificates. On the one hand, this could be seen as an innovative and promising way of financing future agroforestry systems; on the other hand, it must be ensured that the measures meet minimum scientific and social requirements. If planned scientifically sound, reliable, transparent and ethically just, there is a good chance to create with climate certificates for agroforestry some contributing solutions for EUs ambitious climate target plan, a 55 percent greenhouse gas reduction by 2030 compared to 1990.","[Hubner, Von Rico] Tech Univ Munchen TUM, Lehrstuhl Strategie & Management Landschaftsentwi, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Boehm, Christian; Tsonkova, Penka] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus Senftenberg BTU, Lehrstuhl Bodenschutz & Rekultivierung, Konrad Wachsmann Allee 6, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany; [Eysel-Zahl, Georg] VRD Stiftung Erneuerbare Energien, Heinrich Fuchs Str 94, D-69126 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kudlich, Wolfram] WALD21 GmbH, Friedrich Ebert Str 13, D-97215 Uffenheim, Germany; [Kursten, Ernst] 3N Dienstleistungen GmbH, Papenstucken 2, D-30455 Hannover, Germany; [Lamersdorf, Norbert] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Busgen Inst Okopedol Gemaigten Zonen, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Meixner, Christoph A.] Triebwerk Regenerat Land & Agroforstwirtschaft, Rothenbach 49, D-37290 Meissner, Germany; [Morhart, Christopher] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Waldwachstum & Dendrookol, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Peschel, Tobias] Lignovis GmbH, Tietzestr 29, D-22587 Hamburg, Germany; [Wiesmeier, Martin] Inst Agrarokol Okol Landbau & Bodenschutz IAB, Bayer Landesanstalt Landwirtschaft LfL, Emil Ramann Str 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich; University of Gottingen; University of Freiburg,"Hubner, V (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munchen TUM, Lehrstuhl Strategie & Management Landschaftsentwi, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",rico.huebner@tum.de; boehmc@btu.de; gez@vrd-stiftung.org; kudlich@wald21.com; ek@wood-report.de; nlamers@gwdg.de; christoph.meixner@relawi.org; Christopher.Morhart@iww.uni-freiburg.de; tobias.peschel@lignovis.com; penka.tsonkova@b-tu.de; martin.wiesmeier@lfl.bayern.de,"Böhm, Christian/HDN-5925-2022; Morhart, Christopher David/F-6718-2014","Morhart, Christopher David/0000-0003-1874-5011",,,,,93,0,0,11,15,BUNDESMINISTERIUM ERNAHRUNG LANDWIRTSCHAFT,BPMM,"DEICHMANNS AUE 29, BPMM, 53179, GERMANY",2196-5099,,,BER LANDWIRTSCH,Ber.

Even if the target for average temperature increase in the Paris Climate Agreement is met, temperatures during the hottest month in a northern city like Oslo are predicted to rise by over 5 degrees C by 2050. We hypothesised that heat-related diagnoses for heat-sensitive citizens (75+) in Oslo are correlated to monthly air temperatures, and that green infrastructure such as tree canopy cover reduces extreme land surface temperatures and thus reduces health risk from heat exposure. Monthly air temperatures were significantly correlated to the number of skin-related diagnoses at the city level, but were unrelated to diagnoses under circulatory, nervous system, or general categories. Satellite-derived spatially-explicit measures revealed that on one of the hottest days during the summer of 2018, landscape units composed of paved, midrise or lowrise buildings gave off the most heat (39 degrees C), whereas units composed of complete tree canopy cover, ormixed (i.e. tree and grass) vegetation maintained temperatures of between 29 and 32 degrees C. Land surface temperatureswere negatively correlated to tree canopy cover (R-2= 0.45) and vegetation greenness (R-2= 0.41). In a scenario inwhich each city tree was replaced by the most common non-tree cover in its neighbourhood, the area of Oslo exceeding a 30 degrees C health risk threshold during the summerwould increase from 23 to 29%. Combining modelling results with population at risk at census tract level, we estimated that each tree in the city currently mitigates additional heat exposure of one heatsensitive person by one day. Our results indicate that maintaining and restoring tree cover provides an ecosystem service of urban heat reduction. Our findings have particular relevance for health benefit estimation in urban ecosystem accounting and municipal policy decisions regarding ecosystem-based climate adaptation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

They are exposed to weathering stresses. The stress levels depend on the local climates. Monitoring of climatic properties and sample properties in different climatic zones (alpine, arid, maritime, moderate, and tropical) during several years provided the base for categorization of these climates. The local climate does not differ very much from year to year in terms of frequency distributions, but big differences are found for different regions or climatic zones. Especially, the solar irradiation is very location-dependent. The alpine location shows the highest UV irradiation. The UV fraction of the solar irradiation is varying between 2.2% (tropics) and 4.7% (alps). The temperature histograms can be modeled by Gaussian distribution functions. The maritime histogram is very slim and high, showing the cooling by the sea and the wind. Several approaches for a categorization of these local climates can be applied: Mean temperatures, effective temperatures, or the corresponding constant testing time for fictive degradation processes with arbitrary activation energy. The categorization of the relative humidity revealed humid climates in the alpine and the tropical test site, when considering the time of wetness (rh>80%). Obviously, the humidity stress or the corrosivity would be very different at those sites. Therefore, a more holistic approach considering more stress factors simultaneously would be more appropriate for the categorization. The interaction between the samples and the climate creates the so-called micro-climate which is the real stress on the samples, such as surface temperature, daily temperature cycles, surface humidity, or temperature-enhanced photo-degradation. The conditions for accelerated life testing (ALT) modeled on the base of monitored climatic data and sample temperatures are different for the different locations. They offer another possibility for categorization of the climatic stresses and the option for designing climate-adapted components.","[Koehl, Michael; Heck, Markus; Wiesmeier, Stefan] Fraunhofer ISE, Heidenhofstr 2, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany",,"Koehl, M (corresponding author), Fraunhofer ISE, Heidenhofstr 2, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany.",michael.koehl@ise.fraunhofer.de,,,"German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety [BMU FKz 0329978]; Bosch; Schott Solar; Solarfabrik; Solarwatt; Solar World; Solon","German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety; Bosch; Schott Solar; Solarfabrik; Solarwatt; Solar World; Solon","The work was partly funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU FKz 0329978) and sponsored by the industrial partners Bosch, Schott Solar, Solarfabrik, Solarwatt, Solar World, and Solon.",,18,10,10,2,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2050-0505,,,ENERGY SCI ENG,Energy Sci.

However, the bulk of this research has been conducted in Europe and North America and little is known about public perceptions of climate change in developing countries. This article presents the results of the first nationally representative study (n = 1473) of public perceptions of climate change in Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, a large proportion of interviewees (i.e. over 85%) are highly concerned about climate change in general and feel, as noted in European and North American studies, that its impacts are more worrisome for people farthest away (e.g. in the developed countries or among future generations). At the local level, people feel that food (10.5%) and water (16.1%) shortages as well as poverty (11.3%) and heat waves (11.7%) are the most expected impacts of climate change. Analysis of adaptation behaviour responses suggest that individuals have a relatively lower grasp of emergency and prevention disaster plans but are relatively more proactive in preventing hydro-meteorological extremes related to water scarcity or excess. A majority of respondents engage in mitigation behaviours largely for financial or contextual reasons. Finally, support for adaptation and mitigation policy responses is generally high (i.e. above 70% of interviewee supports them) except for the case of internalizing the cost of watershed protection increasing the water tariffs (52.5%). As discussions about mitigation and adaptation become increasingly common within developing countries, questions about public perceptions in that context are more pressing than ever. Work on climate perceptions needs to be carried out in specific countries to better understand which policies are most likely to resonate with public support, and which might be most difficult to implement.","[Vignola, R.; McDaniels, T.] CATIE, Climate Change Ecosyst Serv & Land Use Policy Res, Climate Change Program, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica; [Vignola, R.; Klinsky, S.; Tam, J.; McDaniels, T.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [McDaniels, T.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Community & Reg Planning, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Klinsky, S.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Ctr Climate Change Mitigat Res, Cambridge, England",CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of Cambridge,"Vignola, R (corresponding author), CATIE, Climate Change Ecosyst Serv & Land Use Policy Res, Climate Change Program, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica.",rvignola@catie.ac.cr,,"vignola, raffaele/0000-0003-3483-5076; Klinsky, Sonja/0000-0002-9450-1249","Government of Costa Rica; Country office of the United Nations Development Program; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Climate and Energy Decision-Making Center (CEDM); National Science Foundation [SES-0949710]; Carnegie Mellon University; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0949710] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Government of Costa Rica; Country office of the United Nations Development Program; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Climate and Energy Decision-Making Center (CEDM); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Carnegie Mellon University; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The authors wish to thank the Initiative Peace with Nature of the Government of Costa Rica for supporting this research and the Country office of the United Nations Development Program.

To improve the understanding of how climate vulnerability is expressed in agricultural environments, it is necessary to address how people perceive and interact with their surroundings. This study analyzes farmers' perceptions of a set of climate change indicators and their influence on agricultural practices in two Indigenous communities located at different altitudes in Mexico. Farmers' observations were explored using semi-structured interviews and contextualized within the local instrumental climate record. The influence of these farmers' perceptions on their agricultural practices was further analyzed using a logistic regression model. Changes in rain intensity and seasonality, as well as in wind intensity, were mentioned most frequently. Farmers' experiences suggest a reduction in rain and wind intensity and shorter rainy seasons. Memories of past anomalous years coincide with precipitation anomalies found in the instrumental records. However, temperature changes and biotic indicators were seldom perceived. Our results show that the perception of these indicators is mediated by agricultural practices, and we found evidence indicating that these perceptions during the first stage of the seasonal calendar induce readjustments in sowing dates. Moreover, farmers resort to out-migration, integration of cash crops, and use of commercial fertilizers to cope with or reduce crop loss due to climate impacts.","[Martinez-Herrera, Gonzalo; Fernanda de Alba-Navarro, Maria; Martinez-Balleste, Andrea] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Jardin Bot, Inst Biol, Circuito Exterior S-N,Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Trejo, Irma] UNAM, Inst Geog, Copilco, Mexico; [Moreno-Calles, Ana, I] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Escuela Nacl Estudios Super, Unidad Morelia ENES, UNAM, Campus Morelia, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico; [Martinez-Herrera, Gonzalo] CUNY, Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY 10021 USA",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Martinez-Balleste, A (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Jardin Bot, Inst Biol, Circuito Exterior S-N,Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",andrea.martinez@ib.unam.mx,,"Trejo, Irma/0000-0002-3199-6328; Martinez-Herrera, Gonzalo/0000-0001-5469-7710",CONACYT [464071]; Red Tematica Productos Forestales No Maderables,CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Red Tematica Productos Forestales No Maderables,We are thankful to the people of San Gabriel Vista Hermosa and San Marcos Tlaltlalkilotl for sharing their time and memories with us.

Recent studies explore the potential economic and environmental impacts of this growth, but relatively little attention has been paid to the implications for inequality. In this paper we use household-level microdata from 16 countries to characterize empirically the relationship between climate, income, and residential air conditioning. We show that both current and future air conditioner usage is concentrated among high-income households. Not only do richer countries have much more air conditioning than poorer countries, but within countries adoption is highly concentrated among high-income households. The pattern of adoption is particularly stark in relatively low-income countries such as Pakistan, where we show that the vast majority of adoption between now and 2050 will be concentrated among the upper income tercile. We use our model to forecast future adoption, show how patterns vary across countries and income levels, and discuss what these patterns mean for health, productivity, and educational inequality.","[Davis, Lucas; Gertler, Paul; Wolfram, Catherine] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Davis, Lucas; Gertler, Paul; Wolfram, Catherine] NBER, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jarvis, Stephen] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Mannheim,"Davis, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Davis, L (corresponding author), NBER, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",lwdavis@berkeley.edu; gertler@haas.berkeley.edu; jarvis@uni-mannheim.de; cwolfram@berkeley.edu,,,Oxford Policy Management's Energy and Economic Growth Applied Research Programme; International Growth Centre,Oxford Policy Management's Energy and Economic Growth Applied Research Programme; International Growth Centre,The authors gratefully acknowledge research funding from Oxford Policy Management's Energy and Economic Growth Applied Research Programme and the International Growth Centre.,,18,16,16,8,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

Agricultural practices based on good management of ecosystems are promoted as a good adaptation strategy for the productive activities of coffee smallholder farmers in the Central American region. The dissemination of information on innovations, techniques, instruments, etc. between organizations and producers is key to expand and consolidate the use of these practices. Objective The objective of this study was to identify the structure of information-dissemination governance that can help expand and consolidate the use of Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EM) practices in agriculture. Materials and methods. Three productive landscapes distributed in three countries (Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica) were analysed, characterized by predominantly small-scale coffee growing farmers. For each of these landscapes, the actors that exchange information between the national scale and the level of the producers were identified. Interviews were conducted to characterize the information flows and their possible relevance to promote EbA in the productive systems of coffee producers. Results. It was identified both key actors and gaps in the network of organizations that inhibit the transmission of information between scales and sectors. In Costa Rica, the capacity for intermediation of information across sectors and scales is spread between State entities and competitive producer organizations. In Honduras, intermediation capacities are distributed among some civil society organizations that work at local levels closely with producers and governmental organizations that work at the national level. In Guatemala, the intermediation capacities are mainly distributed among governmental, civil society and private organizations, mainly at the national level. Conclusion.The analysis of networks in these coffee landscapes suggests that although all three countries have a similar institutionalization of the coffee sector, in two the dissemination of information to promote EbA would benefit at intermediate and local scales to promote learning among producers.","[Vignola, Raffaele] Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vignola, Raffaele; Otarola, Marco; Alpizar, Francisco; Rivera, Pavel] CATIE, Apdo 717, Turrialba, Costa Rica",Wageningen University & Research; CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza,"Vignola, R (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",rvignola@catie.ac.cr; motarola@catie.ac.cr; falpizar@catie.ac.cr; pavelrivargas@yahoo.com,,"Alpizar, Francisco/0000-0001-8479-081X; vignola, raffaele/0000-0003-3483-5076",,,,,27,0,0,0,18,UNIV COSTA RICA,SAN JOSE,"CENTRO INVESTIGACIONES AGRONOMICAS, APDO POSTAL 183-4050, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA",,2215-3608,,AGRON MESOAM,Agron.

Over the longer term (decades to centuries), many coastal communities will have to retreat inland away from the coast and toward something new. To date, there appears to be little consideration of how arts and humanities could be leveraged to encourage learning and experimentation to help communities adapt to our changing climate. In this article, we describe an interactive theater model that seeks to address the challenge of bridging scientific knowledge and community conversations on managed retreat and serve as an innovative tool to encourage more productive community conversations about adapting to rising sea levels. The interactive theater workshop consists of two components. The first is a set of short intertwining monologues by three characters (a municipal leader, a climate scientist, and a coastal property owner) who share their thoughts regarding the prospect of managed retreat. Each character provides a glimpse into the attitudes, values, motivations, and fears related to distinct and authentic perspectives on managed retreat. The monologues are followed by a professionally facilitated interactive session during which audienceparticipants are invited to probe characters' perspectives and even redirect and replay scenes in new ways to seek more constructive outcomes. The workshop is designed for all session participants to examine their own strengths and weaknesses when engaging others on this subject, to be more prepared to accommodate a range of emotional connections to the subject matter, and to anticipate social dynamics at play. The workshop has now been piloted at four different events. Initial feedback from post-workshop voluntary surveys suggest that the workshop is useful for improving the capacity of resilience professionals to encourage more productive conversations about difficult climate adaptation actions.","[Wake, Cameron] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Wake, Cameron] Univ New Hampshire, Sustainabil Inst, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Kaye, David] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Theatre & Dance, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Kaye, David; Lewis, C.

In order to obtain food, water, raw materials and shelter, rural people modify forests and other ecosystems, affecting the supply of ecosystem services that contribute to livelihoods and well-being. Despite widespread awareness of the nature and extent of multiple impacts of land-use changes, there remains limited understanding of how these impacts affect trade-offs among ecosystem services and their beneficiaries across spatial scales. We assessed how rural communities in two forested landscapes in Indonesia have changed land uses over the last 20 years to adapt their livelihoods that were at risk from multiple hazards. We estimated the impact of these adaptation strategies on the supply of ecosystem services by comparing different benefits provided to people from these land uses (products, water, carbon, and biodiversity), using forest inventories, remote sensing, and interviews. Local people converted forests to rubber plantations, reforested less productive croplands, protected forests on hillsides, and planted trees in gardens. Our results show that land-use decisions were propagated at the landscape scale due to reinforcing loops, whereby local actors perceived that such decisions contributed positively to livelihoods by reducing risks and generating co-benefits. When land-use changes become sufficiently widespread, they affect the supply of multiple ecosystem services, with impacts beyond the local scale. Thus, adaptation implemented at the local-scale may not address development and climate adaptation challenges at regional or national scale (e.g. as part of UN Sustainable Development Goals or actions taken under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement).

After the Federal Circuit held in St. Bernard Parish Government v. United States that the Army Corps of Engineers' construction and maintenance did not constitute a taking, hurricane victims' efforts to recover in the courts hit a dead end. Using Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath as a lens to examine mechanisms to compensate victims and deter future losses, this Note ultimately concludes that the existing methods of recovery after natural disasters, primarily tort and the National Flood Insurance Program, fall short. As climate change increases the threat of catastrophic flooding caused by hurricanes and rising seas, a new mechanism to compensate victims and deter future flood losses is needed. This Note uses takings, a theory rejected by the Federal Circuit in St. Bernard Parish, as a potential mechanism to facilitate retreat from vulnerable areas by buying back flood-prone properties. However, any federal buyback program must grapple with the problematic history of using eminent domain to forcibly displace poor and minority communities. This Note proposes a program to incorporate community input at an early stage in order to keep valuable community ties intact.","[Sinclair, Katie] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Sinclair, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,135,3,3,3,10,UNIV CALIFORNIA  BERKELEY SCH LAW,BERKELEY,"BOAT HALL, 588 SIMON HALL, BERKELEY, CA 94720-7200 USA",0046-1121,,,ECOL LAW QUART,Ecol.

In architecture, using natural energy is one of the essential pillars of design because it was one of the criteria of designing, which was considered on climate and geography, and it has been a high performance of climate adaptation in the modeling of traditional houses. In this research, Azerbaijan (located in northwestern Iran) is selected to evaluate the practical features of traditional Iranian houses designed in the cold climate, and criteria for developing sensible solutions to achieve a suitable design model for energy saving are provided. The primary purpose of this paper is to evaluate and identify the features of climate design in traditional houses in a cold climate, which are suitable residential buildings for energy management, and to identify the components affecting energy saving. The data collection method is based on checklists, observation, considering the orientation, density, solar radiation angle in the region, documentary, analysis of maps, and adaptation of the architectural plan of the studied houses with the pattern of solar radiation in the area. This research discusses the design criteria for future structures and their adaptable measures based on the obtained results. Finally, it is declared that the traditional architectural design model follows the region's climatic conditions, and considering the current climate and energies, traditional houses were designed; therefore, the best model for maximum use of available energy is climatic design. As a result, suggestions are made regarding residential architecture design to save energy.","[Sharif, Amirmasood Nakhaee] Islamic Azad Univ Mashhad, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Saleh, Sanaz Keshavarz] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Architecture, Zanjan Branch, Zanjan, Iran; [Afzal, Sadegh] Univ Mohaghegh Ardabili, Dept Mech Engn, Ardebil, Iran; [Razavi, Niloofar Shoja] Imam Khomeini Int Univ IKIU, Dept Architecture & Urbanism, MA Grad Urban Dev, Qazvin, Iran; [Nasab, Mozhdeh Fadaei] Fac Payame Noor Univ Sirjan, Kerman, Iran; [Kadaei, Samireh] Bushehr Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Bushehr, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University; University of Mohaghegh Ardabili; Imam Khomeini International University; Persian Gulf University,"Kadaei, S (corresponding author), Bushehr Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Bushehr, Iran.",samira.kadaei@gmail.com,,,,,,,57,0,0,1,1,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,SEP 5,2022,2022,,,,,,,,3522883,10.1155/2022/3522883,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/3522883,,,12,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,5P1IN,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000872913200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Traditional adaptation assessments are aimed at evaluating adaptation to cost-effectively reduce risk and do not capture the far-reaching benefits of adaptation in the context of devel-opment and the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By grounding adaptation planning in an SDG vision, we propose and demonstrate a methodological process that for the first time allows national decision -makers to: i) quantify the adaptation that is needed to safeguard SDG target progress, and ii) evaluate strate-gies of stakeholder-driven adaptation options to meet those needs whilst delivering additional SDG target co -benefits. This methodological process is spatially applied to a national adaptation assessment in Ghana. In the face of the country's risk from floods and landslides, this analysis identifies which energy and transport assets to prioritise in order to make the greatest contribution to safeguarding development progress. Three strategies ('built', 'nature-based', 'combined SDG strategy') were formulated through a multi-stakeholder partnership involving government, the private sector, and academia as a means to protect Ghana's prioritised assets against climate risk. Evaluating these adaptation strategies in terms of their ability to deliver on SDG targets, we find that the combined SDG strategy maximises SDG co-benefits across 116 targets. The proposed methodological process for integrating SDG targets in adaptation assessments is transferable to other climate-vulnerable nations, and can provide decision-makers with spatially-explicit evidence for implementing sustainable adaptation in alignment with the global agendas.","[Fuldauer, Lena I.; Adshead, Daniel; Thacker, Scott; Gall, Sarah; Hall, Jim W.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Adshead, Daniel] KTH Royal Inst Technol, KTH Climate Act Ctr & KTH Div Energy Syst, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Oxford; Royal Institute of Technology,"Fuldauer, LI (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",lenafuldauer@gmail.com,,"Adshead, Daniel/0000-0002-0829-925X","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/R513295/1, EP/N509711/1, EP/N017064/1]; United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS); Ministry for the Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI); Global Centre for Adaptation","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS); Ministry for the Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI); Global Centre for Adaptation","The transferable python code to conduct the analysis can be requested from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

In semi-arid Kenya, persistent drought has made male incomes from pastoralism insecure, and contributed to women's growing engagement with trade, farming and other independent enterprises, for survival. This has, however, raised questions about women's dependence on men for household provisioning, and enhanced expectations of reciprocity in both production and reproduction within households. While demographers note the rise in female headship in sub-Saharan Africa, and female headed households are often the target of policy attention, the situation on the ground is much more complex. Polygamy, separation and consensual unions, multi-generational and multi-locational households, point to a growing diversity in gender and generational relationships, in rights, responsibilities and norms. Based on data from household surveys, focus group discussions and life history interviews with differently positioned women and men within pastoralist communities in northern Kenya, the paper explores the implications of changing household structures beyond headship, in particular the loosening of marriage ties, frequent separation and regrouping, on relational vulnerability and the micro-politics of adaptation in the region.","[Rao, Nitya] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Rao, N (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",n.rao@uea.ac.uk,,,"Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada","Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada(CGIAR)","This work was carried out under the Adaptation at Scale in Semi - Arid Regions project (ASSAR).

These models take climate and geographic variables as input and are therefore helpful for long-term decision support and climate adaptation planning. Generally, local processes of tree germination and seedling survival are resolved probabilistically with explanatory variables such as elevation, latitude, exposure, soil type, moisture availability, climate and weather inputs and 'trained' using landscape and regional presence-absence data and machine learning techniques. How seeds are distributed in these models, that is, determining the dispersal kernel, is far more problematic. The challenge is that variables conditioning vertebrate seed dispersal (motility and probability of utilization or caching in response to cover type) are not represented in large scale distribution models, and in fact vary on scales (10-100 meters) that are much smaller than the smallest pixel size for the distribution model (1-10 kilometers). We present a homogenized seed digestion kernel (HSDK) which incorporates this scale separation. Homogenization naturally links highly variable small-scale processes (like seed foraging and caching by birds and rodents) with large scale effects (like dispersal of seeds over tens of kilometers). We develop a homogenization strategy to predict seed dispersal on landscape scales, analytically linking small-scale variables (landscape fraction cover by tree type, gut residence times and cover type utilization by frugivorous birds) with large scale behaviors. Closed form approximations are developed in two dimensions for two limiting cases of seed handling behavior, and the approach is illustrated using landscape data and pinon-pine dispersal in a 630,000 square kilometer region in the southwestern US.

Large changes in the land surface thermal regime can disturb the hydro-ecological integrity of these landscapes. Thus, it is important to assess landscape change and ecological risk to promote arid landscape sustainability. Objectives This study predicted the landscape change and quantified the Bayanbulak ecological risk evolution through a susceptibility-hazard assessment system. Methods CA-Markov model was used to simulate the landscape change, while ERA model that builds the susceptibility-hazard indices rapport was applied to evaluate the Bayanbulak wetland ecological risk using 30 m remotely sensed data. Results Findings unveiled that modifications in water, meadow, and marshes are predicted to decline at a rate of 39.3, 6.32, 23.98% in 2069 respectively. As wetland hazard, the LST average increased from 20 to 22 degrees C with a maximum value of 35.2 degrees C from 1994 to 2019. Likewise, wetland susceptibility mean value increased from 1.10 to 1.20, a growth rate of 9.09%. Though the decline in high-risk zones, moderate risk zones drastically augmented at the extent of 70.5% while low risk and no risk zones declined with a reduction rate of 18.9 and 95.8% respectively. Overall observations exhibited that Bayanbulak ecological risk is slightly evolving. Conclusion Bayanbulak is a pool of ecosystem services. By highlighting its ecological risk evolution, we call upon the focus on factors driving LST increment and adopt climatic adaptation measures of aqua-terrestrial ecosystems for Bayanbulak management.","[Kayumba, Patient Mindje; Chen, Yaning; Mind'je, Richard; Li, Xiaoyang; Maniraho, Albert Poponi; Umugwaneza, Adeline; Uwamahoro, Solange] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, 818 South Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Kayumba, Patient Mindje; Chen, Yaning; Mind'je, Richard; Li, Xiaoyang; Maniraho, Albert Poponi; Umugwaneza, Adeline; Uwamahoro, Solange] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Umugwaneza, Adeline] Univ Lay Adventists Kigali UNILAK, Fac Environm Sci, Kigali 6392, Rwanda; [Mindje, Mapendo] Univ Rwanda, Coll Agr Anim Sci & Vet Med, Ctr Excellence Biodivers & Nat Resources Manageme, Huye 117, Rwanda","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Rwanda","Chen, YN (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, 818 South Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",chenyn@ms.xjb.ac.cn,"Mind'je, Richard/GNP-0081-2022","MIND'JE, RICHARD/0000-0003-4447-389X; Mindje, Mapendo/0000-0003-3591-9319","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1903208, 41630859]; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)","The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1903208, 41630859).

The objectives of this study were i) to assess the impact of extended drought followed by heavy precipitation events on yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) under historical and future climate, and ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies (no-tillage and new cultivars) in mitigating impacts of increased frequencies of extreme events and warming. We used the validated SALUS crop model to simulate long-term maize and wheat yield and SOC changes of maize-soybean-wheat rotation cropping systems in the northern Midwest USA under conventional tillage and no-till for three climate change scenarios (one historical and two projected climates under the Representative Concentration Path (RCP) 4.5 and RCP6) and two precipitation changes (extreme precipitation occurring early or late season). Extended drought events caused additional yield reduction when they occurred later in the season (10-22% for maize and 5-13% for wheat) rather than in early season (5-17% for maize and 2-18% for wheat). We found maize grain yield declined under the projected climates, whereas wheat grain yield increased. No-tillage is able to reduce yield loss compared to conventional tillage and increased SOC levels (1.4-2.0 t/ha under the three climates), but could not reverse the adverse impact of climate change, unless early and new improved maize cultivars are introduced to increase yield and SOC under climate change.

Therefore, understanding the nature and sustainability of locally adopted coping and adaptation strategies are key, yet still under-researched areas. Design/methodology/approach - Based on ethnographic research conducted in two poor, flood-prone municipalities in Pikine/Dakar, this paper identifies such coping and adaptation strategies and examines their prospects for maladaptation. Findings - The paper shows that poor urban dwellers are not mere passive spectators of climate change. With the very limited resources they have at their disposal, it is found that local actors respond to perennial flooding with very diverse strategies, which have varying degrees of success and sustainability. A key finding is that local coping and adaptation strategies are mainly maladaptive because they divert risks and impacts in time and space and have detrimental effects on the most vulnerable. Unless there is a broad assimilation of all groups in decision-making processes locally, individual and even collective coping and adaptation strategies may easily put the most vulnerable households at greater risk. The findings reveal that community-based adaptation is not a panacea per se, as it may not, by itself, compensate for the lack of basic services and infrastructure that is forcing the urban poor to cope with disproportionate levels of risk. Originality/value - The paper, hence, contributes to address a central question in scholarly debates on climate adaptation, vulnerability and disaster risk management: Are local coping strategies a stepping stone towards adaptation or are they on the contrary likely to lead to maladaptation?","[Schaer, Caroline] UNEP DTU Partnership UDP, Copenhagen, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Schaer, C (corresponding author), UNEP DTU Partnership UDP, Copenhagen, Denmark.",cesc@dtu.dk,,,Otto Monsted Fond; Augustinus Fonden; Julie Von Mullens Fond,Otto Monsted Fond; Augustinus Fonden; Julie Von Mullens Fond,"Support for the research was partly provided by grants from Otto Monsted Fond, Augustinus Fonden and Julie Von Mullens Fond.",,56,26,27,2,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

During a period of extremely difficult economic and environmental conditions rural households relied heavily on social networks, and the capital generated within them, to identify and select potential migration destinations, and to integrate into a destination region very different in agro-ecological terms than the source areas. By combining archival and secondary data and findings from in-depth interviews with migration participants, an enhanced understanding was obtained of the relationship between social capital, migration, and adaptation processes during Depression-era droughts. This case study, and the insights derived from it, is a useful historical analogue from which to improve our understanding of future adaptation and migration responses to anthropogenic climate change under similar socio-economic and geographical conditions.","[Laforge, Julia M.

The distribution and availability of coastal fishery resources, which determine the livelihood of the traditional fisher-folks, are being influenced by factors such as sea surface temperature, salinity, wind patterns, tide levels, coastal erosion, etc. Climate induced variations influence distribution of fish and catch per unit effort, which necessitate modification in fishing strategies and adaptation practices. The goal of the current study was to rank the weather-related parameters influencing the occupational shifts of traditional fishermen in the coastal state of Kerala's three fishing villages of Thrikkunnapuzha, Chellanam, and Elamkunnapuzha in terms of fishermen's perspective. Additionally, the study tries to evaluate the various occupational transitions. The methodology involved extensive field visits and interactions with fishers, fishermen groups, local organizations, self-help groups and non-government organizations. Rising sea surface temperature, among other weather-related characteristics, was the main contributor to the change in occupation, according to fishermen. Additionally, it was noted that 41 % of respondents said that fisherfolks of study area opted for alternative jobs and changed their operational area to combat the climate change risks. To develop effective adaptation measures, the complex interaction of social, economic, and environmental systems must be studied, and community-oriented adaptation strategies should be developed along the coast. For the mitigation of climate-related uncertainties, the local community and public institutions should implement reactive or anticipatory action plans.","[Alex, Anju; Ancy, V.

The objective of the article is to evaluate resilient design characteristics responding to the need for thermal comfort in social housing with regard to the effect of climate change. This was carried out through a theoretical and an empirical stage in two South American cities with opposite characteristics: Passo Fundo in Brazil and Tunja in Colombia. As a result, it was found that CEB is a viable option only in climates with specific conditions given its thermal and environmental properties, according to direct heat gain strategies that tend to be resilient and fit a bioclimatic urban design better. Considering the above, it was concluded that the envelope plays a key role in resilient design in terms of thermal comfort.","[Nieto, V.; Cubillos, R.; Barrios, R.] Univ Catolica Colombia, Bogota, DC, Colombia",,"Nieto, V (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Colombia, Bogota, DC, Colombia.",vnieto37@ucatolica.edu.co,,"Cubillos Gonzalez, Rolando Arturo/0000-0002-9019-961X; Nieto-Barbosa, Valentina/0000-0003-0067-3769",Catholic University of Colombia,Catholic University of Colombia,"This work was possible thanks to the financial support of the Catholic University of Colombia and its Young Researchers program.

Accordingly, the present study aimed to provide a framework/assessment tool to measure Tehran's resilience to flood risks. To this end, 21 professionals from different disciplines were selected through a purposive sampling procedure and were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. The analysis procedure resulted in the identification of 3 themes, 15 categories, 40 subcategories, and 235 codes. The themes were social, economic, and organizational; The identified categories were culture and education (since culture is something to be learned through formal and informal education this component has two features: culture and education), participation, trust, attitude, solidarity, resources, empowerment, flexibility, credit, supervision, intercommunication, rules, specialization, and research. Validation of the indicators and their usability based on the opinions of local experts was used to calibrate the assessment tool and ensure its context-sensitivity. The results of this research can help planners and policymakers to increase their awareness of flood resilience. The approach taken in this research may also be useful for developing flood resilience assessment tools in other Iranian cities as well as in other cities of the Global South with similar conditions.","[Ghasemzadeh, Behnam; Zarabadi, Zahra Sadat Saeideh; Majedi, Hamid] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Art & Architecture, Tehran 1477893856, Iran; [Behzadfar, Mostafa] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Environm Design, Tehran 1311416846, Iran; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci & Network Educ &, Hiroshima 7398511, Japan",Islamic Azad University; Iran University Science & Technology; Hiroshima University,"Zarabadi, ZSS (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Art & Architecture, Tehran 1477893856, Iran.",behnam.ghasemzadeh@yahoo.com; z.zarabadi@srbiau.ac.ir; majedi_h@yahoo.com; behzadfar@iust.ac.ir; sharifi@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"behzadfar, mostafa/S-6055-2018; Sharifi, Ayyoob/M-7584-2013","Sharifi, Ayyoob/0000-0002-8983-8613; Behzadfar, Mostafa/0000-0003-2882-694X",,,,,164,3,3,9,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,14,,,,,,,7852,10.3390/su13147852,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13147852,,,27,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TO6RR,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000677036600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

They are acclaimed as promising instruments for coping with climate risk. However, research on their impacts has mainly focused on economic considerations. Studies on broader social and ecological consequences are sparse and have produced ambiguous and inconclusive results. We address this knowledge deficit by (a) advocating for a holistic view of social-ecological systems and vulnerability when considering insurance impacts; (b) offering a systematic overview highlighting the potential beneficial and adverse effects of 'climate insurance' in agriculture, particularly where programs target intensifying agricultural production; and (c) suggesting preliminary principles for avoiding maladaptive outcomes, including specific recommendations for designing appropriate impact studies and insurance programs. Our synopsis brings together scientific knowledge generated in both developing and developed countries, demonstrating that agricultural insurance programs shape land-use decisions and may generate serious economic, social, and ecological consequences. If insurance is to be an appropriate tool for mitigating the impacts of climate change, it needs to be carefully developed with specific local social-ecological contexts and existing risk coping strategies in mind. Otherwise, it is liable to create long-term maladaptive outcomes and undermine the ability of these systems to reduce vulnerability.","[Mueller, Birgit; Kreuer, David] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Jr Res Grp POLISES, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Johnson, Leigh] Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Oregon,"Muller, B (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Jr Res Grp POLISES, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",birgit.mueller@ufz.de,"Kreuer, David/E-6184-2016","Kreuer, David/0000-0002-9941-8970; Muller, Birgit/0000-0001-8780-4420",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the Junior Research Group POLISES [BMBF-01LN1315A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the Junior Research Group POLISES,"We would like to thank Robert Finger, Volker Grimm, Thomas Hahn, Niklas Hase, Felix John, Christian Kuhlicke, Roland Steinmann, Russell Toth, and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Despite the high vulnerability of African countries to climate change, less work has examined climate change governance within African cities. This paper investigates the constraints and enablers to climate governance in two cities located in least-developed African economies (Karonga, Malawi, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania). It does so by analysing the personal engagement of key urban decision-makers with climate change issues, along cognitive, affective and behavioural dimensions. Semi-structured interviews with a range of local government actors suggest that African cities in low-income economies are aware, concerned and motivated to act on climate change issues. The ability for large African cities to act seems to be reliant in large part on connections to international networks that provide various resources; smaller cities seem to collaborate more effectively at the 'within the city' scale to overcome constraints to climate change governance. The findings point to the potential for positive urban governance of climate change in developing country cities, including small cities, and pave the way for further emphasis to be placed on using the concept of engagement to deepen understanding of urban climate change governance.","[Pasquini, Lorena] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Pasquini, Lorena] Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Pasquini, L (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.;Pasquini, L (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",lorena.pasquini@gmail.com,,,Urban Africa: Risk Knowledge (Urban ARK) programme - UK Economic and Social Research Council; Department for International Development [ES/L008777/1],Urban Africa: Risk Knowledge (Urban ARK) programme - UK Economic and Social Research Council; Department for International Development,"This work is based upon research supported by the Urban Africa: Risk Knowledge (Urban ARK) programme, funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council and Department for International Development [grant number ES/L008777/1].",,82,13,14,5,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Interest in how football relates to climate change, and the climate policy required for football, is growing. Clubs, players and fans increasingly call for action to reduce football's impact on the climate, and for plans to adapt to climate impacts on football. However, well-intentioned actions must be underpinned by robust evidence. This synthesis reviews research at the interface of football and climate change. After summarizing the main climate actions identified for fans, players, clubs and organizing bodies, the review looks in-depth at four areas: impacts of football on climate; impacts of climate on football; football as a driver for pro-climate actions; and the relationship between football and carbon-intensive industries. The review then outlines research gaps for an evidence-driven response to climate change in football: adaptation across different geographical contexts; understanding what climate change means for community-level football; understanding how carbon-intensive industries relate to sense of place identity in football under a just transition; developing principles for phasing-out fossil fuel financing; and considering how climate change relates to women's football.Key policy insightsFootball is a forum for galvanizing societal action in support of climate policy. However, football also contributes to, and is impacted by, climate change, and hence requires policy support under a changing climate;Reducing transportation emissions, especially flying, is a key climate policy requirement for football. Institutional policy, with government support, may enable more efficient scheduling and use of surface transport;Institutional policies, and public health policies, should develop standards and guidelines for football under extreme heat. Football also ought to be integrated within local, regional and national climate adaptation policy to ensure climate resilience;Clubs and players can lead by example on climate-positive actions, and energize wider action through fan bases. Alignment of initiatives with national or international climate policy may raise public awareness of climate polices and targets;Institutional policies for clubs, tournaments and associations should regulate fossil fuel financing. Football also offers an avenue to understand relations between local identity and carbon-intensive industries, and thus to identify socio-cultural factors for regional just transition policies.","[Mabon, Leslie] Open Univ, Sch Engn & Innovat, Venables Bldg, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",Open University - UK,"Mabon, L (corresponding author), Open Univ, Sch Engn & Innovat, Venables Bldg, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",leslie.mabon@open.ac.uk,,"Mabon, Leslie/0000-0003-2646-6119",,,,,71,0,0,12,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Reliance on seawalls and other types of hardened shorelines is unsustainable in an era of rising seas, given the costs to build and maintain these structures and their unintended consequences on ecosystems. This is especially true for communities that depend on coastal and marine ecosystems for livelihoods and sustenance. Protecting and restoring coral reefs and coastal forests can be lower cost, sustainable alternatives for shoreline protection. However, decision-makers often lack basic information about where and under what conditions ecosystems reduce risk to coastal hazards and who would benefit. To better understand where to prioritize ecosystems for coastal protection, we assessed risk reduction provided by coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass along the entire coast of The Bahamas, under current and future climate scenarios. Modeled results show that the population most exposed to coastal hazards would more than double with future sea-level rise and more than triple if ecosystems were lost or degraded. We also found that ecosystem-based risk reduction differs across islands due to variation in a suite of ecological, physical, and social variables. On some populated islands, like Grand Bahama and Abaco, habitats provide protection to disproportionately large numbers of people compared to the rest of the country. Risk reduction provided by ecosystems is also evident for several sparsely populated, remote coastal communities, which in some cases, have large elderly populations. The results from our analyses were critical for engaging policy-makers in discussions about employing natural and nature-based features for coastal resilience. After hurricanes Joaquin and Matthew hit The Bahamas in 2016 and 2017, our assessment of coastal risk reduction and the multiple benefits provided by coastal ecosystems helped pave the way for an innovative loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to the Government of The Bahamas to invest in mangrove restoration for coastal resilience. This work serves as an example for other regions and investors aiming to use assessments of ecosystem services to inform financing of natural and nature-based approaches for coastal resilience and climate adaptation.","[Silver, Jessica M.; Arkema, Katie K.; Griffin, Robert M.; Maldonado, Sergio; Ruckelshaus, Mary; Wyatt, Katherine; Verutes, Gregory] Stanford Univ, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Nat Capital Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Silver, Jessica M.; Arkema, Katie K.; Ruckelshaus, Mary; Wyatt, Katherine] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lashley, Brett] Off Prime Minister Bahamas, Nassau, Bahamas; [Lemay, Michele] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Moultrie, Stacey H.] SEV Consulting Grp, Nassau, Bahamas; [Schill, Steven] Nature Conservancy, Caribbean Program, Nassau, Bahamas; [Thomas, Adelle] Univ Bahamas, Dept Environm & Life Sci, Nassau, Bahamas; [Verutes, Gregory] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Polit & Social Sci, Dept Appl Econ, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Griffin, Robert M.] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, New Bedford, MA USA; [Lashley, Brett] Kings Coll London, Kings Business Sch, London, England; [Maldonado, Sergio] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Southampton, Hants, England",Stanford University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Inter-American Development Bank; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; University of Massachusetts System; University Massachusetts Dartmouth; University of London; King's College London; University of Southampton,"Silver, JM; Arkema, KK (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Nat Capital Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Silver, JM; Arkema, KK (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jess.silver@stanford.edu; karkema@stanford.edu,,"Schill, Steven R/0000-0002-9066-434X; Maldonado, Sergio/0000-0001-6072-122X; Verutes, Gregory/0000-0002-7667-7902; Griffin, Robert/0000-0002-6271-5613",Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Program at the Inter-American Development Bank [BH-T1040],Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Program at the Inter-American Development Bank,This work was funded by the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Program at the Inter-American Development Bank (BH-T1040).,,118,31,31,5,49,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

It was evident from the literature that ICTs continue to form an important part of agricultural operations, climate response and agribusiness in West Africa. TV, radio and mobile phones were the most frequently used ICT platforms for receiving agricultural and climate information. Mobile phones have an added use for sales and financial transactions. There were no distinct gender differences in the use of ICTs for agriculture and climate response. However, women's low income and limitations in controlling household financial responses were identified as significant barriers to ICT access. It was evident that ICTs may contribute to achieving gender outcomes in agriculture and climate response if an enabling environment is created for women to have access to the inputs and resources needed to implement agro-advisories. From the results obtained, there are clear indications that the gender perspectives of ICT use in agriculture and climate response has not received much research attention. The analyses identified important knowledge gaps on gender disaggregated information on the linkages among ICT use, agricultural productivity and climate adaptation indicators.","[Zougmore, Robert B.] Alliance Biovers Int, Accelerating Impacts CGIAR Climate Res Africa AIC, BP 24063, Dakar, Senegal; [Zougmore, Robert B.] CIAT, BP 24063, Dakar, Senegal; [Partey, Samuel T.] UNESCO Reg Off Eastern Africa, UN Ave,UNON Complex,POB 30592, Nairobi, Kenya",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Partey, ST (corresponding author), UNESCO Reg Off Eastern Africa, UN Ave,UNON Complex,POB 30592, Nairobi, Kenya.",s.partey@unesco.org,,,CGIAR Fund Donors; International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group to the Accelerating Impact of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project,CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR); International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group to the Accelerating Impact of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project,"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), a strategic partnership of CGIAR and Future Earth, led by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements (for details, please visit https://ccafs.cgiar.org/donors).It also benefited from funding support of the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group to the Accelerating Impact of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project.",,64,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2022,14,19,,,,,,,12240,10.3390/su141912240,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141912240,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5G7DM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000867155100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The United States is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, but also has one of the largest wealth gaps. Comparatively, India has one of the largest populations of food insecure people. To demonstrate how adaptive food security approaches to climate change will differ, we first review the unique climate, agricultural, demographic, and socio-economic features; and then compare challenges and solutions to food security posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. While both countries rely on rural, low-income farmworkers to produce food, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how agricultural and food security policies differ in their influence on both food insecurity and global hunger alike. Emphasis on agricultural production in developing regions where a majority of individuals living in rural areas are smallholder subsistence farmers will benefit the majority of the population in terms of both poverty alleviation and food production. In the Global North, an emphasis on food access and availability is necessary because rural food insecure populations are often disconnected from food production.","[Raj, Subhashni; Brinkley, Catherine] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Human Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Roodbar, Sam] Univ Calif Davis, Geog Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wolfe, David Walter] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Hort Sect, Ithaca, NY USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; Cornell University,"Raj, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Human Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",siraj@ucdavis.edu,"Raj, Subhashni/AAY-5652-2021",,,,,,144,4,4,1,15,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

In order to clarify the thermal mechanism differences between volcanic-rock dwellings and modern dwellings in Haikou, the main factors affecting the thermal comfort of dwellings are analyzed through investigations of indoor thermal environment in the Yangshan lava area of Haikou. The results show that the volcanic-rock dwelling can achieve 10 h (from 23:30 to 9:30 the next day) with air temperature under 28.7 degrees C in a comfortable thermal indoor environment without air-conditioning cooling equipment, while the rooms on the ground floor of modern dwelling can achieve 1 h around sunrise, and the room on the top floor is completely outside the thermal comfort zone. Temperature difference between exterior and interior of volcanic-rock wall and wooden window can reach a maximum of 6.7 degrees C and 2.8 degrees C respectively, which shows that the envelope of volcanic-rock dwelling has a good thermal insulation performance.

However, reviews of standard top-down and bottom-up approaches indicate that the value of multistakeholder involvement is not fully recognized or incorporated into guidelines. Focusing on provinces in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea within the Coral Triangle region, we present a novel integrated top-down and bottom-up planning approach. Based on Participatory Systemic Inquiry the process involves three stages of workshops intentionally designed to promote social learning, knowledge exchange, empowerment and social networks among multilevel stakeholders. Stage 1 workshops engage government, nongovernment and science stakeholders at the provincial level to analyze sub-districts' vulnerability and design appropriate adaptation strategies. Stage 2 engages local government, non-government and community stakeholders within vulnerable sub-districts identified in Stage 1. Stage 3 combines Stage 1 and 2 stakeholders to refine adaptation strategies and design action plans for sub-districts. Evaluation demonstrated that different stakeholder groups' perceptions of community adaptation needs varied significantly, justifying the approach. In terms of adaptive capacity, the primary outcome for all stakeholder groups was innovative ideas, suggesting that social learning and knowledge exchange had occurred. Empowerment was a secondary outcome. We discuss how the approach could be further refined.","[Butler, J. R. A.] CSIRO, Land & Water Flagship, EcoSci Precinct, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Wise, R.

Eight cultivars namely Gola, Chota Gola, Surahi, Choti Surahi, Sufaida, Sdabahar, Lal Badshah and Karela were selected due to their climatic adaptability and commercial suitability. All the cultivars showed significant variations in terms of their studied quality attributes. Amongst physical characteristics, Gola exhibited highest (79.9 mm(3)) GMD with lowest (50.3 mm(3)) was estimated in Choti Surahi. Insignificant varietal differences were observed in most of the proximate parameters as well as in mineral contents. Nutraceutical estimations showed significant variation in ascorbic acid (222.26-289.43 mg/100 g), total phenolic contents (94.06-190.64 mg GAE/100 g), total flavonoid contents (81.30-154.19 mg QE/100 g) and radical scavenging activity (27.70-78.15%) in the selected cultivars. A highly significant correlation (R-2 = 0.9970 p < 0.05) was observed between ascorbic acid and radical scavenging activity. In sensory evaluation, Gola received over all maximum scores (8.8) amongst its counterparts. Processed data were then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA).

We propose refocusing the climate services lens by moving away from a narrow, supply-driven emphasis on products. Instead, we advocate moving towards a process-centric approach defined by transdisciplinary collaboration that purposefully seeks to bring about fundamental, long-term benefits. Such benefits include increased human and institutional capacity, and the creation of relationships that are essential components of science-informed decision-making for climate adaptation and beyond. Work underpinning this paper consists of a review of existing climate services guidance, and analyses of a survey of climate services stakeholders, and a climate information co-production process case study in Lusaka, Zambia. We identify elements needed to support complex, real-world decision-making that many existing climate services fail to sufficiently consider. We respond by introducing a framework (Tandem), which consists of structured elements and practical, guiding questions informed by empirical analysis. To lay the foundation for both science-informed policy and policy-informed science, the Tandem framework puts forward guidance to achieve three goals: 1) to improve the ways in which all participants work together to purposefully design transdisciplinary knowledge integration processes (co-exploration and co-production processes that bring together different knowledge types across the science-society interface); 2) to co-explore decision-relevant needs for the co-production of integrated climate information (i.e., decision-relevant climate and non-climate information); and, 3) to increase individual and institutional capacities, collaboration, communication and networks that can translate this information into climate-resilient decision-making and action.","[Daniels, Elizabeth; Bharwani, Sukaina; Brandon, Karen] SEI, Oxford Eco Ctr, Roger House, Oxford OX2 0ES, England; [Swartling, Asa Gerger; Vulturius, Gregor] SEI Headquarters, Linnegatan 87D,Box 24218, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Vulturius, Gregor] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Stockholm Environment Institute; University of Edinburgh,"Bharwani, S (corresponding author), SEI, Oxford Eco Ctr, Roger House, Oxford OX2 0ES, England.",sukaina.bharwani@sei.org,"Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/J-1420-2018","Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/0000-0003-3616-7323","UK Department for International Development (DFID); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under the FRACTAL project [NE/M020355/1]; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) through SEI's Initiative on Climate Services; University of Oxford's Santander SME Universities Internship Programme; NERC [NE/M020355/1, NE/M020347/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Department for International Development (DFID); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under the FRACTAL project(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) through SEI's Initiative on Climate Services; University of Oxford's Santander SME Universities Internship Programme; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was supported by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under the FRACTAL project [grant number NE/M020355/1]; the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) through SEI's Initiative on Climate Services; and, the University of Oxford's Santander SME Universities Internship Programme.

Thus far, we have mapped similar to 80 % of the coast, for which we currently have data of sufficient accuracy to perform our analysis. Although Norway is generally at low risk from sea level rise largely owing to its steep topography and land uplift due to glacial isostatic adjustment, the maps presented here show that, on local scales, many parts of the coast are potentially vulnerable to flooding. There is a considerable amount of infrastructure at risk along the relatively long and complicated coastline. Nationwide we identify a total area of 400 km(2), 105 000 buildings, and 510 km of roads that are at risk of flooding from a 200-year storm surge event at present. These numbers will increase to 610 km(2), 137 000, and 1340 km with projected sea level rise to 2090 (95th percentile of RCP8.5 as recommended in planning). We find that some of our results are likely biased high owing to erroneous mapping (at least for lower water levels close to the tidal datum which delineates the coastline). A comparison of control points from different terrain types indicates that the elevation model has a root-mean-square error of 0.26 m and is the largest source of uncertainty in our mapping method. The coastal flooding maps and associated statistics are freely available, and alongside the development of coastal climate services, will help communicate the risks of sea level rise and storm surge to stakeholders.

Here we ask: does urban vegetation provide more cooling arranged in fewer and larger patches or more numerous but smaller patches in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona, USA? We hypothesized the combination of energy exchanges between adjacent patches and microclimate cooling induced by vegetation are key processes determining how configuration affects LST. Using high resolution thermal data (7 m), we evaluated predictions from this hypothesis through a multiple scale analysis spanning from within individual patches to among neighborhoods. We found tree cover is the dominant factor influencing urban cooling and that tree and grass configurations also substantially affect cooling, with effects generally exceeding 40% that of tree cover. The effects of tree and grass cover and configuration on LST were scale-dependent and reflect differences from within individual patches to among neighborhoods. In general, greater edge density and shape complexities of vegetation patches cool the landscape but may warm individual vegetation patches. Conversely, increasing individual vegetation patch size and reducing shape complexity may lead to cooler vegetation patches but a hotter landscape. Our findings suggest more edge area strengthens energy exchanges between vegetation and surroundings and more vegetation core area lead to greater cooling within individual patches. Through applications of high resolution thermal remote sensing, we are able to more directly connect effects of land cover composition and configuration to LST distributions that can help cities plan and evaluate local climate adaptation strategies.","[Yan, Jingli; Jenerette, G.

Urban street greening can achieve this mitigation and improve the quality of urban spaces and people's welfare. However, a clear definition of street green space morphology is lacking, and the nonlinear mechanism of its cooling effect is still unclear; the interaction between street green space morphology and the surrounding built environment has not been investigated. This study used machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision methods to predict land surface temperature based on street green space morphology and the surrounding built environment. The performances of the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models were then compared, and the nonlinear cooling effects offered by the street green space morphology were analyzed using the Shapley method. The results show that streets with a high level of green environment exposure (GVI > 0.4, NDVI > 4) can accommodate more types of green space morphology while maintaining the cooling effect. Additionally, the proportion of vegetation with simple geometry (FI < 0.2), large leaves (FD < 0.65), light-colored leaves (CSI > 13), and high leaf density (TDE > 3) should be increased in streets with a low level of green environment exposure (GVI < 0.1, NDVI < 2.5). Meanwhile, streets with highly variable building heights (AFI > 1.5) or large areas covered by buildings (BC > 0.3) should increase large leaf vegetation (FD < 0.65) while decreasing dark leaf vegetation (CSI < 13). The study uses machine learning methods to construct a nonlinear cooling benefit model for street green space morphology, proposes design recommendations for different street green spaces that consider climate adaptation, and provides a reference for urban thermal environment regulation.","[Liu, Ziyi; Ma, Xinyao; Hu, Lihui; Liu, Yong; Lu, Shan; Chen, Huilin] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Tan, Zhe] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Nanjing Forestry University,"Ma, XY (corresponding author), Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.",mxylm@zstu.edu.cn,,"liu, Ziyi/0000-0002-1099-8228",,,,,64,0,0,9,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,DEC,2022,11,12,,,,,,,2220,10.3390/land11122220,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11122220,,,23,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7E7TM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000901365300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many of these types of phenomena are projected to increase in intensity, duration or frequency as the climate warms. Of these extreme winds are among the most damaging historically over Europe yet assessments of their future changes remain fraught with uncertainty. This uncertainty arises due to both the rare nature of extreme wind events and the fact that most model are unable to faithfully represent them. Here we take advantage of a 15 member ensemble of high resolution Euro-CORDEX simulations (similar to 12 km) and investigate projected changes in extreme winds using a peaks-over-threshold approach. Additionally we show that - despite lingering model deficiencies and inadequate observational coverage - there is clear added value of the higher resolution simulations over coarser resolution counterparts. Further, the spatial heterogeneity and highly localised nature is well captured. Effects such as orographic interactions, drag due to urban areas, and even individual storm tracks over the oceans are clearly visible. As such future changes also exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity. These results emphasise the need for careful case-by-case treatment of extreme wind analysis, especially when done in a climate adaptation or decision making context. However, for more general assessments the picture is more clear with increases in the return period (i.e. more frequent) extreme episodes projected for Northern, Central and Southern Europe throughout the 21st century. While models continue to improve in their representation of extreme winds, improved observational coverage is desperately needed to obtain more robust assessments of extreme winds over Europe and elsewhere.","[Outten, Stephen] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Sobolowski, Stefan] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, Bergen, Norway",Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE),"Outten, S (corresponding author), Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway.",stephen.outten@nersc.no,,"Sobolowski, Stefan/0000-0002-6422-4535; Outten, Stephen/0000-0002-4883-611X",EMULATE project; Norwegian Department of Education,EMULATE project; Norwegian Department of Education,"This publication was supported by the EMULATE project, funded through basic institutional support from Norwegian Department of Education to the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research.

However, there is no systematic and in-depth analysis on this topic in the academia. In this study, a state-of-the-art review on novel PCMs based strategies to reduce cooling load of buildings has been presented. The investigated strategies include the structural configuration, systematic control and the multi-criteria for assessment. The roles of ventilations, radiative cooling and the underlying heat transfer mechanism have been characterized for the in-depth understanding. In order to realise the multivariable optimal design and robust operations under multi-level scenario uncertainties, parametric and uncertainty analysis, single- and multi-objective optimisations have been comprehensively reviewed, together with technical challenges for each solution. Research results show that, integrated passive and active systems with flexible transitions on operating modes are full of prospects for the multi-criteria performance improvement. Trade-off solutions along the multi-objective Pareto frontier are multi-diversified, dependent on the adopted approach and the studied scenario. Furthermore, machine learning methods are promising for the thermal and energy performances improvement, through the surrogate model development, the model predictive control and the optimisation function. Future studies and prospects have been demonstrated as avenues for future research. This study presents a systematic overview on novel PCMs based strategies, together with the application of machine-learning methods for cooling performance enhancement, which are critical for the promotion of novel PCMs based cooling strategies in buildings.","[Zhou, Yuekuan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Siqian] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoqiang] Hunan Univ, Natl Ctr Int Res Collaborat Bldg Safety & Environ, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoqiang] Hunan Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; City University of Hong Kong; Hunan University; Hunan University,"Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zheng, SQ (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yuekuan.zhou@connect.polyu.hk; candyz129@sina.com,"Zhou, Yuekuan/ABE-4194-2020",,Hong Kong Polytechnic University; City University of Hong Kong; Hunan university,Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University); City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong); Hunan university,"This research is supported by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, City University of Hong Kong and Hunan university.",,102,36,37,18,93,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Many studies have compiled lists of such adjustments, especially in the developing country context. There is reason to believe, however, that such studies have suffered from particularly two types of methodological flaws, with the result of over-attributing the importance of climate change, relative to other factors leading farmers to alter their behavior. Firstly, studies in the past often do not consider non-climatic drivers in their analysis and their style of enquiry is also prone to response bias, particularly social desirability bias. In this study, we introduced a new methodological approach that addresses these potential flaws. We applied this new method side-by-side with the more established ones, in a household survey undertaken in Ethiopia. Our new method reveals a list of climate adaptations that is somewhat shorter than previous studies have found. We found that in the study area, crop switching, crop diversification and changing planting date are the adjustments that are primarily motivated by climate change than other drivers. The commonly used approach in studies in the past, the direct enquiry method, identified fertilizer application as the most important adaptation response. Other methods including our suggested new approach, however, indicate that this and other farm-level adjustments, while compatible with climate change, have actually very little to do with it, and instead are primarily motivated by new market and technological opportunities. Our findings could allow for more effective and efficient sets of policies to help farmers best adjust to new threats and opportunities.","[Tessema, Yibekal Abebe; Joerin, Jonas; Patt, Anthony] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Climate Policy Grp, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Tessema, YA (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Climate Policy Grp, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",yibekalab@gmail.com; jonas.joerin@usys.ethz.ch; anthony.patt@usys.ethz.ch,"Tessema, Yibekal Abebe/GMX-3568-2022","Joerin, Jonas/0000-0003-1834-8112; Tessema, Yibekal Abebe/0000-0003-1682-1850",Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship program,Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship program,I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship program for covering my expenses during my PhD study at ETH Zurich.,,64,9,9,0,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

While studies in geographically defined human populations suggest that mtDNA mutations become fixed when they have conferred metabolic capabilities optimally suited for a specific environment, it has been challenging to definitively assign adaptive functions to specific mtDNA sequence variants in mammals. We investigated whether mtDNA genome variation functionally influences Caenorhabditis elegans wild isolates of distinct mtDNA lineages and geographic origins. We found that, relative to N2 (England) wild-type nematodes, CB4856 wild isolates from a warmer native climate (Hawaii) had a unique p.A12S amino acid substitution in the mtDNA-encoded COX1 core catalytic subunit of mitochondrial complex IV (CIV). Relative to N2, CB4856 worms grown at 20 degrees C had significantly increased CIV enzyme activity, mitochondrial matrix oxidant burden, and sensitivity to oxidative stress but had significantly reduced lifespan and mitochondrial membrane potential. Interestingly, mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly increased in CB4856 grown at its native temperature of 25 degrees C. A transmitochondrial cybrid worm strain, chpIR (M, CB4856 > N2), was bred as homoplasmic for the CB4856 mtDNA genome in the N2 nuclear background. The cybrid strain also displayed significantly increased CIV activity, demonstrating that this difference results from the mtDNA-encoded p.A12S variant. However, chpIR (M, CB4856 > N2) worms had significantly reduced median and maximal lifespan relative to CB4856, which may relate to their nuclear mtDNA genome mismatch. Overall, these data suggest that C. elegans wild isolates of varying geographic origins may adapt to environmental challenges through mtDNA variation to modulate critical aspects of mitochondrial energy metabolism.

In this paper, we argue that we must rethink adaptation from a new perspective, considering that humans together function as both ecological actors and social actors. Using international examples from the UNESCO world biosphere reserve network, we show that an ontological perspective may provide a simple and compact way to think about coupled infrastructure systems and systematic formalism, allowing for understanding of the relational matrix between actors, institutions and ecosystems. We contend that our formalism responds to three challenges. First, it encompasses the different regional contexts and policies that rely on the same ontology. Second, it provides a method to relate any local adaptation plan to the conservation paradigms that originate from the ecological modernization of policies. Third, it facilitates the discovery of drivers and processes involved in adaptation and management regime shifts by highlighting the way contextual factors configure, determine the structure of the action situation of the Institutional Analysis and Development framework (IAD) (Ostrom 2005), and how it operates.","[Mathevet, Raphael] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175,CNRS,EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Mathevet, Raphael] Inst Francais Pondichery, UMIFRE 21, CNRS, MAEE, 11 St Louis St, Pondicherry 605001, India; [Allouche, Aurelien; Nicolas, Laurence] RESSOURCE, 3095 Route Boulbon, F-13570 Barbentane, France; [Allouche, Aurelien] Univ Aix Marseille, CNRS, Lab Mediterraneen Sociol, UMR 7305, Marseille, France; [Mitroi, Veronica] Univ Paris 06, Inst Ecol & Sci Environm Paris iEES Paris, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France; [Fabricius, Christo; Guerbois, Chloe] Nelson Mandela Univ, Sustainabil Res Unit, POB 6531, ZA-6530 George, South Africa; [Fabricius, Christo] Nelson Mandela Univ, WWF, ZA-6530 George, South Africa; [Anderies, John M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Nelson Mandela University; Nelson Mandela University; World Wildlife Fund; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Mathevet, R (corresponding author), Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175,CNRS,EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.;Mathevet, R (corresponding author), Inst Francais Pondichery, UMIFRE 21, CNRS, MAEE, 11 St Louis St, Pondicherry 605001, India.",raphael.mathevet@cefe.cnrs.fr; aurelien.allouche@laposte.net; laurence.b.nicolas@wanadoo.fr; veronica.mitroi@leesu.enpc.fr; christo.Fabricius@wwf.org; Chloe.Guerbois@mandela.ac.za; m.anderies@asu.edu,,"Guerbois, Chloe/0000-0003-3746-0548; Fabricius, Christo/0000-0003-2223-5671; Mitroi, Veronica/0000-0003-0296-9555; Mathevet, Raphael/0000-0002-1778-1080","French National Research Agency; Belmont Forum and G8 International Opportunities Fund (IOF 2013); Ministere de l'Ecologie, du Developpement Durable et de l'Energie (France): Programme LITEAU 2013; National Research Foundation of South Africa [86974]","French National Research Agency(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Belmont Forum and G8 International Opportunities Fund (IOF 2013); Ministere de l'Ecologie, du Developpement Durable et de l'Energie (France): Programme LITEAU 2013; National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa)","This research was funded by French National Research Agency and the Belmont Forum and G8 International Opportunities Fund (IOF 2013) and Ministere de l'Ecologie, du Developpement Durable et de l'Energie (France): Programme LITEAU 2013.

There is a pressing need to reduce the gap between actual and potential maize yield/ha, especially among farmers in semi-arid regions. This present study examines the potential role of supplemental irrigation and its differential impact on maize yield in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. In this study, maize yield data were generated from information recorded over a period of 20 years by farmers in Ntabankulu through cross-sectional interviews with 124 randomly-selected farming households. Maize yields for interviewed farmers were analysed for each of the experienced climatic hazards, for yield decline per ha and preferable adaptation strategies. Maize yield analyses show a maximum ceiling/attainable yield of 0.234 t/ha and average farm yield of 0.146 t/ha. Floods or hailstorms cause 75% decline in maize yield/ha and there was no significant difference between farmers practising irrigation and those practising dryland farming (P > 0.05). Low/no rains throughout the season; delay or low onset of rainfall and a rain-break for a week or more in a season results in 75%; 54% and 50.5% decline in maize yield/ha, respectively. On a scale of 1 to 10, farmers highly rank practicing supplementary irrigation (8.4) and change of planting date (7.8) as important adaptation strategies. Rescheduling planting date from the traditional planting times to earlier or later planting dates, assisted by use of weather reports and forecasting, to some extent curbs the impact of delays or slow onset of rainfall on yield. Supplemental irrigation is instrumental in reducing the impact of midseason drought (rains break for a week) and light rainfall throughout the season. Analyses of actual yields and yield decline against each of the experienced climatic hazards provided insight into management possibilities to stabilize maize output.","[Ndhleve, S.; Nakin, M. D.

However, the staging of major tourist events has not only led to increased CO2 emissions in Austria, the events themselves have also been affected by climate change. The paper at hand is based on a data collection and review process which covered the relevant peer reviewed and grey literature. This comprehensive process was based on, and was open to, contributions by the full scientific community of relevant Austrian researchers and experts. The compilation process of the report followed quality standards such as the involvement of international partners as review editors within the review process. In addition, the literature was surveyed to integrate the international state of the art. The paper discusses the relationship between events and climate change by looking at mitigation measures on the one hand as well as adaptive strategies taken by event organizers on the other. However, a significant lack of objective information and data as well as appropriate scientific studies also became obvious in this process. Against this background main tasks and challenges for further research are identified and discussed. The paper closes with managerial implications for the organization of major events. Management implications: The literature review and the analyses of case study reports on events support the following suggestions: Climate change mitigation measures and environmental issues should be already a significant part of the call, the following application by the destination and the final decision making. The application of specific environmental and climate friendly guidelines, awards or certificates are helpful tools to motivate the branch and to achieve green events. Measures related to transportation and mobility are crucial to achieve significant savings of greenhouse emissions. Further important aspects to be considered are waste management, catering, communication, accommodation and site selection. Climate research may help to define a suitable period for the event at the desired location which is likely to avoid or reduce possible climate change related risks such as extreme heat or lack of snows.","[Burton, Anna; Fritz, Oliver] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria; [Proebstl-Haider, Ulrike] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning I, Vienna, Austria; [Ginner, Kathrin; Formayer, Herbert] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Meteorol & Climatol, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Fritz, O (corresponding author), Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria.",oliver.fritz@wifo.ac.at,,"Burton, Anna M./0000-0003-4769-0283; Fritz, Oliver/0000-0002-5942-8621; Formayer, Herbert/0000-0002-2126-9696",Climate and Energy Fund,Climate and Energy Fund,This project has been funded by the Climate and Energy Fund and carried out within the framework of the Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP) -10th Call.,,103,1,1,2,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-0780,2213-0799,,J OUTDOOR REC TOUR,J.

Besides this, cities also need to adapt to face the challenges related to climate change. Cities, with their complex urban texture and fabric, can be represented as a diverse ecosystem that does not have a clear and defined boundary. Multiple software tools that have been developed, in recent years, for assessment of urban climate, building energy demand, the outdoor thermal comfort and the energy systems. In this review, we, however, noted that these tools often address only one or two of these urban planning aspects. There is nonetheless an intricate link between them. For instance, the outdoor comfort assessment has shown that there is a strong link between biometeorology and architecture and urban climate. Additionally, to address the challenges of the energy transition, there will be a convergence of the energy needs in the future with an energy nexus regrouping the energy demand of urban areas. It is also highlighted that the uncertainty related to future climatic data makes urban adaptation and mitigation strategies complex to implement and to design given the lack of a comprehensive framework. We thus conclude by suggesting the need for a holistic interface to take into account this multi-dimensional problem. With the help of such a platform, a positive loop in urban design can be initiated leading to the development of low carbon cities and/or with the use of blue and green infrastructure to have a positive impact on the mitigation and adaptation strategies.","[Mauree, Dasaraden; Coccolo, Silvia; Perera, A.

However, changes at the regional-to-mountain scale is still a major topic of interest. This study addresses the impacts of climate change on mountain snowpack by assessing historical and projected variable-resolution (VR) climate simulations in the community earth system model (VR-CESM) forced by prescribed sea-surface temperatures along with widely used regional downscaling techniques, the coupled model intercomparison projects phase 5 bias corrected and statistically downscaled (CMIP5-BCSD) and the North American regional climate change assessment program (NARCCAP). The multi-model RCP8.5 scenario analysis of winter season SWE for western USA mountains indicates by 2040-2065 mean SWE could decrease -19% (NARCCAP) to -38% (VR-CESM), with an ensemble median change of -27%. Contrary to CMIP5-BCSD and NARCCAP, VR-CESM highlights a more pessimistic outcome for western USA mountain snowpack in latter-parts of the 21st century. This is related to temperature changes altering the snow-albedo feedback, snowpack storage, and precipitation phase, but may indicate that VR-CESM resolves more physically consistent elevational effects lacking in statistically downscaled datasets and teleconnections that are not captured in limited area models. Overall, VR-CESM projects by 2075-2100 that average western USA mountain snowfall decreases by -30%, snow cover by -44%, SWE by -69%, and average surface temperature increase of +5.0 degrees C. This places pressure on western USA states to preemptively invest in climate adaptation measures such as alternative water storage, water use efficiency, and reassess reservoir storage operations.","[Rhoades, Alan M.; Ullrich, Paul A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources LAWR, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Zarzycki, Colin M.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Rhoades, AM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources LAWR, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",amrhoades@ucdavis.edu,"Rhoades, Alan/H-9084-2017; Zarzycki, Colin/E-5691-2014","Rhoades, Alan/0000-0003-3723-2422; Zarzycki, Colin/0000-0001-5731-042X","Leland Roy Saxon and Georgia Wood Saxon Fellowship; Multiscale Methods for Accurate, Efficient, and Scale-aware Models of the Earth System within the Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy Earth System Modeling Program (ESM) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; California Agricultural Experiment Station [CA-D-LAW-2203-H]; National Science Foundation (NSF) via the Climate Change, Water, and Society Integrated Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program at the University of California, Davis (NSF) [1069333]","Leland Roy Saxon and Georgia Wood Saxon Fellowship; Multiscale Methods for Accurate, Efficient, and Scale-aware Models of the Earth System within the Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy Earth System Modeling Program (ESM); California Agricultural Experiment Station; National Science Foundation (NSF) via the Climate Change, Water, and Society Integrated Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program at the University of California, Davis (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF))","The authors would like to acknowledge Cecile Hannay for her help in ensuring that our RCP8.5 configuration within CESM was consistent with NCAR standards.

Understanding the impact of ENSO and temperature on the risk of extreme precipitation over global land will provide a foundation for risk assessment and climate-adaptive design of infrastructure in a changing climate. In this study, nonstationary generalized extreme value distributions were used to model extreme precipitation over global land for the period 1979-2015, with ENSO indicator and temperature as covariates. Risk factors were estimated to quantify the contrast between the influence of different ENSO phases and temperature. The results show that extreme precipitation is dominated by ENSO over 22% of global land and by temperature over 26% of global land. With a warming climate, the risk of high-intensity daily extreme precipitation increases at high latitudes but decreases in tropical regions. For ENSO, large parts of North America, southern South America, and southeastern and northeastern China are shown to suffer greater risk in El Nio years, with more than double the chance of intense extreme precipitation in El Nio years compared with La Nia years. Moreover, regions with more intense precipitation are more sensitive to ENSO. Global climate models were used to investigate the changing relationship between extreme precipitation and the covariates. The risk of extreme, high-intensity precipitation increases across high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere but decreases in middle and lower latitudes under a warming climate scenario, and will likely trigger increases in severe flooding and droughts across the globe. However, there is some uncertainties associated with the influence of ENSO on predictions of future extreme precipitation, with the spatial extent and risk varying among the different models.","[Sun, Qiaohong; Miao, Chiyuan; Qiao, Yuanyuan; Duan, Qingyun] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Sun, Qiaohong; Miao, Chiyuan; Qiao, Yuanyuan; Duan, Qingyun] Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Miao, CY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Miao, CY (corresponding author), Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",miaocy@vip.sina.com,"Miao, chiyuan/E-6036-2011; Duan, Qingyun/C-7652-2011","Miao, chiyuan/0000-0001-6413-7020; Duan, Qingyun/0000-0001-9955-1512","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41622101, 91547118]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41622101; No. 91547118), and the State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology.

In order to support integrated coastal zone management and advance the basic source-pathway-receptor-consequence approach focused on traditional receptors (e.g., population, infrastructure, and economy), a novel risk framework is proposed able to evaluate potential risks of loss or degradation of ecosystem services (ESs) due to projected extreme sea level scenarios in the Italian coast. Three risk scenarios for the reference period (1969-2010) and future time frame up to 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are developed by integrating extreme water-level projections related to changing climate conditions, with vulnerability information about the topography, distance from coastlines, and presence of artificial protections. A risk assessment is then performed considering the potential effects of the spatial-temporal variability of inundations and land use on the supply level and spatial distribution of ESs. The results of the analysis are summarized into a spatially explicit risk index, useful to rank coastal areas more prone to ESs losses or degradation due to coastal inundation at the national scale. Overall, the Northern Adriatic coast is scored at high risk of ESs loss or degradation in the future scenario. Other small coastal strips with medium risk scores are the Eastern Puglia coast, Western Sardinia, and Tuscany's coast. The ESs Coastal Risk Index provides an easy-to-understand screening assessment that could support the prioritization of areas for coastal adaptation at the national scale. Moreover, this index allows the direct evaluation of the public value of ecosystems and supports more effective territorial planning and environmental management decisions. In particular, it could support the mainstreaming of ecosystem-based approaches (e.g., ecological engineering and green infrastructures) to mitigate the risks of climate change and extreme events while protecting ecosystems and biodiversity.

In this context, atmospheric moisture can potentially be harvested in the form of dew, which is commonly disregarded from the water budget, although its impact may be significant when compared to rainfall during the dry season. In this study, a dew atlas for the Mediterranean region is presented illustrating dew yields using the yield data collected for the 2013 dry season. The results indicate that cumulative monthly dew yield in the region can exceed 2.8 mm at the end of the dry season and 1.5 mm during the driest months, compared to <1mm of rainfall during the same period in some areas. Dew yields were compared with potential evapotranspiration (PET) and actual evapotranspiration (ET) during summer months thus highlighting the role of dew to many native plants in the region. Furthermore, forecasted trends in temperature and relative humidity were used to estimate dew yields under future climatic scenarios. The results showed a 27% decline in dew yield during the critical summer months at the end of the century (2080). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

That lack of research is beginning to change. Science and policy experts in the environmental and behavioral health sciences are coming together to explore converging evidence on the relationship-harmful or beneficial-between environmental factors and mental health. OBJECTIVES: To organize evidence and catalyze new findings, the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) hosted a workshop 2-3 February 2021 on the interplay of environmental exposures and mental health outcomes. METHODS: This commentary provides a nonsystematic, expert-guided conceptual review and interdisciplinary perspective on the convergence of environmental and mental health, drawing from hypotheses, findings, and research gaps presented and discussed at the workshop. Featured is an overview of what is known about the intersection of the environment and mental health, focusing on the effects of neurotoxic pollutants, threats related to climate change, and the importance of health promoting environments, such as urban green spaces. DISCUSSION: We describe what can be gained by bridging environmental and psychological research disciplines and present a synthesis of what is needed to advance interdisciplinary investigations. We also consider the implications of the current evidence for a) foundational knowledge of the etiology of mental health and illness, b) toxicant policy and regulation, c) definitions of climate adaptation and community resilience, d) interventions targeting marginalized communities, and e) the future of research training and funding. We include a call to action for environmental and mental health researchers, focusing on the environmental contributions to mental health to unlock primary prevention strategies at the population level and open equitable paths for preventing mental disorders and achieving optimal mental health for all. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9889","[Reuben, Aaron] Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Durham, NC USA; [Manczak, Erika M.] Univ Denver, Dept Psychol, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Cabrera, Laura Y.] Penn State Univ, Dept Engn Sci & Mech, 227 Hammond Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Alegria, Margarita] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Alegria, Margarita] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Alegria, Margarita] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Dispar Res Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Bucher, Meghan L.; Miller, Gary W.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, New York, NY USA; [Freeman, Emily C.] Lundbeck LLC, Deerfield, IL USA; [Solomon, Gina M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Solomon, Gina M.] Publ Hlth Inst, Oakland, CA USA; [Perry, Melissa J.] George Washington Univ, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Washington, DC USA",Duke University; University of Denver; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Columbia University; Lundbeck Corporation; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Public Health Institute; George Washington University,"Perry, MJ (corresponding author), Sch Publ Hlth, Milken Inst, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, 955 New Hampshire Ave, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",mperry@gwu.edu,,"Reuben, Aaron/0000-0001-5713-4913; Bucher, Meghan/0000-0001-7613-3836; Solomon, Gina/0000-0001-6004-0387","NIEHS [F31ES029358, R21ES031501, T32007322, R01023839]; NIMH [R01MH117247]; NIA [R01AG046149]; NIDA [U18052498]",NIEHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)); NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIDA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)),"The authors thank the many presenters and participants at the NASEM Workshop on The Interplay Between Environmental Exposures and Mental Health Outcomes.

Many of these valued coastal systems could reach tipping points, at which hazard exposure substantially increases and threatens the present-day form, function, and viability of communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Determining the timing and nature of these tipping points is essential for effective climate adaptation planning. Here we present a multidisciplinary case study from Santa Barbara, California (USA), to identify potential climate change-related tipping points for various coastal systems. This study integrates numerical and statistical models of the climate, ocean water levels, beach and cliff evolution, and two soft sediment ecosystems, sandy beaches and tidal wetlands. We find that tipping points for beaches and wetlands could be reached with just 0.25 m or less of SLR (similar to 2050), with>50% subsequent habitat loss that would degrade overall biodiversity and ecosystem function. In contrast, the largest projected changes in socioeconomic exposure to flooding for five communities in this region are not anticipated until SLR exceeds 0.75 m for daily flooding and 1.5 m for storm-driven flooding (similar to 2100 or later). These changes are less acute relative to community totals and do not qualify as tipping points given the adaptive capacity of communities. Nonetheless, the natural and human built systems are interconnected such that the loss of natural system function could negatively impact the quality of life of residents and disrupt the local economy, resulting in indirect socioeconomic impacts long before built infrastructure is directly impacted by flooding.","[Barnard, Patrick L.; Hart, Juliette A.

However, the nature of the interaction between long-term and short-term thermal history is unclear. To investigate the interactive effects of long-term and short-term thermal history on outdoor thermal comfort, we conducted summer thermal comfort surveys in Melbourne (n = 3293, January-February 2014), Guangzhou, and Zhuhai (n = 4304, September 2018). The mean thermal sensation of residents of Guangzhou was higher than that of Melbourne and Zhuhai residents under a similar Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) range. The preferred UTCI was the highest for Melbourne residents (19.62 degrees C). When UTCI was 25.6-38.4 degrees C, respondents' mean thermal sensation from Koppen climate zones A, B, and C was significantly higher in Guangzhou than those of Zhuhai and Melbourne. A three-way ANOVA test revealed that peoples' thermal sensations depended on a significant interaction among UTCI thermal stress levels, climate zones, and prior exposure environment. The prior exposure environment could affect the difference in thermal perception between climate zones. However, there was no significant interaction between climate zones and activity engaged in before taking the survey on thermal sensation. The difference in the thermal perception of various climate zones diminished under universally uncomfortable conditions for specific prior exposure environments and activities. The socio-ecological system model, environmental perception theory, climatocultural adaptation, and alliesthesia are useful for understanding the interactive effect of long- and short-term thermal history on outdoor thermal comfort. By revealing how people adapt to different climatic environments, our results can help ensure that people with diverse climatic backgrounds can experience thermal comfort outdoors.

Some recent studies have examined this issue and presented controversial opinions, but only focus on summertime ozone increase. This study extends a comprehensive analysis of the influencing factors on China's ozone changes from 2013 to 2017 out of the summer season, combining satellite data, ground measurements and model analyses. The annual trends of air pollutants, e.g., increase in 95th percentile O-3 concentration (+1.4-8.7 mu g m(-3) yr(-1)), and decreases in fine particulate matter (PM2.5; -4.0 similar to-7.5 mu g m(-3) yr(-1)) and sulfur dioxide (-2.6 similar to-9.7 mu g m(-3) yr(-1)) are uncovered by satellite and observational data. Model results show that the attributions of surface O-3 changes from 2013 to 2017 vary spatially and seasonally, and most regions are more affected by emission changes (-9.5-47.0 mu g m(-3)) rather than meteorological changes (-8.1-21.3 mu g m(-3)). In specific regions and seasons, e.g., south/southwestern and eastern China south of 35 degrees N in May and July, the surface O-3 responses to climate variability could have an equal or even greater importance than emission changes. In these major pollution control regions, e.g. northern and mid-eastern China, the precursor emissions control (11-35%) contributes in the same degree as the changes in aerosol effects (35-38%) to surface ozone enhancement in the warm seasons. More scientific emission controls and climate adaptation strategies are required to attain the synergetic control of atmospheric particulate matter and ozone in China.","[Li, Mengmeng; Wang, Tijian; Shu, Lei; Qu, Yawei; Xie, Min; Liu, Jane; Kalsoom, Ume] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jane] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wu, Hao] Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; University of Toronto; Nanjing University,"Wang, TJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",tjwang@nju.edu.cn,,"QU, YAWEI/0000-0001-7153-7567","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41975153, 42077192]; National Key Basic Research Development Program of China [2019YFC0214603, 2020YFA0607802]; Emory University-Nanjing University Collaborative Research Grant; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [14380051, 14380056]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Basic Research Development Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Emory University-Nanjing University Collaborative Research Grant; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This study is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41975153, 42077192), the National Key Basic Research Development Program of China (2019YFC0214603, 2020YFA0607802), the Emory University-Nanjing University Collaborative Research Grant, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (14380051, 14380056).",,94,20,20,11,57,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1352-2310,1873-2844,,ATMOS ENVIRON,Atmos.

Yet, a majority of Brazilian coffee farms are operated by 'smallholders', producers with relatively small properties and primarily reliant on family labor. While previous work indicates that climate change will decrease the area suitable for coffee production in Brazil, no study has assessed the impacts of climate change on coffee yields or the relative exposure and vulnerability of coffee producing regions to changes in climate hazards (climate-associated losses in yield). To address these knowledge gaps, we assess the sensitivity of coffee yields to temperature and precipitation variation from 1974 to 2017 to map coffee climate hazards. Next, we identify which coffee producing regions in Brazil have the highest exposure to climate hazards due to high dependence of coffee production as a proportion of agricultural area. Finally, we generate a Vulnerability Index to identify which regions are theoretically least able to adapt to climate hazards. Our study finds that since 1974, temperatures in Brazilian coffee growing municipalities have been increasing by similar to 0.25 degrees C per decade and annual precipitation has been decreasing during the blooming and ripening periods. This historical climate change has already resulted in reductions in coffee yield by more than 20% in the Southeast of Brazil. Minas Gerais, the largest coffee producing state in Brazil, has among the highest climate hazard and overall climate risk, exacerbated by ongoing coffee expansion. Additionally, many municipalities with the lowest adaptive capacity, including the country's mountainous regions, also have high climate exposure and hazards. Negative climate hazard and exposure impacts for coffee producing regions could be potentially offset by targeting climate adaptation support to these high-risk regions, including research, extension, and credit subsidies for improved coffee varieties, irrigation, and agroforestry and diversifying agricultural production.","[Koh, Ilyun; Garrett, Rachael; Janetos, Anthony] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Garrett, Rachael] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Garrett, Rachael] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Janetos, Anthony] Boston Univ, Pardee Ctr Study Longer Range Future, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mueller, Nathaniel D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Mueller, Nathaniel D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA",Boston University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Boston University; Colorado State University; Colorado State University,"Garrett, R (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Garrett, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;Garrett, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",rgarrett@ethz.ch,"Garrett, Rachael/H-7889-2019; Mueller, Nathan D/E-5864-2010","Garrett, Rachael/0000-0002-6171-263X; Mueller, Nathan D/0000-0003-1857-5104",Fulbright Foundation NEXUS Program for the Western Hemisphere; Summer Fellows program at the Boston University Fredrick S.

Urban climate adaptation measures are beneficial over the longer term, particularly in coastal areas, yet the upfront costs of such measures are significant. Moreover, public actors responsible for adaptation to flood risk face constrained budgets. A promising strategy for overcoming these constraints and enabling greater adaptation investment is land reclamation that includes adaptation, i.e. flood risk reduction. Land reclamation in high-value urban areas can generate substantial revenues through the sale or lease of new land, or taxes on increased economic activities, thus offsetting public adaptation investments. This paper explores the potential of land reclamation for leveraging public adaptation investments and associated distributional issues, by analysing 3 urban land reclamation and adaptation projects in Germany, the Netherlands and the Maldives. We find that all projects have leveraging potential, and leveraging in projects primarily aimed at land creation is particularly high. Further, due to low adaptation costs needed to protect revenue streams in such projects, these investments appear to be 'low-regret'. Regarding distributional aspects, high project costs and limited public budgets for adaptation constrain public actors' ability to ensure equitable outcomes through planning instruments, for example, social housing. Further, in implementation, competition for project benefits can lead to further inequalities. We conclude that urban land reclamation presents a significant opportunity to leverage public adaptation investments under certain conditions. We further outline future research needs including to extend land-based financing theory from related urban infrastructure sectors to inform the design of equitable governance arrangements and to better understand the role of such urban land reclamation projects in regional or national development pathways.","[Bisaro, Alexander; Hinkel, Jochen] Global Climate Forum, Berlin, Germany; [de Bel, Mark; Kok, Sien] Deltares, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Bouwer, Laurens M.] Helmholtz Zentrum Gecsthacht, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Hamburg, Germany",Deltares,"Bisaro, A (corresponding author), Global Climate Forum, Berlin, Germany.",sandy.bisaro@globalclimateforum.org,"Bouwer, Laurens/AAV-7628-2021; Bouwer, Laurens/ABE-7170-2021","Bouwer, Laurens/0000-0003-3498-2586; de Bel, Mark/0000-0003-2701-5985; Hinkel, Jochen/0000-0001-7590-992X",,,,,71,20,20,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Trend estimation using wavelets has continued to attract ubiquitous applications in various fields including atmospheric and water studies. While Fourier analysis employs big waves, wavelet analysis uses small waves. Since wavelets localise features in a signal data to different scales, we can therefore preserve vital signal features while removing noise in the signal. Hence the basic notion of wavelet denoising or wavelet thresholding is that the wavelet transform results in a sparse representation for many real-world signals, meaning that the wavelet transform concentrates signal features in a few large-magnitude wavelet coefficients. Since small wavelet coefficients are typically noise, we can shrink or remove them without affecting the signal quality. This paper employs wavelet analyses of some selected meteorological factors of the Namibian atmosphere to investigate the noise in the data collected from a number of Southern African Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adaptive Land Management (SASSCAL) stations, for the years 2012 to 2015. The results show some significant levels of noise around the thresholds of various optimal time series peaks of the data. Hence the denoised data serve to represent fairly refined representations of data for the given period. Moreover, the results of comparing the optimal game model solutions for the original and denoised data specifically identified some weather stations that are humidity noise stable and temperature noise stable. Thus, these suggest that despite the noise in the respective meteorological data for these stations, the effects of the noise in the data appear to be manageable or optimally controllable, within the given period.","[Reju, Sunday A.] Namibia Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math & Stat, Windhoek, Namibia; [Kgabi, Nnenesi A.] Namibia Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Windhoek, Namibia; [Kgabi, Nnenesi A.] Univ Free State, Ctr Environm Management, Bloemfontein, South Africa",Namibia University of Science & Technology; Namibia University of Science & Technology; University of the Free State,"Reju, SA (corresponding author), Namibia Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math & Stat, Windhoek, Namibia.",sreju@nust.na; nkgabi@nust.na,,"Kgabi, Nnenesi/0000-0001-9488-9661","UNESCO Chair on Sustainable Water Research for Climate Adaptation in Arid Environments, Namibia University of Science and Technology","UNESCO Chair on Sustainable Water Research for Climate Adaptation in Arid Environments, Namibia University of Science and Technology","The authors wish to acknowledge the support of the UNESCO Chair on Sustainable Water Research for Climate Adaptation in Arid Environments, Namibia University of Science and Technology.",,14,5,6,1,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0169-8095,1873-2895,,ATMOS RES,Atmos.

Much of the water is contained in an unconfined aquifer which occurs in coastal sand dunes and supports ecologically-important throughflow wetlands. The system has been subject to significant climate change since about 1975, although the persistent and unidirectional nature of the change was not recognised for some time. As well as climate, groundwater levels are affected by land use (e.g. plantation forestry, urbanisation) and land management (e.g. how plantations and stormwater are managed) as well as by the amount of groundwater abstraction from each of several inter-connected aquifers. Land, water and forests are managed by different government agencies with their own policy objectives. Maintaining groundwater levels within an agreed range of values to protect the wetlands requires informed and early adaptation by these agencies as well as a supportive community. Adaptation was hampered because there was little or no experience of managing groundwater for climate change and the causes of declining levels were neither clear nor agreed. Even when target water level decisions were agreed, their achievement required the cooperation of parties with different priorities. This paper examines some of the lessons learned from this experience and the current approach to manage the land, water and forest resources to meet multiple objectives in a system that is undergoing transitional change rather than reaching a new equilibrium. Climate change impacts have been progressive and the concept of a system that can respond in a resilient manner after a temporary perturbation is not an appropriate concept in this example. Climate adaptation involves significant social and institutional change as well as biophysical changes to make the most of a changing system.","[McFarlane, Don] CSIRO Land & Water, Floreat, WA, Australia; [Strawbridge, Melanie; Stone, Roy; Paton, Andrew] Dept Water, Perth, WA 6842, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"McFarlane, D (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, Private Bag 5 Wembley 6913, Floreat, WA, Australia.",don.mcfarlane@csiro.au,"McFarlane, Don/A-7256-2013","McFarlane, Don/0000-0002-3828-4964",Government of Western Australia,Government of Western Australia,"The Gnangara Sustainability Strategy was funded by the Government of Western Australia.

With time-series Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and Taiwan Climate Change Estimate and Information Platform (TCCIP) gridded monthly climatic data, their vertical dynamics were investigated by employing the Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithm, Pearson's correlation analysis, and the Durbin-Watson test. The vertical differences in NDVI values presented three breakpoints and a consistent trend from positive (1982 to 1989) to negative at varied rates, and then gradually increased after 2000. In addition, a positive rainfall trend was discovered. Average and maximum temperature had similar increasing trends, while minimum temperature showed variations, especially at higher altitudes. In terms of regional variations, the vegetation growth was stable in the north but worse in the central region. Higher elevations revealed larger variations in the NDVI and temperature datasets. NDVI, along with average and minimum temperature, showed their largest changes earlier in higher altitude areas. Specifically, the increasing minimum temperature direction was more prominent in the mid-to-high-altitude areas in the eastern and central regions. Seasonal variations were observed for each region. The difference between the dry and wet seasons is becoming larger, with the smallest difference in the northern region and the largest difference in the southern region. Taiwan's NDVI and climatic factors have a significant negative correlation (p < 0.05), but the maximum and minimum temperatures have significant positive effects at low altitudes below 500 m. The northern and central regions reveal similar responses, while the south and east display different feedbacks. The results illuminate climate change evidence from assessment of the long-term dynamics of vegetation and climatic factors, providing valuable references for establishing correspondent climate-adaptive strategies in Taiwan.","[Tsai, Hui Ping; Wang, Geng-Gui; Zhuang, Zhong-Han] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 145 Xingda Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Tsai, Hui Ping] Pervas AI Res PAIR Labs, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University,"Tsai, HP (corresponding author), Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 145 Xingda Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan.;Tsai, HP (corresponding author), Pervas AI Res PAIR Labs, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",huiping.tsai@nchu.edu.tw; d110062002@mail.nchu.edu.tw; d109062003@mail.nchu.edu.tw,"Tsai, HuiPing/AAC-2802-2022","TSAI, HUI PING/0000-0002-4915-1075","Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 107-2119-M-005-008-MY2, MOST 109-2121-M-005-002, MOST 109-2119-M-005-003, MOST 110-2121-M-005-001, MOST 110-2321-B-005-003, MOST 110-2321-B-492-001]",Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology,"Funding This research was funded by the Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology, grant number MOST 107-2119-M-005-008-MY2, MOST 109-2121-M-005-002, MOST 109-2119-M-005-003, MOST 110-2121-M-005-001, MOST 110-2321-B-005-003, and MOST 110-2321-B-492-001.",,94,0,0,4,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,NOV,2021,13,22,,,,,,,4707,10.3390/rs13224707,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13224707,,,29,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,XI6VD,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000726245600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the expectation that gender-mainstreaming efforts would contribute towards greater gender equality has been mostly disappointed. Our starting point is this disjuncture between a firm establishment of the gender mainstreaming discourse and the limited visible effects in reducing gender inequalities. Purpose To understand this disjuncture we examine the meanings through which policy makers relate to, and dis/engage with gender issues. The article draws attention to the role of narratives in micro-processes of policymaking that support, perpetuate or create resistance against the concept of gender mainstreaming, or against policy change more broadly. Approach and methods The study deploys a multi-step narrative analysis in which we identify story episodes, co-construct stories, identify and interpret the narratives and finally study these narratives in interaction. The empirical material consists of thirty semi-standardized expert interviews as well as excerpts from ten multi-stakeholder meetings on the themes of climate change, agriculture, rural livelihoods and gender in Uganda. Findings The analysis reveals a complex ecology of 22 stories, clustered in five main narratives. While most stories unfold a Gender Equality narrative, four competing narratives emerge. Shifts during conversations from the Gender Equality narrative to other narratives reveal that the discursive engagement with gender mainstreaming is accompanied by simultaneous resistance, deconstruction and revocation. These narrative shifts exercise four distinct power effects: They (1) shift blame for ineffective gender implementation; (2) legitimize policy inaction; (3) foreground and naturalize patriarchy; and (4) promote the diversion of resources. The implicit communicative strategies exercise powerthroughideas (persuade listeners that the equality narrative is inappropriate), poweroverideas (gender equality ideas are rejected or frustrated) and powerinideas (entrenched patriarchy ideas are reproduced). Policy implications Attention to ideational power through policy narrative contributes to explain implementation issues with gender mainstreaming in Uganda, and is likely to be relevant beyond this case.","[Acosta, Mariola; van Wessel, Margit; van Bommel, Severine; Feindt, Peter H.] Wageningen Univ, Strateg Commun Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Acosta, Mariola; Ampaire, Edidah L.; Jassogne, Laurence] Int Inst Trop Agr, Kampala, Uganda; [van Bommel, Severine] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Australia; [Ampaire, Edidah L.] Int Dev Res Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya; [Jassogne, Laurence] Opus Insights, The Hague, Netherlands; [Feindt, Peter H.] Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Berlin, Germany",Wageningen University & Research; University of Queensland; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Acosta, M (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Strateg Commun Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",mariola.acosta@wur.nl,,"van Bommel, Severine/0000-0002-7782-9162; Acosta, Mariola/0000-0003-4456-1283",CGIAR Fund Donors,CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR),"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

Four earth system models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and a process-based ecosystem model are used in this study to assess the impacts and potential risks of the two warming targets on the carbon cycle of China's terrestrial ecosystems. Results show that warming generally stimulates the increase of net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) under both representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The projected increments of NPP are higher at 2 degrees C warming than that at 1.5 degrees C warming for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios; approximately 13% and 19% under RCP4.5, and 12.5% and 20% under RCP8.5 at 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming, respectively. However, the increasing rate of NPP was projected to decline at 2 degrees C warming under the RCP4.5 scenario, and the further 0.5 degrees C temperature rising induces the decreased NPP linear slopes in more than 81% areas of China's ecosystems. The total NEP is projected to be increased by 53% at 1.5 degrees C, and by 81% at 2 degrees C warming. NEP was projected to increase approximately by 28% with the additional 0.5 degrees C warming. Furthermore, the increasing rate of NEP weakens at 2 degrees C warming, especially under the RCP8.5 scenario. In summary, China's total NPP and NEP were projected to increase under both 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming scenarios, although adverse effects (i.e., the drop of NPP growth and the reduction of carbon sequestration capacity) would occur in some regions such as northern China in the process of global warming.","[Yu, Li] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Gu, Fengxue] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Minist Agr, Key Lab Dryland Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Huang, Mei; Hao, Man; Wang, Zhaosheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Tao, Bo] Univ Kentucky, Coll Agr Food & Environm, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Lexington, KY 40546 USA","China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development in Agriculture, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University of Kentucky","Huang, M (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yuli@cma.gov.cn; gufengxue@caas.cn; huangm@igsnrr.ac.cn; taobo.eco@gmail.com; haom.l4s@igsnrr.ac.cn; wangzs@igsnrr.ac.cn,"wang, zhaosheng/AAX-1350-2021","wang, zhaosheng/0000-0001-7307-2249",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0503905]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41991285]; Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund [BSRF201708],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund,"This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China, grant number 2017YFC0503905, National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 41991285 and Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund, grant number BSRF201708.",,73,8,11,12,45,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,,,,,,,2849,10.3390/su12072849,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12072849,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LL4WR,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000531558100274,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is often excluded from studies of the urban heat island because reliable estimates are not available. This omission is important because anthropogenic heat can contribute up to 4 degrees C to the urban heat island, and increases heat stress to urban residents. The exclusion of anthropogenic heat means the urban heat is-land effect on temperatures may be under-estimated. Here we estimate anthropogenic heat for four Australian capital cities (Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide) to inform the management of the urban heat island in a changing climate. Anthropogenic heat release was calculated using 2011 population census data and an inventory of hourly traffic volume, building electricity and gas use. Melbourne had the highest annual daily average anthropogenic heat emissions, which reached 376 W/m(2) in the city centre during the daytime, while Brisbane's emissions were 261 W/m2 and Sydney's were 256 W/m(2). Adelaide had the lowest emissions, with a daily average of 39 W/m(2) in the city centre. Emissions varied within and among the four cities and decreased rapidly with distance from the city centre, to < 5 W/m(2) at 20 km from the city in Brisbane, and 15 km in Adelaide. The highest emissions were found in the city centres during working hours. The peak emissions reached in the centre of Melbourne are similar to the peak emissions in London and Tokyo, where anthropogenic heat is a large component of the urban heat island. This indicates that anthropogenic heat could be an important contributor to the urban heat island in Australian capital cities, and needs to be considered in climate adaptation studies. This is an important problem because climate change, combined with an ageing population and urban growth, could double the deaths from heatwaves in Australian cities over the next 40 years.","[Chapman, S.; Watson, J.

The development and use hybrid crops with greater productivity and tolerance to climate shocks is one of the approaches to climate adaptation and agricultural intensification. Since hybrid crops are more expensive for the producer, risk management is of paramount importance. Here, we pose that there is high potential for the Colombian maize sector to use crop -specific climate services for risk reduction. We used the CERES-Maize crop model connected to seasonal climate forecasts developed via Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) across key maize growing areas in Colombia to assess the performance of a maize-specific agroclimatic forecast to inform two key decisions, namely, the choice of sowing dates and genotypes. We find that the agroclimatic models perform well at discriminating yield categories (above, below, and normal) with discrimination capacity of up to 70-80 % for the 'below normal' and 'above + below normal' categories. Consistent with this, agroclimatic forecasts typically predict the optimal planting date with an error of 3 pentads or less. They also predict the optimal choice of genotype correctly around 50-70 % of the time depending on the site or season of interest. Notably, we identify specific cases in which the agroclimatic forecast is misleading but argue that the overall value of the forecasts outweighs these cases. Future work should focus on expanding the scope of the agroclimatic prediction to include other relevant farming decisions that are influenced by climate, and on the improvement of climate forecast performance.","[Ordonez, Leonardo; Vallejo, Eliana; Amariles, Daniel; Mesa, Jeison; Esquivel, Alejandra; Llanos-Herrera, Lizeth; Prager, Steven D.; Rojas, Diana Carolina] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17 Recta Cali-Palmira, Cali 763537, Colombia; [Segura, Cristian; Valencia, Jhon Jairo; Duarte, Carmen Julio] Federac Nacl Cereales & Leguminosas, Cota, Cundinamarca, Colombia; [Obando, Diego] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Tegucigalpa, Honduras; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Biovers Int, Via San Domenico 1, Rome, Italy; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] Wageningen Univ & Res, Plant Prod Syst Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Biovers Int, Via San Domenico 1, Rome, Italy",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Alliance; Bioversity International; Wageningen University & Research; Alliance; Bioversity International; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Ramirez-Villegas, J (corresponding author), CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Biovers Int, Via San Domenico 1, Rome, Italy.;Ramirez-Villegas, J (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Plant Prod Syst Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Ramirez-Villegas, J (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Biovers Int, Via San Domenico 1, Rome, Italy.",j.r.villegas@cgiar.org,,,"Climate Services for Resilient Development (CSRD)-United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Award [AID-BFS-G-11-00002-10, MTO 069018]; Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), under the project Agroclimas [G135]; CGIAR Trust Fund; AgriLAC Resiliente One CGIAR Initiative [G206]; National Cereals and Legumes Federation (FENALCE)","Climate Services for Resilient Development (CSRD)-United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Award(CGIAR); Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), under the project Agroclimas; CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR); AgriLAC Resiliente One CGIAR Initiative; National Cereals and Legumes Federation (FENALCE)","This work was carried out under the Climate Services for Resilient Development (CSRD)-United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Award#: AID-BFS-G-11-00002-10 towards the CGIAR Fund (MTO 069018).

More recently, as concern has risen about the potential impacts of climate variability and change on human mobility, development cooperation actors have begun to design projects that intentionally address the drivers of migration, including climate impacts on livelihoods. However, to date, we know little about the development cooperation's role and function in responding to climate related mobility and migration. As such, the main aim of this paper is to outline the policy frameworks and approaches shaping development cooperation actors' engagement and to identify areas for further exploration and investment. First, we frame the concept of climate mobility and migration and discuss some applicable policy frameworks that govern the issue from various perspectives; secondly, we review the toolbox of approaches that development cooperation actors bring to climate mobility; and third, we discuss the implications of the current Covid-19 pandemic and identify avenues for the way forward. We conclude that ensuring safe and orderly mobility and the decent reception and long-term inclusion of migrants and displaced persons under conditions of more severe climate hazards, and in the context of rising nationalism and xenophobia, poses significant challenges. Integrated approaches across multiple policy sectors and levels of governance are needed. In addition to resources, development cooperation actors can bring data to help empower the most affected communities and regions and leverage their convening power to foster more coordinated approaches within and across countries.","[Stojanov, Robert] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Rosengaertner, Sarah] Zolberg Inst Migrat & Mobil, New Sch, New York, NY USA; [de Sherbinin, Alex] Columbia Univ, Ctr Int Earth Sci Informat Network CIESIN, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Nawrotzki, Raphael] German Inst Dev Evaluat Deval, Bonn, Germany",Mendel University in Brno; The New School; Columbia University,"Stojanov, R (corresponding author), Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",stojanov@centrum.cz; roses480@newschool.edu; adesherbinin@ciesin.columbia.edu; r.nawrotzki@gmail.com,"Stojanov, Robert/F-4280-2012","Stojanov, Robert/0000-0002-0471-7055; de Sherbinin, Alex/0000-0002-8875-4864; Nawrotzki, Raphael/0000-0002-1671-3676",German Institute for Development Evaluation (DEval); Columbia Climate School; Earth Institute for the Climate Mobility Network,German Institute for Development Evaluation (DEval); Columbia Climate School; Earth Institute for the Climate Mobility Network,This work is based on a report supported by the German Institute for Development Evaluation (DEval) as part of a larger evaluation of climate change adaptation measures.

This study provides evidence about mortality attributable to non-optimal temperatures in adults aged 65 and over in Sofia, Bulgaria, between 2000 and 2017. We quantified the relationship between the daily mean temperature and mortality in the total elderly adult population aged 65 and over, among males and females aged 65 and over, as well as individuals aged 65-84 and 85 years or older. We used a distributed lag non-linear model with a 25-day lag to fully capture the effects of both cold and hot temperatures and calculated the fractions of mortality attributable to mild and extreme hot and cold temperatures. Cold temperatures had a greater impact on mortality than hot temperatures during the studied period. Most of the temperature-attributable mortality was due to moderate cold, followed by moderate heat, extreme cold, and extreme heat. The total mortality attributable to non-optimal temperatures was greater among females compared to males and among individuals aged 85 and over compared to those aged 65 to 84. The findings of this study can serve as a foundation for future research and policy development aimed at characterizing and reducing the risks from temperature exposures among vulnerable populations in the country, climate adaptation planning and improved public health preparedness, and response to non-optimal temperatures.","[Petkova, Elisaveta P.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY USA; [Dimitrova, Lyudmila K.] Prof Asen Zlatarov Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, Burgas, Bulgaria; [Sera, Francesco; Gasparrini, Antonio] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth Environm & Soc, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Gasparrini, Antonio] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Stat Methodol, London, England; [Gasparrini, Antonio] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Climate Change & Planetary Hlth, London, England",Columbia University; University of Burgas; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Petkova, EP (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY USA.",elisaveta.petkova@columbia.edu,"Gasparrini, Antonio/F-7627-2012","Gasparrini, Antonio/0000-0002-2271-3568; Petkova, Elisaveta/0000-0003-3620-3232; Dimitrova, Lyudmila/0000-0001-7006-8156",Frontiers of Science Program at Columbia University; Medical Research Council-UK [MR/M022625/1]; Natural Environment Research Council UK [NE/R009384/1]; European Union [820655]; MRC [MR/R013349/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/R009384/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Frontiers of Science Program at Columbia University; Medical Research Council-UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Natural Environment Research Council UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Union(European Commission); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This study was partially funded by the Frontiers of Science Program at Columbia University.

However, the specific correlation has not been sufficiently studied. To systematically clarify the correlation between the spatial configuration and the cooling effect of green areas, 25 idealized scenarios are designed and simulated using the microclimate model ENVI-met. These 25 scenarios represent green areas with five different spatial configurations (integrated green area, sparse dotted green areas, dense dotted green areas, belt-shaped green areas parallel to wind direction, and belt-shaped green areas vertical to wind direction) and five vegetation types (trees with big canopies, trees with small canopies, hedges and shrubs, 50 cm grass, and 10 cm grass). The human thermal comfort of each scenario is evaluated by means of physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) using Rayman. The results reveal the influence of the fragmentation degree (quantified by the patch density and edge density), shape complexity (quantified by the land shape index), orientation of green belt, and vegetation type on the cooling effect of a green area. The spatial configuration and the vegetation type of green areas were found jointly affecting the efficiency of the green areas' cooling effect. The highest cooling effect appears at 2 pm, reaching 6.3 K in the scenario of belt-shaped green areas parallel to the wind direction and with big canopy trees. The conclusions of this paper can provide suggestions for the climate-adaptive design and planning of urban green areas in the future.","[Sodoudi, Sahar; Zhang, Huiwen; Chi, Xiaoli; Mueller, Felix; Li, Huidong] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Carl Heinrich Becker Weg 6-10, D-12165 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Sodoudi, S (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Carl Heinrich Becker Weg 6-10, D-12165 Berlin, Germany.",sodoudi@zedat.fu-berlin.de; zhanghuiwen@zedat.fu-berlin.de; xiaoli@zedat.fu-berlin.de; mueller.f@fu-berlin.de; huidong.li@met.fu-berlin.de,"zhang, hui/GXH-6098-2022; Zhang, Hui/HHN-8494-2022; Zhang, Hw/HPD-4999-2023; Li, Huidong/AAT-9574-2020",,German Ministry of Research and Education [FKZ01LP1602 A]; Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Science (BBAW); China Scholarship Council (CSC),German Ministry of Research and Education(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Science (BBAW); China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),"This study contributes to the research program Urban Climate Under Change ([UC]<SUP>2</SUP>), funded by the German Ministry of Research and Education (FKZ01LP1602 A).

Climate services need to integrate standard weather forecasts, with early warning systems, seasonal forecasts, and long-term projections of climatic changes in order to meet the information needs of the sector. While a growing number of studies address the potential climate change impacts on tourism, little is known about how the tourism sector accesses, uses, and analyses the available weather and climate information. This research presents findings from an exploratory study on weather and climate information-seeking behavior of 15 private and public tourism sector stakeholders in the Republic of Fiji. The results show a variety of weather and climate information-seeking paths in use, which differ depending on levels of professional responsibility, weather and climate literacy, and information and digital competency. Those with high weather information literacy access a broader variety of sources. Hence, their interpretation does not focus only on their own location, but weather'' is seen as a broad spatial phenomenon that might or might not result in adverse effects in their location. Understanding diverse weather and climate information-seeking paths can aid in better targeting climate and adaptation services across different stakeholder groups. Especially in the context of small island developing states (SIDS), the integration of traditional, local, and scientific knowledge as information sources is likely to provide a more useful and context-specific basis for climate adaptation planning within the sector.","[Nalau, J.; Mackey, B.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Southport, Qld, Australia; [Nalau, J.; Becken, S.; Noakes, S.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Inst Tourism, Southport, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Southport, Qld, Australia.;Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Inst Tourism, Southport, Qld, Australia.",j.nalau@griffith.edu.au,"Nalau, Johanna/V-5692-2018; Becken, Susanne/AFK-2875-2022; Mackey, Brendan/ABE-3805-2020","Nalau, Johanna/0000-0001-6581-3967; Becken, Susanne/0000-0002-3348-2750; Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064",,,,,82,18,20,2,77,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",1948-8327,1948-8335,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

In California, where a major drought currently demonstrates some of the hardships that could be regularly encountered under a changing climate, we present results from a survey of drinking water utilities about the perceived threat, analytic capacity, and adaptation actions related to maintaining water quality in the face of climate change. Among surveyed utilities (n = 259), awareness is high in regard to climate change occurring and its potential impacts on water quality globally, but perceived risk is lower with regard to climate impacts on local drinking water quality. Just over half of surveyed utilities report at least some adaptation activity to date. The top three variables that most strongly correlated with reported adaptation action were (1) perceived risk on global and local water quality, (2) surface water reliance, and (3) provision of other services beyond drinking water. Other tested variables significantly correlated with reported adaptation action were (4) degree of impact from the current drought and (5) communication with climate change experts. Findings highlight that smaller groundwater-reliant utilities may need the most assistance to initiate climate adaptation processes. Trusted information sources most frequently used across respondents were state government agencies, followed by colleagues in the same utilities. The finding that frequently used sources of information are similar across utilities presents a promising opportunity for training and disseminating climate information to assist those systems needing the most support.","[Ekstrom, Julia A.; Bedsworth, Louise; Fencl, Amanda] Univ Calif Davis, Policy Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Ekstrom, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Policy Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jaekstrom@gmail.com,"Fencl, Amanda/AAV-9760-2020; Fencl, Amanda/Z-1274-2018","Fencl, Amanda/0000-0002-1914-0930; Ekstrom, Julia/0000-0003-1060-5276",USEPA [83519401],USEPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"This study was funded by USEPA grant number 83519401.

Reviving and supporting that sector is instrumental in creating value for rural communities to build sustainable livelihoods and safeguard climate-adapted value chains (VCs). The paper aims to describe the dairy goat VC in the Shouf and West Bekaa (WB) areas of Lebanon, which are traditionally popular for caprine production. Design/methodology/approach A socio-economic approach was employed to determine the perceived challenges, opportunities and context of goat farmers and dairy processor in the Shouf and WB casas as case studies, using the Heifer International's toolkit for goat value chains. Questionnaires were developed for the five actors of the VC: farmer, milk collector, processor, retailer and consumer. The data were analyzed quantitatively, using simple statistical analysis, and qualitatively through observation, gathering, coding and thematically organizing the responses. Findings In the Shouf, the chain is shorter, consisting of a farmer, processor and consumer, while in the WB the VC includes a milk collector and larger dairy factories. The value is unequally and unfairly distributed among the actors putting the small-scale farmers and processors in subordinate positions. In terms of enabling environment, the role of the state, authorities and organizations remains minimal in supporting the sector. The challenges facing this sector are economic, regulatory, operational, social and hygienic as perceived by the participants. Research limitations/implications The economic, political and social instability of the country hinders the performance of the sector. Originality/value Limited research is available on the small ruminants' VC in Lebanon, addressing the socio-economic status of goat farmers and opportunities available in the sector. On the other hand, the demand for traditional dairy products is increasing amid rising concerns related to intensive livestock systems and negative association of livestock systems with climate change. Accordingly, basic assessment and research on the existing small ruminant dairy chains is important as a first step for the sustainable development of the sector.","[Khairallah, Lamisse; Hamadeh, Shady K.] Amer Univ Beirut, Environm & Sustainable Dev Unit, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Beirut, Lebanon; [Chedid, Mabelle] Livestock Sustainabil, Montpellier, France; [Jaber, Lina] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Agr, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Beirut, Lebanon; [Martiniello, Giuliano] Univ Int Rabat, Coll Law & Polit & Social Sci, Sale, Morocco; [Martiniello, Giuliano] Amer Univ Beirut, Fac Food & Agr Sci, Beirut, Lebanon",American University of Beirut; American University of Beirut; Universite Internationale de Rabat; American University of Beirut,"Chedid, M (corresponding author), Livestock Sustainabil, Montpellier, France.",lamisse.kh@gmail.com; mabelle.chedid@gmail.com; lj01@aub.edu.lb; giuliano.martiniello@uir.ac.ma; shamadeh@aub.edu.lb,,"Khairallah, Lamisse/0000-0002-5017-2674",American University of Beirut Research Board [103601],American University of Beirut Research Board,The authors are thankful to the American University of Beirut Research Board (award number: 103601) for funding this project.,,41,0,0,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2044-0839,2044-0847,,J AGRIBUS DEV EMERG,J.

This paper discusses the main problems, opportunities, and challenges that can be solved by the participation of geosciences in carbon neutrality, as well as China's response to them. The main scientific problems involved and the geological work carried out mainly fall into three categories: (1) Carbon emission reduction technology (natural gas hydrate, geothermal, hot dry rock, nuclear energy, hydropower, wind energy, solar energy, hydrogen energy); (2) carbon sequestration technology (carbon capture and storage, underground space utilization); (3) key minerals needed to support carbon neutralization (raw materials for energy transformation, carbon reduction technology). Therefore, geosciences and geological technologies are needed: First, actively participate in the development of green energy such as natural gas, geothermal energy, hydropower, hot dry rock, and key energy minerals, and develop exploration and exploitation technologies such as geothermal energy and natural gas; the second is to do a good job in geological support for new energy site selection, carry out an in-depth study on geotechnical feasibility and mitigation measures, and form the basis of relevant economic decisions to reduce costs and prevent geological disasters; the third is to develop and coordinate relevant departments of geosciences, organize and carry out strategic research on natural resources, carry out theoretical system research on global climate change and other issues under the guidance of earth system science theory, and coordinate frontier scientific information and advanced technological tools of various disciplines. The goal of carbon neutrality provides new opportunities and challenges for geosciences research. In the future, it is necessary to provide theoretical and technical support from various aspects, enhance the ability of climate adaptation, and support the realization of the goal of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality.

In this study, the transient response of a climate or environmental variable per trillion tonnes of CO2 emissions, termed TRE, is quantified for a set of impact-relevant climate variables and from a large set of multi-forcing scenarios extended to year 2300 towards stabilization. An similar to 1000-member ensemble of the Bern3D-LPJ carbon-climate model is applied and model outcomes are constrained by 26 physical and biogeochemical observational data sets in a Bayesian, Monte Carlo-type framework. Uncertainties in TRE estimates include both scenario uncertainty and model response uncertainty. Cumulative fossil emissions of 1000 Gt C result in a global mean surface air temperature change of 1.9 degrees C (68% confidence interval (c.i.): 1.3 to 2.7 degrees C), a decrease in surface ocean pH of 0.19 (0.18 to 0.22), and a steric sea level rise of 20 cm (13 to 27 cm until 2300). Linearity between cumulative emissions and transient response is high for pH and reasonably high for surface air and sea surface temperatures, but less pronounced for changes in Atlantic meridional overturning, Southern Ocean and tropical surface water saturation with respect to biogenic structures of calcium carbonate, and carbon stocks in soils. The constrained model ensemble is also applied to determine the response to a pulse-like emission and in idealized CO2-only simulations. The transient climate response is constrained, primarily by long-term ocean heat observations, to 1.7 degrees C (68% c.i.: 1.3 to 2.2 degrees C) and the equilibrium climate sensitivity to 2.9 degrees C (2.0 to 4.2 degrees C). This is consistent with results by CMIP5 models but inconsistent with recent studies that relied on short-term air temperature data affected by natural climate variability.","[Steinacher, M.; Joos, F.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Climate & Environm Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Steinacher, M.; Joos, F.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Bern,"Steinacher, M (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Climate & Environm Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.;Steinacher, M (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",steinacher@climate.unibe.ch,"Joos, Fortunat/B-4118-2018; Steinacher, Marco/J-1527-2012","Joos, Fortunat/0000-0002-9483-6030; Steinacher, Marco/0000-0002-4795-1749",Swiss National Science Foundation; European Project CARBOCHANGE - European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme [264879]; International Space Science Institute (ISSI),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); European Project CARBOCHANGE - European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme; International Space Science Institute (ISSI),"This study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the European Project CARBOCHANGE (264879), which received funding from the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/20072013).

The OpenMI modelling interface is used to couple a comprehensive hydrological modelling system, MIKE SHE running on personal computers, and a regional climate modelling system, HIRHAM running on a high performance computing platform. The coupled model enables two-way interaction between the atmosphere and the groundwater via the land surface and can represent the lateral movement of water in both the surface and subsurface and their interactions, not normally accounted for in climate models. Meso-scale processes are important for climate in general and rainfall in particular. Hydrological impacts are assessed at the catchment scale, the most important scale for water management. Feedback between groundwater, the land surface and the atmosphere occurs across a range of scales. Recognising this, the coupling was developed to allow dynamic exchange of water and energy at the catchment scale embedded within a larger meso-scale modelling domain. We present the coupling methodology used and describe the challenges in representing the exchanges between models and across scales. The coupled model is applied to one-way and two-way coupled simulations for a managed groundwater-dominated catchment, the Skjern River, Denmark. These coupled model simulations are evaluated against field observations and then compared with uncoupled climate and hydrological model simulations. Exploratory simulations show significant differences, particularly in the summer for precipitation and evapotranspiration the coupled model including groundwater and the RCM where groundwater is neglected. However, the resulting differences in the net precipitation and the catchment runoff in this groundwater dominated catchment were small. The need for further decadal scale simulations to understand the differences and insensitivity is highlighted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a temperature range within which the pollen fertility alteration of PGMS is regulated by photoperiod, being sterile at long days and fertile at short days. The critical values of day length and temperature vary as the PGMS gene(s) is (are) transferred into different genic backgrounds. According to the temperature reactions in response to fertility alterations, the current sterile lines fall into four photothermal types. The climatic adaptation of these is different. Lines of the high-low (a high critical fertile temperature with a low critical sterile temperature point) group have both stable sterile and fertile periods in the low-altitude subtropical rice-growing areas, which are the major rice-production areas df the world. We could exploit them in hybrid rice production there by a two-line method, because there is no need for both male-sterile and maintainer lines. At high altitudes of the subtropical and tropical rice-growing areas, lines of this group are unstable in their sterility. The low-low group is stable in sterility in long-day conditions at all temperatures, and at high temperatures despite day length. They could be used for hybrid seed production from the tropical through to temperate rice-growing conditions. However, their pollen fertility, and hence, seed multiplication, is easily lost in short days if high temperatures occur. The high-high group of sterile lines can be conveniently multiplied in short days, but their sterility is not stable in long days if temperature decreases in the critical fertility alteration period. The low-high group is stable at higher temperature irrespective of photoperiod, and this could be used in the tropics, but their sterilities are not stable in long days if lower temperatures are encountered. Their multiplication in short-day conditions may also be affected by high temperature.","HUAZHONG AGR UNIV, DEPT AGRON, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",Huazhong Agricultural University,,,"Zeng, Hanlai/Q-5719-2019","Zhang, Ziguo/0000-0002-7268-9631",,,,,37,4,9,0,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-4290,1872-6852,,FIELD CROP RES,Field Crop.

Therefore, it is urgent to assess these risks and plan adaptation strategies for historic buildings. These activities must be based on a strong knowledge of the main building categories. Moreover, before adapting a historic building to future climate, it is necessary to understand how the past climate influenced its design, construction, and eventual categories. This knowledge will help when estimating the implication of climate change on historic buildings. This study aims at identifying building categories, which will be the basis for further risk assessment and adaptation plans, while at the same time analyzing the historical interaction between climate and human dwelling. The results show some correlations between building categories and climate. Therefore, it is necessary to use different archetypes to represent the typical buildings in different climate zones. Moreover, these correlations imply a need to investigate the capability of the climate-responsive features in future climate scenarios and to explore possible further risks and adaptation strategies.","[Hao, Lingjun; Del Pero, Claudio] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Hao, Lingjun; Herrera-Avellanosa, Daniel; Troi, Alexandra] Eurac Res, Inst Renewable Energy, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano,"Hao, LJ (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.;Hao, LJ (corresponding author), Eurac Res, Inst Renewable Energy, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",Lingjun.Hao@polimi.it; Daniel.Herrera@eurac.edu; Claudio.delPero@polimi.it; Alexandra.Troi@eurac.edu,"Troi, Alexandra/GNP-7146-2022","hao, lingjun/0000-0002-1036-9085; Del Pero, Claudio/0000-0003-4205-2805; Herrera-Avellanosa, Daniel/0000-0002-9661-8387",Thematic Scholarship Energy Retrofit of Historic Buildings [32b-T4]; Politecnico di Milano,Thematic Scholarship Energy Retrofit of Historic Buildings; Politecnico di Milano,"This research was funded by Thematic Scholarship Energy Retrofit of Historic Buildings, grant number 32b-T4 and The APC was funded by Politecnico di Milano.",,57,5,5,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,DEC,2019,7,12,,,,,,,139,10.3390/cli7120139,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7120139,,,23,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,KA1JX,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000505556200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Only 600 urban areas with just 20 % of the world population generate 60 % of the GWP. Rapid urbanization, climate change, inadequate maintenance of water and wastewater infrastructures and poor solid waste management may lead to flooding, water scarcity, water pollution, adverse health effects and rehabilitation costs that may overwhelm the resilience of cities. These megatrends pose urgent challenges in cities as the cost of inaction is high. We present an overview about population growth, urbanization, water, waste, climate change, water governance and transitions. Against this background, we discuss the categorization of cities based on our baseline assessments, i.e. our City Blueprint research on 45 municipalities and regions predominantly in Europe. With this bias towards Europe in mind, the challenges can be discussed globally by clustering cities into distinct categories of sustainability and by providing additional data and information from global regions. We distinguish five categories of sustainability: (1) cities lacking basic water services, (2) wasteful cities, (3) water-efficient cities, (4) resource-efficient and adaptive cities and (5) water-wise cities. Many cities in Western Europe belong to categories 3 and 4. Some cities in Eastern Europe and the few cities we have assessed in Latin America, Asia and Africa can be categorized as cities lacking basic water services. Lack of water infrastructures or obsolete infrastructures, solid waste management and climate adaptation are priorities. It is concluded that cities require a long-term framing of their sectoral challenges into a proactive and coherent Urban Agenda to maximize the co-benefits of adaptation and to minimize the cost. Furthermore, regional platforms of cities are needed to enhance city-to-city learning and to improve governance capacities necessary to accelerate effective and efficient transitions towards water-wise cities. These learning alliances are needed as the time window to solve the global water governance crisis is narrow and rapidly closing. The water sector can play an important role but needs to reframe and refocus radically.","[Koop, S. H. A.; van Leeuwen, C.

The amplitude of the fluctuations may affect the copepods' ability to respond to climate change. The environment in coastal areas is naturally fluctuating and the effects of ocean acidification are difficult to predict. Negative effects on copepods may affect the whole food web as they are the most abundant zooplankton, constituting a major part of the diet of fish. In this study, we determined the vertical profiles of an array of environmental variables and the vertical distribution of common copepods in a shallow coastal area of the Baltic Sea. We sampled once a month, in June, July and August, every sixth hour during 24 h. We found that copepods experience a change in pH of more than 0.5 units and 5 degrees C change in temperature during migration. Thus, on diurnal time scales copepods experience a range in their physicochemical environment that is equal to or larger than the predicted climate change scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the climatology of SCWs is therefore important for planning and risk management. An archive of observed SCWs is used to examine a diverse set of diagnostics for indicating SCW environments based on reanalysis data. These diagnostics are then applied to climate model data to examine projections of future climate change for Australia. A diagnostic based on logistic regression is found to provide a better representation of observed SCW occurrences than other diagnostics. Projections for the future based on that diagnostic indicate increases and decreases between -16% and 34% in the occurrence frequency of regionally averaged SCW environments, based on the 10th and 90th percentile estimates of annual mean changes from a 12-member ensemble of global climate models. Projections based on other severe weather diagnostics indicate a wider range of future changes, including increases and decreases of up to 50% in magnitude, with regional and seasonal variations through Australia. Changes in the frequency of SCW environments appears to be largely driven by increased low level moisture concentrations which can lead to increased convective available potential energy, countered in some cases by a stabilization of the mid-troposphere temperature lapse rate. These results represent the most comprehensive estimate to date for constraining the range of uncertainty in projected future changes in convective environments for Australia, including severe thunderstorms and associated SCWs, noting that this has significant implications for risk management and climate adaptation purposes.","[Brown, Andrew; Dowdy, Andrew] Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Bureau of Meteorology - Australia,"Brown, A (corresponding author), Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",andrew.brown@bom.gov.au,,"Brown, Andrew/0000-0001-7354-295X",Energy Sector Climate Information (ESCI) project of the Australian Government; ESCC Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program (NESP),Energy Sector Climate Information (ESCI) project of the Australian Government; ESCC Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program (NESP),This work was supported by the Energy Sector Climate Information (ESCI) project of the Australian Government and the ESCC Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program (NESP).

Their implementation requires appropriate investment decisions by policy makers that are relevant for current as well as future scenarios of agro-ecology, climate and economic development. Decision support tools are therefore needed to assist different stakeholders to prioritize and hence implement appropriate strategic interventions. These interventions transform agriculture ecosystems to climate-resilient, adaptive and efficient. This paper outlines the mathematical modelling framework of one such, the Climate Smart Agricultural Prioritization (CSAP) toolkit. This toolkit employs a dynamic, spatially-explicit multi-objective optimization model to explore a range of agricultural growth pathways coupled with climate-adaptation strategies to meet agricultural development and environmental goals. The toolkit consists of three major components: (i) land evaluation including assessment of resource availability, land suitability, yield and input-output estimation for all promising crop production practices and technologies for key agro-ecological units; (ii) formulation of scenarios based on policy views and development plans; and (iii) land-use optimization in the form of linear programming models. Climate change and socio-economic drivers condition the land evaluation, technological input-output relations, and specification of optimization objectives that define modelled scenarios. By integrating detailed bottom-up biophysical, climate impact and agricultural-emissions models, CSAP is capable of supporting multi-objective analysis of agricultural production goals in relation to food self-sufficiency, incomes, employment and mitigation targets, thus supporting a wide range of analyses ranging from food security assessment to environmental impact assessment to preparation of climate smart development plans.","[Dunnett, A.] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, New Delhi 110012, India; [Shirsath, P.

In this study, we explore how water and resource managers' scales of decision-making and scope of decision responsibilities influence climate information use in two Great Lakes watersheds. We find that despite availability of tailored climate information, actual use of information remains low. Reasons include (a) lack of willingness to place climate on agendas because local managers perceive climate change as politically risky, (b) lack of formal mandate or authority at the city and county scale to translate climate information into on-the-ground action, (c) problems with the information itself, and (d) perceived lack of demand for climate information by those managers who have the mandate and authority to use (or help others use) climate information. Our findings suggest that (1) scientists and information brokers should produce information that meets a range of decision needs and reserve intensive tailoring efforts for decision makers who have willingness and authority to use climate information; (2) without support from higher levels of decision-making (e.g., state), it is unlikely that climate information use will accelerate significantly; and (3) the trend towards characterizing climate specific actions within a broader concept of sustainability practices, or adaptation by stealth, should be supported as a component of the climate adaptation repertoire.","[Rasmussen, Laura Vang; Lemos, Maria Carmen] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kirchhoff, Christine J.] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Connecticut,"Rasmussen, LV (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",laura_vang@yahoo.dk,,"Lemos, Maria Carmen/0000-0001-6686-730X; Kirchhoff, Christine/0000-0002-2686-6764; Rasmussen, Laura Vang/0000-0001-7786-6783",,,,,47,15,15,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Understanding its relationships with impact factors is important to provide useful information for climate adaptation urban planning strategies. For this purpose, the geographically-weighted regression (GWR) approach is used to explore the scale effects in a mountainous city, namely the change laws and characteristics of the relationships between land surface temperature and impact factors at different spatial resolutions (30-960 m). The impact factors include the Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Index-based Built-up Index (IBI), and the Soil Brightness Index (NDSI), which indicate the coverage of the vegetation, built-up, and bare land, respectively. For reference, the ordinary least squares (OLS) model, a global regression technique, is also employed by using the same dependent variable and explanatory variables as in the GWR model. Results from the experiment exemplified by Chongqing showed that the GWR approach had a better prediction accuracy and a better ability to describe spatial non-stationarity than the OLS approach judged by the analysis of the local coefficient of determination (R-2), Corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), and F-test at small spatial resolution (< 240 m); however, when the spatial scale was increased to 480 m, this advantage has become relatively weak. This indicates that the GWR model becomes increasingly global, revealing the relationships with more generalized geographical patterns, and then spatial non-stationarity in the relationship will tend to be neglected with the increase of spatial resolution.","[Luo, Xiaobo; Peng, Yidong] Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Inst Comp Sci & Technol, 2 Chongwen Rd, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiaobo] Chongqing Inst Meteorol Sci, Chongqing 401147, Peoples R China",Chongqing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Luo, XB (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Inst Comp Sci & Technol, 2 Chongwen Rd, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China.;Luo, XB (corresponding author), Chongqing Inst Meteorol Sci, Chongqing 401147, Peoples R China.",luoxb@cqupt.edu.cn; eadonlife@yahoo.com,,,Program for National Natural Science Foundation of China [61272195]; Scientific and Technological Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission [KJ120517],Program for National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific and Technological Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission,"This work is supported by the Program for National Natural Science Foundation of China (61272195) and the Scientific and Technological Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (KJ120517).

Progress in understanding the impact of climate change on crop yield is essential for agricultural climate adaptation, especially for the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain (3H Plain) of China which is an area known to be vulnerable to global warming. In this study, the impacts of climate change on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield between the baseline period (1981-2010) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5) were simulated for the short-term (2010-2039), the medium-term (2040-2069) and the long-term (2070-2099) in the 3H Plain, by considering the relative contributions of changes in temperature, solar radiation and precipitation using the DSSAT-CERES-Wheat model. Results indicated that the maximum and minimum temperatures (TMAX and TMIN), solar radiation (SRAD), and precipitation (PREP) during the winter wheat season increased under these two RCPs. Yield analysis found that wheat yield increased with the increase in SRAD, PREP and CO 2 concentration, but decreased with an increase in temperature. Increasing precipitation contributes the most to the total impact, increasing wheat yield by 9.53, 6.62 and 23.73% for the three terms of future climate under RCP4.5 scenario, and 11.74, 16.38 and 27.78% for the three terms of future climate under RCP8.5 scenario. However, as increases in temperature bring higher evapotranspiration, which further aggravated water deficits, the supposed negative effect of increasing thermal resources decreased wheat yield by 1.92, 4.08 and 5.24% for the three terms of future climate under RCP4.5 scenario, and 3.64, 5.87 and 5.81% for the three terms of future climate under RCP8.5 scenario with clearly larger decreases in RCP8.5. Counterintuitively, the impacts in southern sub-regions were positive, but they were all negative in the remaining sub-regions. Our analysis demonstrated that in the 3H Plain, which is a part of the mid-high latitude region, the effects of increasing thermal resources were counteracted by the aggravated water deficits caused by the increase in temperature.","[Qu Chun-hong] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Informat Inst, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Li Xiang-xiang] Agrometeorol Ctr Jiangxi Prov, Nanchang 330096, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Li Xiang-xiang] Meteorol Sci Inst Jiangxi Prov, Nanchang 330096, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Ju Hui; Liu Qin] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Agriculture Information Institute, CAAS; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development in Agriculture, CAAS","Liu, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",quchunhong@caas.cn; lixiangxiang0901@163.com; liuqin02@caas.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41401510, 41675115]; Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (2017-2020)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (2017-2020),This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41401510 and 41675115) and the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (2017-2020).,,40,29,30,7,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2095-3119,,,J INTEGR AGR,J.

However, next to scenarios about the future climate, scenarios about future vulnerability are essential, since also changing societal conditions fundamentally determine adaptation needs. At the international and national level, first initiatives for developing vulnerability scenarios and so-called shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) have been undertaken. Most of these scenarios, however, do not provide sufficient information for local scenarios and local climate risk management. There is an urgent need to develop scenarios for vulnerability at the local scale in order to complement climate change scenarios. Heat stress is seen as a key challenge in cities in the context of climate change and further urban growth. Based on the research project ZURES (ZURES 2020 website), the paper presents a new method for human vulnerability scenarios to heat stress at the very local scale for growing medium-sized cities. In contrast to global models that outline future scenarios mostly with a country-level resolution, we show a new method on how to develop spatially specific scenario information for different districts within cities, starting from the planned urban development and expansion. The method provides a new opportunity to explore how different urban development strategies and housing policies influence future human exposure and vulnerability. Opportunities and constraints of the approach are revealed. Finally, we discuss how these scenarios can inform future urban development and risk management strategies and how these could complement more global or national approaches.","[Birkmann, Joern; Sauter, Holger; Goettsche, Franziska; Laranjeira, Kevin] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning IREUS, Stuttgart, Germany; [Garschagen, Matthias] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany; [Fleischhauer, Mark; Puntub, Wiriya] TU Dortmund Univ, Inst Spatial Planning IRPUD, Dortmund, Germany; [Klose, Charlotte; Burkhardt, Albrecht; Mueller, Julia] Dept Energy Environm & Mobil, City Of Ludwigsburg, Germany; [Klose, Charlotte; Burkhardt, Albrecht; Mueller, Julia] Dept Stat & Social Data, City Of Ludwigsburg, Germany; [Bueter, Bjoern] GEO Net, Hannover, Germany",University of Stuttgart; University of Munich; Dortmund University of Technology,"Birkmann, J (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning IREUS, Stuttgart, Germany.",joern.birkmann@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de,"Birkmann, Joern jb/J-5736-2015","Sauter, Holger/0000-0001-7356-2790; Puntub, Wiriya/0000-0003-4309-1486",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,48,5,5,4,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The risk varies based on the adaptation capacity of the exposed population which can be driven by climatic and/or non-climatic factors subject to fluctuations over time. We investigated temporal changes in the exposure-response relationship between daily mean temperature and mortality by cause of death, sex, age, and ethnicity in the megacity of Sao Paulo, Brazil (2000-2018). We fitted a quasi-Poisson regression model with time-varying distributed-lag non-linear model (tv-DLNM) to obtain annual estimates. We used two indicators of adaptation: trends in the annual minimum mortality temperature (MMT), i.e., temperature at which the mortality rate is the lowest, and in the cumulative relative risk (cRR) associated with extreme cold and heat. Finally, we evaluated their association with annual mean temperature and annual extreme cold and heat, respectively to assess the role of climatic and non-climatic drivers. In total, we investigated 4,471,000 deaths from non-external causes. We found significant temporal trends for both the MMT and cRR indicators. The former was decoupled from changes in AMT, whereas the latter showed some degree of alignment with extreme heat and cold, suggesting the role of both climatic and non-climatic adaptation drivers. Finally, changes in MMT and cRR varied substantially by sex, age, and ethnicity, exposing disparities in the adaptation capacity of these population groups. Our findings support the need for group-specific interventions and regular monitoring of the health risk to non-optimal temperatures to inform urban public health policies.","[Roca-Barcelo, Aina; Fecht, Daniela; Pirani, Monica; Piel, Frederic B.; Vineis, Paolo] Imperial Coll London, MRC Ctr Environm & Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England; [Fecht, Daniela] Imperial Coll London, Sch Publ Hlth, Natl Inst Hlth Res Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat,Protect Res Unit Chem &, Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England; [Piel, Frederic B.] Imperial Coll London, Sch Publ Hlth, Natl Inst Hlth Res Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat,Protect Res Unit Environ, Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England; [Nardocci, Adelaide C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Roca-Barcelo, A (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, MRC Ctr Environm & Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England.",a.roca-barcelo@imperial.ac.uk,,"Roca Barcelo, Aina/0000-0002-3681-6517",Imperial College London PhD President Scholarship; MRC Centre for Environment and Health - Medical Research Council [MRC/S019669/1]; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Environmental Exposures and Health,Imperial College London PhD President Scholarship; MRC Centre for Environment and Health - Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Environmental Exposures and Health,"The authors are grateful to Professors Majid Ezzati and Antonio Gasparrini for their input on an earlier version of this work.

Adjustments to maintenance regimes could accommodate marginal changes to degradation rate. However, for significant increases in degradation rate, adaptations may be required. Globally, any new deterioration mechanisms are unlikely. However, in the future previously insignificant problems may start to become significant at a local level, for which there is a lack of local knowledge or experience. Adaptation in the context of existing buildings is a means to further protect the existing fabric, to consolidate performance and control the rate of deterioration. This adaptation goes beyond the scope of enhanced maintenance. For historic buildings, there will be tension between the need to conserve the building and simultaneously adapt in the face of increased climate change driven weathering. Impact studies are needed to identify priorities for adaptation by identifying the scale and impact of degradation-related defects for the future building stock. Such studies need to be integrated with authoritative information on projected future climate. Adaptation of building design is needed to ensure new buildings consider performance in both current and future climates. A whole-life approach to building design is needed. To achieve this building standards, building codes need to be developed which consider future climate design. Traditional vernacular styles may offer an opportunity for learning design lessons and adapting design practices that could help facilitate appropriate climate protection.

To elucidate the physiological basis for climatic adaptation in trees, we have characterized photoperiodic responses in the latitudinal ecotypes of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) exposed to gradually shortening photoperiod under controlled conditions. In all ecotypes, shortening photoperiod triggered growth cessation, cold acclimation and dormancy development, that was accompanied by increases in endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and decreases in indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). There were distinct differences between the ecotypes in the rates and degrees of these responses. The critical photoperiod and the photoperiodic sensitivity for growth cessation varied with latitudinal origin of the ecotype. The northern ecotype had a longer critical photoperiod and a greater photoperiodic sensitivity than the southern ecotype. Compared with the southern ecotypes, the northern ecotype was more responsive to shortening photoperiod, resulting in earlier cold acclimation, dormancy development, increase in ABA content and decrease in IAA content. However, at the termination of the experiment, all the ecotypes had reached approximately the same level of cold hardiness (-12 to -14degreesC), ABA content (2.1-2.3 mug g(-1) FW) and IAA content (17.2-20.3 ng g(-1) FW). In all ecotypes, increase in ABA levels preceded development of bud dormancy and maximum cold hardiness. IAA levels decreased more or less parallel with increasing cold hardiness and dormancy, suggesting a role of IAA in the photoperiodic control of growth, cold acclimation and dormancy development in birch.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Div Genet, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Viikki Bioctr, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; Univ Tromso, Dept Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; Univ Helsinki, Dept Appl Biol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University of Helsinki","Palva, ET (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Div Genet, POB 56, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",tapio.palva@helsinki.fi,"Li, Chunyang/D-6254-2013","Li, Chunyang/0000-0003-2895-2786",,,,,48,105,118,1,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-9317,1399-3054,,PHYSIOL PLANTARUM,Physiol.

Evidence now demonstrates that the shocks resulting from climate risks to agriculture and food security, and related adaptive responses, are highly gender-differentiated. However, agricultural research and development have not delivered the transformative changes needed in small-scale farming from a poverty eradication and gender equality perspective, and particularly to support women adapt to climate risks. A range of responses to climate change, including that referred to as climate smart agriculture (CSA), have been introduced. These strive to enable changes in the ways that issues related to crop and livestock productivity, the climate adaptive capacity of small-scale agriculture, and the carbon footprint of farming are investigated and technologies transferred. However, international agriculture research and development have struggled to find effective ways of integrating gender equality dimensions into the processes and outcomes of agriculture programmes. High level strategic decisions have not prioritized resources for gender equality work resulting in CSA too often being gender blind. Knock-on effects down the research and development strata have meant that some development agencies have taken up a CSA approach without addressing gender inequalities. While others, including some international non-government organizations, are pushing for greater attention to gender equality in agricultural development. Methodological remedies that can enable gender equality to be better addressed through agricultural research and development have been identified from tool-boxes to epistemological change. But without a change in high level prioritization of resources the potential for a climate smart and gender responsive international agriculture research and development remains a task similar to that of Sisyphus(1).","[Anderson, Simon] Int Inst Environm & Dev, Strategy & Learning Grp, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sriram, Vidhya] CARE, Washington, DC USA",,"Anderson, S (corresponding author), Int Inst Environm & Dev, Strategy & Learning Grp, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",simon.anderson@iied.org,,,,,,,59,5,5,3,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

Under extreme weather conditions, it is necessary to manage water effectively. We must not neglect drainage as a water management option for sustainable agricultural production. Specially designed perforated sheet pipe drains have been developed in Japan recently to control the underground water table and to upgrade croplands from lowlands to uplands. As soils with perforated sheet pipes installed could potentially improve soil aeration, and land conversion could also influence soil functions and properties, this study focuses on the importance of soil properties changed around perforated sheet pipes installed at a depth of 40cm in former paddy soils. Using (3x3x2) factorial design with three replications, soils were sampled on farmland in the Japanese towns of Hisayama, Fukuoka and Usa, Oita, respectively, in 2017 based on three stream sites (upstream, midstream and downstream), three distances from the sheet pipe (center, 1m and 2m) and two soil depths of 10cm and 25cm, respectively. Thirteen potentially changeable soil properties were measured, and all recorded data were analyzed statistically by performing the F test. All means were also compared at least the 5% significantly different level. As the results, there was a major improvement in air-filled capacity and infiltration above the installed perforated sheet pipe. The nearer the sheet pipe, the more the soil bulked together, with the more significant increase in soil organic matter, and total carbonate content that promotes the formation of soil macropores, at 1m of sheet pipe distance in the deep paddy soil layer. The increase in the porosity (f) of studied soils allows more water and air to pass through.","[Soe, Yinn Mar; Shinogi, Yoshiyuki; Taniguchi, Tomoyuki] Kyushu Univ, Sch Agr, Lab Irrigat & Water Management, Div Bioprod Environm Sci,Dept Agroenvironm Sci, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan",Kyushu University,"Soe, YM (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Sch Agr, Lab Irrigat & Water Management, Div Bioprod Environm Sci,Dept Agroenvironm Sci, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",yinnmar2011@gmail.com,,,Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA),Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA),"The authors would like to express their special thanks to Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for supporting grants and Japan Association of Sheet Pipe Promotion (JASPIP) for providing sheet pipe installation in fields and tutoring about sheet pipe information.

As a key strategy to address sustainable urban development, the EU has advocated the development of Nature-Based solutions, such as the implementation of Green Infrastructure (GI), which can deliver a wide range of Regulating Ecosystem Services (ES). In this article, the ES of climate regulation provided by GI has been analyzed in the Municipality of Rome, Italy, characterized by a complex territory and by a Mediterranean climate. The methodological approach allowed to characterize the UHI and to analyze its features in a spatially explicit way and on a seasonal basis, through the Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from Landsat-8 data. The cooling capacity of different GI elements (peri-urban forest, urban forest, street trees), as well as the effect of vegetation cover and tree diversity on the provision of this regulating ES were assessed. The results show that GI significantly mitigates the hot urban climate during summer, with an effect that is dependent on the GI element and the environmental constrains to which it is exposed. NDVI and tree cover resulted the main indicators of the provision of the ES of climate regulation, highlighting that GI elements such as urban and peri-urban forests have the highest potential to provide this ES in a Mediterranean city. In the context of the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) process, our results lend support to claims that GI is important for an ecosystem-based climate adaptation strategy in urban environments, contributing to the definition of knowledge based criteria and indicators, relevant for decision-making in Mediterranean cities.","[Marando, Federica; Salvatori, Elisabetta; Sebastiani, Alessandro; Fusaro, Lina; Manes, Fausto] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Environm Biol, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Salvatori, E (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Environm Biol, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",elisabetta.salvatori@uniroma1.it,"Fusaro, Lina/Q-4369-2017; BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/AAC-9538-2021; Sebastiani, Alessandro/AAC-1725-2021","Fusaro, Lina/0000-0003-3316-707X; BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/0000-0002-3614-9910; Sebastiani, Alessandro/0000-0003-4877-3769; MARANDO, FEDERICA/0000-0002-8285-4012; SALVATORI, ELISABETTA/0000-0002-5603-5064; MANES, Fausto/0000-0002-4563-4272",Project: Global Change and Health in the Vision Planetary health - Italian Ministry of Health [4100/22]; Project Enhancing Resilience Of Urban Ecosystems through Green Infrastructure (EnRoute) - Joint Research Centre of the European Commission [12/2016-11/2018],Project: Global Change and Health in the Vision Planetary health - Italian Ministry of Health; Project Enhancing Resilience Of Urban Ecosystems through Green Infrastructure (EnRoute) - Joint Research Centre of the European Commission,"This research was supported by the following grants: Project: Global Change and Health in the Vision Planetary health, co-ordinated by ISS, funded by Italian Ministry of Health (Capitolo 4100/22); Project Enhancing Resilience Of Urban Ecosystems through Green Infrastructure (EnRoute) funded by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, 12/2016-11/2018.

Oceans provide the main source of animal protein for over a billion people, and contribute significantly to food security for billions more. Clearly, if we are to continue to derive these benefits, then the rate of adaptation in our human systems needs to at least keep pace with the rate of ecological change for these benefits to continue. An Australia-wide program of research into marine biodiversity and fisheries explored the opportunities for policy and management to respond to a changing climate. The research program spanned all Australian estuarine-nearshore and marine environments-tropical, subtropical, and temperate-and focused on two key marine sectors: biodiversity conservation and fisheries (commercial, recreational, and aquaculture). Key findings from across this strategic and extensive research investment were the need to foster resilience through habitat repair and protection, improve resource allocation strategies, fine-tune fisheries management systems, and enhance whole of government approaches and policies. Building on these findings, from a climate adaptation perspective, we generated a checklist of thirteen elements encompassing all project findings to assess and steer progress towards improving marine policy and management. These elements are grouped in three broad areas: preconditioning; future proofing; and transformational changes and opportunities. Arising from these elements is a suite of priority strategies that provide guidance for marine managers, policy practitioners, and stakeholders as they prepare for a future under climate change. As the research program encompassed a wide range of habitats and ecosystems, spanned a latitudinal range of over 30A degrees, and considered a diversity of management systems and approaches, many of these elements and strategies will be applicable in a global context.","[Creighton, Colin] Fisheries Res & Dev Corp, Deakin West, ACT 2600, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.] CSIRO, Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.; Pecl, Gretta T.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, 20 Castray Esplanade, Battery Point, Tas 7004, Australia; [Lockwood, Michael] Univ Tasmania, Sch Land & Food, Geog & Spatial Sci, Private Bag 78, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Pecl, Gretta T.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Creighton, Colin] 117 Lex Creek Rd, Crediton, Qld 4757, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Creighton, C (corresponding author), Fisheries Res & Dev Corp, Deakin West, ACT 2600, Australia.;Creighton, C (corresponding author), 117 Lex Creek Rd, Crediton, Qld 4757, Australia.",colinmwnrm@bigpond.com,"Hobday, Alistair/A-1460-2012; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Pecl, Gretta/D-7267-2011","Hobday, Alistair/0000-0002-3194-8326; Pecl, Gretta/0000-0003-0192-4339",Australian Government; CSIRO; State Government,Australian Government(Australian Government); CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); State Government,"The Climate Change Adaptation-Marine Biodiversity and Fisheries research initiative was supported by Australian and State Governments, CSIRO, and many Australian universities.

Under the European Union funded project, European Provision Of Regional Impacts Assessments on Seasonal and Decadal Timescales (EUPORIAS) we have developed the Land Management Tool (LMTool), a prototype seasonal climate service for land managers, working closely in collaboration with two stakeholder organizations, Clinton Devon Estates (CDE) and the National Farmers Union (NFU). LMTool was one of several prototype climate services selected for development within EUPORIAS, including those for the UK transport network, food security in Ethiopia, renewable energy production, hydroelectric energy production in Sweden, and river management in two French basins. The LMTool provides SCFs (1-3 months ahead) to farmers in the Southwest UK, alongside 14-day site specific weather forecasts during the winter months when the skill of seasonal forecasts is greatest. We describe the processes through which the LMTool was co-designed and developed with the farmers, its technical development and key features; critically examine the lessons learned and their implications for providing future climate services for land managers; and finally assess the feasibility of delivering an operational winter seasonal climate service for UK land managers. A number of key learning points from developing the prototype may benefit future work in climate services for the land management and agriculture sector; many of these points are also valid for climate services in other sectors. Prototype development strongly benefitted from; working with intermediaries to identify representative, engaged land managers; an iterative and flexible process of co-design with the farmer group; and from an interdisciplinary project team. Further work is needed to develop a better understanding of the role of forecast skill in land management decision making, the potential benefits of downscaling and how seasonal forecasts can help support land managers decision-making processes. The prototype would require considerable work to implement a robust operational forecast system, and a longer period to demonstrate the value of the services provided. Finally, the potential for such services to be applied more widely in Europe is not well understood and would require further stakeholder engagement and forecast development.","[Falloon, Pete; Liggins, Felicity; Taylor, Inika; Kahana, Ron; Comer, Ruth; Stanley, Simon; Middleham, Ross] Met Off, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Soares, Marta Bruno] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Manzanas, Rodrigo; San-Martin, Daniel] Predictia, Edificio ID,Modulo S345 Sn,Ave Castros, Santander 39005, Cantabria, Spain; [Wilding, John] Clinton Devon Estates, Rolle Estate Off, Budleigh Salterton EX9 7BL, Devon, England; [Jones, Ceris] NFU, Agr House,Stoneleigh Pk, Warks CV8 2TZ, England; [de Vreede, Ernst; de Cerff, Wim Som] KNMI, Postbus 201, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands; [Buontempo, Carlo; Brookshaw, Anca] ECMWF, Shinfield Pk, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Pittams, Daisy; Lawrence, Ellen; Bate, Emily; Peter, Hannah; Uzell, Katherine; Richards, Matt] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Amory Bldg,Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; University of Leeds; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Exeter,"Falloon, P (corresponding author), Met Off, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",pete.falloon@metoffice.gov.uk,"Soares, Marta/HJH-3434-2023; Manzanas, R./A-7747-2013; Buontempo, Carlo/GLQ-7538-2022","Manzanas, R./0000-0002-0001-3448; Buontempo, Carlo/0000-0002-1874-5380; Kahana, Ron/0000-0003-2070-8818; San Martin, Daniel/0000-0002-2862-2704; Bruno Soares, Marta/0000-0003-3127-4461",EUPORIAS project - European Commission [308291]; Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101],EUPORIAS project - European Commission(European Commission); Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme,"This work was supported by the EUPORIAS project, funded by the European Commission 7th Framework Programme for Research, grant agreement 308291, and the Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme (GA01101).

Brisbane and the northeast coast of Queensland are regions where design wind specifications may be inadequate under either current or likely future climate conditions. An appropriate adaptation strategy may be one that increases wind classifications for new houses, which leads to a reduced vulnerability of new construction. The present paper will assess the damage risks, adaptation costs, and cost-effectiveness of these adaptation measures for residential construction in Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton, and South East Queensland, assuming time-dependent changes in the frequency and intensity of cyclonic and noncyclonic winds to 2100. Loss functions are also developed for direct and indirect losses. It was found that increasing design wind loads for new houses in Brisbane and South East Queensland will lead to a net benefit [net present value (NPV)] of up to $10.5 billion by 2100, assuming a discount rate of 4%, which includes approximately 95% of a direct benefit and 5% of an indirect benefit. The benefits are highest for Brisbane due to its large population and the high vulnerability of existing residential construction, and have a 90-100% likelihood of achieving a net benefit by 2100.

Effective strategies for climate adaptation and development depend on understanding these differential sensitivities to climatic variability. This study focuses on a vulnerable population living in forest-fringe villages of central India, where seasonal migration is a common livelihood strategy for poor households to supplement their incomes with remittances. We quantify the relative sensitivity of a decision to migrate for the first time to climate and socio-economic variables and how the sensitivities vary for different segments of the population. We surveyed 5000 households in 500 forest-fringe villages to identify patterns of migration from 2013 to 2017. Using a mixed-effects logistic regression model, we predicted the probability of first-time migration of a household member based on climate variables and household- and district-level characteristics. We find that households in more agricultural and prosperous districts experience lower rates of migration but are more sensitive to climatic variability than households in poorer districts. The probability of first-time migration from a household in the most prosperous district increases by approximately 40% with one standard deviation in mean maximum temperature or rainfall from the 1981-2017 mean. However, the probability of migration does not vary as a function of climatic variability for households in the poorest district. We attribute this difference in sensitivities to the greater dependence on agriculture and irrigation in more prosperous districts and poverty-driven dependence on migration regardless of the climate in poorer districts. Households investing remittances from migration in agricultural intensification could become increasingly sensitive to climate variability, particularly with water shortages and projected increases in climate variability in the region. Promotion of non-agricultural livelihood options and climate-resilient agriculture could the reduce sensitivity of migration to climate variability in the study region.","[Choksi, Pooja; DeFries, Ruth] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY USA; [Singh, Deepti; Singh, Jitendra] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Vancouver, WA USA; [Mondal, Pinki] Univ Delaware, Dept Geog & Spatial Sci, Newark, DE USA; [Mondal, Pinki] Univ Delaware, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Newark, DE 19717 USA; [Nagendra, Harini] Azim Premji Univ, Sch Dev, Bengaluru, India; [Urpelainen, Johannes] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Columbia University; Washington State University; University of Delaware; University of Delaware; Johns Hopkins University,"Choksi, P (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY USA.",pc2796@columbia.edu,"Mondal, Pinki/AFU-2382-2022; Choksi, Pooja/HPC-8368-2023","Choksi, Pooja/0000-0002-2997-5894; DeFries, Ruth/0000-0002-3332-4621",NASA Land-Cover and Land-Use Change program [NNX17AI24G],NASA Land-Cover and Land-Use Change program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"The survey was conducted under IRB Protocol Number: IRB-AAAR5819 and funded by NASA Land-Cover and Land-Use Change program Grant No. NNX17AI24G for the project 'Tropical Deciduous Forests of South Asia: Monitoring Degradation and Assessing Impacts of Urbanization.'

The impacts are globally and regionally visible through more and more frequent extreme weather events, be they devastating storms, longer periods of cold and heat or prolonged periods of drought alternating with heavy rain and flooding. In addition to the urgent need for climate change mitigation, therefore, the question has been raised for some time as to which measures cities and municipalities, rural districts and regions can use to prepare themselves against the consequences of climate change.The region of Northern Hesse developed strategies and measures for climate adaptation at an early stage as part of the KLIMZUG (shaping climate change for the future in regions) federal support programme. The question remains open as to what will happen in rural regions - and especially in remote places - when there is no more civil protection assistance available in the event of adisaster either because they are needed elsewhere, roads are impassable or electricity, telephone and Internet connections are no longer functioning. For this case, aproject consortium led by the Regionalmanagement Nordhessen GmbH has now developed the volunteers on-site system (Freiwilligen-vor-Ort-System [FvOS]) as an organised form of neighbourhood support.This model project, which is unique in Germany, is intended to show how care for people in need of help and care can be ensured in rural areas in the event of adisaster.The project has sensitised citizens and task forces to this task and initiated aprocess that is intended to lead to more self-responsibility, but also safety in the event of adisaster situation.

Human activity is causing a rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and there is little doubt that this is contributing to global warming. There is greater uncertainty about how this global trend will play out at a regional scale and also how close we are to climatic tipping points. Instrumental records document the overall trends and variability in Scotland's climate since 1914. These show that since the 1960s, Scotland's average climate has proved to be wetter (especially in the west) and warmer. This trend is expected to continue throughout the 21st Century with, on average, hotter and drier summers and milder and wetter winters. However, extreme events will continue to affect Scotland, as they have always done, and the severity and frequency of these events may increase. Sea levels will continue to rise modestly, especially in the Outer Hebrides and the Northern Isles. Some of the uncertainty in climatic predictions is captured in the probabilistic outputs of Defra's UK Climate Projections 2009 programme. An initial attempt to assess the likely impacts of climate change is provided in Defra's 2012 Climate Change Risk Assessment, which includes a report specific to Scotland. Whilst most of the risks involve negative impacts, with increased flooding and loss of biodiversity being especially adverse, there are also positive impacts with associated opportunities, especially in terms of increased agricultural production and larger numbers of tourists. The report on Scotland will allow different groups of policy makers to refine the risks associated with specific activities. But given the fragile nature of many of the metrics underpinning the report, caution should be exercised in using it to frame climate adaptation strategies.","[Werritty, Alan] Univ Dundee, Sch Environm, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Sugden, David] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Geog, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Dundee; University of Edinburgh,"Werritty, A (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Sch Environm, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",,,,,,,,60,21,21,2,42,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1755-6910,1755-6929,,EARTH ENV SCI T R SO,Earth Environ.

While saving labor, this training system results in relatively high crop load and a poor leaf area to fruit weight-ratio (LFR), and thus, needs to be able to ripen grapes in a cool to moderate climate. For these reasons the impact of yield regulation strategies, including (i) shoot thinning (Darwin-Rotor), (ii) biotechnological thinning (Gibberellic acid), and (iii) bunch thinning (harvest machine) were trialed in a three year study at Geisenheim, Germany between 2017 and 2019 using Riesling (Vitis vinifera L.). The average yield per vine in SMPH (5.34 +/- 1.10 kg) was 61.1% higher with a narrower LFR (14.01 cm(2) g(-1)), compared with VSP (3.32 +/- 1.02 kg, LFR: 16.99 cm(2) g(-1)). The yield was successfully reduced and LFR simultaneously increased with shoot thinning (-33.1%, LFR: 19.04 cm(2) g(-1)), biotechnological thinning (-18.3%, LFR: 16.69 cm(2) g(-1)) and bunch thinning (-37.3%, LFR: 21.49 cm(2) g(-1)). Ripening was delayed in SMPH. On average, two maturity thresholds (14.1 degrees Brix and 18.2 degrees Brix) were achieved 129 GDD (seven days according to the recorded daily mean temperatures, respectively) and 269 GDD (16 days) later in non-thinned SMPH, compared to VSP. All thinning treatments accelerated maturity progress ranging from 27 GDD (two days) to 58 GDD (three days) for 14.1 degrees Brix and 59 GDD (three days) to 105 GDD (six days) for 18.2 degrees Brix. Apart from immediate benefits on the economic efficiency, the adaption of the leaf area to fruit weight ratio using SMPH holds high potential to, (i) produce grapes targeting specific wine profiles and/or (ii) reducing the velocity of ripening under conditions of climatic change.","[Schaefer, Jan; Friedel, Matthias; Stoll, Manfred] Hsch Geisenheim Univ, Dept Gen & Organ Viticulture, Von Lade Str 1, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany; [Molitor, Daniel] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Environm Res & Innovat ERIN Dept, 41 Rue Brill, L-4422 Belvaux, Luxembourg",Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology,"Schafer, J (corresponding author), Hsch Geisenheim Univ, Dept Gen & Organ Viticulture, Von Lade Str 1, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany.",jan.schaefer@hs-gm.de; matthias.friedel@hs-gm.de; daniel.molitor@list.lu; manfred.stoll@hs-gm.de,"Friedel, Matthias/AFV-1955-2022","Friedel, Matthias/0000-0003-4211-5327; Molitor, Daniel/0000-0001-7487-6740",BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research) of the project NoViSys [Novel viticulture systems for sustainable production and products project] [031A349G],BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research) of the project NoViSys [Novel viticulture systems for sustainable production and products project](Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We acknowledge the financial support by the BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research) of the project NoViSys [Novel viticulture systems for sustainable production and products project; number 031A349G].

Over the past decade, numerous studies have focused on vulnerability assessments with respect to drought and other meteorological hazards. Nonetheless, less research has focused on applying common measurement frameworks to compare vulnerability in different communities and the sources of such vulnerability. Yet, the crucial question remains: who is more vulnerable and what contributes to this vulnerability? This article is a case study for assessing the vulnerability to drought of smallholder farmers in two wards in Chivi district, Masvingo Province, Zimbabwe. This study is timely, as climate change is increasingly affecting populations dependent on rainfed agriculture. This assessment has been conducted by calculating the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and Livelihood Vulnerability Index of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (LVI-IPCC). This empirical study used data from 258 households from the two wards and triangulated it through Key Informant Interviews and Focus Group Discussions. To calculate the LVI, twenty-six subcomponents made up of seven major components, including socio-demographic variables; livelihood strategies; social capital; access to food, health, and water; and exposure to drought, were considered. To calculate the LVI-IPCC, we combined the three contributing factors of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity). Our results indicate that the LVI forward 14 is statistically higher than for ward 19 (F = 21.960; p <= 0.01) due to high exposure to drought, food insecurity, and compromised social networks. Concerning the LVI-IPCC, ward 14 was significantly more vulnerable to the impacts of drought than ward 19 (F = 7.718; p <= 0.01). Thus, reducing exposure to drought through early warning systems, building diversified agricultural systems, and social networks are of high priority to reduce the vulnerability of the farmers.","[Mugandani, Raymond; Chitata, Tavengwa; Zirebwa, Farai Solomon; Mupfiga, Elvis Tawanda] Midlands State Univ, Fac Agr Environm & Nat Resources Management, Dept Land & Water Resources Management, Gweru 9055, Zimbabwe; [Muziri, Tavagwisa] Midlands State Univ, Fac Agr Environm & Nat Resources Management, Dept Agron & Hort, Gweru 9055, Zimbabwe; [Murewi, Cyril Tapiwa Farai] Midlands State Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Gweru 9055, Zimbabwe; [Mugadza, Amanda] Midlands State Univ, Fac Law, Publ Law Dept, Gweru 9055, Zimbabwe; [Chitata, Tavengwa] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, England; [Sungirai, Marvelous; Manhondo, Petronella; Mudereri, Bester Tawona] Midlands State Univ, Fac Agr Environm & Nat Resources Management, Dept Anim & Wildlife Sci, Gweru 9055, Zimbabwe; [Nyamutowa, Charles] Midlands State Univ, Fac Agr Environm & Nat Resources Management, Dept Agr Econ & Dev, Gweru 9055, Zimbabwe; [Mudereri, Bester Tawona] Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol Icipe, POB 30772, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Mudereri, Bester Tawona] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Mugari, Zvenyika Eckson] Midlands State Univ, Fac Social Sci, Gweru 9055, Zimbabwe; [Mwadzingeni, Liboster; Mafongoya, Paramu] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Carbis Rd, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa",University of Sheffield; International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE); University of Witwatersrand; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mugandani, R (corresponding author), Midlands State Univ, Fac Agr Environm & Nat Resources Management, Dept Land & Water Resources Management, Gweru 9055, Zimbabwe.",mugandanir@staff.msu.ac.zw,,"Murewi, Cyril/0000-0002-0345-322X",,,,,72,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,DEC,2022,10,12,,,,,,,189,10.3390/cli10120189,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli10120189,,,16,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,7D6XI,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000900630200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Within these environments, there has been interaction between hydrological, physical and ecological characteristics. Therefore, impacts of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change on surface and sub - surface hydrology needs to be well understood due to the increasing population competing for scarce natural resources such as water, trees and forest land. The water balance com-ponents' spatial and temporal dynamics in relationship to the LULC change between 2003 and 2018 in the Lower Nzoia Sub - Catchment (LNSC) in Kenya was therefore assessed. Landsat data with 30 m (m) spatial resolution was used in understanding LULC dynamics of the study area using Supervised Classification Approach (Interactive Classification Method) in ArcGIS 10.5. After landsat image classification, key water balance components including; surface runoff (SURFQ), lateral flow (LATQ), groundwater recharge (BASEQ), deep acquifer recharge (DEEPQ), evapotranspiration (ET) and groundwater revap (REVAP) for years 2003 and 2018 were estimated using SWAT model in ArcSWAT. The overall accuracies for 2003 and 2018 classified images were 75.9% and 98.9% respectively which are showing good values. The results of the study showed that agricultural land coverage reduced from 83.1% in 2003 to 78.6% in 2018. Rangeland on the hand increased from 6.3% to 9.8% while urban/built - up area increasing from 10.6% to 11.6%. The annual water balance components from the LULC distribution of the two time periods shows that ET reduced, SURFQ increased, BASEQ reduced, DEEPQ reduced, LATQ reduced and REVAP reduced. At catchment level, results show that 2018 had a higher water balance than 2003 which can partly be explained by land cover decrease. The relationship between rainfall distribution, Land Surface Temperature (LST) and LULC change were further compared. At the same time, the study found out that there is limited focus to date on rural communities climate adaptive capacity. Hence, water institutions in the sub - catchment such as Water Resources Authority (WRA) are yet to fully mainstream adaptive capacity into their organizational structure and policies.","[Juma, Lilian A.] Pan African Univ, Water Policy Master Grad, Inst Water & Energy Sci including Climate Change, Tilimsen, Algeria; [Nkongolo, Nsalambi, V] Navajo Tech Univ, Sch Sci, Crownpoint, NM USA; [Raude, James M.; Kiai, Caroline] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Soil Water & Environm Engn Dept, Nairobi, Kenya",Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology,"Juma, LA (corresponding author), Pan African Univ, Water Policy Master Grad, Inst Water & Energy Sci including Climate Change, Tilimsen, Algeria.",lillianjuma@hotmail.com,,"Juma, Lilian/0000-0001-6014-3044; Nkongolo, Nsalambi/0000-0003-2485-4759; Raude, James/0000-0002-2690-3852",African Union Commission; Pan African University Institute of Water and Energy Sciences including Climate Change in Algeria,African Union Commission; Pan African University Institute of Water and Energy Sciences including Climate Change in Algeria,This work was supported by African Union Commission research grant for the Master Thesis at Pan African University Institute of Water and Energy Sciences including Climate Change in Algeria for the rersearch work of Lilian Adhiambo Juma.,,44,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,JUL,2022,8,7,,,,,,,e09799,10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09799,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09799,,JUL 2022,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,3Y1UU,35855988,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000843515600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent studies to estimate the climatic response of urban landscape conversion have mostly examined the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) change and land surface temperature (LST) data collected using advanced remote sensing (RS) techniques instead of atmospheric temperature. In this respect, four decadal Landsat images from the 1980s were used to investigate the impact of landscape transformation on atmospheric temperature. The mean and average minimum and maximum monthly air temperature datasets were used in the analysis. The CORINE (Coordination of Information on Environment) index was used to determine LULC diversity in an urban development boundary and urban periphery. Consequently, clustered LULC change values for the last three decades were integrated with decadal air temperature anomalies. The findings revealed an important relationship between monthly mean air temperature and land changes over recent decades, which resulted in an increase in urban fabric land use, deforestation land cover changes and conversion of permanent crop fields to artificial green houses for earlier vegetable production; the R-sqr values for these regressions were 97.7%, 88.5% and 90.6% respectively. On the other hand, the most important increasing temperature trends were obtained for the average monthly minimum air temperature, which supports the global warming concerns of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and related studies, which have concluded that an increased nighttime temperature results in urban heat islands (UHIs). The results should be used to support better urban landscape plans and architectural designs to improve human thermal comfort for sustainable urban life in Mediterranean cities. Street geometry and orientation to wind breeze, the Height/Width H/W ratio of buildings, and sizes of open and green spaces should be examined carefully in urban planning and design for climate adaptation.","Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Dept Landscape, TR-48306 Fethiye, Turkey",Mugla Sitki Kocman University,"Cinar, I (corresponding author), Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Dept Landscape, TR-48306 Fethiye, Turkey.",icinar@mu.edu.tr,,,Department of Research Foundation of Mugla Sitki Kocman University [2011/27],Department of Research Foundation of Mugla Sitki Kocman University(Mugla Sitki Kocman University),"Part of this research was supported by the Department of Research Foundation of Mugla Sitki Kocman University Project Number: 2011/27.

This question is critical for climate adaptation, but is challenging to answer given the length and non-stationarity of the observational record. The large single-model ensemble climate simulations archived in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) offer a unique opportunity to explore whether the hottest temperatures of the current climate are more extreme than any that could have occurred in the absence of human forcings. We first analyze the one CMIP6 model that has daily data archived for large ensembles in both the historical all-forcings and historical natural forcings experiments. We find that, for large areas of the world, the maximum daily-, seasonal- and annual-scale thresholds of the large single-model ensemble with natural and human forcings ('all-forcings') are never reached in the large single-model ensemble with only natural forcings. However, we also identify widespread areas-notably in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes-where the hottest thresholds of the all-forcings ensemble are frequently exceeded in the absence of human forcings. Further analysis suggests that human forcings other than greenhouse gases (GHGs) are a primary cause of this discrepancy. For example, when comparing the late and early periods of the CMIP6 historical all-forcings experiment, other large single-model ensembles exhibit similar muting of extremely warm years over northern-hemisphere mid-latitude regions. However, under GHG-only forcing, all years in the recent period are hotter than the hottest early-period year over most of the globe. These results suggest that, although the hottest possible events in the current climate may have been virtually impossible in the absence of historical GHG emissions, other non-GHG anthropogenic forcings have muted the emergence of previously impossible events.","[Diffenbaugh, Noah S.; Davenport, Frances, V] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Diffenbaugh, Noah S.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Diffenbaugh, NS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Diffenbaugh, NS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",diffenbaugh@stanford.edu,"; Diffenbaugh, Noah/I-5920-2014","Davenport, Frances/0000-0002-3061-2062; Diffenbaugh, Noah/0000-0002-8856-4964",Stanford University,Stanford University(Stanford University),"This paper is dedicated to Dr. Geert Jan van Oldenborgh (1961-2021), whose work inspired this and many other studies.

This study presents findings from seedling and sapling surveys conducted across 179 sites 15-21 years post-fire in eastern Oregon's Blue Mountain ecoregion. We found wide variation in conifer seedling and sapling densities across low, medium and high burn severity sites in the eight fires surveyed. One-third of sites had zero seedlings and saplings, while a quarter of sites had densities above 2000 juvenile trees ha(-1), in part due to high densities of lodgepole pine saplings. We assessed stocking adequacy by comparing observed juvenile conifer densities to local recommendations for specific plant associations, and found densities did not meet minimum stocking levels in approximately 35% of sites. The most important variables explaining juvenile conifer presence were topographic heat load and distance to live seed source, with the probability of juvenile conifer presence declining below 50% at approximately 100 m from a live seed source. Douglas-fir seedlings were less likely to be found on sites with high heat load than ponderosa pine, and drought conditions in the first three years post-fire reduced Douglas-fir regeneration. Post-fire drought also reduced the probability of achieving minimum stocking levels. Our findings indicate that juvenile conifer densities on warmer slopes within large, high-severity burn areas may be insufficient to meet local silvicultural guidelines without supplementary replanting, especially when moisture availability in the first few years post-fire is low. Some of these marginal sites may transition to shrub or grassland for the foreseeable future, though further research is needed to confirm regional post-fire successional trajectories. The findings from this study can inform post-fire and climate-adapted forest management in the inland Northwest.","[Boag, Angela E.] Colorado Dept Nat Resources, 1313 Sherman St,Rm 718, Denver, CO 80203 USA; [Ducey, Mark J.; Hartter, Joel] Univ New Hampshire, Carsey Sch Publ Policy, Huddleston Hall,73 Main St, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Ducey, Mark J.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, 114 James Hall, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Palace, Michael W.] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Morse Hall,8 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Palace, Michael W.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Earth Sci, 56 Coll Rd,214 James Hall, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Hartter, Joel] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Sustainabil Energy & Environm Complex, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Boag, AE (corresponding author), Colorado Dept Nat Resources, 1313 Sherman St,Rm 718, Denver, CO 80203 USA.",angela.boag@state.co.us,,,"United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2014-68002-21782]; NIFA [687305, 2014-68002-21782] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"This work is supported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) (2014-68002-21782).

The lack of relevant information to anticipate coping measures has exacerbated impacts leading to climate adaptation failure in most parts. In this regard, the current research paper has collected important datasets with an objective to assess the impact of extreme drought events on household's livelihoods for better understanding impacts, local people's perception, and the changes on vegetation cover in order to support a robust adaptation strategy to drought. The study conducted a household survey and collected satellite data for comparative analysis. The first survey was conducted in 2013 to collect data from 465 household heads through a structured questionnaire. Supplementary focus group discussions (FGDs) were also conducted in 2018 to collect qualitative information from targeted respondents such as village leaders and members of other key groups including women and youth. Descriptive statistics and correlation coefficient matrix were used to characterize the impact on households' main livelihoods and logistic regression to predict people's perception on pasture depletion over the last 20 years. Satellite data were used to derive spectral vegetation of land covers and unsupervised classification indexes. Both individual survey and focus group discussions identified drought as the main climate constraint which reduced crop production, water and pastures. The logistic analysis revealed that if the respondent's major occupation is livestock, the probability to perceive a depletion of pasture will increase by 28%. Concurrently, the satellite image observation in perfect agreement with the field survey showed 6.78% and 6.01% losses of water surface and vegetation cover respectively between 1986 and 2016 in the study area. These findings showed that logistic regression coupled with satellite information can inform on past and future impacts which are extremely crucial for sound adaptation planning in the Sahel region.","[Traore, Ousmane] Anhui Univ Hefei, Sch Econ, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Chang, Wei] Anhui Univ, Res Ctr Agr Rural Peasants, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Rehman, Abdul] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Traore, Seydou] Metropolitan Solar Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Rauf, Abdul] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Hefei University; Anhui University; Henan Agricultural University; Southeast University - China,"Chang, W (corresponding author), Anhui Univ, Res Ctr Agr Rural Peasants, Hefei, Peoples R China.;Rehman, A (corresponding author), Henan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China.",2522871406@qq.com; ahchangw@126.com; abdrehman@henau.edu.cn; straore@metropolitansolarinc.com; abdulrauf@seu.edu.cn,"Rehman, Abdul/HIZ-6275-2022; Rehman, Abdul/AAG-3676-2021","Rehman, Abdul/0000-0001-7809-5124",,,,,34,5,5,1,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

A wide first metacarpal head has also been proposed to be useful in distinguishing tool-dependent hominids from those less reliant on tools. In order to contribute to an evaluation of these hypotheses variation in first metacarpal and distal phalanx shape is explored among samples of modern humans and compared to that of fossil hominids. Modern humans are from the Terry Collection, Larsen Bay, a Chinese-Alaskan cemetery, Egypt, and Sully and Mobridge. Hominid fossils include AL 333w-39, SKX 5016, SK 84, Stw 294, OH 7, several Neanderthals, Skhul 4 and 5, and Predmosti 3. Analysis involves length-width ratios, regressions of distal phalanx tuft width on base width and of metacarpal head width on length, and pattern profiles based on Z-scores with reference to the Larsen Bay sample. Larsen Bay individuals are robust, while Terry blacks, Egyptians, and Chinese-Alaskan males tend to be gracile. Fossil hominids are most distinctive for distal phalanx radioulnar tuft and mid-shaft widths relative to length. Security of grip is one plausible explanation. While most modern samples are positively allometric for tuft, width relative to base width, the Larsen Bay and fossil hominid samples are not; thus caution is advised in accepting a base-tuft width comparison as a tool-dependence marker. Separation from modern humans is not easily achieved with metacarpal measures, but the Hadar metacarpal has distinctively narrow radioulnar head width ratios. While first metacarpal head expansion among hominids may plausibly be related to tool manufacture, other activities that place stress on the metacarpophalangeal joint should also be considered.

The TAP contains practical, easy to implement solutions for key stakeholders in the sector by adaptation type (technology, management, behavior, education, policy). Surveys of local tourism suppliers showed that 70% said they were well informed, largely by the Internet, but 55% admitted to not knowing enough. The methodology outlined here is transferable and the process can be replicated elsewhere, supporting other regions in becoming climate-friendly tourism destinations, creating opportunities for uniquely positioning a region for consumers. The article provides a concise overview of tourism provider attitudes assessed through a questionnaire, shedding light on points of intervention, willingness to pay, main barriers and suitable adaptation instruments.

Many studies have shown that a reasonable shape in the early stage of design can significantly reduce the energy consumption of buildings. Therefore, it helps if architects quickly select a reasonable shape that can effectively reduce energy consumption. This study summarized a number of outpatient building cases in China and proposed three typical building shapes: centralized-type (Shape-1), corridor-type (Shape-2), and courtyard-type (Shape-3). The Design Builder tool was used to simulate and analyze the typical building energy consumption in different climate zones. The simulation results show that Shape-2 (angle: 0 degrees) should be chosen in severe cold zone; Shape-1 (angle: 90 degrees) should be chosen in cold zone; Shape-1 (angle: 0 degrees) should be chosen in hot summer and cold winter zone; Shape-1 (angle: 60 degrees) should be chosen in hot summer and warm winter zone; and Shape-1 or Shape-2 can be chosen in warm zone.

Compound concurrent hot day and night (CCHDNs) extremes that combine daytime and nighttime heat are of greater concern for health than individual hot days (HDs) or hot nights (HNs), even though their frequency is lower. We utilize a bottom-up exploratory approach to investigate how adaptation options and various unfolding future scenarios alleviate the impacts of the heatwaves and affect the frequency and intensity of CCHDNs. We use climate observations (1981-2020) and Switzerland's future climate model scenarios (CH2018) to analyze historical and future trends of the individual hot day followed by a hot night (HDNs, first metric), and the length and frequency of CCHDNs (second and third metrics) in the near-future (2020-2050) and far-future (2070-2100). Results show more frequent and lengthier HDNs in cities under all emission scenarios, notably significant under high emissions scenarios.

We consistently project that the CCHDNs in April-October become more likely and intense in all cities under all emission scenarios, with higher increases under the RCP8.5 scenario and after the 2050s. The frequency of compound extreme heatwaves (exceeding both historical thresholds of night and day temperatures) may increase by 3.5-7.8-fold and become 3.3-5.3-fold lengthier in all cities of Switzerland in the far-future. We find that the adaptation options targeting higher tolerance to increased minimum temperatures contribute more to reducing compound extreme events' frequency and intensity than adaptation options that address the maximum daily temperature.","[Vaghefi, Saeid Ashraf; Muccione, Veruska; Neukom, Raphael; Huggel, Christian] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Vaghefi, Saeid Ashraf] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Neukom, Raphael; Salzmann, Nadine] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Salzmann, Nadine] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Davos, Switzerland; [Salzmann, Nadine] Climate Change Extremes & Nat Hazards Alpine Reg, Davos, Switzerland","University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); University of Fribourg; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Vaghefi, SA (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland.",saeid.vaghefi@geo.uzh.ch,,,"Swiss National Science Foundation, Switzerland [198086, 195968]; Digital Initiative Zurich's Innovation Program through the project DSS_Embrace","Swiss National Science Foundation, Switzerland(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Digital Initiative Zurich's Innovation Program through the project DSS_Embrace","This research has been supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Switzerland (grant nos. 198086 and 195968) and the Digital Initiative Zurich's Innovation Program through the project DSS_Embrace.",,64,0,0,11,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0947,,,WEATHER CLIM EXTREME,Weather Clim.

Understanding the adaptations being practiced and factors which determine decision in adoption is vital in designing viable strategies. A cross-sectional survey research design was employed to collect data from 384 randomly selected smallholder farmers to identify adaptation measures being undertaken and to estimate the prominent determinants in the adoption of adaptations in drought-prone areas of north-central Ethiopia. Data were analyzed using percentage, weighted mean index, Chi-square test, t test and multinomial regression model and triangulated with thematic analysis. Around 96% of the respondents have perceived a change in climate and 65.4% employed adaptation measures. Stone/soil bund, changing the farming calendar and switching to short maturing varieties are the most widely practiced adaptations. Barriers inhibiting smallholder farmers from taking adaptation measures were financial constraint, lack of affordable technologies, lack of knowledge, limited access to early warning, uncertainty about the future, shortage of land and scarcity of water. The results from the multinomial discrete choice model revealed that age and educational level of the head, family size, herd size, access to training, access to microfinance, extension services, remittance and perceiving that climate change can be adapted influenced the selection of adaptations. Overcoming financial constraint, strengthening extension service, providing timely information and early warning, intensifying irrigation, integration of non-farm sources of livelihood in the farming system and land resource management would enable to enhance the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers.","[Asfaw, Amogne; Hassen, Ali] Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Rural Dev Studies, Coll Dev Studies, POB 1145, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Simane, Belay] Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Environm & Dev Studies, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Bantider, Amare] Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Food Secur Studies, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University; Addis Ababa University; Addis Ababa University,"Asfaw, A (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Rural Dev Studies, Coll Dev Studies, POB 1145, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",amuvenu@yahoo.com; simaneb@yahoo.com; amare_zerfe@yahoo.com; hmuhaba@yahoo.com,"Asfaw, Amogne/AAV-9598-2020; Bantider, Amare/GWZ-9391-2022",,,,,,75,37,38,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Exploring the different design schemes of rainwater in situ regulation and storage systems in green spaces to cope with extreme rainfall events is critical to cities for combating flood disasters. Using the Gongkang green space as the research object and the XPDrainage software program as the simulation tool, this study explored and evaluated different design schemes of rainwater in situ regulation and storage systems in green spaces and their responses to extreme rainfall events in Shanghai. Based on the simulated results of the runoff curves, paths and ponding area of the Gongkang green space, the ideal number and position of rainwater regulation and storage facilities were determined. Four different schemes were examined: Scheme A (diversion-oriented), Scheme B (infiltration- and detention-oriented) and schemes C and D (comprehensive rainwater regulation and storage systems). From the simulation evaluation, the total runoff volume capture rate of Scheme C reached 100%, 99.8% and 98.2% under one-, three- and five-year return period rainfall events, respectively. For the 210 mm extraordinary rainstorm event, Scheme C's and Scheme D's total runoff volume capture rates reached 81.9% and 94.7%, respectively. Therefore, the comprehensive rainwater regulation and storage schemes (schemes C and D) met the runoff control requirements under extreme rainfall events in the Gongkang green space. This study provides a technical reference for the optimal design of a rainwater in situ regulation and storage system in a green space and promotes the construction of resilient cities.","[Xie, Changkun; Yu, Bingqin; Che, Shengquan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Design, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhedong] Zhejiang Federat Rural Credit Cooperat, Hangzhou 310016, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Che, SQ (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Design, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",xiechangkun@sjtu.edu.cn; wangzhedong@zjrcu.com; yubingchin1983@sjtu.edu.cn; chsq@sjtu.edu.cn,,"Yu, Bingqin/0000-0001-9649-3169",National Natural Science Foundation of China [32001362]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [19DZ1203702],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)),This research was funded by the Projects in the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 32001362) and the project of the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (grant number 19DZ1203702).,,25,1,1,7,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,JUN,2022,11,6,,,,,,,777,10.3390/land11060777,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11060777,,,15,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2K4HY,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000816300300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Farmers have been exposed to multiple stressors including climate change, and they have managed to adapt to those risks. The adaptation actions undertaken by farmers and their decision making are, however, only poorly understood. By studying adaptation practices undertaken by apple farmers in three regions: Nagano and Kazuno in Japan and Elgin in South Africa, we categorize the adaptation actions into two types: farmer initiated bottom-up adaptation and institution led top-down adaptation. We found that the driver which differentiates the type of adaptation likely adopted was strongly related to the farmers' characteristics, particularly their dependence on the institutions, e.g. the farmers' cooperative, in selling their products. The farmers who rely on the farmers' cooperative for their sales are likely to adopt the institution-led adaptation, whereas the farmers who have established their own sales channels tend to start innovative actions by bottom-up. We further argue that even though the two types have contrasting features, the combinations of the both types of adaptations could lead to more successful adaptation particularly in agriculture. This study also emphasizes that more farm-level studies for various crops and regions are warranted to provide substantial feedbacks to adaptation policy.","[Fujisawa, Mariko; Kobayashi, Kazuhiko] Univ Tokyo, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Fujisawa, Mariko; New, Mark] Univ Cape Town, ACDI, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Johnston, Peter] Univ Cape Town, CSAG, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Tokyo; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Kobayashi, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Bunkyo Ku, Yayoi 1-1-1, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",k.kobayashi.ut@gmail.com,"Kobayashi, Kazuhiko/AAN-7096-2020; New, Mark/A-7684-2008","New, Mark/0000-0001-6082-8879; Johnston, Peter/0000-0003-3329-0334","Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)","Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)(CGIAR)","The grant is in 'Theme 4.2-Activity 261' (http://activities.ccafs.cgiar.org/activity.do?id=261), Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) (http://ccafs.cgiar.org/), the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).

It is widely viewed that warm climate breeds (Zebu and Sanga cattle) are adapted to the climate in which they evolved. Such adaptations might be exploited for increasing cattle productivity in warm climates and decrease the effect of warm periods in cooler climates. The literature was reviewed for presence of such adaptations. Evidence is clear for resistance to ticks and tick-transmitted diseases in Zebu and Sanga breeds as well as for a possible development of resistance to ticks in additional breeds. Development of resistance to ticks demands time; hence, it needs to be balanced with potential use of insecticides or vaccination. The presumption of higher sweating rates in Zebu-derived breeds, based upon morphological differences in sweat glands between breeds, has not been substantiated. Relatively few studies have examined hair coat characteristics and their responses to seasonal heat, particularly in temperate climate breeds. Recently, a gene for slick hair coat has been observed that improved heat tolerance when introduced into temperate climate breeds. No solid evidence exists that hair coat in these lines is lighter than in well-fed warm climate-adapted Holsteins. Warm climate breeds and their F1 crosses share as dominant characteristics lower maintenance requirements and milk yields, and limited response to improved feeding and management. These characteristics are not adaptations to a feed-limited environment but are constitutive and useful in serving survival when feed is scarce and seasonal and high temperatures prevail. The negative relationship between milk yield and fertility present in temperate climates breeds also prevails in Zebu cattle. Fertility impairment by warm conditions might be counteracted in advanced farming systems by extra corporeal early embryo culture. In general, adaptations found in warm climate cattle breeds did not increase heat dissipation capacity, but rather diminished climate-induced strain by decreasing milk production. The negative relationship between reproductive efficiency and milk yield, although relatively low, also appears in Zebu cattle. This association, coupled with limited feed intake, acting over millennia, probably created the selection pressure for a low milk production in these breeds.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Anim Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Berman, A (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Anim Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",berman@agri.huji.ac.il,,,,,,,122,93,100,3,43,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0022-0302,1525-3198,,J DAIRY SCI,J.

We developed alternate groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) farming practices for rainfed kharif (South-west monsoon) and irrigated rabi (winter) cropping seasons for agro-ecological region 3.0 in semi-arid peninsular India; and compared their yields, farm income as well as nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions with current baseline practices among regional small scale farm-holders. At the study farm, alternate practices including application of locally prepared fermented manures along with a 40-60 % reduction in application of total N increased pod yield by 50 and 35 % and net profit by similar to 120 and similar to 70 % in a drought-hit kharif and an irrigated rabi, respectively. High resolution field measurements of N2O flux indicate that the seasonal emission factors for groundnut cultivation using baseline and alternate practices were 1.7-2.0 % of applied N. Thus, the average IPCC and Indian national emissions factors of 1 and 0.58 %, respectively, underestimate GHG emissions during groundnut cultivation. Crucially, alternate practices led to (1) a reduction of 0.13 +/- A 0.07 and 0.24 +/- A 0.1 tCO(2)e ha(-1) season(-1) through decreases in direct N2O emissions along with a 50 % reduction in GHG emission intensity (per unit yield) in both seasons; (2) a concomitant average reduction of similar to 0.1 and 0.24 tCO(2)e ha(-1) season(-1) through decreased demand for manufactured fertilizers in kharif and rabi seasons, respectively. The positive implications for climate resilience, mitigation and ecosystem services are discussed.","[Kritee, K.; Nair, Drishya; Tiwari, Rakesh; Rudek, Joseph; Ahuja, Richie; Adhya, Tapan; Hamburg, Steven] Environm Def Fund, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Nair, Drishya; Tiwari, Rakesh; Tetaert, Filip] Fair Climate Network, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Loecke, Terrance] Univ Nebraska, Lincoln, NE USA; [Reddy, Shalini; Dava, Obulapathi] Acc Fraterna AF Ecol Ctr, Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh, India",Environmental Defense Fund; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Kritee, K (corresponding author), Environm Def Fund, 2060 Broadway,Suite 300, Boulder, CO 80302 USA.",kriteek@gmail.com,"Tiwari, Rakesh/B-3676-2013; K., Kritee/AAT-8370-2020; ADHYA, TAPAN KUMAR/H-4525-2011","Tiwari, Rakesh/0000-0002-2191-769X; ADHYA, TAPAN KUMAR/0000-0002-8267-1793; Loecke, Terrance/0000-0001-9861-5115; Nair, Drishya/0000-0002-3074-0638",Environmental Defense Fund; ICCO Cooperation,Environmental Defense Fund; ICCO Cooperation,"This work would have been impossible without the constant efforts and cooperation of Nagendra Reddy (groundnut farmer near our field experiment hub).

Potential sources of variation include sex, age, side (left or right), regional differences in body shape due to climatic adaptation, and the effects of habitual activity patterns (e.g. mobile and sedentary lifestyles and foraging, agricultural, and urban economies). In this study we addressed these issues, using consistent methods to assemble a global NSA database comprising over 8000 femora representing 100 human groups. Results from the analyses show an average NSA for modern humans of 127 degrees (markedly lower than the accepted value of 135 degrees); there is no sex difference, no age-related change in adults, but possibly a small lateral difference which could be due to right leg dominance. Climatic trends consistent with principles based on Bergmann's rule are evident at the global and continental levels, with the NSA varying in relation to other body shape indices: median NSA, for instance, is higher in warmer regions, notably in the Pacific (130 degrees), whereas lower values (associated with a more stocky body build) are found in regions where ancestral populations were exposed to colder conditions, in Europe (126 degrees) and the Americas (125 degrees). There is a modest trend towards increasing NSA with the economic transitions from forager to agricultural and urban lifestyles and, to a lesser extent, from a mobile to a sedentary existence. However, the main trend associated with these transitions is a progressive narrowing in the range of variation in the NSA, which may be attributable to thermal insulation provided by improved cultural buffering from climate, particularly clothing.","[Gilligan, Ian] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Archaeol & Anthropol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Chandraphak, Supichya] Mahidol Univ, Siriraj Hosp, Dept Anat, Congdon Anat Museum,Fac Med, Bangkok 10700, Thailand; [Mahakkanukrauh, Pasuk] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Med, Dept Anat, Chiang Mai 50000, Thailand",Australian National University; Mahidol University; Chiang Mai University,"Gilligan, I (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Archaeol & Anthropol, AD Hope Bldg 14, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",ian.g@bigpond.net.au,"Mahakkanukrauh, Pasuk/AAE-3791-2020; Gilligan, Ian/AFK-7800-2022","Gilligan, Ian/0000-0003-2339-6573","University House Postgraduate Research Scholarship; Faculty of Arts and a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship; Faculty of Arts; College of Arts and Social Sciences, Australian National University","University House Postgraduate Research Scholarship; Faculty of Arts and a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship; Faculty of Arts; College of Arts and Social Sciences, Australian National University","The authors thank David Bulbeck, Colin Groves, David Leask, Bill Lyndon, Marc Oxenham, Colin Pardoe, and Peter White for their assistance during the course of this research, and Erik Trinkaus for his advice on measuring femoral neck-shaft angles.

CarboSOIL is an empirical model based on regression techniques and developed as a geographical information system tool to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) contents at different depths. This model is a new component of the agro-ecological decision support system for land evaluation MicroLEIS, which assists decision-makers in facing specific agro-ecological problems, particularly in Mediterranean regions. In this study, the CarboSOIL model was used to study the effects of climate change on SOC dynamics in a Mediterranean region (Andalusia, S Spain). Different down-scaled climate models were applied based on BCCR-BCM2, CNRMCM3, and ECHAM5 and driven by SRES scenarios (A1B, A2 and B2). Output data were linked to spatial data sets (soil and land use) to quantify SOC stocks. The CarboSOIL model has proved its ability to predict the short-, medium- and long-term trends (2040s, 2070s and 2100s) of SOC dynamics and sequestration under projected future scenarios of climate change. Results have shown an overall trend towards decreasing of SOC stocks in the upper soil sections (0-25 cm and 25-50 cm) for most soil types and land uses, but predicted SOC stocks tend to increase in the deeper soil section (0-75 cm). Soil types as Arenosols, Planosols and Solonchaks and land uses as permanent crops and open spaces with little or no vegetation would be severely affected by climate change with large decreases of SOC stocks, in particular under the medium-high emission scenario A2 by 2100.

For a long time, it was thought possible to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which, according to many experts, brought on an unfit adaptation. There are international agreements designed to significantly reduce CO2 emissions and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, but the policy measures taken so far are insufficient to achieve this goal. In addition, the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the relevance of placing this issue at the core of international policies and the need for bottom-up measures and options. The purpose of this paper is to explore how collaborative planning can contribute to adapting the urban tourism sector to climate change in the Porto Metropolitan Area (PMA), located in the northern region of mainland Portugal. In this investigation, we used mixed methods based on the following: (1) the discussion of urban tourism's adaptation planning to climate change with undergraduate students; (2) the application of a modified Delphi questionnaire survey, to 47 international researchers and technicians in the first round and 35 international researchers and technicians in the second round, about the predictability of the adaptation measures; and (3) a theoretical-practical workshop aimed to discuss the main action intentions and ways of adaptation in the short and medium term. All empirical data were collected during the year of 2021. This research highlights the need for more detailed information, the weak interaction between stakeholders and the limitation of resources. Our research identifies the main impacts and local vulnerabilities and determines priorities for adaptation and implementation of actions, aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change and maintaining tourism attractiveness in urban areas. In addition, this investigation allowed the definition of a research agenda, which seeks to guide the area of tourism climatology regarding the new challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","[Silva Lopes, Helder; Remoaldo, Paula; Ribeiro, Vitor] Univ Minho, Dept Geog, Lab2PT Landscape Heritage & Terr Lab, ICS, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal; [Silva Lopes, Helder; Martin-Vide, Javier] Univ Barcelona, Dept Geog, FGH, IdRA Climatol Grp, Barcelona 08001, Spain; [Ribeiro, Vitor] ESE Paula Frassinetti, Dept Teacher Training, CIPAF, P-4000225 Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; University of Barcelona,"Lopes, HS (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Dept Geog, Lab2PT Landscape Heritage & Terr Lab, ICS, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.",htsltiago@hotmail.com; premoaldo@geografia.uminho.pt; vitor.geografia@gmail.com; jmartinvide@ub.edu,"Lopes, Hélder/ADP-8422-2022","Lopes, Hélder/0000-0002-2931-5175; Martin-Vide, Javier/0000-0002-1179-7380","FCT Portugal [SFRH/BD/129153/2017]; FCT; FEDER [COMPETE2020-POCI 01 0145 FEDER 007528]; Lab2PT-Landscapes, Heritage and Territory Laboratory [AUR/04509]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/129153/2017] Funding Source: FCT","FCT Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER(European Commission); Lab2PT-Landscapes, Heritage and Territory Laboratory; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","This research was funded by FCT Portugal, grant number SFRH/BD/129153/2017 and Lab2PT-Landscapes, Heritage and Territory Laboratory-AUR/04509 and FCT through national funds and when applicable of the FEDER co-financing, in the aim/under the scope of the new-partnership agreement PT2020 and COMPETE2020-POCI 01 0145 FEDER 007528.",,91,2,2,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Afghanistan, a South Asian country, is affected by climate change, extreme weather events and losses accompanying its poor adaptation status. Therefore, the present study intends to evaluate the adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers based on primary data collected through pre-tested questionnaire from 260 households distributed in 26 villages across both plain and mountain regions of Yangi Qala district, Afghanistan. The questionnaire contained questions about the general household information and farm-level adaptation strategies by smallholders. Logistic regression models were applied to four major adaptation strategies practiced by the farmers in form of scientific techniques applied during crop cultivation; cultivation of drought-resistant varieties; cultivation of new crop and migration of family members with household characteristics for each region considered separately as well as jointly. The results confirmed that household characteristics like house type, LPG usage, livestock population, irrigated land area, education, secondary profession and male population determined the strategies to abate climate risks by the peasant smallholders of the region. The study highlights the need to identify the in-situ barriers and enablers of adaptation to facilitate an expanded uptake of adaptation practices by smallholders. Therefore, the government must employ policies addressing the challenges by applying a community-inclusive approach for climate adaptation in agriculture.","[Omerkhil, Najibullah; Chand, Tara; Rawat, P.

We assess agricultural vulnerabilities within this region to support identification and development of adaptation strategies at regional to local scales, where many management decisions are made. Exposure to the synergistic effects of warming, such as fewer and more intense precipitation events and greater overall weather variability, will uniquely affect rain-fed and irrigated cropping, high-value specialty crops, extensive and intensive livestock production, and forestry. Although the sensitivities of various agricultural sectors to climatic stressors can be difficult to identify at regional scales, we summarize that crops irrigated from the Ogallala aquifer possess a high sensitivity; rangeland beef cattle production a low sensitivity; and rain-fed crops, forestry, and specialty crops intermediate sensitivities. Numerous adaptation strategies have been identified, including drought contingency planning, increased soil health, improved forecasts and associated decision support tools, and implementation of policies and financial instruments for risk management. However, the extent to which these strategies are adopted is variable and influenced by both biophysical and socioeconomic considerations. Inadequate local- and regional-scale climate risk and resilience information suggests that climate vulnerability research and climate adaptation approaches need to include bottom-up approaches such as learning networks and peer-to-peer communication.","[Steiner, Jean L.; Brown, David P.; Rottler, Caitlin M.] ARS, USDA, Grazinglands Res Lab, 7207 W Cheyenne St, El Reno, OK 73036 USA; [Briske, David D.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, Centeq Bldg,Room 130C,MS 2120 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Steiner, JL (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, Grazinglands Res Lab, 7207 W Cheyenne St, El Reno, OK 73036 USA.",jean.steiner@ars.usda.gov,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020",,,,,,82,61,62,3,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

For increasing urban populations, green???blue infrastructure (GBI) is an important element in compact cities contributing to human health, well-being, and the provision of important ecosystem services. We analyzed responses from two open-ended questions about visions, ideas, and topics for the development and management of GBI important for citizens of the city of Leipzig, Germany. The questions were part of an online survey accompanying the development of the local GBI planning strategy: Master Plan Green. The strategy is focusing on five guiding themes that are leading local and global debates about sustainable and resilient cities: biodiversity, climate adaptation, environmental justice, health, and sustainable mobility. We categorize citizens' ideas and suggestions, summarize frequent problems and conflicts, and link ideas and visions to the five guiding themes. As the last step, we discuss citizens' suggestions in order to minimize conflicts in GBI and to identify deficits in present local planning. Major problems and conflicts that were addressed by respondents relate to quality, usability, other users, activities, and safety and security of GBI. Numerous suggestions aimed to tackle these problems, for example, by designating separate use areas, adding naturalness, improving maintenance, and enhancing facilities. A range of ideas and suggestions were based on diverging expectations underpinning the challenge of matching heterogeneous demands of GBI users in an equitable fashion. Linking these suggestions to the five guiding themes reveals that most ideas are covered by one or several guiding themes and are considered in local planning strategies. However, findings also demonstrate that increasing the quantity of Leipzig's GBI is a central request from respondents. Sociocultural and economic aspects as well as conflicting demands among citizens should further be central to GBI planning to avoid injustice and achieve sustainability objectives. This analysis gives insights into opinions and visions of citizens regarding the development of the city's GBI network and thus substantiates major strategic and planning themes leading global and local urban strategies toward sustainable cities. Considering specific suggestions and GBI deficits that bother citizens on a local level, offers the opportunity to improve the social and ecological resilience of GBI.","[Palliwoda, Julia; Priess, Joerg A.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Haase, Annegret; Rink, Dieter] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Leipzig, Germany; [Suppee, Constantin] Off Green Space & Water, Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Palliwoda, J (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany.",,,,BiodivErsA [01LC1616A],BiodivErsA,"The study was part of the UrbanGaia project http://urbangaia.eu/, which was funded by BiodivErsA, project number 01LC1616A.

Here, we tried to understand three related important questions through literature survey: how did soil organic carbon (SOC) stock change in Chinese croplands in the past decades? What are the agronomic management practices and their potentials to increase the SOC of croplands in China? And how do changes in the SOC affect crop yields? The analyses showed that the SOC stock in the surface soil (0-20 cm) of Chinese croplands increased on average by 0.48% yr(-1) from 1980 to 2011. The increase was significant in the eastern and northern China, and particularly in the paddy soils in southern China; however it decreased in the northeastern China. The increase of the SOC stock was attributed to substantial increase in organic inputs, resulted from increased crop productivity, the amendments of crop residues and organic manure, the increases in synthetic fertilizer application and the optimal combination of nutrients, as well as adopting no-tillage practice. Increase in the SOC can increase crop yield and reduce yield variability. Additional means to enhance soil carbon sequestration can be application of biochar, and improvement of synthetic nitrogen use efficiency through disseminating formula fertilizer application based on soil testing, optimized application of inorganic and organic fertilizers associated with extension of conservation tillage. Currently, the straw return ratio has reached about 50%, whereas organic fertilization and conservation tillage (about 6.6%) are still at relatively low levels, the recommended management practices can be further extended to the regions with degraded soils and high population pressure. Further implementation of the recommended management practices on Chinese croplands would increase the SOC stock by >= 25.0 Tg C yr(-1) or 0.63% yr(-1), compensating for Chinese CO2 emissions by >= 1.0%. In conclusion, Chinese croplands can meet the 4 per mille target and play a crucial role in food security, carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. The priority is to develop climate smart agronomic management practices to gain synergies between climate adaptation and mitigation.","[Tao, Fulu; Palosuo, Taru; Valkama, Elena; Makipaa, Raisa] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Helsinki 00790, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Tao, FL (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Helsinki 00790, Finland.",fulu.tao@luke.fi,"Mäkipää, Raisa/AAC-6548-2022; Valkama, Elena/ABB-4520-2021; Palosuo, Taru/B-9593-2012","Mäkipää, Raisa/0000-0003-3146-4425; Valkama, Elena/0000-0002-8337-8070; Palosuo, Taru/0000-0003-4322-3450; Tao, F/0000-0001-8574-0080",Natural Resources Institute Finland; Academy of Finland through the project DivCSA [41007-00140700],Natural Resources Institute Finland; Academy of Finland through the project DivCSA(Academy of Finland),This study was funded by the strategic funding of Natural Resources Institute Finland (project ChinaSOC & ClimSmartAgr) and by the Academy of Finland through the project DivCSA (Project No. 41007-00140700).,,98,47,52,20,247,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-1987,1879-3444,,SOIL TILL RES,Soil Tillage Res.,MAR,2019,186,,,,,,70,78,,10.1016/j.still.2018.10.009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2018.10.009,,,9,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,HE0CN,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000452934500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we focus on the role that trees can play in reducing temperature during warm seasons and associated impacts on human health and well-being. We introduce a method for quantifying and valuing changes in premature mortality from extreme heat due to the changes in urban tree cover and apply this method to Baltimore City, Maryland. The model i-Tree Cool Air uses a water and energy balance to estimate hourly changes in air temperature due to alternative scenarios of tree cover applied across 653 Census Block Groups. The changes in temperature are applied to existing temperature?mortality models to estimate changes in health outcomes and associated values. Existing tree cover in Baltimore is estimated to reduce annual mortality by 543 deaths as compared to a 0% tree cover scenario. Increasing the area of current tree cover by 10% of each Census Block Group reduced baseline annual mortality by 83 to 247 deaths (valued at $0.68 ?2.0 billion applying Value of Statistical Life estimates). Over half of the reduced mortality is from the over 65 year age group, who are among the most vulnerable to extreme heat. Reductions in air temperature due to increased tree cover were greatest in downtown Baltimore where tree cover is relatively low and impervious cover is relatively high. However, the greatest reductions in mortality occurred in the outskirts of Baltimore where a greater number of people who are over 65 years in age reside. Quantifying and valuing the health benefits of changes in air temperatures due to increased tree cover can inform climate adaptation and mitigation plans by decision makers. Developing adaptation strategies to effectively address these issues will become increasingly important in the future under changing climates and an aging population.","[Sinha, Paramita; Lim, Brian] RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Coville, Robert C.; Hirabayashi, Satoshi] US Forest Serv, USDA, Davey Inst, Davey Tree Expert Co,SUNY ESF, 5 Moon Lib, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Endreny, Theodore A.] SUNY ESF, Dept Environm Resources Engn, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Nowak, David J.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Forest Inventory & Anal, SUNYESF, 5 Moon Lib, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA",Research Triangle Institute; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Sinha, P (corresponding author), RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",psinha@rti.org,"Endreny, Theodore/H-4743-2019","Endreny, Theodore/0000-0002-1891-261X; sinha, paramita/0000-0001-5667-9428",2018 U.S. Forest Service National Urban and Community Forestry Challenge CostShare Grant Program [18DG-11132544_014]; RTI internal grant,2018 U.S. Forest Service National Urban and Community Forestry Challenge CostShare Grant Program; RTI internal grant,We acknowledge financial support from the 2018 U.S. Forest Service National Urban and Community Forestry Challenge CostShare Grant Program (Federal Award Identification Number 18DG11132544?014) and an RTI internal grant.

Yet, its urbanisation will be unprecedented in terms of climate vulnerabilities. Little is known about urbanisation and migrants, in the context of these vulnerabilities, in part because demographic inquiry and training (with a few notable exceptions) has only begun in the last decade to embrace new, spatial data and methods of analysis-especially those involving earth-observing satellites. This descriptive analysis examines urban change along with low-elevation coastal zone (LECZ) data as a proxy for flood exposure, using data from satellites, and integrates those features with socioeconomic characteristics and migration information from demographic and health survey data (DHS 2000-2014). We describe where urban change has occurred in the past 40 years, with a focus on understanding change occurring in LECZ areas. We then describe vulnerabilities of the households and migrants in areas of urban change from about 2004 onward, both in terms of their potential exposure to flooding and socioeconomic characteristics. We find that moderate-risk, 7-10m LECZ areas are not only more built-up than higher elevation areas, but they have also had appreciably more urban development as measured by built-up change than other areas. Although we found that poor urban households are more likely to be located in flood-prone areas, poor households were also less likely to be in areas that are built-up. The 0-6m LECZ has lower proportions of urban in-migrants, but among those migrants to cities, the flood-prone LECZ is more likely to be the destination of poor migrants. This paper suggests that climate adaptation plans should be spatially specific because poor migrants are more likely to be located in LECZ areas that are more prone to flooding.","[Liu Zhen] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Sociol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Balk, Deborah] CUNY, Baruch Coll, CUNY Inst Demog Res, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Balk, Deborah] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Marxe Sch Publ & Int Affairs, New York, NY 10021 USA",Zhejiang University; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Balk, D (corresponding author), CUNY, Baruch Coll, Marxe Sch Publ & Int Affairs, CUNY Inst Demog Res, New York, NY 10021 USA.",zhen_liu@zju.edu.cn; deborah.balk@baruch.cuny.edu,,"Liu, Zhen/0000-0001-5859-1585; Balk, Deborah/0000-0002-9028-7898",Carnegie Corporation of New York [G-F-16-53680]; AXA Research Fund,Carnegie Corporation of New York; AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund),"Carnegie Corporation of New York, Grant/Award Number: G-F-16-53680; AXA Research Fund",,125,3,3,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1544-8444,1544-8452,,POPUL SPACE PLACE,Popul.

J,"Lyons, G; Marsden, G",,,,"Lyons, Glenn; Marsden, Greg",,,Opening out and closing down: the treatment of uncertainty in transport planning's forecasting paradigm,TRANSPORTATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Uncertainty; Forecasting; Opening out; Closing down; Decision-making,DECISION-MAKING; POLICY-MAKING; INFORMATION; SCENARIOS; FACE,"Since the 1960s, development of the transport system has been framed by the notion of forecasting future demand. Yet the past decade or more appears to signal some significant changes to the role of travel in society which are having a material impact on how much people travel (and may travel in the future). Coupled with the potential for major technological changes and a range of climate adaptation scenarios, the future of mobility presents today's decision making on transport strategy and investment with a broader set of uncertainties than has previously been considered. This paper examines current mainstream practice for incorporating uncertainty into decision-making, through an illustrative case study of the highly codified approaches of the Department for Transport in England. It deconstructs the issue by first focussing on different ways in which there is anopening outor acceptance of new uncertainties and how this creates a (wider) set of potential futures. It then turns to consider how this set of futures is used, or not, in decision-making, i.e. the process ofclosing downuncertainty to arrive at or at least inform a decision. We demonstrate that, because the range of uncertainties has broadened in scope and scale, the traditional technocratic approach of closing down decisions through sensitivity testing is at odds with the greater breadth now being called for at the opening out stage. We conclude that transport decision-making would benefit from a rebalancing of technical depth with analytical breadth. The paper outlines a plausible new approach to opening out and closing down that is starting to be applied in practice. This approach must be accompanied by anopening upof the processes by which technical advice for decisions are reached and how uncertainties are understood and negotiated.","[Lyons, Glenn] Univ West England, Ctr Transport & Soc, Future Mobil, Bristol, Avon, England; [Marsden, Greg] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of West England; University of Leeds,"Marsden, G (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",G.R.Marsden@its.leeds.ac.uk,,"Lyons, Glenn/0000-0001-7551-9198; Marsden, Greg/0000-0003-3570-2793",Mott MacDonald; EPSRC Dynamics of End Use Energy Demand Centre grant [EP/K011723/1]; EPSRC [EP/K011723/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Mott MacDonald; EPSRC Dynamics of End Use Energy Demand Centre grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),We are grateful to Professors Peter Mackie and John Parkin for feedback on an earlier version of this paper and to the willingness of staff at the Department for Transport to engage on the topic being addressed.

Potential natural vegetation (PNV) and climate adaptation concepts should be integrated into revegetation programs to achieve sustainable ecosystems. The Yanhe Basin in the Loess Plateau of China (7687 km(2)) has been subjected to intense human activity for centuries. It was selected as the study area because vegetation degradation and restoration are occurring there. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate whether the current vegetation pattern is appropriate, and (2) provide a restoration plan for future revegetation programs based on PNV and habitat suitability patterns simulated by the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Current work focused on the parameter calibration and high-resolution climate data of the model over the study area. The comparisons of model performances in the PNV pattern and productivity indicated that parameter calibration was necessary for the model application. PNV of the Yanhe Basin may shift by 21.37-29.67% from 1981-2010 to 2071-2100, mainly in the southern part. Forests may decrease and steppes may increase as the climate becomes drier in the future. Comparisons between an existing land use map and the current PNV pattern indicated that only 40.8% of the forestland was coincident with the current PNV pattern, whereas grassland was a more suitable vegetation type for the rest of the terrain. In contrast, 83.1% of the grassland aligned with the current PNV pattern. Therefore, 16.9% remains to be forested. Current forestland and grassland patterns should be adjusted to cope with future climate change. Broadleaf summer-green shrubs covered a larger area and had higher habitat suitability than forests; they might be the most suitable woody plants for revegetation of the Yanhe Basin. The applied research approach could be extended to other regions undergoing similar revegetation programs and help promote sustainable vegetation management.","[Peng, Shouzhang; Wen, Zhongming; Zhang, Chao] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Peng, Shouzhang; Wen, Zhongming; Zhang, Chao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Peng, Shouzhang; Wen, Zhongming; Zhang, Chao] Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Yu, Kailiang] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str 16, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Li, Zhi] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Ministry of Water Resources; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Northwest A&F University - China","Zhang, C (corresponding author), Inst Soil & Water Conservat, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",zhangchaolynn@163.com,"LI, ZHI/D-7204-2015; LI, ZHI/O-6615-2019","LI, ZHI/0000-0002-9268-6497; LI, ZHI/0000-0002-9268-6497; Peng, Shouzhang/0000-0002-2358-6329","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601058]; CAS Light of West China Program [XAB2015B07, XAB2017A02]; Key Cultivation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS Light of West China Program; Key Cultivation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,"This work was jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41601058), the CAS Light of West China Program (Grants No. XAB2015B07 and XAB2017A02), and the Key Cultivation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences entitled 'The promotion and management of ecosystem functions of restored vegetation in Loess Plateau, China'.

Global climate simulations from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario are used to examine the time at which an anthropogenic influence becomes detectable in extreme precipitation over China and the change in probability of extreme precipitation with certain magnitudes when the changes are detectable. Anthropogenic influence is not significantly detected over China in the observational record or simulations from 1961 to 2012 based on the test of field significance. Simulations indicate that such change would become detectable in the future by around 2035. Large changes would already manifest by the time of signal detection; for example, extreme precipitation events that occur on average once every 20, 50, and 100years in current (1986-2005) climate would reduce to about 15, 34, and 63years on average by the time of detection around 2035. Plain Language Summary Understanding causes of changes in extreme precipitation can enhance our confidence in future projections of extreme precipitation. The attribution of cause in changes of extreme precipitation is not straightforward at regional scale, due to the presence of strong natural variability in Earth's climate and the lack of long-term and reliable observational records. This work seeks the anthropogenic signal in extreme precipitation events within the current observational record. It also uses climate models to explore the time at which such a signal would emerge in the future and to assess the associated risks of extreme precipitation events over China. The findings help us to understand the future evolution of Earth's climate and provide useful information for the design and implementation of climate adaptation measures.","[Li, Wei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhihong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xuebin] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Li, Laurent] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Ecole Polytech, Ecole Normale Super,Lab Meteorol Dynam, Paris, France",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Jiang, ZH (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhjiang@nuist.edu.cn,"Li, Laurent/X-3278-2019; Zhang, Xuebin/ABD-7511-2021; Li, Wei/ABF-6887-2020","Li, Laurent/0000-0002-3855-3976; Li, Wei/0000-0003-3561-7345",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0603804]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41675081]; China Scholarship Council (CSC) under State Scholarship Fund; French ANR,National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council (CSC) under State Scholarship Fund(China Scholarship Council); French ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modeling and the modeling groups listed in Table S1 for making their simulations available for analysis and the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Interpretation for collecting and archiving the CMIP5 model output (http://esgf.llnl.gov.).

This can be implemented in climate adaptation plans as an element of asset management. The method is illustrated by a specific case in which traffic on a road network is disrupted by the flooding of a tunnel due to extreme rainfall. Novel techniques to describe both probability of occurrence and consequences of an event are integrated into the proposed risk-based approach. To model a typical climate-change related phenomenon, i.e. rainfall intensity-duration, a model using copulas is proposed as well as a method to account for uncertainty using structured expert judgement. To quantify the consequences, an existing quick scan tool is adopted. The method calculates the risk of flooding of a tunnel, expressed in both probability of occurrence and subsequent additional travel duration on the road network. By comparison of this evolving risk to a societally acceptable threshold, the remaining resilience of the tunnel is evaluated. Furthermore, the method assesses the development of the resilience over time as a result of projected climate change. The maximum time-to-intervention is defined as the period up until the moment when the resilience is depleted. By application of the method to a tunnel in two different contexts, i.e. in a regional road network and a highway network, it is shown that the consequences of tunnel flooding may differ by an order of magnitude (25-fold for the example). Using a risk-based decision-making perspective leads to significant differences in the maximum time-to-intervention. In the example case the year of intervention is determined at 2020 for a tunnel in a highway network, while interventions can be postponed until 2140 in a regional road network.","[Huibregtse, Elja; Hellebrandt, Laura; de Wit, Sten] TNO, Delft, Netherlands; [Napoles, Oswaldo Morales; Paprotny, Dominik] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Delft, Netherlands",Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research; Delft University of Technology,"Huibregtse, E (corresponding author), Van Mourik Broekmanweg 6, NL-2628 XE Delft, Netherlands.",elja.huibregtse@tno.nl; o.moralesnapoles@tudelft.nl; laura.hellebrandt@tno.nl; d.paprotny@tudelft.nl; sten.dewit@tno.nl,"Morales Nápoles, Oswaldo/B-6941-2015; Morales-Nápoles, Oswaldo/N-3224-2019","Morales Nápoles, Oswaldo/0000-0002-6764-4674; Morales-Nápoles, Oswaldo/0000-0002-6764-4674; Paprotny, Dominik/0000-0001-5090-8402",,,,,36,5,5,0,40,EDITORIAL BOARD EJTIR,JAFFALAAN 5,"SECTION TRANSPORT POLICY-TLO, JAFFALAAN 5, JAFFALAAN 5, 2628 BX, NETHERLANDS",1567-7133,1567-7141,,EUR J TRANSP INFRAST,Eur.

This paper presents an innovative method of converting average residential density into a set of one-hectare 3D tiles to represent the dwelling stock. These generic tiles include residential land as well as the dwelling characteristics. The method was based on a detailed analysis of the English House Condition Survey data and density was calculated as the inverse of the plot area per dwelling. This found that when disaggregated by age band, urban morphology and area type, the frequency distribution of plot density per dwelling type can be represented by the gamma distribution. The shape parameter revealed interesting characteristics about the dwelling stock and how this has changed overtime. It showed a consistent trend that older dwellings have greater variability in plot density than newer dwellings, and also that apartments and detached dwellings have greater variability in plot density than terraced and semi-detached dwellings, Once calibrated, the shape parameter of the gamma distribution was used to convert the average density per housing type into a frequency distribution of plot density. These were then approximated by systematically selecting a set of generic tiles. These tiles are particularly useful as a medium for multidisciplinary research on decentralized environmental technologies or climate adaptation, which requires this understanding of the variability of dwellings, occupancies and urban space. It thereby links the socioeconomic modeling of city regions with the physical modeling of dwellings and associated infrastructure across the spatial scales. The tiles method has been validated by comparing results against English regional housing survey data and dwelling footprint area data. The next step would be to explore the possibility of generating generic residential area types and adapt the method to other countries that have similar housing survey data. (C) 2015 The Author.

First, what are the main reasons for concern? Second, how large is the adaptation effort in each region? We address the first question by measuring sensitivity to climate change with Huglin, Cold Night and Dryness Indices over the entire territory, providing information on the adaptation type (e.g. varieties, zoning, water allocation). We then estimate probabilistic projections across scenario, zone and sensitivity indices in the 56 Protected Designation of Origin areas to inform on the magnitude of the adaptation effort. Second, we propose an adaptation effort measure that is framed according to the local environmental context. Results suggest that most areas urgently need an adaptation plan due to the deterioration of production and quality indices as a result of climate change. Potential opportunities in many climate regions might be limited by current policy. The production objectives of quality and quantity trade-offs will probably need to be revised by analysing the sustainability of grapevine production.","[Resco, Pablo] Org Farmers Unions COAG, Madrid, Spain; [Iglesias, Ana; Bardaji, Isabel] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ & Social Sci, Madrid, Spain; [Sotes, Vicente] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Crop Prod, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Iglesias, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ & Social Sci, Madrid, Spain.",presco@coag.org; ana.iglesias@upm.es; isabel.bardaji@upm.es; vicente.sotes@upm.es,"Iglesias, Ana/AEN-3261-2022; BARDAJI, ISABEL/AAS-3286-2020",,European Commission BASE project [308337]; Spanish Meteorological Agency; Spanish office of Climate Change,European Commission BASE project; Spanish Meteorological Agency; Spanish office of Climate Change,"This research was supported by the European Commission BASE project (Grant Agreement No. 308337, Funded under FP7-ENVIRONMENT).

Recently published requirements urge the need for homogenised access to long historical records at a global scale, together with the standardised characterisation of the accuracy of observations. While satellite altimeters offer world coverage measurements, existing initiatives and online platforms provide derived water level data. However, these are sparse, particularly in complex topographies. This study introduces a new methodology in two steps (1) teroVIR, a virtual station extractor for a more comprehensive global and automatic monitoring of water bodies, and (2) teroWAT, a multimission, interoperable water level processor, for handling all terrain types. L2 and L1 altimetry products are used, with state-of-the-art retracker algorithms in the methodology. The work presents a benchmark between teroVIR and current platforms in West Africa, Kazakhastan and the Arctic: teroVIR shows an unprecedented increase from 55% to 99% in spatial coverage. A large-scale validation of teroWAT results in an average of unbiased root mean square error ubRMSE of 0.638 m on average for 36 locations in West Africa. Traditional metrics (ubRMSE, median, absolute deviation, Pearson coefficient) disclose significantly better values for teroWAT when compared with existing platforms, of the order of 8 cm and 5% improved respectively in error and correlation. teroWAT shows unprecedented excellent results in the Arctic, using an L1 products-based algorithm instead of L2, reducing the error by almost 4 m on average. To further compare teroWAT with existing methods, a new scoring option, teroSCO, is presented, measuring the quality of the validation of time series transversally and objectively across different strategies. Finally, teroVIR and teroWAT are implemented as platform-agnostic modules and used by flood forecasting and river discharge methods as relevant examples. A review of various applications for miscellaneous end-users is given, tackling the educational challenge raised by the community.","[Machefer, Melissande; Perpinya-Valles, Marti; Romero, Laia] Lobelia Earth SL, Marie Curie 8-14,A226, Barcelona 08042, Spain; [Escorihuela, Maria Jose] isardSAT, Marie Curie 8-14,A219, Barcelona 08042, Spain; [Gustafsson, David] Sveriges Meteorol & HydrolInst SMHI, Folkborgsvagen 17, SE-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden",,"Machefer, M (corresponding author), Lobelia Earth SL, Marie Curie 8-14,A226, Barcelona 08042, Spain.",melissande@lobelia.earth; marti@lobelia.earth; mj.escorihuela@isardsat.cat; david.gustafsson@smhi.se; laia@lobelia.earth,,"Perpinya-Valles, Marti/0000-0002-9886-9331; Machefer, Melissande/0000-0002-9359-3946; Escorihuela, Maria Jose/0000-0002-7780-7334; Romero, Laia/0000-0001-6476-0875",,,,,38,0,0,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2022,14,15,,,,,,,3513,10.3390/rs14153513,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14153513,,,16,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,3S6WV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000839735400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we have carried out a new multi-proxy investigation of lake sediments, including geochemical and palynological analyses, to reconstruct past changes in temperature and agricultural practices of pre-Viking and Viking societies in Southeastern Norway during the period between 200 and 1300 CE. The periods 200-300 and 800-1300 CE were warmer than the 300-800 CE period, which is known as the Dark Ages Cold Period. This cold period was punctuated by century-scale more temperate intervals, which were dominated by the cultivation of cereals and hemp (before 280 CE, 420-480 CE, 580-700 CE, and after 800 CE). In between, cold intervals were dominated by livestock farming.

There have been negative spillover effects in agriculture. This study aims to assess the climate change impacts on cropland suitability in Kyrgyzstan. We used the random forest algorithm to develop a model that captures the effects of multiple climate and environment factors at a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). The model was then applied in the scenario analysis for an understanding of how climate change affects cropland distribution. The potential high-quality cropland was found to be included in existing croplands, while the remaining were distributed around the Chu-Talas valley, the Issyk-kul area, and the Fergana valley. These potential high-quality croplands comprise grasslands (47.1%) and croplands (43.7%). In the future, the potential high-quality cropland exhibited inland trends at the periphery of original cropland category, with grassland and cropland as the primary land components. Due to climate change, potential high-quality cropland is expected to gradually reduce from the 2050s to the 2070s, exhibiting the largest reduction in potential high-quality areas for the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Therefore, the short- and long-term adaptation strategies are needed for prioritizing the croplands to ensure food security and agricultural resilience.","[Park, Sugyeong] Korea Univ, OJeong Resilience Inst OJERI, 145 Anamro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Lim, Chul-Hee] Kookmin Univ, Coll Gen Educ, 77 Jeongneungro, Seoul 02707, South Korea; [Kim, Sea Jin] Deloitte Anjin LLC, One IFC, Risk Advisory, 10 Gukjegeumyung Ro, Seoul 07326, South Korea; [Isaev, Erkin] Univ Cent Asia, Mt Soc Res Inst, 138 Toktogul St, Bishkek 720001, Kyrgyzstan; [Choi, Sol-E; Lee, Woo-Kyun] Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, 145 Anamro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Lee, Sung-Dae] Yumkwang High Sch, 9,Wolgyero 45Ga-gil, Seoul 01874, South Korea",Korea University; Kookmin University; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited; University of Central Asia; Korea University,"Lee, WK (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, 145 Anamro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",synergyeong@gmail.com; clim@kookmin.ac.kr; bluegulcy@gmail.com; erkin.isaev@ucentralasia.org; pine0630@gmail.com; illskys@kakao.com; leewk@korea.ac.kr,,"Lee, Woo-Kyun/0000-0002-2188-359X; Park, Sugyeong/0000-0002-2065-041X; Isaev, Erkin/0000-0001-8174-6055; Kim, Sea Jin/0000-0002-3627-1596; Lim, Chul-Hee/0000-0001-7752-0694","Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport [20UMRG-B158194-01]","Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport","This research was funded by the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA), grant funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, grant number 20UMRG-B158194-01.",,70,4,4,8,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,AUG,2021,11,8,,,,,,,1490,10.3390/agronomy11081490,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11081490,,,17,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,UF6FK,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000688667400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While studies of the influence of fatalism on disaster preparedness are common, the ways in which fatalism influences climate change skepticism, and in turn affects farmers' interest in crop insurance, have not been previously investigated. An additional objective was to understand farmers' preferences for index versus standard insurance options, the former entailing damage compensation based on post-hazard assessment, the latter tying damage compensation to a set of weather parameter thresholds. A discrete choice experiment was conducted with maize farmers on a climate-risk prone island in coastal Bangladesh. Most farmers were insurance averse. Those who chose insurance were however significantly more likely to select standard as opposed to index-based insurance. Insurance demand was significantly and positively correlated with farmers' concern about the adverse livelihood impacts of climate change. Farmers who exhibited fatalistic views regarding the consequences of climate change were significantly less likely to opt for insurance of either kind. These findings imply that the prospect for farmers' investment in insurance is conditioned by their understanding of climate change risks and the utility of adaptation, in addition to insurance scheme design.","[Akter, Sonia] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore; [Akter, Sonia; Khanam, Fahmida] Int Rice Res Inst, Social Sci Div, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Krupnik, Timothy J.; Khanam, Fahmida] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, House 10-B,Rd 53,Gulshan 2, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh",National University of Singapore; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Akter, S (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore.;Akter, S (corresponding author), Int Rice Res Inst, Social Sci Div, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines.",sonia.akter@nus.edu.sg,"Akter, Sonia/J-2208-2014","Akter, Sonia/0000-0001-5644-9403","Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) at Yale University, through the Microfinance and Payment Innovations Initiative; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF); BMFG; USAID through the CSISA Phase II; CSISA expansion in Bangladesh - USAID-Bangladesh Mission in Bangladesh; Global Rice Science Partnership (GRiSP) program under the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)","Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) at Yale University, through the Microfinance and Payment Innovations Initiative; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); BMFG; USAID through the CSISA Phase II(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); CSISA expansion in Bangladesh - USAID-Bangladesh Mission in Bangladesh(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Global Rice Science Partnership (GRiSP) program under the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)(CGIAR)","This research was funded by Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) at Yale University, through the Microfinance and Payment Innovations Initiative, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF).

It also emphasised the fact that, even in countries with temperate climates, adaptations are needed to cope with increasing future drought frequencies. A crucial component of drought management strategies is to monitor the status of groundwater resources. However, providing up-to-date assessments of regional groundwater drought development remains challenging due to the limited availability of high-quality data. This limits many studies to small selections of groundwater monitoring sites, giving an incomplete image of drought dynamics. In this study, a time series modelling-based method for data preparation was developed and applied to map the spatio-temporal development of the 2018-2019 groundwater drought in the south-eastern Netherlands, based on a large set of monitoring data. The data preparation method was evaluated for its usefulness and reliability for data validation, simulation, and regional groundwater drought assessment. The analysis showed that the 2018-2019 meteorological drought caused extreme groundwater drought throughout the south-eastern Netherlands, breaking 30-year records almost everywhere. Drought onset and duration were strongly variable in space, and higher-elevation areas suffered from severe drought well into 2020. Groundwater drought development appeared to be governed dominantly by the spatial distribution of rainfall and the landscape type. The time series modelling-based data preparation method was found to be a useful tool to enable a spatially detailed record of regional groundwater drought development. The automated time series modelling-based data validation improved the quality and quantity of useable data, although optimal validation parameters are probably context dependent. The time series simulations were generally found to be reliable; however, the use of time series simulations rather than direct measurement series can bias drought estimations, especially at a local scale, and underestimate spatial variability. Further development of time-series-based validation and simulation methods, combined with accessible and consistent monitoring data, will be valuable to enable better groundwater drought monitoring in the future.","[Brakkee, Esther; van Huijgevoort, Marjolein H.

A baseline ice state on both regional and local scales is important for monitoring how the current regional and local states depart from their normal to understand the vulnerability of marine and sea ice-based ecosystems to the changing climate conditions. Combined with up-to-date observations and reliable projections, normals are essential to business strategic planning, climate adaptation and risk mitigation. In this paper, monthly and annual climate normals of sea ice parameters (concentration, area, and extent) of the whole Arctic Ocean and 15 regional divisions are derived for the period of 1981-2010 using monthly satellite sea ice concentration estimates from a climate data record (CDR) produced by NOAA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Basic descriptions and characteristics of the normals are provided. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has been utilized to describe spatial modes of sea ice concentration variability and how the corresponding principal components change over time. To provide users with basic information on data product accuracy and uncertainty, the climate normal values of Arctic sea ice extents (SIE) are compared with that of other products, including a product from NSIDC and two products from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). The SIE differences between different products are in the range of 2.3-4.5% of the CDR SIE mean. Additionally, data uncertainty estimates are represented by using the range (the difference between the maximum and minimum), standard deviation, 10th and 90th percentiles, and the first, second, and third quartile distribution of all monthly values, a distinct feature of these sea ice normal products.

This study applies a water-food-energy nexus modelling framework to evaluate drought impacts on irrigation and agriculture in Sweden using 2018 and 2019 as case studies. A previous water-food-energy nexus model was updated to facilitate an investigation of the benefits of data-driven irrigation scheduling as compared to existing irrigation guidelines. Moreover, the benefits of assimilating earth observation data in the crop model have been explored. The assimilation of leaf area index data from the Copernicus Global Land Service improves the crop yield estimation as compared to default crop model parameters. The results show that the irrigation water productivities of the proposed model are measurably improved compared to conventional and static irrigation guidelines for both 2018 and 2019. This is mostly due to the advantage of the proposed model in providing evapotranspiration in cultural condition (ETc)-driven guidelines by using spatially explicit data generated by mesoscale models from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. During the drought year 2018, the developed model showed no irrigation water savings as compared to irrigation scenarios based on conventional irrigation guidelines. Nevertheless, the crop yield increase from the proposed irrigation management system varied between 10% and 60% as compared to conventional irrigation scenarios. During a normal year, the proposed irrigation management system leads to significant water savings as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines. The modelling results show that temperature stress during the 2018 drought also played a key role in reducing crop yields, with yield reductions of up to 30%. From a water-food-energy nexus, this motivates the implementation of new technologies to reduce water and temperature stress to mitigate likely negative effects of climate change and extremes. By using an open-source package for Google Earth (R), a demonstrator of cost-effective visualization platform is developed for helping farmers, and water- and energy-management agencies to better understand the connections between water and energy use, and food production. This can be significant, especially during the occurrence of extreme events, but also to adapt to the negative effects on agricultural production of climate changes.","[Campana, P.

In this study, an experimental investigation at the micro-scale and also a numerical simulation at the macro-scale of a typical urban environment in Adelaide were conducted to estimate the potential for mitigating the UHI effect. The results showed that existing low albedo materials such as asphalt, metal roofs and brick pavements contribute to the heat island potential. Also, urban development and a lack of natural vegetation contribute to increased temperatures in cities. The ability of two types of extensive and intensive green roofs to reduce the surrounding micro-climate temperature were monitored. The results showed that they have significant cooling effects in summer time and could behave as an insulation layer to keep buildings warmer in the winter. Furthermore, different scenarios of adding green roofs to the Adelaide urban environment were investigated using the Envi-MET model. The scenario modelling of adding green roofs in a typical urban area in Adelaide, Australia, supported the hypothesis that this can lead to reductions in energy consumption in the Adelaide urban environment. Also an increased use of other water sensitive urban design technologies such as green walls and street trees together with the adoption of high albedo materials is recommended for achieving the optimum efficiency in terms of reducing urban temperatures and mitigating urban heat island effects.

The importance of women in the global governance of climate change is self-evident. During the global climate change governance, it is very crucial to focus on achieving gender equality. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is the main channel of global climate change governance, the gender-specific climate change agenda started later than other topics and the progress is limited. This article summarized the progress, deficiencies and future directions of gender issues under the main channels of global climate governance, analyzed the current status of gender equality in Chinese climate response actions, and pointed out the progress and deficiencies of women in the fundamental scientific research and the participation in global governance and decision-making. Our research finds that in the current process of international climate change governance, gender issues have received adequate attention. While in China, despite the attention paid to gender issues, the practical action on gender equality is still out of the mainstream agenda. In the past few decades, Chinese women have made gratifying progress in basic scientific research on climate change and global climate governance, but there are still great insufficiencies in the field of decision-making. In the future, China needs to pay more attention to emphasize gender equality at the strategic level, and promote the formulation of policies and regulations in the field of gender and climate change. Increasing the proportion of women participating in decision-making and management in the field of climate change and disaster prevention and mitigation is also important. China also needs to focus on enabling a gender friendly environment and strengthening research on gender and climate change, support women's participation in relevant work, strengthen capacity-building, and enhance women's access to resources, funds, knowledge and information related to climate adaptation or mitigation.","[Zhang, Yongxiang; Huang, Lei; Chao, Qingchen] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yang, Qingwen] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chao] China Meteorol Adm, Dept Sci Technol & Climate Change, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration; Renmin University of China; China Meteorological Administration,"Zhang, YX (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",helen.zyx@hotmail.com,,,National Key Research and Development Program [2018YFC1509008]; China Meteorological Administration's Special Project on Climate Change [CCSF202043]; Ministry of Ecology and Environment's Special Fund for Addressing Climate Change Research on the follow-up related Capacity Building for the Implementation of the Paris Agreement,National Key Research and Development Program; China Meteorological Administration's Special Project on Climate Change; Ministry of Ecology and Environment's Special Fund for Addressing Climate Change Research on the follow-up related Capacity Building for the Implementation of the Paris Agreement,This article is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program [Grant number. 2018YFC1509008]; China Meteorological Administration's Special Project on Climate Change [Grant Number.

Design/methodology/approach Based on the exposure-sensitivity-adaptability vulnerability assessment framework, this paper establishes the index system of rural social-ecological system vulnerability to climate change. Combined with the questionnaire survey and meteorological data, the entropy method was used to measure and analyze the vulnerability level and influencing factors of the overall rural social-ecological system in Yunnan Province. At the same time, the vulnerability level of social-ecological system in Yunnan Province is divided into five levels, and the spatial differences of vulnerability level of 16 states (cities) in Yunnan Province are analyzed. Findings The results show that: the social-ecological system has high exposure to climate change (0.809), strong sensitivity (0.729), moderate adaptability (0.297) and overall system vulnerability is at a medium level (0.373). Yunnan Province is divided into five levels of social-ecological system vulnerable areas. The areas of extreme, severe, moderate, mild and slight vulnerability account for 21.45%, 24.65%, 36.82%, 13.18% and 3.90% of the whole province, respectively. The geographical division and vulnerability division of Yunnan Province are basically consistent in space. Originality/value Comprehensive evaluation of the vulnerability of the social-ecological system of Yunnan Province to climate change is the scientific basis for the country to formulate countermeasures against climate change, and it is also the need to improve the adaptability of the social and economic system of the fragile area, reduce the vulnerability and realize the sustainable development of national social economy. The research results can provide a basis for decision-making of climate adaptation in Yunnan and other regions and provide methods and indicators for the assessment of social-ecological system vulnerability under the background of climate change.","[He, Yueyue; Zhou, Changchun; Ahmed, Tanveer] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Kunming University of Science & Technology,"Zhou, CC (corresponding author), Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",kmlgdxgjxy@126.com,"Ahmed, Tanveer/AFK-1392-2022; Ahmed, Tanveer/ABC-2863-2021; , CC.

Early integration of stakeholders in participatory processes in the nexus of ecosystem services, climate adaption, and land-use management is still a demanding challenge. This investigation followed a cognitive approach to archetype analysis. We defined cognitive archetypes as recurrent patterns in individual perceptions of social-ecological relations. Our aim was to identify cognitive archetypes based on stakeholders' perceived relation between land-use elements and ecosystem services as exemplified in a German North Sea coastal region. Land-use elements were spatially explicit and delivered a variety of different ecosystem services. The stakeholders were regional decision makers and experts who represented key societal sectors, i.e., water management, agriculture, nature conservation, regional policy, and tourism. Within a participatory process, these stakeholders individually evaluated a matrix of 19 land-use elements and 18 ecosystem services. In terms of archetype analysis, the stakeholders were considered as different cases, and the evaluation of relationships between land-use elements and ecosystem services built the attributions to identify archetypes. They independently agreed on the relevance of close to one-third of 342 attributions, whereas there was disagreement on approximately two-thirds of the possible attributions. By identifying agreements across different sectors, 2 archetypes in land-use element-ecosystem service attributions were identified. The first archetype built on monofunctional attributions, i.e., one land-use element was relevant for the provision of one ecosystem service. The second archetype described land-use elements attributed to bundles of ecosystem services, indicating multifunctionality of land-use elements. Disagreement can result primarily from sector or individual viewpoints. In the case of disagreements, land-use-ecosystem relationships can reveal archetypical mutually exclusive interests, the third archetype. We found that disagreements were mainly individual and not sector specific. This indicated that individual knowledge on service outputs of multiple land uses differed strongly among the stakeholders, particularly with respect to regulatory services.","[Karrasch, Leena] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ecol Econ, Oldenburg, Germany; [Karrasch, Leena; Klenke, Thomas] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, COAST Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, Oldenburg, Germany; [Kleyer, Michael] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Landscape Ecol Grp, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Karrasch, L (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ecol Econ, Oldenburg, Germany.;Karrasch, L (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, COAST Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, Oldenburg, Germany.",,,"Karrasch, Leena/0000-0002-7722-1720; Klenke, Thomas/0000-0001-7190-8495",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LL0911],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The authors would like to thank the stakeholders who took an active part in our study.

City gaming works along with the understanding that cities are self-organizing systems, influenced by multiple bottom-up and top-down actors with varying interests and powers. Affordable housing, climate adaptation, or area development are examples of urgent urban challenges city games typically focus on. The assumption is that if these specialized games could be linked, then a large game infrastructure built as a modular system, can offer various game combinations responding to urban challenges in an integral and holistic way. To test a working game network, city games, models, and digital apps have been linked through their shared datasets as well as game interfaces. Two city experiments have been conducted in two Dutch cities-Amsterdam and Breda-which enabled the testing to function as constructive design research. In Amsterdam (Klimaatspel) two separate city games were connected through their datasets, while in Breda (Play the Koepel) datasets and interfaces merged to create a new game. Used data models are the Energy Transition Model developed by Quintel and the urban plan cost simulator software of Urban Reality. Used game interfaces (digital and analog) include the Typeform, the Network of Games app, the Urban Reality simulator, and the Play the City table-top game format. The testing considered two different approaches for a potential game network. The first option assumes an all-encompassing digital app, reformatting and involving various games and models in a single interface. The second option is an open approach that looks to link custom-made games with existing interfaces. The second option allows both simultaneous and sequential linking. Two experiments utilizing sequential and simultaneous integration of diverse digital tools suggest that a collection of interfaces connecting to each other throughout the entire process from a digital poll to an app, a simulator or a webinar, or analog game sessions is more effective than a single mobile phone app for all potential game interactions. Considering city games as an ecology of city tools that can be linked to one another becomes through this study a concrete goal to reach. Through combining specialized games, addressing complex city challenges becomes possible. This step enables a more effective participation environment for diverse experts and non-experts.","[Tan, Ekim] Play City Fdn, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Tan, E (corresponding author), Play City Fdn, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",ekim@playthecity.eu,,,,,,,10,1,1,1,2,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-7635,,,URBAN PLAN,Urban Plan.,,2022,7,2,,,,,264,277,,10.17645/up.v7i2.5136,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v7i2.5136,,,14,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,2R2ZD,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000820979800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We drew on 25 semi-structured interviews with community leaders, farmers, fisherfolk, and individuals in the tourism industry in northwestern Pakistan to identify types of adaptations employed by households and explore what values were present in these households' adaptation decisions. Our results show that households frequently employed environmental management and livelihood diversification to adapt to a wide range of social-ecological change. We found that multiple values influenced household adaptation and that employing an adaptation strategy often involved a tradeoff of values. We also found that household adaptations were embedded in multi-scalar social, cultural, economic, and political processes that could constrain or conflict with such adaptations. Overall, our research illustrates the complex influence of values on household adaptation decisions and highlights the need to further understand how adaptations are aligned, or misaligned, with stakeholders' diverse values in order to inform more equitable adaptation to social-ecological change.","[Nixon, Rebecca] Purdue Univ, Illinois Indiana Sea Grant, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Nixon, Rebecca; Ma, Zhao] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Zanotti, Laura] Purdue Univ, Dept Anthropol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Khan, Bushra] Univ Peshawar, Dept Environm Sci, Peshawar, KP, Pakistan; [Birkenholtz, Trevor] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lee, Linda] Purdue Univ, Dept Agron, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Mian, Ishaq] Univ Agr Peshawar, Dept Soil & Environm Sci, Peshawar, KP, Pakistan",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Peshawar; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Nixon, R (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Illinois Indiana Sea Grant, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Nixon, R (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",nixon17@purdue.edu,"Ma, Zhao/P-2622-2019; Zanotti, Laura/HLG-3622-2023; Ma, Zhao/M-7657-2013","Ma, Zhao/0000-0002-9103-3996; Ma, Zhao/0000-0002-9103-3996; Zanotti, Laura C/0000-0003-2712-4284; Imran, Dr. Imran/0000-0002-9459-0130; Nixon, Rebecca/0000-0003-3418-4971",United States Government; American people through the United States Department of State; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Pakistan-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation Program,United States Government; American people through the United States Department of State; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Pakistan-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation Program(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),This research was funded by a grant from the United States Government and the generous support of the American people through the United States Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Pakistan-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation Program.

Risks of coastal erosion and marine flooding result both from climate-related ocean changes and anthropogenic drivers such as inappropriate coastal development and structural protection measures. Poor development planning and lack of coordination between public and private actors have increased the exposure of human assets along the Mauritius coastline. To reduce these risks, the government leads risk reduction activities in coastal zones, functioning on a centralized top-down governance approach. In recent years, this governance framework has been evolving by opening up participatory channels and exploring a long-term adaptation perspective. Progress is driven by international engagements and demonstration projects to embrace soft measures, nature-based options and integrated solutions. We review a selection of pilot projects undertaken by the government that illustrate flexibility in a 'learning by doing' model. However, we find that certain governance arrangements do not allow to draw the most from ad hoc projects because they do not feed into a long-term comprehensive plan. We consider the role of evidence and risk assessments, learning processes and coordination mechanisms as key governance mechanisms required for a robust and evolving national coastal risk reduction and adaptation policy framework.","[Anisimov, Ariadna; Magnan, Alexandre K.] Sci Po, Inst Sustainable Dev & Int Relat, 27 Rue St Guillaume, Paris 75007, France; [Magnan, Alexandre K.; Duvat, Virginie K.

The limited information on hydroclimatic change motivates developing hydrologic scenarios from 1950 to 2099 using climate-hydrology impact modeling chains consisting of multiple statistically downscaled climate projections as input to hydrologic model simulations for both states. We adopt an approach similar to the previous CONUS hydrologic assessments where: 1) we select the outputs from ten global climate models (GCM) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 with Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5; 2) we perform statistical downscaling to generate climate input data for hydrologic models (12-km grid-spacing for Alaska and 1km for HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai); and 3) we perform process-based hydrologic model simulations. For Alaska, we have advanced the hydrologic model configuration from CONUS by using the full water-energy balance computation, frozen soils and a simple glacier model. The simulations show that robust warming and increases in precipitation produce runoff increases for most of Alaska, with runoff reductions in the currently glacierized areas in Southeast Alaska. For HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, we produce the projections at high resolution (1 km) which highlight high spatial variability of climate variables across the state, and a large spread of runoff across the GCMs is driven by a large precipitation spread across the GCMs. Our new ensemble datasets assist with state-wide climate adaptation and other water planning.","[Mizukami, Naoki; Newman, Andrew J.; Wood, Andrew W.; Gutmann, Ethan D.; Hamman, Joseph J.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Littell, Jeremy S.] US Geol Survey Alaska Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK USA; [Giambelluca, Thomas W.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geog, Honolulu, HI USA; [Hamman, Joseph J.] CarbonPlan, San Francisco, CA USA; [Gergel, Diana R.] BlackRock, Charlotte, NC USA; [Nijssen, Bart] Univ Washington Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA USA; [Clark, Martyn P.] Univ Saskatchewan, Ctr Hydrol, Canmore, AB, Canada; [Arnold, Jeffrey R.] US Army Corps Engineers, Responses Climate Change Program, Seattle, WA USA; [Arnold, Jeffrey R.] MITRE Corp, Mclean, VA USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Saskatchewan; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; MITRE Corporation,"Mizukami, N (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",mizukami@ucar.edu,"Mizukami, Naoki/J-7027-2015","Mizukami, Naoki/0000-0002-0893-5869",U.S Army Corps of Engineers Climate Preparedness and Resilience program; National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR); National Science Foundation [1852977],U.S Army Corps of Engineers Climate Preparedness and Resilience program; National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was financially supported by the U.S Army Corps of En-gineers Climate Preparedness and Resilience program, and by the Na-tional Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), which is a major facility sponsored by the National Science Foundation under Coopera-tive Agreement No. 1852977.

Identifying how stressors relate to shifts in vegetation growth is critical for maintaining the health and stability of its regional ecosystems. To address this, we constructed a 20-year dataset (1999-2018) reflecting changes in satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), climate variables, and land use in the DRW. We then used time series, principal component, and partial correlation analyses to detect spatial and temporal patterns in vegetation dynamics over time, as well as linkages with temperature, precipitation, and anthropogenic activities. Over 20 years, the DRW exhibited a warming-greening trend and experienced four regime shifts in its climate-vegetation system, roughly centered on 2001, 2006, 2013, and 2016. Both the average and maximum NDVI increased in all seasons, likely due to favorable changes in seasonal climatic conditions. Temperature was the dominant factor promoting vegetative growth in spring, autumn, and throughout the growing season. Precipitation had a considerable positive effect on the average NDVI during the summer. Spatial analyses indicated that 67.94% of the study area exhibited significant increase in NDVI values over time, mainly locating in the mountains and in Dongping County; Significant NDVI decrease was generally located in the urban expansion areas around cities and counties. Land cover types and annual growth cycles appeared to govern spatial patterns and the extent of variation in vegetation growth, followed by land use-related drivers and climate anomalies. These findings offer an insight on appropriate ecological management and climatic adaptation within the Dawen River Watershed.","[Niu, Beibei; Li, Xinju] Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Fuqiang; Wang, Ying] Shandong Bur Coal Geol, Explorat Team 3, Tai An 271000, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiao] Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong Agricultural University; Shandong Agricultural University,"Hu, X (corresponding author), Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.",huxiaozhy@163.com,,"Xiao, Hu/0000-0002-6205-5889",Special Fund for Scientific Research of Shandong Bureau of Coal Geology [2019-8],Special Fund for Scientific Research of Shandong Bureau of Coal Geology,This work was supported by the Special Fund for Scientific Research of Shandong Bureau of Coal Geology (Grant number 2019-8).,,68,3,3,8,32,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an evidence on the impacts of climate change on China's agriculture, with particular attention to the market and trade responses. Using projected crop yield changes for China and its' main trading partners under changing climate, we employ an agricultural partial equilibrium model (CAPSiM) and a linked national and global equilibrium model (CAPSiM-GTAP) to assess the impacts on food production, price, trade and self-sufficiency of China. Our results show that climate change will have significant effects on crop production though with large differences among crops. Under the worst climate change scenario RCP 8.5, wheat yield in China is projected to decline by 9.4% by 2050, which is the biggest yield reduction among the crops. However, the market can also respond to the climate change, as farmers can change inputs in response to reduced yields and rising prices. As a result, production losses for most crops are dampened. For example, wheat production loss under RCP8.5 reduces to only 4.3% due to market response. The adverse impacts on crop production will be further reduced after accounting for the trade response as farmers adjust production to much higher prices in the more severely affected countries. The paper concludes that we need to learn more from farmers who optimize their production decisions in response to the market and trade signals during climate change. A major policy implication is that policymakers need to mainstream the market and trade responses into national plans for climate adaptation.","[Xie, Wei; Huang, Jikun; Wang, Jinxia; Cui, Qi] Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Robertson, Ricky; Chen, Kevin] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Cui, Qi] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Resource Management, Beijing Key Lab Study Sci Tech Strategy Urban Gre, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Peking University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Beijing Normal University,"Huang, JK; Cui, Q (corresponding author), Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Cui, Q (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Resource Management, Beijing Key Lab Study Sci Tech Strategy Urban Gre, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@pku.edu.cn; cuiqi.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"Chen, Kevin/GYU-8963-2022","Cui, Qi/0000-0002-3704-8257","Ministry of Science and Technology, China [2012CB955700]; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [71503243, 71873009, 71333013]; NSFC-CGIAR [71161140351]; Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research [ADP/2010/070]; National Social Science Fund of China [16AJL009]","Ministry of Science and Technology, China(Ministry of Science and Technology, ChinaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NSFC-CGIAR(CGIAR); Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research; National Social Science Fund of China","The authors acknowledge their respective financial supports from Ministry of Science and Technology, China (2012CB955700), National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (71503243; 71873009; 71333013), NSFC-CGIAR (71161140351), Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ADP/2010/070), and National Social Science Fund of China (16AJL009).",,38,42,42,27,103,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

These are often vulnerable to climate change and other pressures. Therefore, enhancing resilience to climate change is important for their long term viability. This paper explores how management options can be evaluated on their resilience implications. The approach included five steps: (1) characterizing the system, (2) characterizing the impacts of climate change and other disturbances, (3) inventorying management options, (4) assessing the impacts of these on climate resilience, and (5) follow-up analysis. For the resilience assessment, we used a set of 'resilience principles': homeostasis, omnivory, high flux, flatness, buffering, and redundancy. We applied the approach in a case study in a Dutch wetlands region. Many options in the region's management plan contribute to resilience, however, the plan underutilised several principles, particularly flatness, but also redundancy and omnivory for agriculture, and high flux for nature. Co-benefits was identified as an important additional criterion to obtain support for adaptation from local stakeholders, such as farmers. The approach provided a relatively quick and participatory way to screen options. It allowed us to consider multiple impacts and sectors, multiple dimensions of resilience, and stakeholder perspectives. The results can be used to identify gaps or pitfalls, and set priorities for follow-up analyses.","[Wardekker, J. A.; Wildschut, D.; Stemberger, S.; van der Sluijs, J.

Outcomes in these regards are changes beyond the walls of the research organisation (typically to values, attitudes and behaviour). The authors recognise that outcome evaluation is essential in ensuring the relevance and effectiveness of activities. To date, however, there is a limited appreciation within the EMS community of the nature of the challenge inherent in outcome evaluations. The paper presents an exploratory analysis of the challenges that outcome assessment raises for EMS. It does so using mutually reinforcing conceptual and practical perspectives. The paper presents a conceptual framework of three loosely coupled phases research, development and operations. The nature of activities and their interactions within these phases is outlined and the forms of evaluation associated with each stage set out. The paper notes how existing forms of evaluation (e.g. peer review, validation and relevance) underpin the delivery of outcomes but do not of themselves evaluate outcomes. The paper proposes that outcomes need conceptually to be seen as an element of complex social processes mediated by government, regulation, markets and the media rather than as simply another form of output from research and development projects. As such outcomes of EMS are: less easily tangible than are outputs; more likely to occur at a significant time lag after any intervention; more difficult to assign causality for and to be subject to significant contestation. Thus EMS activity, however well conducted technically, may only have a minor influence on outcomes and EMS practitioners will have limited control over those outcomes that do occur. The paper uses a series of linked EMS projects to populate the conceptual framework showing the role of evaluations in research, development and operations phases. The paper then presents two forms (quantitative and qualitative) of outcome evaluation used as part of an operational phase evaluation of a project communicating the consequences of climate change to remote-rural land managers in Scotland. The authors conclude that while the challenges of EMS evaluation can be met, there needs to be care from the EMS community not to raise expectations of outcomes that cannot be met.

Rising sea levels, extreme temperatures, and drier conditions are the impacts with the most significant potential to amplify the economic damage on islands. However, their isolation and natural conditions bring about some leeway to respond to climate impacts on their terms. This paper aims to provide a local-level analysis and ranking of alternative adaptation pathways in an island context through the stakeholders' lens. This study reviews the latest advancements in adaptation science and proposes a catalogue of adaptation and risk management options that feed a participatory assessment and ranking by local stakeholders. The research was conducted on the island of Sicily (Italy) and saw the participation of high-level experts and tourism, energy, and maritime transport representatives. It employs a sequential process of four ordered steps oriented towards adaptation planning and stakeholders' engagement. The process reveals breaches between what stakeholders' would prioritise when designing policy pathways and their opinion about the most beneficial and balanced adaptation programmes across the sustainability criteria. Results indicate that, according to stakeholders, the priorities are to prepare the energy, tourism, and maritime transport sectors to confront future climate-related events more efficiently. Other transformational actions to ensure long-term social-ecological resilience, which requires significant structural changes and substantial investments, are not at the core of the public needs.","[Leon, Carmelo J.; Lam Gonzalez, Yen E.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Tourism & Sustainable Econ Dev, Campus Tafira, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Ruggieri, Giovanni] Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat, Viale Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Calo, Patrizia] Observ Tourism Isl Econ OTIE, Via Emerico Amari 38, I-90139 Palermo, Italy",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of Palermo,"Ruggieri, G (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat, Viale Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",carmelo.leon@ulpgc.es; yen.lam@ulpgc.es; giovanni.ruggieri@unipa.it; research@otie.org,"Ruggieri, Giovanni/AAZ-9204-2020; Lam Gonzalez, Yen E./F-8057-2016","Ruggieri, Giovanni/0000-0001-9085-4509; Lam Gonzalez, Yen E./0000-0002-3239-9795",European Union [776661]; Interreg MAC 2014-2020 programme [MACCLIMA_MAC2/3.5b/254],European Union(European Commission); Interreg MAC 2014-2020 programme,"Research for this paper has been supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 776661, project SOCLIMPACT, and the Interreg MAC 2014-2020 programme under the contract MACCLIMA_MAC2/3.5b/254.",,81,1,1,8,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,AUG,2022,11,8,,,,,,,1206,10.3390/land11081206,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11081206,,,21,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4B1VF,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000845573600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Regional Climate Model (RCM) outputs from CNRM-CM5/RCA4, EC-EARTH/RACMO22E and NorESM1-M/HIRHAM5 with the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios were utilized to drive the HBV-Light (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) hydrological model. A trend analysis was performed with the Mann-Kendall trend test for precipitation and temperature projections. A meteorological drought assessment was presented using the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) method for the worst-case scenario (i.e., RCP8.5). The calibrated and validated hydrological model was used for streamflow simulations in the basin for the period 2022-2100. The selected climate models were found to produce high precipitation projections with positive anomalies ranging from 22 to 227 mm. The increase in annual mean temperatures reached up to 1.8 degrees C and 2.6 degrees C for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The trend results showed statistically insignificant upward and downward trends in precipitation and statistically significant upward trends in temperatures at 5% significance level for both RCP scenarios. It was shown that there is a significant increase in drought intensities and durations for SPEI greater than 6 months after mid- century. Streamflow simulations showed decreasing trends for both RCP scenarios due to upward trend in temperature and, hence, evapotranspiration. Streamflow peaks obtained with the RCP8.5 scenario were generally lower than those obtained with the RCP4.5 scenario. The mean values of the streamflow simulations from the CNRM-CM5/RCA4 and NorESM1-M/HIRHAM5 outputs were approximately 2 to 10% lower than the observation mean. On the other hand, the average value obtained from the EC-EARTH/RACMO 22E outputs was significantly higher than the observation average, up to 32%. The results of this study can be useful for evaluating the impact of climate change on streamflow and developing sustainable climate adaptation options in the Ayazma river basin.","[Seddiqe, Khaja Haroon; Sediqi, Rahmatullah] Eskisehir Tech Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Iki Eylul Campus, TR-26555 Eskisehir, Turkey; [Yildiz, Osman; Akturk, Gaye] Kirikkale Univ, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Civil Engn, TR-71450 Ankara, Kirikkale, Turkey; [Kostecki, Jakub; Gortych, Marta] Univ Zielona Gora, Inst Environm Engn, PL-65516 Zielona Gora, Poland",,"Seddiqe, KH (corresponding author), Eskisehir Tech Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Iki Eylul Campus, TR-26555 Eskisehir, Turkey.;Kostecki, J (corresponding author), Univ Zielona Gora, Inst Environm Engn, PL-65516 Zielona Gora, Poland.",khs@ogr.eskisehir.edu.tr; j.kostecki@iis.uz.zgora.pl,,,,,,,55,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2023,15,4,,,,,,,763,10.3390/w15040763,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15040763,,,24,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,9M4BZ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000942178700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, the production of spatial information on these crops are often overlooked in favor of annual food crops. Remote sensing detection of coffee faces a particular set of challenges due to persistent cloud cover in the tropical coffee belt, hilly topography in coffee growing regions, diversity of coffee growing systems, and spectral similarity to other tree crops and agricultural land. Looking at the major coffee growing region in Dak Lak, Vietnam, we integrate multi-temporal 10 m optical Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data in order to map three coffee production systems: i) open-canopy sun coffee, ii) intercropped and other shaded coffee and iii) newly planted or young coffee. Leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE), we compute five sets of features in order to best enhance separability between coffee and other land cover and within coffee production systems. The features include Sentinel-2 dry and wet season composites, Sentinel-1 texture features, Sentinel-1 spatiotemporal metrics, and topographic features. Using a random forest classification algorithm, we produce a 9-class land cover map including our three coffee production classes and a binary coffee/non-coffee map. The binary map has an overall accuracy of 89% and the three coffee production systems have user accuracies of 65, 56, 71% for sun coffee, intercropped coffee and newly planted coffee, respectively. This is a first effort at large-scale distinction of within-crop production styles and has implications across many applications. The binary coffee map can be used as a high-resolution crop mask, whereas the detailed land cover map can inform monitoring of deforestation dynamics, biodiversity, sustainability certification and implementation of climate adaptation strategies. This work offers a scalable approach to integrating optical and radar Sentinel data for production of spatially explicit agricultural infor-mation and contributes particularly to tree crop and agroforestry mapping, which often is overlooked in between agricultural and forestry sciences.","[Maskell, Gina; Chemura, Abel; Gornott, Christoph] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Maskell, Gina; Chemura, Abel; Gornott, Christoph] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam, Germany; [Nguyen, Huong] Tay Nguyen Univ, Dept Forest Resource & Environm Management FREM, Buon Ma Thuot, Dak Lak Provinc, Vietnam; [Gornott, Christoph] Univ Kassel, Dept Agroecosyst Anal & Modelling, Kassel, Germany; [Mondal, Pinki] Univ Delaware, Dept Geog & Spatial Sci, Newark, DE USA; [Mondal, Pinki] Univ Delaware, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Newark, DE 19717 USA",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Tay Nguyen University; Universitat Kassel; University of Delaware; University of Delaware,"Maskell, G (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",maskell@pik-potsdam.de,"Gornott, Christoph/ABI-8107-2020; Mondal, Pinki/AFU-2382-2022","Gornott, Christoph/0000-0003-3933-3358; ",University of Delaware Research Foundation - Berlin-Potsdam Research Network Geo.X,University of Delaware Research Foundation - Berlin-Potsdam Research Network Geo.X,"We are grateful to Pamela D.

This paper aims to examine the determinants of household decisions to adapt, it is also possible to target factors that facilitate or constrain adaptation. This helps to identify key components of current adaptive capacity, which leads to important insights into households' competence to adapt in the future. Design/methodology/approach This paper takes a full-pledged approach examining factors and processes that shape households' climate adaptation decision-making in rural Cambodia at three levels: adaptation status, adaptation intensity and choices of adaptation strategy. The three-stage analyses are materialized by applying the double hurdle model and multivariate probit model, which provides a potential way to systematically assess household adaptation decision-making in rural settings. Findings Results show a high level of involvement in adaptation among local households who are facing multiple stressors including climatic risks. The findings suggest that perceived climate change influence households' decisions in both adaptation status and intensity. Access to financial credit, farmland size, water availability and physical asset holdings are identified as key factors promoting the adoption of more adaptation measures. To facilitate adaptation, collective effort and support at community level is important in providing knowledge based climate information dissemination and early warning systems. Public sector support and development aid programs should focus on positive triggers for targeted community and household adaptation. Originality/value The study, to the authors' best knowledge, is one of the first studies to investigate the determinants of local adaptation decision-making systematically in Cambodia. It also provides a comprehensive approach to improve understanding of adaptation decision-making processes by exploring how various capital assets are associated with different stages of adaptation decisions. The findings contribute to policy implications enlightening adaptation planning at multi-scales with knowledge of key factors, which enhance local adaptive capacity to reduce climate change vulnerability.","[Jiao, Xi] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Zheng, Yuan] Yunnan Univ, Sch Econ, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yuan] New Dev Bank, Dept Strategy & Partnerships, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhen] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Peoples R China",University of Copenhagen; Yunnan University; Nanjing Normal University,"Liu, Z (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",zhenliu_cn@yahoo.com,,,Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate (EMJD) Programme; Forest and Nature for Society (FONASO); Research Council of the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603126]; International Cooperation [71911530164]; Cambodia Development Resource Institute (CDRI); Greater Mekong Sub-region Environment Operations Center (GMS EOC),Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate (EMJD) Programme; Forest and Nature for Society (FONASO); Research Council of the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Cooperation; Cambodia Development Resource Institute (CDRI); Greater Mekong Sub-region Environment Operations Center (GMS EOC),"Financial support under the Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate (EMJD) Programme, Forest and Nature for Society (FONASO), the Research Council of the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs National Natural Science Foundation of China: (71603126) and International Cooperation (71911530164) are gratefully acknowledged.

However, different GCMs are not always in agreement with each other over various regions. The reason is that GCMs' configurations, module characteristics, and dynamic forcings vary from one to another. Model ensemble techniques are extensively used to post-process the outputs from GCMs and improve the variability of model outputs. Root-mean-square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (CC, or R) and uncertainty are commonly used statistics for evaluating the performances of GCMs. However, the simultaneous achievements of all satisfactory statistics cannot be guaranteed in using many model ensemble techniques. In this paper, we propose a multi-model ensemble framework, using a state-of-art evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm (termed MOSPD), to evaluate different characteristics of ensemble candidates and to provide comprehensive trade-off information for different model ensemble solutions. A case study of optimizing the surface air temperature (SAT) ensemble solutions over different geographical regions of China is carried out. The data covers from the period of 1900 to 2100, and the projections of SAT are analyzed with regard to three different statistical indices (i.e., RMSE, CC, and uncertainty). Among the derived ensemble solutions, the trade-off information is further analyzed with a robust Pareto front with respect to different statistics. The comparison results over historical period (1900-2005) show that the optimized solutions are superior over that obtained simple model average, as well as any single GCM output. The improvements of statistics are varying for different climatic regions over China. Future projection (2006-2100) with the proposed ensemble method identifies that the largest (smallest) temperature changes will happen in the South Central China (the Inner Mongolia), the North Eastern China (the South Central China), and the North Western China (the South Central China), under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively.","[Yang, Tiantian; Tao, Yumeng] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Li, Jingjing] Calif State Univ, Dept Geosci & Environm, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Zhu, Qian] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Hydrol & Water Resources, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Su, Lu] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [He, Xiaojia] Adm Ctr Chinas Agenda21, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaoming] Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Irvine; California State University System; California State University Los Angeles; Zhejiang University; Beijing Normal University; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research,"Yang, TT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",tiantiay@uci.edu,"Zhu, Qian/GXV-9916-2022; Yang, Tiantian/P-5989-2016","Yang, Tiantian/0000-0002-0148-396X; Zhu, Qian/0000-0002-2646-2604","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41622101]; NASA MIRO grant [NNX15AQ06A]; DOE [DE-IA0000018]; NASA [NNX15AQ06A, 802110] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NASA MIRO grant; DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41622101), the NASA MIRO grant (NNX15AQ06A) program, and the DOE (Prime Award No. DE-IA0000018).

To this end, the historical and future changing trends of key hydrometeorological variables, including precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and runoff were analyzed in detail for each water zone across China. The climate elasticity method was also established to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on historical runoff variations. The results indicate that the characteristics and causes of runoff variations in China were generally spatially heterogeneous. The runoff in water-scarce river basins of northern China decreased significantly during the period of 1961-2018, variations of which were more sensitive to human activities. For southern water zones in China, the runoff showed no significant trend and climate change was the main influencing factor. On basis of 9 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate model ensemble simulations under three different shared socioeconomic pathways (ssp126, ssp245 and ssp585), the future runoff in 10 typical basins of the water zones were projected and the results suggested an increasing trend of runoff over China, thanks to increasing precipitation in the rest 21 century. While under ssp585, the rising air temperature tends to evaporate more water and offset the effect of precipitation increase to some extent, resulting in that the increments of runoff under ssp585 are not necessarily greater than those under ssp245 and ssp126. Overall, our study could be used as a basis to support climate adaptation strategies and policies to cope with future water resources conditions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, the effect of tropical and extra-tropical climate modes such as Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on wind-wave climate of the Indian Ocean (IO) is studied using multiple linear regression of individual climate indices on relevant wind-wave parameters. There are two regions of importance for swell generation in the Indian Ocean - a region between 40 degrees and 60 degrees S in the Southern Ocean (SO) and another region in the Eastern Tropical Indian Ocean (ETIO; 10 degrees-30 degrees S, 60 degrees-100 degrees E). SAM, the strongest inter-annual mode of the SO, generates swells in the 40 degrees-60 degrees S band throughout the year that eventually propagates to the entire North IO. Both the positive and negative phases of SAM generate swells from SO, but it's genesis region vary meridionally depending on the phase of SAM. The positive phase of ENSO (LaNina) generally reduce the westerly wind anomalies in the SO caused by a positive phase of SAM and hence reduce the swell generation from SO, but causes stronger south-easterlies in the ETIO, generating more swells from there. IOD that peaks in September-October-November period has its effect on swell generation limited to eastern equatorial IO. Our analysis suggests that interannual climate features are important in modulating wind-wave climate of IO and a basin-wide model set-up with an accurate representation of various interannual climate features is a prerequisite for accurate wave forecast.","[Remya, P.

The research zooms in on lake Volkerak-Zoom. Interviews confirm that 'negotiated knowledge', shaped by the agricultural sector, NGO's and water managers can lead to strategies to improve water quality problems. One such a strategy, based on negotiated knowledge, is to create an inlet to allow limited tides and inflow of saline waters in Lake Volkerak-Zoom. Meanwhile, during negotiations, monitoring showed an autonomous decline in the annually returning algal blooms, leading to new uncertainties and disrupting the negotiations. At another negotiation arena, water users and policy makers repeatedly disputed scientific assessments about costs and benefits regarding additional freshwater supply for agriculture and the knowledge underlying proposed decisions was still considered uncertain in 2014. Several strategies have been observed to deal with uncertainties in decision making, such as deconstruction of certainties, creation of deadlines for decisions and selection of preferred solutions based upon the No-regret principle'. The risk of a lengthy decision making process can be reduced when the responsible authorities recognize, acknowledge and give an equal role to these behavioural strategies to address uncertainties. Tailor-made strategies are needed to make knowledge use more efficient, for example, joint-factfinding (in case of disputed knowledge and ambiguity), additional research and monitoring (in case of epistemic uncertainty) or commissioning research whereby temporarily a protected environment is created to allow research without political interference (in case of ontic/structural uncertainty).","[Veraart, J.

However, knowledge about T-opt in natural ecosystems remains limited, especially at large scales, which increases the uncertainty of climate projections. Here, we collected 25 soils from tropical to cold temperate forests in the northern hemisphere to quantify regional variation in T-opt and the controls underlying this variation. R-h was measured at high frequency using a novel system under the mode, with temperature gradually increasing from 5 to 50 degrees C. The results showed that T-opt ranged from 38.5 to 46.0 degrees C (mean: 42.4 degrees C). Of note, this study is the first to demonstrate that T-opt is far higher than the assumed value used in models (35 degrees C), varying greatly across different climatic zones and increasing with latitude from tropical to cold-temperate forest soils. To some extent, our results supported the substrate supply hypothesis, and contrast with the climate adaption hypothesis. In addition, climate, nutrient, and soil microorganisms jointly regulate regional variation in T-opt together explaining 53% of variation in T-opt. The higher T-opt in northern regions indicated that these regions have a greater potential to release more CO2 from soil, which might lead to a positive feedback to global warming. In conclusion, process-based models should incorporate the high variability of T-opt across regions to improve predictions of the carbon dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems under climate warming scenarios.","[Liu, Yuan; He, Nianpeng; Wen, Xuefa; Xu, Li; Sun, Xiaomin; Yu, Guirui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yuan; He, Nianpeng; Wen, Xuefa; Sun, Xiaomin; Yu, Guirui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environment, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [He, Nianpeng] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China; [He, Nianpeng] Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Liang, Liyin; Schipper, Louis A.] Univ Waikato, Sch Sci, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton, New Zealand","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Northeast Normal University - China; University of Waikato","He, NP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",henp@igsnrr.ac.cn,"于, 贵瑞/C-1768-2014; Liu, Yuan/P-3172-2019; Liu, Yuan/GSI-7550-2022; Liáng, Lìyǐn Lín/G-4503-2015; Schipper, Louis A/F-1605-2010","于, 贵瑞/0000-0002-1859-8966; Liu, Yuan/0000-0001-8350-5773; Liáng, Lìyǐn Lín/0000-0001-9831-4793; Schipper, Louis A/0000-0001-9899-1276; he, nianpeng/0000-0002-0458-5953","Natural Science Foundation of China [31770655, 41571130043]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0500202]; program of Youth Innovation Research Team Project [LENOM2016Q0005]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; program of Youth Innovation Research Team Project,"This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (31770655 and 41571130043), the National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFC0500202), and the program of Youth Innovation Research Team Project (LENOM2016Q0005).

This landmark and its surroundings will be refurbished in the years to come and will be transformed into a mixed-use development, the Aerospace Campus, with residential buildings, and commercial, sports, educational and cultural facilities. This new district has been planned mostly on the basis of heritage and functional rules. The UCI project (from Urban Cool Islands) is a French national research project that discusses procedures aiming at incorporating a set of reasoned measures for local climate adaptation into this new urban area that will be set as a landmark development. This research aims to analyse and compare various suitable, resilient urban design strategies to provide support for their application in the Montaudran district, focusing on mitigating urban heat island effects in summer conditions. Three main methodological steps were undertaken: (1) the initial urban plan was assessed relative to a set of well-known urban morphology parameters and a microclimate analysis; (2) a set of urban design variations was established based on important microclimate adaptation measures as well as on the constraints and opportunities of the original plan; (3) the microclimate was modelled and the thermal comfort of pedestrians analysed. Results pointed out the major influence of water and green features on the mitigation of urban heat islands, notably in daytime. Besides creating an important urban cool island for pedestrians, the results showed great opportunities for supporting decision makers on specific integrated actions towards a truly sustainable neighbourhood.

The key biological parameters of the parasitoid T. zahiri in relation to temperature were investigated to find out its candidature as a potential biological control agent of rice hispa. The highest number of eggs parasitized by T. zahiri was 15.7 eggs per female at 26 degrees C, which differed significantly from those at 18, 22, 30, and 34 degrees C (P < 0.05). Development duration and longevity of T. zahiri decreased as temperature increased. Fecundity differed significantly at all constant temperatures. Emergence rates decreased at both high (34 degrees C) and low ( < 26 degrees C) temperatures. Female-biased sex ratio ranged from 54 to 70% at all constant temperatures. The lower temperature threshold for T. zahiri was 6.2 degrees C for males and 6.95 degrees C for females. The upper threshold temperatures were 35.82 and 35.87 degrees C for males and females, respectively. Net reproductive rate (R-0) was highest at 26 degrees C compared with other temperatures. Mean cohort generation time (t(G)) and population doubling time (t(D)) decreased as temperature increased from 18 to 30 degrees C. The daily intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) and finite rate of increase (lambda) were positively correlated with temperatures ranging from 18 to 30 degrees C and then decreased at 34 degrees C.

Previous studies on tourism and climate change have mainly focused on the global north and snow-based winter tourism activities. This study aimed to fill the gap by examining tourism operators' perceptions of climate change in Kgalagadi South District, southwest Botswana, and looking at their adaptation strategies, if any. It was found that these operators were aware of the general impacts of climate change but most saw no impacts on the tourism industry and none recognised any impacts on their own operations. Most did, however, envisage challenges to future business growth and Botswana's tourism competitiveness. The perception that climate change did not currently have any impacts may explain why there were almost no adaptation strategies in place.","[Hambira, Wame L.; Atlhopheng, Julius] Univ Botswana, Dept Environm Sci, Gaborone, Botswana; [Saarinen, Jarkko] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Management, Sch Tourism & Hospitality, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Saarinen, Jarkko] Univ Oulu, Dept Geog, Oulu, Finland; [Manwa, Haretsebe] North West Univ, Fac Human & Social Sci, Mmabatho, South Africa",University of Botswana; University of Johannesburg; University of Oulu; North West University - South Africa,"Hambira, WL (corresponding author), Univ Botswana, Dept Environm Sci, Gaborone, Botswana.",hambira@mopipi.ub.bw,"Saarinen, Jarkko/AAD-3227-2019; Atlhopheng, Julius/AAL-3412-2020; Hambira, Wame/GQB-0658-2022; Hambira, Wame L./AFU-4130-2022","Saarinen, Jarkko/0000-0002-9327-6932; Hambira, Wame L./0000-0003-1266-0738",,,,,54,44,45,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0376-835X,1470-3637,,DEV SO AFR,Dev.

The impacts, however, will not be homogenous across regions, sectors, population groups or time. The literature specifically related to how climate change will affect rural communities, their resilience, and adaptive capacity in the United States (U. S.) is scarce. This article bridges this knowledge gap through an extensive review of the current state of knowledge to make inferences about the rural communities vulnerability to climate change based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios. Our analysis shows that rural communities tend to be more vulnerable than their urban counterparts due to factors such as demography, occupations, earnings, literacy, poverty incidence, and dependency on government funds. Climate change impacts on rural communities differs across regions and economic sectors; some will likely benefit while others lose. Rural communities engaged in agricultural and forest related activities in the Northeast might benefit, while those in the Southwest and Southeast could face additional water stress and increased energy cost respectively. Developing adaptation and mitigation policy options geared towards reducing climatic vulnerability of rural communities is warranted. A set of regional and local studies is needed to delineate climate change impacts across rural and urban communities, and to develop appropriate policies to mitigate these impacts. Integrating research across disciplines, strengthening research-policy linkages, integrating ecosystem services while undertaking resource valuation, and expanding alternative energy sources, might also enhance coping capacity of rural communities in face of future climate change.","[Lal, Pankaj; Alavalapati, Janaki R.

Particularly the coastal zone will be affected by derived consequences like sea level rise, increased storminess and flooding. In order to mitigate the most severe consequences for the society it is decisive that urban and regional planners address the climate change issue in their planning efforts. Using modelling and simulation, we can increase our understanding of the future land-use system under influence of a changing climate and accordingly reduce uncertainty concerning decisions. The current paper describes how to carry out land-use simulations as envisaged by the SRES narratives using a multi-criteria land-use modelling framework. Combined with expected future flooding due to sea level rise we perform an impact assessment on future urban development.

However, current changes in climate have been adversely affecting agricultural productivity. In this paper, perceived impacts of climate change on agriculture and adaptation towards it have been studied in Charsadda district (lowlands) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan through extensive field surveys, involving 116 farm households. Results have revealed that climate change factors including fluctuating temperature, evidence of yearly long droughts, and a steady shift in rainfall patterns have pressured the agriculture sector and livelihoods of the local peasants. The staggering floods of 2010 and 2011 in Pakistan have evidenced severe climatic changes in Pakistan. These countrywide floods have washed fertile soil in the study area that has directly contributed to losses in agricultural yield and increased vector-borne diseases in crops. The local farmers have commonly deployed adaptive measure such as crops diversification, changing fertilizer, and planting shaded trees to minimize the impacts of changes in climate. However, these adjustments measures are perceived as not appropriate for improving farm yield. Therefore, the study suggests that improved understanding of the climate change impacts and knowledge on adapting adequately will lead to no-regret adaptation. It will also help protecting farmer's lives and livelihoods and will boost their resilience towards changing climatic conditions.","[Ullah, Wahid] Jiangxi Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Pakistan Studies, Fac Foreign Studies, 86 Hongqi Ave, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Nafees, Muhammad] Univ Peshawar, Dept Environm Sci, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Khurshid, Muhammad] Univ Haripur, Dept Environm Sci, Haripur 25000, Pakistan; [Nihei, Takaaki] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Letters, Dept Human Geog, Kita Ku, Kita 10,Nishi 7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600808, Japan",Jiangxi University of Science & Technology; University of Peshawar; Hokkaido University,"Ullah, W (corresponding author), Jiangxi Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Pakistan Studies, Fac Foreign Studies, 86 Hongqi Ave, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",waheedullah@live.in; nafees@upesh.edu.pk; khurshed75@live.com; nihei@let.hokudai.ac.jp,"Ullah, Wahid/O-3782-2018; Nafees, Mohammad/J-4769-2019","Ullah, Wahid/0000-0001-9370-133X; Nafees, Mohammad/0000-0002-8717-8092",,,,,36,15,15,4,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

The concept is currently being tested at scale by the World Bank in six countries in the Sahel region. Based on conceptual considerations, this paper aims to address three questions: How and to what extent can adaptive social protection be considered transformative? Where does this concept sit along the humanitarian-development continuum? And, how does it relate to resilience? To answer these questions the paper draws on the authors' exposure to the on-going World Bank ASP program, as well as documents derived from the emerging body of literature on climate- and shock-responsive social protection. Drawing on these different materials the paper first demonstrates that ASP can effectively be considered as a transformative intervention at two different levels: at the system level and at the beneficiaries' level. The paper also shows how, through its activities designed to strengthen households' adaptive capacity, an ASP program can contribute to building resilience beyond the short-term coping strategies which humanitarian interventions generally focus on. As such ASP covers a larger spectrum along the humanitarian-development continuum than most other interventions proposed in the context of shock-responsive interventions.","[Bene, Christophe; Howland, Fanny] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Decis & Policy Anal Program, Cali 763537, Colombia; [Cornelius, Alex] Social Protect Livelihoods & Nutr Monitoring & Ev, Hove BN3 1RE, England",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Bene, C (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Decis & Policy Anal Program, Cali 763537, Colombia.",c.bene@cgiar.org; alex.cornelius@itad.com; f.c.howland@cgiar.org,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Bene, Chris/ACK-2643-2022","Bene, Chris/0000-0002-7078-9241; Howland, Fanny/0000-0002-0778-2741",DFID under the program Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disaster (BRACED),DFID under the program Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disaster (BRACED),This paper is derived from the Evaluation Activity 4 (EA4) implemented by Itad and funded by DFID under the program Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disaster (BRACED).

Based on an intimate knowledge of the local farming systems, we discuss the cropping systems adaptation to these rainfall changes. If the wetting of the dry season extends in the future, as expected according to most climate projections, households would not find it difficult to adapt, except for the problems caused by temperature rise, mainly due to their renowned adaptive capacity and high mobility that historically produced diverse and resilient rural livelihood systems.","[Lacombe, Guillaume] Southeast Asia Reg Off, IWMI, POB 4199, Viangchan, Laos; [Polthanee, Anan] Khon Kaen Univ, Dept Plant Sci & Agr Resources, Fac Agr, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand; [Trebuil, Guy] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev Cirad, UMR Innovat, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); Khon Kaen University; CIRAD,"Lacombe, G (corresponding author), Southeast Asia Reg Off, IWMI, POB 4199, Viangchan, Laos.",g.lacombe@cgiar.org,"LACOMBE, GUILLAUME/I-2503-2019; Trébuil, Guy François/H-9823-2019","LACOMBE, GUILLAUME/0000-0002-3882-2697; Trébuil, Guy François/0000-0002-1370-4731","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR)","This study was funded by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

In this regard, attention toward vulnerability assessments is increasing within policy-making processes, to assist in selecting suitable coping strategies and policies to reduce farmers' vulnerability. Through identifying the main vulnerability indicators from a sustainability perspective (including social, economic, and environmental dimensions) among wheat farmers, this study is seeking an inclusive conceptual framework to assess their vulnerability to both socio-economic and environmental changes. Taking the main elements (i.e., sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity) of vulnerability into account, this paper tried to develop an inclusive systemic framework to understand the most important indicators of vulnerability for wheat farmers at various spatial and temporal scales. It is supposed that the framework is a useful guide for policymakers in identifying the vulnerable groups of wheat farmers and zones so that they can decide about proper coping strategies to effectively deal with adverse effects of climate and undesired socioeconomic changes in the wheat farming system.

Understanding the underlying aspects of climate change that influence ecosystems is crucial to devise adaptation strategies and conservation efforts. To this end, climate classification schemes can be employed as an effective means for both validation of climate models and identify areas that may experience a pronounced shift in climate in the future. In this context, the current study focuses on the impact of climate change on shift in climatic regimes over the Indian sub-continent for the mid and late 21st century with respect to the reference period (1975-2005). Koppen-Trewartha climate (KTC) classification was applied to climate projections resulting from four downscaled General Circulation Models from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Climate Projections, under two RCPs (4.5 and 8.5) along with global Climate Research Unit TS-3.23 dataset which is treated as observed. Analysis of the future 21st century climate projections revealed noticeable shifts in climate types, of which expansion of arid and savannah class is the most prominent. Results indicate that the sub-continental scale analysis done at a grid cell-by-grid cell basis was able to locate potentially static and dynamic climate regions across the country with projected shifts from warmer/wetter to drier climate regime. This in turn is expected to pose serious threat to various sectors, especially agriculture, owing to its heavy dependence on water resources. The observations from the study provide information on the magnitude and pattern of change in climate types across the country and thus can serve as prospective reference to develop adequate and effective climate adaptation strategies.","[Bindhu, Vijayalekshmi Muraleedharan; Smitha, Prema Somanathan; Narasimhan, Balaji] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Civil Engn, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Annamalai, Hariharasubramanian] Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Annamalai, Hariharasubramanian] Univ Hawaii, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Srinivasan, Govindarajalu] Asian Inst Technol, Reg Integrated Multihazard Early Warning Syst RIM, Pathum Thani, Thailand",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii System; Asian Institute of Technology,"Narasimhan, B (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Civil Engn, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",nbalaji@civil.iitm.ac.in,"Narasimhan, Balaji/H-6050-2011","Narasimhan, Balaji/0000-0003-2609-9320","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology [DST/TM/WTI/WIC/2K17/82]; Indian council for Agriculture Research (ICAR) [2-11(21)/18-19NICRA]","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology(Department of Science & Technology (DOST), Philippines); Indian council for Agriculture Research (ICAR)","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: DST/TM/WTI/WIC/2K17/82; Indian council for Agriculture Research (ICAR), Grant/Award Number: 2-11(21)/18-19NICRA",,42,1,1,2,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Other avenues, such as litigation, have emerged as a policy tool for seeking redress for past and prospective harm resulting from climate change. The academic and policy literatures have, however, had limited engagement with the role of rights-based litigation in climate governance since Paris. We help fill this gap by developing the four-component OATH (Objective, Associated climate impact, Type of justice, Harm) framework and applying it to three high-profile climate litigation cases - Urgenda v. The Netherlands, Juliana v. United States, and Demanda v. Minambiente. Our analysis confirms that the progress and achievements of these cases demonstrate the potential of climate litigation to force greater national and sub-national government action on climate change. However, litigation better serves some types of justice (e.g. intergenerational) than others (e.g. distributive). Therefore, as its ambition and progress continue to grow, litigation must be combined with other forms of climate action to better advance justice in a post-Paris world. Key policy insights International climate agreements and obligations are important to the success of climate litigation. Climate litigation can be used to hold countries accountable to the commitments they communicate in their NDCs and other policy instruments, but it should be used as one of several policy tools. Litigation pertaining to climate adaptation should and can be expanded to support and advance justice. Distributive justice cannot be sufficiently advanced through domestic climate litigation so it must be further incorporated into international climate agreements and obligations. The universal right to a clean environment, its definition and criteria should be (a) established in international environmental agreements and obligations, and (b) aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.","[Beauregard, Charles; Carlson, D'Arcy; Robinson, Stacy-ann; Cobb, Charles; Patton, Mykela] Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Mayflower Hill Dr, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Colby College,"Robinson, SA (corresponding author), Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Mayflower Hill Dr, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",stacy-ann.robinson@colby.edu,,"Robinson, Stacy-ann/0000-0003-3163-8771; Carlson, D'Arcy/0000-0002-5436-4630",,,,,89,7,7,1,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

For agricultural applications, however, highly localized climate conditions can be critically important. This certainly applies to tropical highland regions, where dissected topography and convectively dominated precipitation processes can lead to strong variability in both mean climate conditions and year-to-year climate variability. This study examines recent climate variability and trends (1981-2016) on Choke Mountain, located in the western Ethiopian Highlands. Through analysis of precipitation and temperature records at monitored locations, we explore observed variability in climate patterns and trends across sites and seasons. The lens for our spatial analysis is the agroecosystem (AES), defined on the basis of prevailing climate and cropping systems, which currently serve as the foundation for climate adaptation planning in the region. We find that interannual temperature variability is greatest in the hottest, driest AES, and is most pronounced in the dry season. All AES warmed significantly in all seasons over the analysis period, but the magnitude of trend was greatest in high elevation AES. Precipitation variability was also large across AES, with largest interannual variability found in the dry season. This season is frequently excluded in climate analyses, but it is a critical harvest time and irrigation period. Trends in rainfall anomaly and precipitation concentration index are less clear, but there is a tendency towards drying and increasing irregularity of rainfall. Interestingly, we find little association between the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and temperature or precipitation variability at our study sites. This suggests that even though ENSO is a widely recognized driver of large-scale rainfall variability in the region, its impacts are highly spatially variable. This has implications for applying ENSO-based precipitation outlooks to agricultural management decisions. Farmer interviews reveal that local perceptions of climate variability and trends are generally consistent with the objective observations.","[Ademe, Dereje] Debre Markos Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Debre Markos, Ethiopia; [Ziatchik, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Tesfaye, Kindie] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Simane, Belay] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Environm & Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Alemayehu, Getachew; Adgo, Enyew] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia",Johns Hopkins University; Addis Ababa University; Bahir Dar University,"Ademe, D (corresponding author), Debre Markos Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Debre Markos, Ethiopia.",ademe.dereje@gmail.com,"Birhan, Dereje/GRO-6552-2022","Tesfaye, Kindie/0000-0002-7201-8053",Belmont Forum Collaborative Research (NILE-NEXUS) - National Science foundation (NSF) [1624335],Belmont Forum Collaborative Research (NILE-NEXUS) - National Science foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The first author was supported by the Belmont Forum Collaborative Research (NILE-NEXUS-a projected award number 1624335) funded by the National Science foundation (NSF).

This research explores the potential contribution of utilizing monotonous-free Elementary Cellular Automata patterns as climate-adaptive shading systems, to be applied on buildings' facades in order to mitigate the undesirable impacts by excessive solar penetration in cooling-dominant climates. It also presents a new approach for evaluating the daylighting performance and energy demand for the dynamic shading systems at the early stages of design. Grasshopper is exploited for parametric modeling of Elementary Cellular Automata patterns. The methodological procedure is realized through two main phases. The first evaluates all 256 Elementary Cellular Automata possible rules to elect the ones with random patterns, and to ensure an equitable distribution of the natural daylight in internal spaces. The computational simulations are then conducted in the second phase using DIVA-for-Rhino and Archsim to evaluate the performance of the elected Elementary Cellular Automata patterns that are applied as dynamic shadings. Based on the newly developed hourly-based metrics: Hourly Daylight Illuminance (HDI300/HOY), Hourly Sunlight Illuminance (HSI3000/HOY), and Hourly Energy Consumption (HEC), the adaptive facade variation configuration could be formalized that maximizes daylighting and minimizes energy demand. The simulation results showed that the adaptive facade outperformed the static shading configurations, and exhibited its ability to obtain adequate level of natural daylighting, while mitigated the undesirable impacts of excessive solar penetration, and maintained a minimized amount of cooling load and artificial lighting energy demands throughout the year.

With the increased magnitude and occurrence of floods, a paradigm shift in flood risk-management strategies has been observed from structural interventions to a multi-faceted resilience-oriented approach. The need is to apprehend the perception of vulnerable populations for effective social resilience, risk communication, and coping capacity. This study aims to quantify the community's risk perception by applying a contemporary approach, i.e., cognitive mapping. A survey was conducted in rural communities of Muzaffargarh, Pakistan, where four union councils were further selected for the survey. The selection criteria included past experience with the 2010 floods and proximity to rivers. Yamane sampling technique was used to determine the required sample size, and 365 respondents were involved in outlining their 2010 flood memories. GIS was used for the visualization and conversion of these delineations into vector data. Based on the community's perception, scoring and Kernel density were applied to rank each settlement and to show the perceived spatial extent of the 2010 flood. These cognitive maps were then assessed based on age groups and proximity to the source of risk. Results show that the spatial extent of the flood perceived by the older age group was comparatively higher. Similarly, households living far away from rivers tend to perceive a larger spatial extent of flood risk. This study proposes cognitive mapping as a potential method for assessing flood risk perception.","[Rasool, Samavia; Rana, Irfan Ahmad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn SCEE, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Arshad, Hafiz Syed Hamid] Univ Management & Technol, Sch Architecture & Planning, Dept City & Reg Planning, Lahore, Pakistan",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; University of Management & Technology (UMT),"Rana, IA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn SCEE, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",samaviarasool461@gmail.com; irfanrana90@hotmail.com; hamid.arshad@umt.edu.pk,"Rana, Irfan Ahmad/C-2560-2017","Rana, Irfan Ahmad/0000-0002-3157-1186",,,,,64,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2363-6203,2363-6211,,MODEL EARTH SYST ENV,Model.

The study analyses Suriname's historical climate (1990-2014) and provides climate projections for three time horizons (2020-2044, 2045-2069, 2070-2094) and two emissions scenarios (intermediate/SSP2-4.5 and severe/SSP5-8.5). Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) modeling is used to analyze changes in sea level, temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and winds. In addition, risk impact chains were produced for the country's four most important socio-economic sectors: agriculture and fisheries, forestry, water, and infrastructure. Results show the temperature is expected to increase for all regions and timeframes, reaching warming up to 6 degrees C in the southern region in the long-term future (2070-2094). Projections point towards a reduction in precipitation in the southwest and coastal regions and a rise in mean sea level. Regarding risk, Paramaribo and Wanica face the highest climate risk. Coronie and Nickerie face the least climate risk. These regions remain the most and least vulnerable in both the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, but overall values of their risk indices increase substantially over time.","[Antich-Homar, Helena] Meteoclim, Parc BIT, Sophie Germain S-N,Lleret Bldg, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Hess, Katharina] Minist Transport Baden Wurttemberg, Climate Prot Transport, D-70173 Stuttgart, Germany; [Solaun, Kepa] Univ Navarra, Sch Sci, Campus Univ, Pamplona 31080, Spain; [Solaun, Kepa] Global Factor, Colon Larreategui,26,Planta 1, Bilbao 48009, Spain; [Alleng, Gerard; Flores, Adrian] Inter American Dev Bank, Climate Change Div, New York Ave NW 1300, Washington, DC 20577 USA",University of Navarra,"Solaun, K (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Sch Sci, Campus Univ, Pamplona 31080, Spain.;Solaun, K (corresponding author), Global Factor, Colon Larreategui,26,Planta 1, Bilbao 48009, Spain.",helena.antich@wdna.com; hess.katharina0@gmail.com; ksolaun@globalfactor.com; gerarda@iadb.org; adrianfl@iadb.org,,"Flores, Adrian/0000-0002-0837-116X; Antich Homar, Helena/0000-0002-2915-2150; Solaun, Kepa/0000-0003-1041-8825",Inter-America Development Bank (IDB) as part of the Technical Cooperation Mainstreaming Climate Change in Sustainable Decision-Making Tools [SU-T1117],Inter-America Development Bank (IDB) as part of the Technical Cooperation Mainstreaming Climate Change in Sustainable Decision-Making Tools,This research was funded by the Inter-America Development Bank (IDB) as part of the Technical Cooperation Mainstreaming Climate Change in Sustainable Decision-Making Tools (SU-T1117).,,41,0,0,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2022,14,3,,,,,,,1463,10.3390/su14031463,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14031463,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YZ1YV,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000755279900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, their relationship is still in dispute. So far, three approaches have been suggested: interchangeable, distinct and interrelated. We argue that the third is the most useful as it provides insights into how long-term adaptation can be achieved by a series of short-term coping mechanisms. Within this focus, we interpret adaptation in a novel way: as a complex cumulative result based on the interaction between multiple coping mechanisms and vulnerability dynamics. As such we reorient Smit et al.'s work on cumulative adaptation. Our empirical case is slum households affected by floods from the Mekong River in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The inquiry is based on 119 surveys and 25 semi-structured interviews in nine slum communities. The results capture new trajectories of adaptation (or maladaptation), livelihoods and local collective action.

Among degradation processes, soil sealing represents the major threat, as ecosystem services dramatically decrease or are even nullified. The increasing use of big open data from satellites combined with AI algorithms are making geodata mining and mapping techniques essential to quantify soil sealing. Different keywords are adopted to define the phenomenon. However, at present, review articles presenting the state-of-the-art on mapping soil sealing by including the most common definitions are currently not available. Hence, we analyzed: (a) impervious surface, (b) soil sealing, (c) land take, (d) soil consumption, (e) land consumption. We provide a systematic review of remote sensing platforms and methodologies to map and to classify soil sealing, by highlighting: (a) definitions; (b) relationships among study areas, scales, platforms, resolutions, and classification methodologies; (c) emerging trends and policy implications. We performed a systematic search on Scopus (from 2000 to 2020), identifying 1277 papers; 392 focused on mapping soil sealing. 'Impervious surface' is the dominant definition. The phenomenon is more studied by the USA, China and Italy and, 'soil sealing' is recently more adopted in EU. Most studies focuses on mapping soil sealing at urban scale. We found Landsat are the most adopted platforms; they are frequently used for multi-temporal analyses. Eleven methodologies were identified: automatic classifications are the most adopted, dominated by pixel/sub-pixel-based approaches; other methods include Band Ratios, Supervised, OBIA, ANN. The majority of mapping analyses are performed on 30 m resolution in areas of 1000-10 000 km(2). Landsat images are less used for smaller areas. In conclusion, as study area size increases, a decrease in image resolution with the use of more completely automatic classification methodologies is recorded. However, most studies focuses on comparing classification techniques rather than supporting policy making for sustainable urban planning. Thus, we encourage to fill the gap by developing approaches that applicable to international policies.","[Peroni, Francesca; Facchinelli, Francesco] Univ Padua, Dept Hist & Geog Sci & Ancient World DiSSGeA, Padua, Italy; [Pappalardo, Salvatore Eugenio; Crescini, Edoardo; De Marchi, Massimo] Univ Padua, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn ICEA, Padua, Italy; [Munafo, Michele] Italian Natl Inst Environm Protect & Res ISPRA, Rome, Italy; [Hodgson, Michael E.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of Padua; University of Padua; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA); University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Pappalardo, SE (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn ICEA, Padua, Italy.",salvatore.pappalardo@unipd.it,"Facchinelli, Francesco/AAS-2022-2021","Facchinelli, Francesco/0000-0001-5740-8435; De Marchi, Massimo/0000-0001-8184-013X; PERONI, FRANCESCA/0000-0003-2389-5612",,,,,104,2,2,9,23,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Thermal imbalance in bulls can lead to hyperthermia and alter testicular metabolism, causing subfertility or infertility. Therefore, the thermoregulation of composite Canchim bulls (5/8 Charolais x 3/8 Zebu) raised in tropical climate as well as their consequences in the physiological, hematological, hormonal, and andrological parameters were evaluated monthly. The bulls (n = 18; 30.0 +/- 1.5 months; 503.8 +/- 23.0 kg) were kept on pasture, in a single group, from August 2015 to March 2016, comprising the winter, spring, and summer seasons. Biometeorological variables were continuously monitored, and the Temperature and Humidity Index (THI) was calculated. A greater thermal challenge occurred in spring and summer (THI >= 72.0). Nevertheless, the bulls exhibited normothermia (38.6 to 38.9 degrees C) in these seasons. The cortisol did not vary between seasons (7.0 vs. 8.7 vs. 6.8 ng/mL; P > 0.05) and remained within the physiological patterns. Independent of the seasons, stress leukogram was also not observed, refitting the incidence of acute or chronic thermal stress. It is noteworthy that T3 and testosterone increased (P < 0.0001, P < 0.05) in spring and summer, the time that coincides with the breeding season, when there is increased metabolic requirement from the bulls. The progressive thermal challenge increase did not affect the scrotal thermoregulatory capacity, and in general, scrotal temperature remained at 5.2 degrees C below the internal body temperature. In summer, there was a 5% reduction in the minor sperm defects (P < 0.05) and DNA fragmentation in 2.4% of spermatozoa, a compatible value for high fertility bulls. The results show that the studied composite bulls can be considered as climatically adapted and constitute a viable alternative to be used in production systems in a tropical climate, even if the breeding seasons occur during the most critical thermal condition periods of the year.","[Romanello, Narian; Lourenco Junior, Jose de Brito; de Andrade Pantoja, Messy Hannear; Botta, Daniela; Giro, Alessandro; Barreto, Andrea do Nascimento] Fed Univ Para, Av Univ S-N, BR-68746360 Castanhal, Brazil; [Barioni Junior, Waldomiro; Marcondes, Cintia Righetti; Macedo Pezzopane, Jose Ricardo; Garcia, Alexandre Rossetto] Brazilian Agr Res Corp, Lab Biotechnol & Anim Reprod, Embrapa Livestock Southeast, Km 234, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Brandao, Felipe Zandonadi; Bossois Moura, Ana Beatriz] Fluminense Fed Univ, Rua Vital Brazil 64, BR-24230340 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Para; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); Universidade Federal Fluminense,"Garcia, AR (corresponding author), Brazilian Agr Res Corp, Lab Biotechnol & Anim Reprod, Embrapa Livestock Southeast, Km 234, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",narian.r_@hotmail.com; joselourencojr@yahoo.com.br; waldomiro.barioni@embrapa.br; fzbrandao@id.uff.br; cintia.marcondes@embrapa.br; jose.pezzopane@embrapa.br; messy.andrade@yahoo.com.br; dani_botta@hotmail.com; giro.aless@gmail.com; anabeatriz.bossois@gmail.com; andreadnb91@gmail.com; alexandre.garcia@embrapa.br,"Garcia, Alexandre Rossetto/G-1477-2012; Barioni Jr, Waldomiro/AFK-0489-2022; de Andrade Pantoja, Messy Hannear/Z-4309-2019; Pezzopane, José Ricardo/AAG-7792-2021; Marcondes, Cintia R/D-9904-2013","Garcia, Alexandre Rossetto/0000-0002-3354-1474; Barioni Jr, Waldomiro/0000-0001-5970-6591; de Andrade Pantoja, Messy Hannear/0000-0002-4325-1841; Pezzopane, José Ricardo/0000-0001-5462-6090; Marcondes, Cintia R/0000-0002-1444-8514",Embrapa-Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation [BIOTEC Network] [0113060010504]; Embrapa-Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation [ADAPT+] [0212020080003]; Federal University of Para; CNPq-National Council for Scientific and Technological Development,Embrapa-Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation [BIOTEC Network](Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA)); Embrapa-Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation [ADAPT+]; Federal University of Para; CNPq-National Council for Scientific and Technological Development(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This project was financially supported by the Embrapa-Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation [BIOTEC Network (grant no. 0113060010504) and ADAPT+ (grant no. 0212020080003)], by the Federal University of Para, and by the CNPq-National Council for Scientific and Technological Development.",,71,13,13,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

There is an increased understanding of the impact of climate change on global crop production however, little focus has been given to local adaptation pathways and rural smallholder community responses, especially regarding food security. It is becoming increasingly evident that local level decision-making plays a vital role in reducing vulnerability to environmental change. This research aimed to qualitatively investigate coping and adaptive strategies adopted by smallholder farming households to respond to the impacts of drought in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Focus group discussions (n = 7) consisting of 5-9 participants and individual interviews (n = 9) using pre-tested topic guides, involving a total of 57 adults were conducted in rural areas of drought-affected districts: Msinga, Richmond and Umbumbulu of KwaZulu-Natal, in July 2018. The data were analysed using thematic analysis in NVivo 12. Thematic analysis identified three principal themes: 1. Perceived effects of droughts on the local food system and diets; 2. Current coping strategies; and 3. Enablers for successful adaptation. All sites reported a change in food consumption habits, with the majority perceiving drought to be the main driver behind a shift from vegetable-based to starch-based diets and decreased animal source food consumption. Only short-term coping strategies were implemented across the study sites. However, knowledge of long-term adaptation strategies existed but was unattainable to most respondents. Recommendations of perceived context-specific long-term adaptation strategies that could be used at a local scale were communicated by the respondents. However, they would need external help to actualize them. A need exists to support smallholder communities' short-term response methods to drought to achieve more holistic resilience and successful adaptation. Short-term adaptation strategies, if implemented alone, often have significant tradeoffs with longer-term adaptation and building resilience. This study highlights the need for targeted, contextualised policy solutions to improve smallholder productivity during drought through a strategic combination of both short- and longer-term adaptation measures, i.e. short-term adaptation should be guided by a long-term adaptation strategy. Proper planning, including the use of climate scenarios combined with information on nutritional status, is needed to develop context-specific and transformative adaptation strategies. These strategies should aim to strengthen resilience at a local level and should be included as policy recommendations.","[Hawkins, Poppy] Univ Hertfordshire, Ctr Agr Food & Environm Management CAFEM, Hatfield, Herts, England; [Geza, Wendy; Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Durban, South Africa; [Sutherland, Catherine] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Built Environm Dev Studies, Durban, South Africa; [Queenan, Kevin] Royal Vet Coll, Dept Pathobiol & Populat Sci, London, England; [Dangour, Alan; Scheelbeek, Pauline] London Sch Hyg Trop Med, Ctr Climate Change Planetary Hlth, London, England",University of Hertfordshire; University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Kwazulu Natal; University of London; University of London Royal Veterinary College; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Scheelbeek, P (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg Trop Med, Ctr Climate Change Planetary Hlth, Room 134,Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",pauline.scheelbeek@lshtm.ac.uk,"Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe/AAF-2418-2019","Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe/0000-0002-9323-8127; Hawkins, Poppy/0000-0002-8004-1237",Wellcome Trust Our Planet Our Health Programme [205200/Z/16/z]; Adaptation Fund,Wellcome Trust Our Planet Our Health Programme(Wellcome Trust); Adaptation Fund,"This research was funded by the Wellcome Trust Our Planet Our Health Programme Grant number: (205200/Z/16/z).; The uMngeni Resilience Project, which is funded by the Adaptation Fund, is acknowledged for providing support for this study.

The socio-economic efforts to address climate change involve both international and domestic economic transformation, industrial upgrading, infrastructure protection, and disaster prevention and mitigation, amongst other considerations. In particular, capacity-building is a prerequisite for both participating in global climate governance and for targeting domestic response measures. After the Paris Agreement, global climate governance has entered the new so-called post-Paris era. Changes to the United States' global climate policy have exacerbated the complexity of global climate governance, but domestic actions by stakeholders at the national or sub-national level are still striving toward the goals agreed to in the Paris Agreement. In particular, China faces significant challenges in addressing climate change impacts in both global mitigation efforts and domestic adaptation needs. Here, we identify areas shortcoming in capacity building for China that are targeted for improvement in the post-Paris era. Firstly, advances in the basic scientific research capacity of China to study climate change should focus on climate change detection attribution, prediction and impact assessment. One specific approach includes the development of climate system models along with the improvement of the comprehensive climate observation system should be implemented to improve fundamental research on climate related topics. Secondly, it is necessary to further enhance China's climate adaptation capacity, particularly targeting adaptation goals for agriculture and urbanized areas as well as improving risk assessment and management of for already-occurring disasters. Thirdly, the development of a comprehensive understanding and support system for policy makers that can be used to integrate climate change responses into China's international and domestic policies is critical for formulating effective mitigation and adaptation efforts. Fourthly, efforts should also be taken in building and enhancing a clear legal system that addresses emerging challenges in mitigation and adaptation. To address many of the above challenges, improvements and expansions also need to be made to strengthen the national expertise in relevant professional fields of climate change, so as to effectively support the pertinence, specialization, refinement, and aptitude in developing strategies for the many climate change-related challenges facing China. Lastly, enhancements in public outreach, awareness and education on climate change will help the public to consciously practice many of the capacity-building efforts being developed, including adopting the concept of green and low carbon in their daily life.","[Huang, Lei; Zhang, Yongxiang; Chao, Qingchen; Hu, Ting] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Jiashuang] China Meteorol Adm, Dept Sci & Technol & Climate Change, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration; China Meteorological Administration,"Zhang, YX (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",helen.zyx@hotmail.com,,,,,,,27,1,1,4,18,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",0023-074X,2095-9419,,CHIN SCI B-CHIN,Chin.

But the ways in which researchers and policy makers have thought about experimentation have generally been with reference to new infrastructural and governance conditions. Focusing on intentional interventions downplays the capacity for change stemming from peoples' already existing practices. In this paper, we propose that the camping music festival a site that continues to be seen by some as a cultural laboratory in which attendees try out new identities can be thought of as a site of 'already existing' sustainability experimentation. Drawing on 60 interviews about personal washing at two camping music festivals in the UK, we explore the festival as a site from which we can draw lessons about how societies in the Global North might cope with the disrupted water supply linked to future climate change. Interviewees divulge how escaping societal expectations about bodily cleanliness can become pleasurable and the enjoyment found in resurrecting otherwise disappearing societal skills for living without easy access to familiar washing infrastructures. Spending an extended period without these infrastructures, and enjoying the experience, brings into question the assumption of an unwavering consumer need for constant supply that is embedded in modernist visions of 'Big Water' systems. Thus, we argue that research on the geographies of 'already existing' sustainability experiments holds new potential for reimagining mundane, everyday practices within research and policy agendas on sustainable futurity.","[Browne, Alison L.] Univ Manchester, Dept Geog, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Jack, Tullia] Lund Univ, Dept Sociol, Paradisgatan 5,House G, Lund, Sweden; [Hitchings, Russell] UCL, Dept Geog, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of Manchester; Lund University; University of London; University College London,"Browne, AL (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Dept Geog, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",alison.browne@manchester.ac.uk; tullia.jack@soc.lu.se; r.hitchings@ucl.ac.uk,"Jack, Tullia/AAT-7617-2020","Jack, Tullia/0000-0003-0381-4088; Browne, Alison L/0000-0002-1048-6724",ESRC Patterns of Water project [RES-597-25-003]; UCL Bridging the Gap fund; ESRC [ES/H044914/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC Patterns of Water project; UCL Bridging the Gap fund; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Thanks to Stefan Ramsden for his assistance in data collection and the festival-goers for talking to us even though there are much better things to do at a festival!

As more than half the world lives in urban spaces, flooding could devastate urban populations, especially if the infrastructure to cope with flooding is inadequate. We study flooding in Cuttack, Odisha, a typical Indian city subject to annual flooding. We present estimates from a lower and lower-middle income country of household willingness to pay (WTP) for improved urban drainage using a revealed preference method. We use a hedonic price model to estimate WTP across city zones with differential exposure to flooding. At 2014-15 prices, a typical flood (approximately 7 hours per day on average) reduces the annual rental value by INR1352 (US$ 21) or about 4.4% annually. This implies that Cuttack households are willing to pay INR 188 million (or $ 2.9 million) to avoid flooding.

Cities will concentrate around 70% of the world population by 2050 accounting for 75% of the world's resources consumption. For that reason, cities must act against climate change adopting resilience strategies. Resilience strategies recognize the importance of the reliability and functioning of urban critical infrastructures as they provide essential services for the citizens and they are crucial for the resolution and recovery of the crises. However, the integration of critical infrastructures in the city climate resilience strategies is challenging because critical infrastructures are complex systems, strongly interconnected one to each other and generally, they belong or are operated by private companies. This research proposes a governance framework for better integration of the management of urban critical infrastructures into the city climate resilience strategy. The framework has been developed from academic literature and has been enriched with insights from workshops and interviews with experts and practitioners. As a result, the framework tackles four aspects of governance: (1) modes of governance; (2) stakeholders' roles; (3) processes and (4) instruments. These aspects will help to improve the vertical integration, cross-sectorial coordination, innovation and knowledge, and cooperation needed for improving city resilience.","[Lomba-Fernandez, Cinta; Labaka, Leire; Hernantes, Josune] Univ Navarra, Tecnun, Pamplona, Spain",University of Navarra,"Lomba-Fernandez, C (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Tecnun, Pamplona, Spain.",,"Lomba-Fernández, Cinta/AAB-8489-2021; Labaka, Leire/H-9744-2014","Lomba-Fernández, Cinta/0000-0002-6338-5580; Labaka, Leire/0000-0002-1721-0624",Fundacion AON,Fundacion AON,This research is funded by the Fundacion AON.,,25,1,1,7,26,EUROPEAN CENTER SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,ROME,"VIA DEI FIORI 34, ROME, 00172, ITALY",2239-5938,2239-6101,,EUR J SUSTAIN DEV,Eur.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were obtained through semi-structured qualitative interviews with key policy informants as well as rural agricultural producers. The adaptive attributes of two successful agri-environmental programs with a proven track record in reducing vulnerability and increasing adaptive capacity of rural producers were studied, including program responsiveness, program framing, stakeholder engagement mechanisms, and the respective roles of key actors. Findings - The adaptive governance practices of program delivery through localized government personnel and organizations increased perceived responsiveness. Mechanisms of program delivery and stakeholder participation and review changed over time as well as the framing of programs. Producers and key policy informants agreed that producers responded to concretely framed issues. A possible disconnect was discovered in the anticipated role of government in relation to meeting and responding to the climate change challenge. Practical implications - This research shows a need to study changes in programs over time in relation to the attributes of adaptive management. Differing climatic events, geographies, and government and stakeholder priorities all contribute to changes in the institutional design of programs and policies. Originality/value - This paper documents adaptive governance practices in relation to two agri-environmental programs that have successfully facilitated producer adaptation to climate variability in the past, as well as the perceptions of agricultural producers of the future role of government in relation to responding to climate change.","[Hurlbert, Margot] Univ Regina, Dept Justice Studies, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Hurlbert, Margot] Univ Regina, Dept Sociol & Social Studies, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada",University of Regina; University of Regina,"Hurlbert, M (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Dept Justice Studies, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",margot.hurlbert@uregina.ca,,,,,,,83,8,8,1,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

The Ganzi region, based in the western plateau of China, is a typical example for such a study. Restricted by factors such as natural conditions and economic level, the winter indoor thermal environment of western plateau houses is generally poor. Taking the new residential houses in the Ganzi region as a case study, the authors of this paper conducted field research and analyses. First, the authors analyzed the construction technology and functional layout of the building through thermal environment testing and investigation; second, the authors analyzed the user's activity path according to the production and lifestyle; thirdly, the authors comprehensively evaluated the indoor thermal comfort through questionnaires and a predicated mean vote (PMV)-predicted percentage dissatisfied (PPD) evaluation model. The research results showed that: (1) the construction technology, functional layout, and temperature distribution of the new residential building were consistent with the user's activity path, which could effectively improve thermal insulation ability and thermal comfort; (2) compared to the developed eastern regions, the users in the building showed a stronger tolerance and wider acceptable temperature range in the extreme climate environment; and (3) under certain cooperative work conditions, an indoor temperature of 10-14 degrees C could meet basic thermal environment requirements and thus lower the limits of the standards. The author's method was proven to be more resilient than current standards in dealing with climate change. Therefore, this research can provide a practical reference for the improvement of peoples' living conditions and sustainable development in cold regions and other harsh areas.","[Liu, Peng; Zhang, Qun] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Architecture, Xian 710055, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Kaiyang] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ Informat Engn, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Wei, Youman] Xian Housing & Urban Rural Construction Bur, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qing] Chongqing Coll Elect Engn, Chongqing 401333, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Chongqing College of Electronic Engineering,"Zhang, Q (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Architecture, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.;Zhong, KY (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ Informat Engn, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",penman@xauat.edu.cn; zhangqun@xauat.edu.cn; zhongky@smail.swufe.edu.cn; pen_archi007@163.com; wangqccee@163.com,"liu, peng/GMX-0972-2022","liu, peng/0000-0001-6697-8739; zhong, kaiyang/0000-0002-5575-0306",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51678466],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 51678466.",,35,3,3,6,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2022,14,1,,,,,,,576,10.3390/su14010576,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14010576,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YT4QR,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000751347100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results from CHIRPS-v2 revealed that the three seasonal rainfall indices have substantial latitudinal variability. Significant late and early onsets were observed at the West and East of 1.5 degrees W longitude, respectively. Significant late cessations and longer growing periods occurred across Northern Ghana. The ability of farmers' perceptions and CHIRPS-v2 to capture rainfall onsets are time and location-dependent. A total of 71% of farmers rely on traditional knowledge to forecast rainfall onsets.

The aim of this paper is to investigate new models of financing green resilient infrastructures in terms of their socio-spatial implications. It provides a case study of the 'co-financing' system established in Copenhagen to realise the city's plans for 'blue-green' stormwater management. It highlights limitations to this system including that it requires identifying a discrete 'design dimension' of stormwater projects. This embeds an understanding of design as an additional layer which is vulnerable to being discarded in financially constrained circumstances. The paper's contributions are its analysis of the limitations of existing models of financing green resilient infrastructures and its identification of the need for new funding models to facilitate more integrated design.","[Tubridy, Daniel] Univ Sheffield, Urban Studies & Planning, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Tubridy, Daniel] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Architecture Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin, Ireland",University of Sheffield; University College Dublin,"Tubridy, D (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Urban Studies & Planning, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.;Tubridy, D (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Architecture Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin, Ireland.",tubridyd@tcd.ie,,"Tubridy, Fiadh/0000-0002-1934-6883",,,,,45,2,2,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-6397,1469-9710,,LANDSCAPE RES,Landsc.

In the present article, the sensitivity of PT on air temperature, water vapour pressure, wind speed, mean radiant temperature, street canyon width, and building heights is investigated. The mesoscale atmospheric model METRAS is integrated for a domain covering the city of Hamburg at 250 m horizontal resolution to calculate the meteorological input data for PT. The sensitivities of PT are determined by automatic differentiation of the basic DWD program. The sensitivities show how local adaptation measures and regional climate change can influence PT. The sensitivities also allow to estimate how accurate different input variables need to be known in order to achieve a desired accuracy in PT. The results are discussed in detail for 10 June 2007, a cloudless day with advection of warm air masses from south-east. A comparison with results obtained for different synoptic situations during summer is made. The sensitivities of PT on air temperature, water vapour pressure and mean radiant temperature are higher during warm and humid conditions than in situations with thermal comfort. The sensitivity of PT on wind speed is highest for low wind speeds. Around noon, increasing the building heights by 5 m can reduce PT up to 2.4 K due to shading effects in street canyons with aspect ratios above 0.5. After sunset, increasing the building heights by 5 m tends to moderately increase PT due to increased longwave radiation.","[Schoetter, Robert; Grawe, David; Hoffmann, Peter; Kirschner, Peter; Schluenzen, K.

The influence of urbanization on meteorology is driven by changes in land surface physical properties and land surface processes. These changes in meteorology in turn influence air quality by changing temperature-dependent chemical reactions and emissions, gas-particle phase partitioning, and ventilation of pollutants. In this study we characterize the influence of land surface changes via historical urbanization from before human settlement to the present day on meteorology and air quality in Southern California using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled to chemistry and the single-layer urban canopy model (WRF-UCM- Chem). We assume identical anthropogenic emissions for the simulations carried out and thus focus on the effect of changes in land surface physical properties and land surface processes on air quality. Historical urbanization has led to daytime air temperature decreases of up to 1.4 K and evening temperature increases of up to 1.7 K. Ventilation of air in the LA basin has decreased up to 36.6 % during daytime and increased up to 27.0 % during nighttime. These changes in meteorology are mainly attributable to higher evaporative fluxes and thermal inertia of soil from irrigation and increased surface roughness and thermal inertia from buildings. Changes in ventilation drive changes in hourly NO, concentrations with increases of up to 2.7 ppb during daytime and decreases of up to 4.7 ppb at night. Hourly O-3 concentrations decrease by up to 0.94 ppb in the morning and increase by up to 5.6 ppb at other times of day. Changes in O-3 concentrations are driven by the competing effects of changes in ventilation and precursor NO(x )concentrations. PM2.5 concentrations show slight increases during the day and decreases of up to 2.5 mu g M-3 at night. Process drivers for changes in PM(2)(.5)( )include modifications to atmospheric ventilation and temperature, which impact gas-particle phase partitioning for semi-volatile compounds and chemical reactions. Understanding process drivers related to how land surface changes effect regional meteorology and air quality is crucial for decision-making on urban planning in megapolitan Southern California to achieve regional climate adaptation and air quality improvements.","[Li, Yun; Zhang, Jiachen; Ban-Weiss, George A.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Sailor, David J.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA",University of Southern California; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Ban-Weiss, GA (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",banweiss@usc.edu,"Zhang, Jiachen/AAK-7045-2020; Sailor, David/E-6308-2014","Zhang, Jiachen/0000-0003-4981-2328; Ban-Weiss, George/0000-0001-8211-2628; Sailor, David/0000-0003-1720-8214","US National Science Foundation [CBET-1512429, CBET-1623948, CBET-1752522]; University of Southern California's Center for High-Performance Computing",US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Southern California's Center for High-Performance Computing,"This research is supported by the US National Science Foundation under grants CBET-1512429, CBET-1623948, and CBET-1752522.

Small-scale irrigation is becoming the main mechanism in livelihood enhancement discourse especially in recent times when the rainfall pattern is becoming erratic in the country. Small-scale irrigation is a policy priority in Ethiopia for rural poverty alleviation and growth, as well as climate adaptation. The aim of the study is to examine the effect of small-scale irrigation on income of rural household in the North Eastern Ethiopia. The study used Taro proportional sampling techniques formula to get 200 sampling respondents of irrigation and non-irrigation users. Econometric model such as Propensity Score Matching method and binary logistic regression model were used to study the specific objectives, impact of use of small-scale irrigation on households' income and determinants of smallholder farmers' decision to participate in small-scale irrigation water use, respectively. The Propensity Score Matching model using logit estimate indicated that family size, credit access and subsidy with productive safety net program were found positive significant effect. The logit model discovered that sex, livestock holding size, dwelling distance from irrigation farm, and subsidy by productive safety net programme and credit access have determinant effect on decision participation in small-scale irrigation. Therefore, attention should be given by the government in expanding of modern irrigation practice and constructing improved storage house should be given priorities.","[Alemu, Melese] Kebri Dehar Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Kebri Dehar, Ethiopia; [Dessale, Moges] Wollo Univ, Dept Agr Econ, POB 1145, Dessie, Ethiopia",,"Dessale, M (corresponding author), Wollo Univ, Dept Agr Econ, POB 1145, Dessie, Ethiopia.",melesealemu10@gmail.com; mogesd2255@gmail.com,"Alemu, Moges Dessale/AEM-5306-2022","Alemu, Moges Dessale/0000-0002-5744-7802",,,,,48,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2363-5037,2363-5045,,SUST WAT RESOUR MAN,Sustain.

To date, spatially explicit and accurate information of the pasture resource base is needed for improved climate-adapted livestock rangeland grazing. This study developed deep learning predictive models of pasture yield, as total standing dry matter in tonnes per hectare (TSDM (tha(-1))), from field measurements and both remotely piloted aircraft systems and satellite imagery. Repeated remotely piloted aircraft system structure measurements derived from structure from motion photogrammetry provided measures of pasture biomass from many overlapping high-resolution images. These measurements were taken throughout a growing season and were modelled with persistent photosynthetic pasture responses from various Planet Dove high spatial resolution satellite image-derived vegetation indices. Pasture height modelling as an input to the modelling of yield was assessed against terrestrial laser scanning and reported correlation coefficients (R-2) from 0.3 to 0.8 for both a coastal grassland and inland woodland pasture. Accuracy of the predictive modelling from both the remotely piloted aircraft system and the Planet Dove satellite image estimates of pasture yield ranged from 0.8 to 1.8 TSDM (tha(-1)). These results indicated that the practical application of repeated remotely piloted aircraft system derived measures of pasture yield can, with some limitations, be scaled-up to satellite-borne imagery to provide more temporally and spatially explicit measures of the pasture resource base.","[Barnetson, Jason; Phinn, Stuart; Scarth, Peter] Univ Queensland, Joint Remote Sensing Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Barnetson, Jason] Queensland Dept Environm & Sci, Grazing Land Syst Remote Sensing Ctr, Dutton Pk, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia",University of Queensland,"Barnetson, J (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Joint Remote Sensing Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.;Barnetson, J (corresponding author), Queensland Dept Environm & Sci, Grazing Land Syst Remote Sensing Ctr, Dutton Pk, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia.",jason.barnetson@des.qld.gov.au; s.phinn@uq.edu.au; p.scarth@uq.edu.au,"; Phinn, Stuart/J-8457-2013","Barnetson, Jason/0000-0002-2399-877X; Phinn, Stuart/0000-0002-2605-6104; Scarth, Peter/0000-0001-5091-7915",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; University of Queensland Joint Remote Sensing Research Program; QLD Department of Environment and Science; Department of Agriculture and Fisheries-Drought and Climate Adaptation Program,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); University of Queensland Joint Remote Sensing Research Program; QLD Department of Environment and Science; Department of Agriculture and Fisheries-Drought and Climate Adaptation Program","The anonymous reviewers for their review and feedback of the manuscript.

This has led to different strategies by communities, governments, and businesses involved in food systems to mitigate and adapt to the unfolding pandemic. Small Island Developing States are particularly exposed to the conflation of risks from COVID-19 disease, economic downturns, underlying climate vulnerabilities and biosecurity risks. Objective: Our study aimed to identify the food systems vulnerabilities, impacts, and opportunities for supporting resilience and sustainable development in selected Pacific Island countries, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste. The study focused on the impacts from the first six months of the pandemic (February-July 2020), with remote data collection and analysis done between May and July 2020. Methods: We conducted 67 interviews, and triangulated information with desktop and news sources emerging at the time. We present results on the effect on smallholder livelihoods, supply chains, governance, communities and employment. Overall, the major impacts of COVID-19 have been on economies, posing risks to future food security and further hampering progress towards key Sustainable Development Goals. Results and conclusions: We found that unemployment and economic contraction have been the most severe effects to date, with long-term consequences for food value chains and smallholder farmers. Disruptions to tourism, labour migration, and remittances have led to varying socio-economic impacts throughout the region. Vulnerable groups, notably women, urban poor, and youth, have been disproportionately affected by unemployment. TimorLeste has had some social protection measures, whereas in Pacific Countries these have been varied. The lockdowns and State of Emergency initially influenced the distribution and marketing of food, but local food economies are starting to stabilise. The continued functioning of international food supply chains reduced the risk of food insecurity in high import dependent nations, notably import dependent countries like Tuvalu and Kiribati. Significance: The results have significance for three recovery pathways. The first recovery pathway relates to revisiting value chains in light of restricted travel. The second recovery pathway exists through leveraging the adaptive capacities of communities to stimulate innovative agriculture that also integrates climate adaptation and nutrition. The third recovery pathway relates to addressing the structural challenges that perpetuate inequalities and poverty while finding new ways of implementing inclusive policies and research.

Hydroelectricity offers potentially low greenhouse-gas emission, renewable energy and reliable energy storage. However, hydroelectricity developments are large, complicated projects and possibly critically vulnerable to changes in climate and other assumptions related to future uncertainties. This paper presents a general assessment approach for evaluating the resilience of hydroelectricity projects to uncertainty in climate and other risk factors (e.g., financial, natural hazard). The process uses a decision analytic framework based on a decision scaling approach, which combines scenario neutral analysis and vulnerability-specific probability assessment. The technical evaluation process involves identification of project objectives, specification of uncertain factors, multi-dimensional sensitivity analysis, and data mining to identify vulnerability-specific scenarios and vulnerability-specific estimations of risk. The process is demonstrated with an application to a proposed hydropower facility on the Arun River in Nepal. The findings of the case study illustrate an example in which climate change is not the critical future uncertainty, and consequently highlight the importance of considering multiple uncertainties in combination.","[Ray, Patrick A.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, 601 Engn Res Ctr, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Wi, Sungwook; Brown, Casey M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 130 Nat Resources Rd, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Bonzanigo, Laura; Karki, Pravin; Garcia, Luis E.; Rodriguez, Diego J.] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Yang, Yi-Chen E.] Lehigh Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Fritz Engn Lab, 13 East Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; The World Bank; Lehigh University,"Ray, PA (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, 601 Engn Res Ctr, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",patrick.ray@uc.edu,,"Ray, Patrick/0000-0001-9495-2317",World Bank [717 4462]; Massachusetts Green High-Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC),World Bank(The World Bank India); Massachusetts Green High-Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC),"This project was funded under World Bank Contract 717 4462: Including Climate Uncertainty in Water Resources Planning and Project Design - Decision Tree Initiative.

However, the ECEs difference between early (from December 1 to January 15) and late (from January 16 to February 28) winters is a lack of sufficient understanding. Herein, we investigated the trends of ECEs over eastern China in early and late winters. Results showed that the number of days with ECEs had a faster and uniformly decreasing trend in late winter over eastern China, whereas the decreasing trend in early winter was not significant because of the dipole pattern with an increase of ECEs in northeast China and a decrease of ECEs in southeast China during the time period 1980-2021. This denoted that China was presenting a pattern of cold early winter-warm late winter . The feature of cold early winter was related to a significant increase in high-latitude blocking highs extending poleward and reaching the Arctic Circle in early winter during the last 20 years. In particular, there was a large-scale tilted high ridge from the Ural Mountains to northern Asia, which favored the negative phase of the Arctic oscillation. This, in turn, led to a strong Siberian high and East Asian winter monsoon. Strong cold advection related to the circulation anomalies caused an ECEs increase in northeast China and dominated the change in temperature over eastern China in early winter. By contrast, the decrease in ECEs in late winter in the last 20 years was more related to the interdecadal enhancement of the anticyclonic anomaly over the north Pacific (NPAC). The strong NPAC extended to East Asia in a zonal direction, causing strong warm anomalies in eastern China through warm advection and diabatic heating, which weakened the northerly and prevented the East Asian trough from moving south, resulting in a warmer East Asia and a uniform decrease in late winter.","[Dong, Wei; Shen, Xinyong; Yao, Haoxin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast andEvaluat Meteoro, Joint Int ResearchLaboratory Climate & Environm Ch, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Dong, Wei] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Key Lab Geosci Big Data & Deep Resource Zhejiang P, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Liang; Yao, Haoxin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmosphere Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Wei] Beijing Inst Appl Meteorol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Chunyan] Inner Mongolia Meteorol Serv Ctr, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Shen, Xinyong] Southern MarineScience & Engn Guangdong Lab, Zhuhai, Peoples R China","Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Zhejiang University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Shen, XY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast andEvaluat Meteoro, Joint Int ResearchLaboratory Climate & Environm Ch, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Zhao, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmosphere Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Cheng, W (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Appl Meteorol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Guo, CY (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Meteorol Serv Ctr, Hohhot, Peoples R China.;Shen, XY (corresponding author), Southern MarineScience & Engn Guangdong Lab, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.",zhaol@lasg.iap.ac.cn; chengw@mail.iap.ac.cn; guocy1266@126.com; shenxy@nuist.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences [41790471, 42075040, 41975054]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [XDA20100304];  [2018YFA0606203];  [2019YFC1510400]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Key Research and Development Program of China; ; ,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41790471, 42075040, 41975054), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20100304), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFA0606203, 2019YFC1510400).",,45,0,0,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Using a case study methodology, we will examine the case of the Magdalen Island Archipelago in Quebec, Canada, and pinpoint the subcase of La Grave. The case study will show how tourism is adding value to land dynamics to justify major adaptation work on the shore in order to protect the capital accumulation capacities of the tourism space.

Fisheries governance and regulations can alter socio-ecological resilience to climate change impacts via harvest control rules and incentives driving fisher behavior, yet there are no syntheses or conceptual frameworks for examining how institutions and their regulatory approaches can alter fisheries resilience to climate change. We identify nine key climate resilience criteria for fisheries socio-ecological systems (SES), defining resilience as the ability of the coupled system of interacting social and ecological components (i.e., the SES) to absorb change while avoiding transformation into a different undesirable state. We then evaluate the capacity of four fisheries regulatory systems that vary in their degree of property rights, including open access, limited entry, and two types of rights-based management, to increase or inhibit resilience. Our exploratory assessment of evidence in the literature suggests that these regulatory regimes vary widely in their ability to promote resilient fisheries, with rights-based approaches appearing to offer more resilience benefits in many cases, but detailed characteristics of the regulatory instruments are fundamental.","[Ojea, Elena] Univ Vigo, Future Oceans Lab, Edificio Torre CACTI,Campus Univ, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Ojea, Elena] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Spain; [Pearlman, Isaac; Gaines, Steven D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, 2400 Bren Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lester, Sarah E.] Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Bellamy Bldg, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Universidade de Vigo; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Ojea, E (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Future Oceans Lab, Edificio Torre CACTI,Campus Univ, Vigo 36310, Spain.;Ojea, E (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Spain.",elenaojea@uvigo.es; isaac.pearlman@gmail.com; gaines@bren.ucsb.edu; slester@fsu.edu,"Gaines, Steven/Y-3234-2019; ojea, elena/D-3709-2018","ojea, elena/0000-0003-4991-8077",Basque Government; European Research Council under the European Horizon 2020 Program / ERC [679812]; Waitt Foundation,Basque Government(Basque Government); European Research Council under the European Horizon 2020 Program / ERC; Waitt Foundation,"E.

The energy needed in order to produce the same average live body weight at 18 weeks was similar in all the 3 climatic chambers. The effect of treatments in the growing period was not significantly different (P > 0.05) for most of the parameters subsequently measured during the laying period. The exception was the body weight gain between 18 and 38 weeks and the food and energy intakes. However, apart from the sexual maturity, all these parameters were negatively influenced (P < 0.05) by the effect of hot climates during the laying period irrespective of method of rearing. The results of this study seem to indicate that ambient temperature experienced during the first 18 weeks after hatching has little effect on subsequent productivity and that rearing birds at high ambient temperature does not acclimatise them to these conditions better than rearing them under temperate conditions.","INRA,RECH AVICOLES STN,F-37380 MONNAIE,FRANCE",INRAE,"NJOYA, J (corresponding author), CTR ZOOTECH & VET RES,POB 125,BAMENDA,CAMEROON.",,,,,,,,11,10,10,0,4,EDINBURGH UNIV PRESS,EDINBURGH,"TRADE DEPT 22 GEORGE SQUARE, EDINBURGH, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND EH8 9LF",0049-4747,,,TROP ANIM HEALTH PRO,Trop.

Climate change impact assessments of ski areas in Australia, Europe and North America all project negative consequences for the industry. An important limitation of earlier studies has been the incomplete consideration of snowmaking as a climate adaptation strategy. Recognising that snowmaking is an integral component of the ski industry, this study examined how current and improved snowmaking capacity affects the vulnerability of the ski industry in southern Ontario (Canada) to climate variability and change. A 17 yr record of daily snow conditions and operations from a primary ski area in the region was used to calibrate a ski season simulation model that included a snowmaking module with climatic thresholds and operational decision rules based on interviews with ski area managers. Climate change scenarios (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) were developed by downscaling climate variables from 4 general circulation models (using both IS92a and SIZES emission scenarios) with the LARS weather generator (parameterized to local climate stations) for input into a daily snow depth simulation model. In contrast to earlier studies, the results indicate that ski areas in the region could remain operational in a warmer climate, particularly within existing business planning and investment time horizons (into the 2020s), The economic impact of additional snowmaking requirements remains an important uncertainty. Under climate change scenarios and current snowmaking technology, the average ski season at the case study ski area was projected to reduce by 0-16 % in the 2020s, 7-32 % in the 2050s and 11-50 % in the 2080s. Concurrent with the projected ski season losses, the estimated amount of snowmaking required increased by 36-144 % in the scenarios for the 2020s. Required snowmaking amounts increased by 48-187 % in the scenarios for the 2020s. The ability of individual ski areas to absorb additional snowmaking costs and remain economically viable in addition to the relative impact of climate change on other nearby ski regions (Quebec, Michigan and Vermont) remain important avenues of further research. The findings reveal the importance of examining a wide range of climate change scenarios and the necessity of including snowmaking and other adaptation strategies in future climate change vulnerability assessments of the ski industry and winter tourism in other regions of the world.","Univ Waterloo, Adaptat & Impacts Res Grp, Fac Environm Studies, Environm Canada, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog, Fac Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Scott, D (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Adaptat & Impacts Res Grp, Fac Environm Studies, Environm Canada, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",dj2scott@fes.uwaterloo.ca,"Scott, Daniel/AAB-6190-2020","Scott, Daniel/0000-0001-7825-9301",,,,,30,227,232,5,79,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

However, even in low-lying, flood prone countries like the Netherlands, climate change, weather extremes, economic growth, urbanization, land subsidence and increased food production will make it more complex to guarantee sufficient freshwater for all sectors. Furthermore, the frequency and amplitude of extremely dry and wet weather conditions is expected to increase. The current Dutch water management system is not designed to anticipate these extremes. Over the last decades, drained Dutch agricultural fields, land consolidation and urbanization resulted in declining groundwater tables. Additionally, the fresh water demand of different sectors (agriculture, industry, drinking water) increased, causing an increased pressure on the regional groundwater system. As a consequence, the annual groundwater table in sandy soil areas dropped over time with the effect that, nowadays, fresh water is becoming scarce in dry periods. In this paper we provide insight in the shifting water management strategy in the Netherlands (1950-2020), with the corresponding drainage systems, developing from conventional drainage (approx. 1950-1990), to controlled drainage (1990's onwards), climate adaptive drainage (2010 onwards) and subirrigation systems (2018 onwards). Furthermore, we provide insight in the effect of subirrigation on groundwater levels and crop yields, based on both international literature and measurements of Dutch field pilots. Although subirrigation can contribute to improved soil moisture conditions for crop growth on field scale, we show that the water volume needed for subirrigation can be large and could put a significant pressure on the available regional water sources. Therefore, efficient and responsible use of the available external water sources for subirrigation (e.g. surface water, treated waste water, or groundwater) is required. Finally, the implementation of controlled drainage with subirrigation asks for correct implementation in the regional balance: it requires an integral, catchment-wide approach.","[de Wit, J. A.

Standardized measures of resilience which can be used across different geographical and socioeconomic contexts are however sparse. We present and analyze a standardized community resilience measurement framework for flooding. The corresponding measurement tool is modelled based on and adapted from a so-called 'technical risk grading' approach as used in the insurance sector. The grading approach of indicators is based on a two-step process: (i) raw data is collected, and (ii) experts grade the indicators, called sources of resilience, based on this data. We test this approach using approximately 1.25 million datapoints collected across more than 118 communities in nine countries. The quantitative analysis is complemented by content analysis to validate the results from a qualitative perspective. We find that some indicators can more easily be graded by looking at raw data alone, while others require a stronger application of expert judgement. We summarize the reasons for this through six key messages. One major finding is that resilience grades related to subjective characteristics such as ability, feel, and trust are far more dependent on expert judgment than on the actual raw data collected. Additionally, the need for expert judgement further increases if graders must extrapolate the whole community picture from limited raw data. Our findings regarding the role of data and grade specifications can inform ways forward for better, more efficient and increasingly robust standardized assessment of resilience. This should help to build global standardized and comparable, yet locally contextualized, baseline estimates of the many facets of resilience in order to track progress over time on disaster and climate resilience and inform the implementation of the Paris Agreement, Sendai Framework, and the Sustainable Development Goals.","[Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan; Laurien, Finn; Velev, Stefan; Keating, Adriana; Mechler, Reinhard] IIASA Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Hochrainer-Stigler, S (corresponding author), IIASA Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria.",hochrain@iiasa.ac.at; laurien@iiasa.ac.at; velev@iiasa.ac.at; keatinga@iiasa.ac.at; mechler@iiasa.ac.at,"Keating, Adriana/GSE-5451-2022",/0000-0003-2239-1578,International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC); International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Wharton Business School's Risk Management and Decision Processes Center (Wharton); international development non-governmental organization Practical Action; Zurich Insurance Group,International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC); International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Wharton Business School's Risk Management and Decision Processes Center (Wharton); international development non-governmental organization Practical Action; Zurich Insurance Group,"The alliance members who designed and managed the implementation of the Gen 1 tool are the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), the Wharton Business School's Risk Management and Decision Processes Center (Wharton), the international development non-governmental organization Practical Action, and Zurich Insurance Group who are also funding the endeavor.",,39,7,7,3,29,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

With a mega-biodiversity ecosystem, the assessment of forest cover resilience will enhance the effectiveness of climate adaptive conservation strategies. In the current study, we have used an open source tree canopy cover percentage (TCC %) data to map the spatial distribution of forest, scrub, grassland and treeless, and to relate with long term annual precipitation. The natural occurrences forest, scrub, grassland and treeless were identified in the precipitation ranges as 340-8650mm, 196-1018mm, 167-995mm, and 34-965mm precipitation, respectively; whereas their mean values were observed as 1952mm, 779mm, 760mm, and 322mm respectively. We applied binary logistic regression with the binary presence and absence of life forms, and used the probability value to define the resilience state and precipitation thresholds. Only 0.02% of the total forest covers in India are estimated least resilient observed in the dry regions in the trans-Himalaya. Whereas, the forest covers in the wet climate regimes as the Western Ghats, Western Himalaya, Eastern Ghats and North-East (NE) India are predicted highly resilient. The forest cover resilience curve saturates about 1400mm precipitation, indicating majority forest covers in India are extremely resilient that can withstand large precipitation alterations in addition to the shorter drought periods. However, the TCC % loss and gain during 2000-2017 were observed dominantly in highly resilient forest covers areas may be indicating its anthropogenic origin. The precipitation thresholds of each life forms and forest cover resilience are critically important in ecological research. Moreover, the spatially explicit forest cover resilience map offers to integrate with other spatial and non-spatial data to frame uniform and improved conservation and management policies in India under the threats to climate alteration.","[Das, P.; Behera, M.

Big challenges occur in the form of uncontrolled urban sprawl due to rapid population growth with encroachment of agricultural land, which leads to environmental and climatic issues like urban heat island effects, air pollution and flooding events. Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide new computer-based technologies for urban planners which can greatly ease the monitoring of agricultural loss as well as improve decision making for future land management. In the first part of this study, land cover change dynamics are thoroughly assessed using moderate and high spatial resolution satellite imagery (Landsat and SPOT) over the period 2010-2017 in 22 districts of HCMC. In the second part, the land cover classification results of 2017 provide the initial map for a GIS-based Multi-Criteria-Decision-Analysis (MCDA) of potential agricultural protection sites. Therefore, criteria of climate adaptation and ecological service are established and embedded in the GIS-compatible Compromise Programming Model (CP). With the use of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) by Thomas L. Saaty and additional expert knowledge, appropriate weighting factors have been affiliated. The results show that agricultural land decreased by more than two thirds in the period considered. However, particularly the western rural districts Binh Chanh and Hoc Mon still offer a great amount of valuable agricultural land suitable for protection. The proposed method can serve as a scientific framework for planning departments of fast growing cities to zone agricultural land for protection on an early planning stage in order to ensure sustainable land use development in the future.","[Schaefer, Mathias; Nguyen Xuan Thinh] TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Spatial Informat Management & Modelling, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Schaefer, M (corresponding author), TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Spatial Informat Management & Modelling, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",mathias.schaefer@tu-dortmund.de,"BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/AAC-9538-2021","BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/0000-0002-3614-9910; Schaefer, Mathias/0000-0002-5330-7714",German Martin-Schmeisser-Foundation (TU Dortmund University); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; TU Dortmund University,German Martin-Schmeisser-Foundation (TU Dortmund University); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); TU Dortmund University,This work was partly funded by the German Martin-Schmeisser-Foundation (TU Dortmund University) and was also supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and TU Dortmund University within the funding programme Open Access Publishing.,,71,22,24,6,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,MAY,2019,5,5,,,,,,,e01773,10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01773,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01773,,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,IG1OR,31193515,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000473561400198,View Full Record in Web of Science

Population growth and uncertainties due to climate change make historic data not a reliable source of information for future planning of water resources, hence necessitating climate and landuse change impact studies. This work presents an integrated modeling approach by linking Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and MODSIM. While SWAT produces hydrologic and water resources information, MODSIM provides a decision support system for water allocation. We used the coupled SWAT-MODSIM to analyze the effects of climate and cropping pattern changes on agricultural and hydroenergy production in the Karkheh River Basin, a semiarid region in south-west of Iran. Cropping patterns were considered by limiting the cereal production to 50 % (S1, near to historic), 17 % (S2), and 83 % (S3) of total agricultural areas. The future climate was provided by the Canadian Global Coupled Model (CGCM 3.1 version T63) for A1B, A2, and B1 scenarios. The results showed that based on future climate changes and landuse scenarios, wheat production had a large variation in five economically important agricultural regions ranging from 33,000 ton year(-1) (S2-A1B) to 74,000 ton year(-1) (S3-A2). Similarly, energy production, while increasing from 614 to 1,100 GWH in A2, decreased from 614 to 464 GWH in B1 climate scenario. Our analyses indicate that cropping pattern change can be used as an effective tool to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change.","[Vaghefi, S. Ashraf; Mousavi, S.

These should, ideally, be based on sound scientific information so as to positively impact them.","[Cherif, Sadia] Univ Alassane Ouattara, Dept Anthropol & Sociol, 13 BP 1476, Abidjan 13, Cote Ivoire; [Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Chester St, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Azeiteiro, Ulisses M.] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Azeiteiro, Ulisses M.] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Manchester Metropolitan University; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Leal, W (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Chester St, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England.",cherif.sadia@yahoo.fr; w.leal@mmu.ac.uk; ulisses@ua.pt,"Azeiteiro, Ulisses Manuel de Miranda/C-5933-2008; Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022","Azeiteiro, Ulisses Manuel de Miranda/0000-0002-5252-1700; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225",,,,,51,2,2,0,13,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",1758-2083,1758-2091,,INT J GLOBAL WARM,Int.

Then he describes how the adaptation approach based on an urban design sensitive to water can reduce the vulnerability generated by pollution of the banks of the main river in the city.

We explore, through qualitative analysis, the relationship between community social structure, indigenous knowledge, water management technologies and practices, and water governance rules under conditions of anthropogenic climate change. From participant observational and interview data (n = 32), we find that historically-dependent community roles establish a social contract for water distribution. Cultural conventions establish linked hierarchies of water ownership, profit-sharing and social responsibility; collectively they construct an equitable system of role-sharing, social benefit distribution, socio-ecological resilience and adaptive capacity in the face of climate change-induced drought. We conclude that the combination of hierarchical land ownership-based water distribution and what we term 'bilateral compensatory mutual assistance' for the lowest-profit agricultural water users, provides a model of spontaneous common pool resource management that bolsters community drought resilience. We use this case to proffer recommendations for adapting other centralized, grey infrastructure and regulatory models of water management from lessons learned from this spontaneous adaptive management case.","[Ghorbani, Mehdi; Borji, Moslem] Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Reclamat Arid & Mt Reg, Karaj, Iran; [Eskandari-Damaneh, Hamed] Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Desertificat, Karaj, Iran; [Cotton, Matthew] Teesside Univ, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England; [Ghoochani, Omid M.] Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Fac Agr Engn & Rural Dev, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Ahvaz, Iran; [Borji, Moslem] Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Watershed Management, Karaj, Iran",University of Tehran; University of Tehran; University of Teesside; University of Tehran,"Ghoochani, OM (corresponding author), Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Fac Agr Engn & Rural Dev, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Ahvaz, Iran.",mehrab.omid@gmail.com,,"M.

This procedure enables us to quantify the effects of two natural adaptation measures on soybean production in China, concern on which has been growing owing to the rapidly rising demand for soybean and the foreseen global climate change. The parameters calibration and mode verification are based on the observation records of soybean growth at 13 agro-meteorological observation stations in Northeast China and Huang-Huai-Hai Plain over 1981-2011. The calibration of eco-physiological parameters is based on the algorithms of DSSAT that simulate the dynamic bio-physiological processes of crop growth in daily time-step. The effects of shifts in planting day and changes in the length of growth cycle (LGC) are evaluated by the speedy algorithms of AEZ. Results indicate that without adaptation, climate change from the baseline 1961-1990 to the climate of 2050s as specified in the Providing Regional Climate for Impacts Studies-A1B would decrease the potential yield of soybean. By contrast, simulations of DSSAT using AEZ-recommended cultivars with adaptive LGC and also the corresponding adaptive planting dates show that the risk of yield loss could be fully or partially mitigated across majority of grid cells in the major soybean-growing areas.","[Fan, Dongli; Ding, Qiuying] Shanghai Inst Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ding, Qiuying; Tian, Zhan] Shanghai Meteorol Bur, Shanghai Climate Ctr, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Sun, Laixiang] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Sun, Laixiang; Fischer, Guenther] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria",Shanghai Institute of Technology; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Tian, Z (corresponding author), Shanghai Meteorol Bur, Shanghai Climate Ctr, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",zhantzy@gmail.com,"Sun, Laixiang/ABB-2622-2021","Sun, Laixiang/0000-0002-7784-7942","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371110, 41601049, 41671113]; China Meteorological Administration [CCSF201330, CCSF201112]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Meteorological Administration,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41371110) and the China Meteorological Administration (Grant No. CCSF201330 and CCSF201112).

Movement of growing areas to limit exposure to adverse climate conditions has been discussed as a theoretical adaptive response but has not previously been quantified or demonstrated at a global scale. Here, we assess how changes in rainfed crop area have already mediated growing season temperature trends for rainfed maize, wheat, rice, and soybean using spatially-explicit climate and crop area data from 1973 to 2012. Our results suggest that the most damaging impacts of warming on rainfed maize, wheat, and rice have been substantially moderated by the migration of these crops over time and the expansion of irrigation. However, continued migration may incur substantial environmental costs and will depend on socio-economic and political factors in addition to land suitability and climate.","[Sloat, Lindsey L.; Mueller, Nathaniel D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Sloat, Lindsey L.; Mueller, Nathaniel D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Davis, Steven J.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Gerber, James S.; Ray, Deepak K.; West, Paul C.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Moore, Frances C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Sloat, LL (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.;Sloat, LL (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",lindsey.sloat@colostate.edu,"Ray, Deepak K/F-7720-2012; Davis, Steven J/F-9968-2010; Mueller, Nathan D/E-5864-2010; Davis, Steven/Y-2838-2019; West, Paul/J-1665-2015","Ray, Deepak K/0000-0002-2856-9608; Davis, Steven J/0000-0002-9338-0844; Mueller, Nathan D/0000-0003-1857-5104; Davis, Steven/0000-0002-9338-0844; Gerber, James/0000-0002-6890-0481; West, Paul/0000-0001-9024-1657",USDA NIFA [2016-67012-27434]; U.S. National Science Foundation; USDA NIFA (INFEWS grant) [EAR 1639318]; USDA NIFA (NIFA grant) [12225279]; Belmont Forum/FACCE-JPI [NE/M021327/1]; Institute on the Environment,USDA NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USDA NIFA (INFEWS grant); USDA NIFA (NIFA grant); Belmont Forum/FACCE-JPI; Institute on the Environment,"L.S. and N.M. were supported by USDA NIFA (2016-67012-27434).

First, we analysed the risks to the water resources sector derived from climate change. We then identified the main objective of water adaptation measures: ensuring there is enough water for food, for people, and for ecosystems. This implies visions about availability - being sufficient water -, accessibility - both physical and economic access -, and adequacy - being safe for ecosystems and human consumption. A portfolio of local and collective actions to adapt water management for agriculture to climate change in Mediterranean countries is presented. Adaptation strategies included improved efficiency, optimisation of governance, enhancement of participation, development of risk-based choices, and economic instruments. Finally, the paper categorised the constraints to implement the measures, give specific examples about these issues and also quantify their impact. When considering constraints and opportunities to implement these water management practices, any environmental policy regulating their adoption should be based on recommending the use of extension and training to local actors on the application of the practices.","[Iglesias, Ana] UPM, Dept Agr Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Santillan, David; Garrote, Luis] UPM, Dept Civil Engn, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Iglesias, A (corresponding author), UPM, Dept Agr Econ, Madrid, Spain.",ana.iglesias@upm.es,"SANCHEZ, DAVID SANTILLAN/AAX-1110-2021; Garrote, Luis/B-5925-2013; Iglesias, Ana/AEN-3261-2022","SANCHEZ, DAVID SANTILLAN/0000-0002-9749-0522; Garrote, Luis/0000-0001-9087-3638; ",European Commission through iSQAPPER project; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid through ADAPT project,European Commission through iSQAPPER project; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid through ADAPT project,"We acknowledge the financial support of the European Commission through iSQAPPER project and of Universidad Politecnica de Madrid through ADAPT project.

The recent revision of the EU Directive 2014/52/EU on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) requires changes in the EIA practice of the EU member states. This paper investigates the extent to which the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) can contribute to an early consideration of climate change consequences in planning processes. In particular the roles of different actors in order to incorporate climate change impacts and adaptation into project planning subject to EIA at the appropriate levels are a core topic. Semi-structured expert interviews were carried out with representatives of the main infrastructure companies and institutions responsible in these sectors in Austria, which have to carry out EIA regularly. In a second step expert interviews were conducted with EIA assessors and EIA authorities in Austria and Germany, in order to examine the extent to which climate-based changes are already considered in EIA processes. This paper aims to discuss the different perspectives in the current EIA practice with regard to integrating climate change impacts as well as barriers and solutions identified by the groups of actors involved, namely project developers, environmental competent authorities and consultants (EIA assessors/practitioners). The interviews show that different groups of actors consider the topic to different degrees. Downscaling of climate change scenarios is in this context both, a critical issue with regards to availability of data and costs. Furthermore, assistance for the interpretation of relevant impacts, to be deducted from climate change scenarios, on the specific environmental issues in the area is needed. The main barriers identified by the EIA experts therefore include a lack of data as well as general uncertainty as to how far climate change should be considered in the process without reliable data but in the presence of knowledge about possible consequences at an abstract level. A joint strategy on how to cope with uncertain prognoses about main impacts on environmental issues for areas without reliable data requires a discussion and cooperation between EIA consultants and environmental authorities.

The first global stocktake will be undertaken in 2023, and an assessment of loss and damage from climate change is an important part of the process. Loss and damage refer to the impacts of climate change felt when mitigation and adaptation efforts are inadequate or absent. Much data, including metrics and indicators relevant for loss and damage, are held in existing global databases, but these are disparate and cannot easily be combined and compared to support the global stocktake. We combine relevant primary data sources to provide a harmonized country-level global dataset containing relevant indicators of recorded losses and damages from climate-related events; exposure to climate-related events; country vulnerability and adaptation readiness; scientific studies of climate change attribution; financial support for climate adaptation; and contextual governance conditions. The indicators are standardized against country population and GDP where relevant. We describe original data sources, processing steps, and an overview of key indicators in the dataset. We also compare the assembled data to existing global risk databases; namely, the INFORM risk index and the World Risk Index. This comparison, provided in the Supporting Information, shows a large amount of redundancy among vulnerability and governance indicators, and we suggest that creators of new databases and risk indices be clear about data limitations and the gaps that specific indices attempt to fill in the global data landscape. We recommend the standard use of ISO codes in future databases of this nature, as well as clear metadata regarding how overseas territories are treated relative to their sovereign state, and information on dissolution and creation of states over time.","[Scown, Murray W.; Boyd, Emily] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Scown, Murray W.; Triyanti, Annisa] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Chaffin, Brian C.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",Lund University; Utrecht University; University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Scown, MW (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden.",m.w.scown@uu.nl,,"Triyanti, Annisa/0000-0001-5524-7551",Swedish Research Council Formas [FR-2018/0010]; Lund University Library,Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Lund University Library,The research is funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas Grant FR-2018/0010 `Recasting the Disproportionate Impact of Climate Extremes (DICE)'.

As a result, the construction of the GERD, the Earth's eighth largest dam, ignited a furious debate among Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt on its filling policies and long-term operation. Ethiopia and Egypt's stance on the Nile River's water resources, combined with a nationalistic policy debate on the GERD's filling policies and long-term operation, has severely affected progress toward reaching agreeable terms before the first round of GERD filling was completed. These three countries continue to debate on the terms of agreement for the second round of GERD filling, scheduled to start by July 2021. We examined the GERD filling strategy for five- and six-year terms using time series data for the periods 1979-1987 and 1987-1992 to combine analyses for dry and wet seasons and investigate the potential impacts of filling the GERD above the downstream HAD using four HAD starting water levels. A model calibrated using MIKE Hydro results shows that during both five- and six-year terms of future GERD filling, Egypt would not need to invoke the HAD's minimum operating level. We pursued a narrative approach that appeals to both a technical and nontechnical readership, and our results show the urgent need for cooperation at both policy and technical levels to mitigate and adapt to future climate change through the development of climate-proof agreements. Moreover, the results call for the riparian countries to move away from the current nationalistic policy debate approach and pursue a more cooperative, economically beneficial, and climate adaptive approach.","[Yimere, Abay; Assefa, Engdawork] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Environm & Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Yimere, Abay] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Ctr Int Environm & Resource Policy CIERP, Res Affiliate, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Addis Ababa University; Tufts University,"Yimere, A (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Environm & Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.;Yimere, A (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Ctr Int Environm & Resource Policy CIERP, Res Affiliate, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",yimabay@gmail.com,"Abay, Ezra/HKF-4730-2023","Yimere, Abay/0000-0002-0686-3726",,,,,71,2,2,6,16,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",2471-2132,,,AIMS GEOSCI,AIMS Geosci.,,2021,7,3,,,,,313,330,,10.3934/geosci.2021019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/geosci.2021019,,,18,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,WB6GR,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000703668900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

It builds on the already established quasi-linear relation between global-mean temperature and regional climate change found in atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). The new approach simultaneously 1) takes correlations between temperature- and precipitation-related uncertainty distributions into account, 2) enables the inclusion of predictors other than global-mean temperature, and 3) checks for the interscenario and interrun variability of the scaling relationships. This study tests the effectiveness of SOx and black carbon emissions and greenhouse gas forcings as additional predictors of precipitation changes. The future precipitation response is found to deviate substantially from the linear relationship with global-mean temperature change in some regions; thereby, the two main limitations of a simple linear scaling approach, namely having to rely on exogenous aerosol experiments (or ignoring their regional effect), and ignoring changes in scaling coefficients when approaching equilibrium conditions, are addressed. The additional predictors can markedly improve the emulation of AOGCM simulations. In some regions, variations in hydrological sensitivity (the percentage change of precipitation per degree of warming) across different scenarios can be reduced by more than 50%. Coupled to probabilistic projections of global-mean temperatures and greenhouse gas forcings, bidimensional distributions of regional temperature and precipitation changes accounting for multiple uncertainties are derived. Based on 20 Fourth Assessment Report AOGCMs (AR4 AOGCMs), probabilistic projections are provided for two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios and 31 world regions (online database at www.pik-potsdam.de/primap/regional_temp_and_precip). As an example application of the projections for climate adaptation and vulnerability studies, future changes in the surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet are computed.","[Frieler, Katja; Meinshausen, Malte; Mengel, Matthias] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Braun, Nadine] Ecofys, Cologne, Germany; [Hare, William] Climate Analyt, Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Frieler, K (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegrafenberg A26, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",katja.frieler@pik-potsdam.de,"Meinshausen, Malte/AAG-6505-2019; Hare, Bill/A-8527-2013; Meinshausen, Malte/A-7037-2011; Meinshausen, Malte/AAG-7985-2019","Meinshausen, Malte/0000-0003-4048-3521; Hare, Bill/0000-0003-1242-8250; Meinshausen, Malte/0000-0003-4048-3521; Mengel, Matthias/0000-0001-6724-9685; Frieler, Katja/0000-0003-4869-3013",UFOPLAN by the German Federal Environment Agency [FKZ 370841103],UFOPLAN by the German Federal Environment Agency,"KF and MM were supported by the UFOPLAN project (FKZ 370841103) by the German Federal Environment Agency.

Smallholders in marginal mountainous areas (MMA) are particularly vulnerable due to precarious livelihoods in challenging environments. Acting collectively can enable and constrain the ability of smallholders to adapt to GEC. The objectives of this paper are: (i) identify collective actions in four MMA of the central Indian Himalaya Region, each with differing institutional contexts; (ii) assess the adaptive capacity of each village by measuring livelihood capital assets, diversity, and sustainable land management practices. Engaging with adaptive capacity and collective action literatures, we identify three broad approaches to adaptive capacity relating to the SDGs: natural hazard mitigation (SDG 13), social vulnerability (SDG 1, 2 and 5), and social-ecological resilience (SDG 15). We then develop a conceptual framework to understand the institutional context and identify SDG synergies and trade-offs. Adopting a mixed method approach, we analyse the relationships between collective action and the adaptive capacity of each village, the sites where apparent trade-offs and synergies among SDGs occur. Results illustrate each village has unique socio-environmental characteristics, implying distinct development challenges, vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities exist. Subsequently, specific SDG synergies and trade-offs occur even within MMA, and it is therefore crucial that institutions facilitate locally appropriate collective actions in order to achieve the SDGs. We suggest that co-production in the identification, prioritisation and potential solutions to the distinct challenges facing MMA can increase understandings of the specific dynamics and feedbacks necessary to achieve the SDGs in the context of GEC.","[Orchard, Steven; Karki, Shova Thapa; Rowhani, Pedram] Univ Sussex, Sussex Sustainabil Res Programme, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Glover, Dominic; Ayele, Seife] Inst Dev Studies, Sussex Sustainabil Res Programme, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Sen, Debashish; Rathod, Roshan] Peoples Sci Inst, Dehra Dun, Uttar Pradesh, India",University of Sussex,"Orchard, S (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sussex Sustainabil Res Programme, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",s.e.orchard@sussex.ac.uk,"Glover, Dominic/F-2365-2010","Glover, Dominic/0000-0003-2055-1996; Orchard, Steven/0000-0001-9595-6993","Sussex Sustainability Research Programme, University of Sussex, UK [SSRP2016-017]","Sussex Sustainability Research Programme, University of Sussex, UK","This research was supported by the Sussex Sustainability Research Programme, University of Sussex, UK.

This means that for companies to manage climate risks, it is important not just to assess risks in operation locations, but also throughout supply chains. In this paper, we analyse how 14 Swedish large export-oriented businesses view and address risks from physical climate impacts on their international supply chains. We find that climate change is not considered a priority risk and there is little evidence of risk management strategies implemented at the operational level. Businesses fail to see a clear causality between climate change as a global phenomenon and operational risks in the supply chain. Furthermore, the complicated structures of many supply chains make comprehensive risk assessment and management very resource-demanding.

Currently, the freshwater biodiversity crisis extends across all continents and demands urgent attention from environmental planners, practitioners, and policymakers to protect streams and their valleys. As we work to slow losses of freshwater biodiversity and restore freshwater ecosystems, it is time to revisit the important messages from Hynes. One of the most obvious and immediate actions that could be undertaken is to back off-that is, to limit human activity and new development in floodplain and riparian areas immediately adjacent to freshwater systems, including streams, rivers, lakes, and wetlands, while minimizing impacts and risks in areas with existing development. From reducing erosion and flood damage to maintaining cool water temperatures, filtering pollutants, protecting critical habitats, and enabling lateral connectivity, intact riparian zones mitigate many of the threats that degrade freshwater ecosystems. There has been much research to identify optimal setbacks and buffer-strip widths to protect against harm. As such, in many areas, our ability to protect the stream and its valley is not limited by natural science but rather our failure to consistently apply floodplain and riparian regulations and the absence of political will. We are too quick to trade off the environment for short-term economic development. In areas that are already developed, solutions are more complicated but, in many cases, represent a key priority for healing damaged ecosystems and for addressing economic and social risks of vulnerable development. We need to redefine our relationship with freshwater ecosystems, and the first step is to back off and give freshwater ecosystems the opportunity to heal while ensuring that as-of-yet intact riparian areas continue to support freshwater resiliency. In doing so, we will also gain climate adaptive benefits, given that maintaining intact riparian areas is an effective nature-based solution.","[Cooke, Steven J.; Twardek, William M.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Cooke, Steven J.; Vermaire, Jesse C.] Carleton Univ, Inst Environm & Interdisciplinary Sci, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Cooke, Steven J.; Vermaire, Jesse C.] Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Baulch, Helen M.] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 105 Adm Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A2, Canada; [Birnie-Gauvin, Kim] Danish Tech Univ, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2800 Kongens, Denmark; [Richardson, John S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Carleton University; Carleton University; Carleton University; University of Saskatchewan; Technical University of Denmark; University of British Columbia,"Cooke, SJ (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.;Cooke, SJ (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Inst Environm & Interdisciplinary Sci, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.;Cooke, SJ (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",steven.cooke@carleton.ca; jesse.vermaire@carleton.ca; helen.baulch@usask.ca; kbir@aqua.dtu.dk; william.twardek@gmail.com; john.richardson@ubc.ca,"Cooke, Steven J/F-4193-2010","Cooke, Steven J/0000-0002-5407-0659; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Technical University of Denmark and Villum Fonden,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Technical University of Denmark and Villum Fonden,"SJC, JCV, HMB, WMT, and JSR are supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

However, existing approaches lack the ability to model the combined effect of these flood mechanisms, especially under climate change and sea level rise (SLR). Thus, to increase flood resilience of coastal cities, modeling techniques to improve the understanding and prediction of the combined effect of these flood hazards are critical. To address this need, this study presents a modeling system for assessing the combined flood impact on coastal cities under selected future climate scenarios that leverages ocean modeling with land surface modeling capable of resolving urban drainage infrastructure within the city. The modeling approach is demonstrated in quantifying the impact of possible future climate scenarios on transportation infrastructure within Norfolk, Virginia, USA. A series of combined storm events are modeled for current (2020) and projected future (2070) climate scenarios. The results show that pluvial flooding causes a larger interruption to the transportation network compared to tidal flooding under current climate conditions. By 2070, however, tidal flooding will be the dominant flooding mechanism with even nuisance flooding expected to happen daily due to SLR. In 2070, nuisance flooding is expected to cause a 4.6% total link close time (TLC), which is more than two times that of a 50-year storm surge (1.8% TLC) in 2020. The coupled flood model was compared with a widely used but physically simplistic bathtub method to assess the difference resulting from the more complex modeling presented in this study. The results show that the bathtub method overestimated the flooded area near the shoreline by 9.5% and 3.1% for a 10-year storm surge event in 2020 and 2070, respectively, but underestimated the flooded area in the inland region by 9.0% and 4.0% for the same events. The findings demonstrate the benefit of sophisticated modeling methods compared to more simplistic bathtub approaches, in climate adaptive planning and policy in coastal communities.","[Shen, Yawen; Chen, T.

Food system interventions and policies give rise to synergies and trade-offs that emerge over time due to the dynamic nature and interconnections of system elements. Analysis of an entire food system is necessary to identify synergies that bring simultaneous benefits and mitigate trade-offs, both short-and long-term. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to inform the sustainable transformation of food systems by identifying short-and long-term synergies and trade-offs in the climate-smart village (CSV) Lawra-Jirapa in northern Ghana under the current practices, technologies, policies, and trends of population growth, extreme events, and climate change impacts. METHODS: We develop a system dynamics model to simulate the food system in the CSV between 2011 and 2060. We apply the climate-smart agriculture (CSA) approach as a diagnostic tool to the CSV system to reveal the short-and long-term trade-offs and synergies between the CSA goals. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The simulation results reveal short-term progress towards the goal of increased productivity and income, with trade-offs in the goals of GHG removal, climate adaptation, and resilience. In the long term, post-2035, current agriculture practices, technologies, and policies inside and outside the CSV boundaries result in trade-offs across all three CSA goals, and progress made towards these goals is reversed. The CSV system behaviour, thus, exhibits a better before worse pattern. SIGNIFICANCE: The analysis demonstrates an approach, which considers simultaneously all three CSA goals, to identify synergies and mitigate trade-offs in an entire food system. The findings suggest that understanding the dynamics of food systems is a precursor to their sustainable transformation. This transformation will entail changes to the food system's goals and structure with equal attention to short-and long-term outcomes.","[Jagustovic, Renata; Kessler, Aad; Ritsema, Coen J.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Environm Sci, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Papachristos, George] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Innovat Sci, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Zougmore, Robert B.; Ouedraogo, Mathieu] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, BP 320, Bamako, Mali; [Kotir, Julius H.] CSIRO Agr & Food, POB 203, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Dittmer, Kyle M.] Alliance Biovers Int, Cali, Colombia; [Dittmer, Kyle M.] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Cali, Colombia",Wageningen University & Research; Eindhoven University of Technology; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Jagustovic, R (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Environm Sci, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",renata.jagustovic@wur.nl,,"Kotir, Julius/0000-0001-8536-9146; Zougmore, Robert/0000-0002-6215-4852",CGIAR; CGIAR Fund Council; European Union; USAID; AustraliaACIAR; International Fund for Agricultural DevelopmentIFAD,CGIAR(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund Council(CGIAR); European Union(European Commission); USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); AustraliaACIAR; International Fund for Agricultural DevelopmentIFAD,"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) , which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Fund Donors and through several bilateral funding agreements (the CGIAR Fund Council, AustraliaACIAR, European Union, International Fund for Agricultural DevelopmentIFAD, Ireland, New Zealand, Netherlands, Switzerland, USAID, UK, and Thailand) .

The story that is presented here is derived from the engagement of participants in a transdisciplinary, co-productive workshop, theWindhoek Learning Lab 1 (March 2017), as part of the FRACTAL Research Programme. The results show that the story starts with the 'complication' where the drought had reached crisis levels where the water demand increasingly exceeded the supply in the face of the drought. The City ofWindhoek (CoW) was unable to address the problem, particularly the recharging of the Windhoek aquifer due to lack of funding. Phase 2 then shows four reactions to the drought: water conservation by water demand management; a Water Saving campaign; the Windhoek Managed Aquifer Recharge Scheme; and, the setting up of the Cabinet Technical Committee of Supply Security. The resolution of the story, Phase 4, is when the national government instructs NamWater to provide the funds for CoW to complete the recharging of the aquifer, which supplied water to the city at the last minute at the end of 2016. The final situation of the story is that ongoing collaborative work by CoW with FRACTAL on the city's burning issues is planned to integrate climate change into future decision making for the longer term. The main actors in the story are the Ministry of Agriculture and NamWater as hero and villain, and CoW a hero, with the victims of the story, the residents of informal settlements. The main learnings from this story are that the lack of decentralization of power and resources serve to exacerbate water crises at the local level and hamper climate adaptation, despite a proactive and innovative local municipality. The paper also shows that the narrative approach provides the thread of the story to simplify a very complex set of arrangements and contradictions.","[Scott, Dianne; Muchadenyika, Davison] Univ Cape Town, African Ctr Cities, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Iipinge, Kornelia N.; Mfune, John K.

Based on the temperature and precipitation data of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA 5 for northern China, this paper calculates three indexes, the standard precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the extreme degree-day (EDD), from 1979 to 2017. Monthly SPI and monthly SPEI were calculated at 1 - to - 12 month lags, and EDD was calculated per crop growth season. The yield of winter wheat, spring wheat and summer maize in each province of the study area from 1979 to 2017 was de-trended, and the relative fluctuation of the yield of the three crops was calculated. The change trends of SPI, SPEI and EDD were analysed using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope. The single and interactive effects of high temperature and drought on crop yield were studied using multidimensional Copula function. The results show that: 1) Both high temperature and drought stress in northern China show an increasing trend. The drought trend in the study area detected based on SPEI was greater than the drought trend detected by SPI. The difference between SPEI and SPI in the winter wheat growing season was smaller than that in the spring wheat and maize growing seasons. 2) With the increase in EDD and the decrease of SPI/SPEI values, the probability of negative yield fluctuation gradually increased, and the probability of positive yield fluctuation gradually decreased. Under the same drought and high temperature conditions, the probability of yield fluctuation varies among different crops and different provinces. Drought has a greater impact on crop yield than high temperature. Both the single and interactive effects of drought and high temperature on yield are nonlinear. 3) Irrigation can effectively alleviate the impact of drought and high temperature on yield. In heavily irrigated provinces, the effects of both high temperature and drought on crop yield are not obvious.","[Zhu, Xiufang] Beijing Normal Univ, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disaster, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiufang; Liu, Tingting; Xu, Kun] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Remote Sensing Sci & Engn, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Chen, Changxiu] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Ctr Geodata & Anal, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Liu, TT (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Remote Sensing Sci & Engn, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",602018834@qq.com,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFA0606901]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42077436],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Acknowledgment This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFA0606901) , and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42077436) .",,74,11,11,37,61,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Governance of risk (policies, legislation, and organizational arrangements) still focuses largely on preparing to respond to the hazards and planning for recovery. This leaves largely unattended the vulnerability component of risk, which is the only component on which change can be effected.

By employing the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), TPFW-MK test, Run Theory, Moran's I, and General G, the spatio-temporal evolution characteristic of drought was clarified and the spatial autocorrelation of local and global drought characteristic variables was explored based on the meteorological data from 122 stations in Northwest China (NWC) during 1960-2018. The results indicated that the drought situation of NWC was improving regardless of annual or seasonal scale. According to the Z-statistics by the TPFW- MK test, there existed an obvious wet trend in west NWC and a slight dry trend in east NWC. The center of gravity migration model revealed that the gravity center of SPI moved towards higher latitude over the last decades, there was a northwest (1960-1990) and northeast (1990-2018) variation in the covering shapes of the standard deviational ellipses of SPI, and the spatial distribution of SPI tended to be concentrated. Meanwhile, the distribution pattern of drought characteristics suggested that more droughts occurred in east of NWC, which were less harmful while fewer droughts happened in west NWC, which brought greater drought damage. The results of global Moran's I (GMI) indicated that both annual and seasonal drought variables were characterized with significant spatial autocorrelation, the spatial distribution of winter drought variables was more disperse than other seasons, while the damage of summer and autumn drought was bigger than that in spring and winter. Besides, the results of local Moran's I (LMI) showed that there was obvious agglomeration in the overall distribution of drought characteristic variables, which had a seesaw effect. The spatial distribution of hot spots and cold spots at different confidence levels indicated that Shaanxi Province experienced the most droughts but with shortest duration and lowest severity while northwest Xinjiang had the fewest droughts with longest duration and highest severity. The results of revealing the drought development process and identifying the location of drought aggregation will provide references for supporting climate adaptation strategies and preventing droughtrelated loss.","[Li, Hui; Hou, Enke; Deng, Jiawei] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geol & Environm, Xian, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Science & Technology,"Li, H (corresponding author), Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geol & Environm, Xian, Peoples R China.",lihui@xust.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [42007186],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42007186).,,62,0,0,11,19,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

Relatively dry, trailing edge (TE) forests are especially vulnerable to ecological transformation when tree regeneration is moisture-limited following high-severity fire. Here, we illustrate the potential landscape-scale impacts of changing disturbance regimes by focusing on TE forests in the eastern Cascades of Washington, USA. Our specific objectives were to: (1) map TE forests based on climatic water deficit and forest cover; (2) characterize the composition, structure, and ownership of TE and non-TE forests; (3) quantify recent fire activity in TE and non-TE forests; (4) identify locations of potential forest loss where recent fires have burned severely in TE forests. Across the study area, TE forests encompassed 387 000 ha, representing a substantial portion (21 per cent) of the total forested landscape. TE forests generally were characterized by dry, mixed-conifer forest types with more open structure and less biomass than non-TE forests. The structural and compositional conditions within TE forests make them ideal locations for management strategies designed to enhance landscape resilience and sustain fire-resistant trees. TE forestland ownership is diverse (35 per cent federal, 19 per cent Tribal, 16 per cent Washington State, 14 per cent private non-industrial and 13 per cent private industrial), indicating that successful land management will require collaboration among numerous partners. Recent wildfires (1984-2020) cumulatively covered 84 300 ha (22 per cent) of TE forests and 363 500 ha (25 per cent) of non-TE forests. TE forests experienced less high-severity fire than non-TE forests (39 per cent vs. 46 per cent, respectively). Recent high-severity fire effects in TE forests occurred primarily in the northern portion of the study region, reflecting the distribution of individual large fires. By quantifying the variability of TE forests and their recent fire activity, this study supports adaptive management strategies for landscape restoration, post-disturbance reforestation and climate adaptation.","[Meigs, Garrett W.; Churchill, Derek J.; Hersey, Charles M.; Smith, L.

Farmers' perception of climate variability can significantly influence their coping, mitigation, and adaptation potential. This study assessed farmers' perceptions of indicators and consequences of climate variability and explored factors influencing their perception of climate variability and adoption of climate coping strategies. A crosssectional survey design was used to sample 300 farmers in the Central Highlands of Kenya. Binary logistic regression models were used to determine factors that influenced the perception of climate variability, adaptation, and mitigation strategies based on three predictor sets, including socioeconomic, institutional, and environmental dimensions. Three climate adaptation and mitigation strategy groups adopted by farmers, including crop adjustment, nutrient management, and soil and water management practices, were subjected to binary logistic regression models. The core determinants of farmers' perception of climate variability included tropical livestock unit (TLU, p = 0.008), access to agricultural training (p = 0.022), change in agricultural production (p = 0.005), change in forest cover (p = 0.014), soil fertility status (p = 0.039), and perceptions of soil erosion (p = 0.001). Most farmers reported changes in all climatic indicators during the decade preceding the survey, including increasing temperature (80%), reduced precipitation (78%), and declining season lengths (76%). There were significant relationships between climate variability perceptions and coping strategies, with the soil and water management set showing stronger links with climate perceptions compared to crop adjustment and nutrient management strategies. Critical mitigation and adaptation strategies to cope with climate variability implemented by farmers included the use of fertilizer and manure in combination (71%), terracing (66%), and crop rotation (60%). Farmers' perceptions significantly determined the adoption of climate-smart agriculture technologies, and environmental determinants strongly influenced climate variability coping strategies. Therefore, while formulating climate sustainability-related policies, farmers' perceptions should be considered.","[Mairura, Franklin S.; Kiboi, Milka N.; Okeyo, Jeremiah M.] Univ Embu, Dept Land & Water Management, POB 6-60100, Embu, Kenya; [Musafiri, Collins M.; Ng'etich, Onesmus K.; Mugendi, Daniel N.] Univ Embu, Dept Agr Resource Management, POB 6-60100, Embu, Kenya; [Macharia, Joseph M.; Shisanya, Chris A.] Kenyatta Univ, Dept Geog, POB 43844-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Okwuosa, Elizabeth A.] Kenya Agr & Livestock Res Org KALRO Muguga, POB 30148-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ngetich, Felix K.] Jaram Oginga Odinga Univ Sci & Technol JOOUST, Dept Plant Anim & Food Sci PAFS, POB 210-40601, Bondo, Kenya",Kenyatta University,"Mairura, FS (corresponding author), Univ Embu, Dept Land & Water Management, POB 6-60100, Embu, Kenya.",fsmairura@gmail.com,"Ngetich, Felix Kipchirchir/L-1837-2013; Musafiri, Collins/GWQ-3131-2022; Kiboi, Milka/AAD-9601-2019","Ngetich, Felix Kipchirchir/0000-0002-7058-7973; Kiboi, Milka/0000-0003-3206-858X; Mugendi, Daniel Njiru/0000-0002-4998-662X; Okeyo, Jeremiah/0000-0003-2198-1699; Musafiri, Collins/0000-0002-7344-4644",National Research Fund (NRF)-Kenya,National Research Fund (NRF)-Kenya,The authors acknowledge the National Research Fund (NRF)-Kenya for providing financial support through the University of Embu Multidisciplinary project entitled; Towards Quantifying Green House Gas emissions and deriving emission factors from organic and inorganic fertilized farming systems of Kenya.

Methods: The summary of the response methods is to try to find the substantive connotation of vernacular architecture in order to provide basic theoretical support for contemporary vernacular architecture creation. At the same time, combined with the characteristics of the times of the contemporary area, it proposes a typical site design adaptability analysis, a suitability climate adaptability analysis and a construction adaptability analysis returning to the local culture. And for the coastal cultural and historical background of the region, the development of regional ancient towns is discussed, and the location of regional coastal ancient towns is analyzed for the coastal environment. Results: The final selected model was a weighted average based on Akaike weights of 71 logistic candidate models that included all the variables in these 71 candidate models. The importance weights of variables are the criteria for assessing the impact and contribution rate of environmental factors on survival and dispersal, and are the sum of the Akaike weights of all candidate models containing a given predictor variable. The connection between households basically uses the scattered water of the building, does not occupy the foundation, and basically does not damage the landform. The entrance to the building is determined by the terrain on the one hand, and the road on the other, and is generally set on one side of the road. Finally, the coastal environmental background and historical and cultural background of regional ancient towns are summarized, and the research roughly explores the region. Conclusions: At the end of the article, through the interpretation of actual cases, it provides certain evidence and explanations for adaptability analysis, and expresses the design ideas of comprehensive trade-offs in the process of adaptability analysis, in order to provide contemporary local architectural design for the extensive urban and rural construction in the region with theories and adaptability analysis.

Ocean climate change ('CC') modelling may become a key decision-support tool for MSP, but traditional modelling analysis and communication challenges prevent their broad uptake. We employed MSP-specific ocean climate modelling analyses to inform a real-life MSP process; addressing how nature conservation and fisheries could be adapted to CC. We found that the currently planned distribution of these activities may become unsustainable during the policy's implementation due to CC, leading to a shortfall in its sustainability and blue growth targets. Significant, climate-driven ecosystem-level shifts in ocean components underpinning designated sites and fishing activity were estimated, reflecting different magnitudes of shifts in benthic versus pelagic, and inshore versus offshore habitats. Supporting adaptation, we then identified: CC refugia (areas where the ecosystem remains within the boundaries of its present state); CC hotspots (where climate drives the ecosystem towards a new state, inconsistent with each sectors' present use distribution); and for the first time, identified bright spots (areas where oceanographic processes drive range expansion opportunities that may support sustainable growth in the medium term). We thus create the means to: identify where sector-relevant ecosystem change is attributable to CC; incorporate resilient delivery of conservation and sustainable ecosystem management aims into MSP; and to harness opportunities for blue growth where they exist. Capturing CC bright spots alongside refugia within protected areas may present important opportunities to meet sustainability targets while helping support the fishing sector in a changing climate. By capitalizing on the natural distribution of climate resilience within ocean ecosystems, such climate-adaptive spatial management strategies could be seen as nature-based solutions to limit the impact of CC on ocean ecosystems and dependent blue economy sectors, paving the way for climate-smart MSP.","[Queiros, Ana M.; Talbot, Elizabeth; Beaumont, Nicola J.; Somerfield, Paul J.; Kay, Susan; Pascoe, Christine; Miller, Peter I.; Sailley, Sevrine F.; Austen, Melanie C.; Widdicombe, Steve] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Dedman, Simon] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Fernandes, Jose A.] Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, AZTI Tecnalia, Marine Res, Bizkaia, Spain; [Jueterbock, Alexander] Nord Univ, Fac Biosci & Aquaculture, Bodo, Norway; [Sara, Ginaluca] Univ Palermo, Dept Earth & Marine Sci, Ecol Lab, Palermo, Italy; [Carr, Liam M.] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland; [Austen, Melanie C.] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Rilov, Gil] Israel Oceanog & Limnol Res, Nat Inst Oceanog, Haifa, Israel; [Levin, Lisa A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Hull, Stephen C.; Walmsley, Suzannah F.] ABPmer, Southampton, Hants, England; [Nic Aonghusa, Caitriona] Inst Marine, Oranmore, Ireland",Plymouth Marine Laboratory; Stanford University; AZTI; Nord University; University of Palermo; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; University of Plymouth; Israel Oceanographic & Limnological Research Institute; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Marine Institute Ireland,"Queiros, AM (corresponding author), Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, England.",anqu@pml.ac.uk,"Miller, Peter I./E-4525-2013; Kay, Susan/C-5659-2008; Austen, Melanie C/GLU-1418-2022","Miller, Peter I./0000-0002-5292-8789; Kay, Susan/0000-0003-1510-8578; Austen, Melanie C/0000-0001-8133-0498; Carr, Liam/0000-0002-6514-5433; Rilov, Gil/0000-0002-1334-4887; Beaumont, Nicola/0000-0002-5976-9661; Fernandes Salvador, Jose Antonio/0000-0003-4677-6077; Talbot, Elizabeth/0000-0002-5046-5143; Queiros, Ana/0000-0002-7067-3177; Dedman, Simon/0000-0002-9108-972X","Irish Government; COPERNICUS [2018/C3S_422_Lot2_PML]; Global Challenges Research Fund [NE/P021050/1, NE/P021107/1]; European Maritime Fisheries Fund [SERV-18-OSIS-002]; European Union's Horizon 2020 [869300]; NERC [NE/V016725/1, NE/P021050/2] Funding Source: UKRI",Irish Government; COPERNICUS; Global Challenges Research Fund; European Maritime Fisheries Fund; European Union's Horizon 2020; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Irish Government; COPERNICUS, Grant/Award Number: 2018/C3S_422_Lot2_PML; Global Challenges Research Fund, Grant/Award Number: NE/P021050/1 and NE/P021107/1; European Maritime & Fisheries Fund, Grant/Award Number: SERV-18-OSIS-002; European Union's Horizon 2020, Grant/Award Number: 869300",,67,15,16,7,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

For the purpose of the study, a field experiment was established at the Experimental Farm of the University of Thessaly, Velestino, in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The experimental design was a factorial split-split-plot design with Mico-plus being the main factor (Trt(1): control, Trt(2): mico-plus which contains non composed plant residues, 3% Glomus mosseae and Glomus intradices, 1 x 10(8)UFC/g Bacillus spp, Pseudomonas spp., and Streptomyces spp., and 1 x 10(8)UFC/g Trichoderma), plant density the sub-factor (P-1: 10,000 and P-2: 20,000 plants ha(-1)) and N-fertilization the sub-sub factor using bio-fertilizers (N-1: 0, N-2: 40, and N-3: 80 kg N ha(-1)) with three replicates. Height, leaf area index and leaf yield were measured by samplings at the ideal collection stage (start of the flowering period). The use of mico-plus and nitrogen fertilization resulted in significantly higher yield. Furthermore, plant density had a negative effect on measured values, leading to reduced leaf yield and lower leaf area. The higher produced leaf yield and leaf area (7296 kg ha(-1) and 4.47 leaf area index, respectively) were recorded in the third year for the treatment of the lower plant density with the higher N-dressing where mico-plus was used (MP1N3). Therefore, sage seems to be a promising perennial cultivation characterized by satisfactory yields under low inputs in similar soil-climatic environment, while the use of mico-plus should be taken into consideration, especially in the case of poor and abandoned lands.","[Giannoulis, Kyriakos D.; Skoufogianni, Elpiniki; Bartzialis, Dimitrios; Danalatos, Nicholaos G.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Crop Prod & Rural Environm, Fytocou Str, Volos 38446, Greece; [Solomou, Alexandra D.] Hellen Agr Org DEMETER, Inst Mediterranean & Forest Ecosyst, N Chlorou 1, Athens 11528, Greece",University of Thessaly,"Giannoulis, KD (corresponding author), Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Crop Prod & Rural Environm, Fytocou Str, Volos 38446, Greece.",kgiannoulis@uth.gr,"Giannoulis, Kyriakos/ABC-8947-2021","Giannoulis, Kyriakos/0000-0001-6579-8023; SOLOMOU, Dr. ALEXANDRA/0000-0002-0014-1909","Department of Agriculture, Crop Production and Rural Environment, University of Thessaly, Greece","Department of Agriculture, Crop Production and Rural Environment, University of Thessaly, Greece","This work was supported by the Department of Agriculture, Crop Production and Rural Environment, University of Thessaly, Greece.",,57,4,4,2,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-6690,1872-633X,,IND CROP PROD,Ind.

Based on the multi-model ensemble (MME) results of 10 downscaled high-resolution Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) model output from NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NASA-GDDP), the intensity (largest lasting time), frequency and total duration of heatwaves over China as well as population exposure in the 21st century and at 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C above pre-industrial levels are investigated by using the three indices, the Heat Wave Duration Index (HWDI), annual total frequency of heatwaves (N_HW) and annual total days of heatwaves (T_HW) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The MME results illustrate that heatwaves are projected to become more frequent (0.40/decade and 1.26/decade for N_HW), longer-lasting (3.78 days/decade and 14.59 days/decade for T_HW) as well as more extreme (1.07 days/decade and 2.90 days/decade for HWDI under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively) over China. High latitude and high altitude regions, e.g., the Tibetan Plateau and northern China, are projected to experience a larger increase of intensity, frequency and the total time of heatwaves compared with southern China (except Central China). The total population affected by heatwaves is projected to increase significantly and will reach 1.18 billion in later part of the 21st century, and there will be more and more people expected to suffer long heatwave time (T_HW) in the 21st century. Compared with a 2.0 degrees C global warming climate, holding the global warming below 1.5 degrees C can avoid 26.9% and 29.1% of the increase of HWDI, 34.7% and 39.64% for N_TW and 35.3%-40.10% of T_HW under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively. The half-degree less of warming will not only decrease the population exposure by 53-83 million but also avoid the threat caused by longer heatwave exposure under the two scenarios. Based on the comprehensive assessment of heatwave under the two RCP scenarios, this work would help to enhance the understanding of climate change and consequent risk in China and thus could provide useful information for making climate adaptation policies.","[Li, Zhansheng; Guo, Xiaolin; Yang, Yuan; Hong, Yang; Wang, Zhongjing] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Hong, Yang] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [You, Liangzhi] Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPR, EPTD, Washington, DC 20006 USA",Tsinghua University; Peking University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Hong, Y; Wang, ZJ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Hong, Y (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",lizhsh1985@yahoo.com; guoxl15@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; yangyuan15@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; hongyang@tsinghua.edu.cn; zj.wang@tsinghua.edu.cn; L.YOU@CGIAR.ORG,"Wang, Zhongjing/G-3315-2012; Hong, Yang/D-5132-2009","Wang, Zhongjing/0000-0001-9374-564X; Hong, Yang/0000-0001-8720-242X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71461010701, 41701385]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number. 71461010701 and 41701385.",,63,16,17,10,37,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN 2,2019,11,12,,,,,,,3318,10.3390/su11123318,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11123318,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IG4DG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000473753700088,View Full Record in Web of Science

The lack of awareness of the construction industry's impact on climate change could be very harmful in terms of CO2 emission, water and soil pollution, etc. This paper aims to explore the critical factors in the Egyptian construction industry that contributes to climate change. Moreover, given the shared features between the construction industry in Egypt and those in other countries, this research could also shed light on the general impacts of the construction industry on the various aspects of climate change. So, to achieve this aim, an intensive literature review was carried out to identify various factors contributing to climate change within the construction industry. This is followed by conducting 11 interviews with construction experts to explore any further factors throughout the lifecycle of a construction project. The identified factors from the literature review and the interviews were used to design a questionnaire survey to collect construction professionals' opinions on the impact of these factors on climate change in Egypt. 48 valid responses were received. The collected data were statistically analyzed to rank and determine the criticality level of these factors. The results revealed that the most significant factors influencing climate change are the impact of industrial construction on climate change, the use of primary renewable energy as raw materials during the construction and use phases, and the effect of heavy civil and highway construction on climate change. The results also show that managing these factors requires considerable awareness and proactive actions during the project life cycle and pre-construction stage. The findings could inform decision-makers and construction professionals to raise awareness and make informed decisions to handle these key factors and minimize their potential contribution to climate change. Therefore, it can be recommended that construction clients may involve a climate change management plan as a requirement of tender documents.","[Elhegazy, Hosam; Yahia, Mohamed; Mahdi, Ibrahim] Future Univ Egypt, Dept Struct Engn & Construction Management, Cairo, Egypt; [Elhegazy, Hosam; Zhang, Jiansong] Purdue Univ, Sch Construct Management Technol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Amoudi, Omar] Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Built Environm, Oxford, England; [Zaki, Joliviana Nashaat] Future Univ Egypt, Dept Biomed Engn, Cairo, Egypt; [Eid, Mohamed] Heliopolis Univ Sustainable Dev, Fac Organ Agr, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Future University in Egypt; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Oxford Brookes University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Future University in Egypt; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Heliopolis University,"Elhegazy, H (corresponding author), Future Univ Egypt, Dept Struct Engn & Construction Management, Cairo, Egypt.;Elhegazy, H (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Construct Management Technol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",hossam.mostaffa@fue.edu.eg,"Elhegazy, Hosam Mostafa/AAP-9018-2020","Elhegazy, Hosam Mostafa/0000-0002-8454-0690",,,,,64,0,0,3,3,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2424-8622,2424-8630,,J IND INTEGR MANAG,J.

SUDS include individual elements integrated in the urban landscape, e.g. rain gardens or wet basins, which are usually constructed with low structural heterogeneity. Structural heterogeneity of habitats is, however, associated with a high degree of biodiversity. This study explored potentials of habitat heterogeneity enhancement in SUDS using structural heterogeneity as a proxy for biodiversity potential. In an interdisciplinary workshop, landscape architects and urban ecologists designed individual SUDS elements with enhanced structural habitat heterogeneity, hereafter bio-SUDS. The redesigned SUDS elements were infiltration trench, curb extension, rain garden, swale, wet basin, and dry basin. To evaluate the bio-SUDS designs, we developed an index of habitat heterogeneity in SUDS based on registration of 45 structurally important components. The conversion from standard SUDS to bio-SUDS entailed substantial increases in structural heterogeneity ranging from 4 to 18 additional components within elements. Larger bio-SUDS elements returned higher index scores, but the relative score increases were substantial for all bio-SUDS and in the range of a factor of 2-5.5. Increased terrain differences, meandering edges, stones, gravel, boulders, deadwood, and brown roof-like vegetation were the components most often employed in the bio-SUDS designs. In conclusion, implementation of bio-SUDS has potential to increase structural habitat heterogeneity thereby providing habitat for biodiversity in urban green areas. The developed bio-SUDS index can assist in future assessments of ecological qualities in designs and real-world SUDS elements.","[Monberg, Rikke Juul; Howe, Andy G.; Ravn, Hans Peter; Jensen, Marina Bergen] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Monberg, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",rikkejmonberg@gmail.com,"Jensen, Marina Bergen/C-9841-2015; Howe, Andrew/A-8259-2015","Jensen, Marina Bergen/0000-0003-0202-0366; Howe, Andrew/0000-0002-7460-5227","University of Copenhagen; Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation; Danish Council for Technology and Innovation [10-093317]","University of Copenhagen; Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation; Danish Council for Technology and Innovation","Thanks to landscape architect Henrik Dixen Dausell, GHB Landscape Architects, for help on workshop planning and to Antje Backhaus for original sketches of standard SUDS.

This study experimentally tested the effects of three cultivation techniques (conventional-till, strip-till, and no-till) on pumpkin production, weed pressure, soil moisture, and soil erosion. Randomized complete block field experiments were conducted on Cucurbita pepo L. 'Gladiator' pumpkins in 2014 and 2015. Overall yields were higher in 2015, averaging 45.2 t.ha(-1), compared with 37.4 t.ha(-1) in 2014. In 2014, pumpkin yields were similar across tillage treatments. In 2015, the average fruit weight of no-till pumpkins was significantly greater than strip-till and conventional-till pumpkins, which corresponded to a marginally significant 13% and 22% yield increase, respectively (P = 0.11). Weed control was variable between years, especially in the strip-till treatment. Soil moisture was consistently highest in the no-till treatment in both years of study. Conventional-till pumpkin plots lost approximate to 9 times more soil than the two conservation tilled treatments during simulated storm events. The 2015 yield advantage of no-till pumpkins seems related to both high soil moisture retention and weed control.

Areas with no roads or little traffic (roadless and low-traffic areas) represent relatively undisturbed natural habitats and functioning ecosystems. They provide many benefits for biodiversity and human societies (e.g., landscape connectivity, barrier against pests and invasions, ecosystem services). Roadless and low-traffic areas, with a lower level of anthropogenic disturbances, are of special relevance in Europe because of their rarity and, in the context of climate change, because of their contribution to higher resilience and buffering capacity within landscape ecosystems. An analysis of European legal instruments illustrates that, although most laws aimed at protecting targets which are inherent to fragmentation, like connectivity, ecosystem processes or integrity, roadless areas are widely neglected as a legal target. A case study in Germany underlines this finding. Although the Natura 2000 network covers a significant proportion of the country (16%), Natura 2000 sites are highly fragmented and most low-traffic areas (75%) lie unprotected outside this network. This proportion is even higher for the old Federal States (western Germany), where only 20% of the low-traffic areas are protected. We propose that the few remaining roadless and low-traffic areas in Europe should be an important focus of conservation efforts; they should be urgently inventoried, included more explicitly in the law and accounted for in transport and urban planning. Considering them as complementary conservation targets would represent a concrete step towards the strengthening and adaptation of the Natura 2000 network to climate change.","[Selva, Nuria] Inst Nat Conservat PAS, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland; [Kreft, Stefan; Schluck, Martin; Ibisch, Pierre L.] Eberswalde Univ Sustainable Dev, Fac Forest & Environm, Eberswalde, Germany; [Kreft, Stefan; Schluck, Martin; Ibisch, Pierre L.] Ctr Econ & Ecosyst Management, Eberswalde, Germany; [Kati, Vassiliki] Univ Ioannina, Agrinion, Greece; [Jonsson, Bengt-Gunnar] Mid Sweden Univ, Sundsvall, Sweden; [Mihok, Barbara] Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, Budapest, Hungary; [Okarma, Henryk] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development; University of Ioannina; Mid-Sweden University; Jagiellonian University,"Selva, N (corresponding author), Inst Nat Conservat PAS, Mickiewicza 33, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland.",nuriselva@gmail.com,"Kati, Vassiliki I/AAB-9418-2020; Okarma, Henryk/W-2050-2019; Selva, Nuria/J-6970-2013; Kreft, Stefan/AAE-5558-2021","Kati, Vassiliki I/0000-0003-3357-4556; Selva, Nuria/0000-0003-3389-201X; Ibisch, Pierre/0000-0001-9820-9272; Okarma, Henryk/0000-0002-8912-3546",BfN [FKZ 80682270K]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,BfN; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This paper is part of an initiative launched by the Policy Committee of the Society for Conservation Biology-Europe Section.

There is some uncertainty about how quickly the climate will change and what the anticipated localised effects will be. There are also governance questions, for instance, who has the mandate to make decisions around the management of collective resources (like council infrastructure) and private property. Underlying these questions are issues of justice, equity and agency - who pays for the costs of adaptation and mitigation, and how do decision-makers engage with communities when what is ultimately needed is transformational socio-economic change? We use a case study in Te Awa Kairangi - Lower Hutt, Wellington, to show how a community initiative called Common Unity Project Aotearoa (CUPA) is fostering everyday practices of adaptation and mitigation amongst people who have traditionally had limited participation in more formal planning processes. We use the example of CUPA to demonstrate the significance of local community-led development initiatives for adapting to a changing climate. We argue that local government engagement with people around climate change cannot be separated from broader community development and wellbeing initiatives, and needs to be understood as longer term processes, rather than one-off project consultations.","[Simon, Katy; Thomas, Amanda C.] Victoria Univ, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Diprose, Gradon] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Diprose, G (corresponding author), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Wellington, New Zealand.",diproseg@landcareresearch.co.nz,,"Thomas, Amanda/0000-0002-8063-5828; Diprose, Gradon/0000-0001-5394-9410",Deep South: National Science Challenge,Deep South: National Science Challenge,We are also grateful for the funding and support from The Deep South: National Science Challenge that enabled this project.,,51,9,9,3,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,1177-083X,,KOTUITUI,Kotuitui,,2020,15,1,,,,,93,105,,10.1080/1177083X.2019.1652659,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1177083X.2019.1652659,,,13,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,LT0LM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000536768500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet the literature on adaptation has paid less attention to the distinction between ex-ante adjustments to expected weather and ex-post responses to unexpected shocks. Using a three-wave, nationally representative Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey, this paper exploits large variation in precipitation and temperature to estimate the weather impacts on Bangladesh agriculture and to identify the associated productive adaptations to expected and unexpected weather changes. It presents evidence that Bangladeshi farmers are resilient to exposure of crops to temperatures below 32 degrees C through various adaptive activities such as reallocation of land and irrigation water between rice and non-rice crops, the adoption of non-rice improved seed varieties, and the adjustment of the input cost composition. But increased exposure to extreme heat above 32 degrees C causes significant declines in agricultural productivity in wet seasons. Although farmers increase irrigation water inputs to aus and aman rice against unexpected extreme heat, the adaptation effect remains lim-ited. The total cash cost associated with cultivation does not respond to weather changes, plausibly due to the presence of financial liquidity constraints. This study's finding adds to evidence of smallholder farm-ers' short-and medium-run productive responses to adverse climate change in the developing world.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents an historical analysis of major world energy crises from 1988 to 2015 and in Brazil from 1924 to 2015. Analysing the natural river flow of key Brazilian dams from 1931 until 2017, this paper suggests that hydropower generation in Brazil has a 10-15 years cyclical pattern of hydropower generation. The periods of drought in this cyclical pattern usually coincides with energy crises due to the reduction in hydropower generation. It was found that the drought in 2015 had an impact of 110 TWh in hydropower generation, from which 25 TWh are due to head loss and 70 TWh are from lack of stored hydropower in July of 2014. In addition, 48 TWh were not generated due to delays in the construction of new power plants. Other causes of the Brazilian energy crisis of 2015 are presented and the overall electricity generation impact of these causes are compared. In addition, this paper presents the impacts on the energy, water and food supply sectors in Brazil, and the strategies employed to reduce the impact of the crises. With the intention of preventing future energy crises, the paper then shows the potential alternatives to improve electricity supply security in Brazil, particularly in terms of diversifying and widening the share of renewable sources and increasing the energy storage potential of the country.","[Hunt, Julian David] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Scholsspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Stilpen, Daniel; Vasconcelos de Freitas, Marcos Aurelio] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPE, Energy Planning Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Hunt, JD (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Scholsspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",hunt@iiasa.ac.at; stilpen@ppe.ufrj.br; mfreitas@ppe.ufrj.br,"Freitas, Marcos Aurélio/GYQ-9960-2022",,CAPES/BRAZIL (Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education) [99999.000613/2016-09]; IIASA (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis) [ZVR 524808900],CAPES/BRAZIL (Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education); IIASA (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis),"We would like to thank CAPES/BRAZIL (Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education) and IIASA (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis) for the research grant (99999.000613/2016-09) and research fellowship (ZVR 524808900), respectively, as part of the CAPES/IIASA Postdoctorate program.",,104,48,50,11,38,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

This intensification, which includes asset and infrastructure intensification, along with the increasing likelihood of inundation associated with sea level rise, implies an increasing risk profile for many coastal communities. In response, many cities and owners of major civil infrastructure have commissioned climate risk and adaptation studies in order to develop adaptation strategies. In many cases the same methods, terminology and approaches have been applied in studies of adaptation options for entire communities as for individual structures and assets. It is argued here that as a result of the different scales and complexity between whole communities and individual assets or structures, it is desirable that tailored approaches to identifying adaptation options need to be applied. In particular, it is recommended that categorising settlement and infrastructure studies into either community-scale, or infrastructure-scale problems will help to ensure that the most appropriate methodological approaches are be used.

While cities across the United States implement GSI into their planning processes, they are also potentially affecting the local communities that are receiving these GSI through social, ecological, physical, and economic impacts. Flooding is impacting urban communities by damaging homes and infrastructure, degrading ecosystems, and exacerbating social inequities. In the planning process, there is an acute need for the consideration of the equitable distribution of GSI in addition to technical and engineering needs. This study examines multiple aspects of vulnerability to local flooding impacts-social, environmental, and infrastructural-across a city landscape to identify those communities that have a greater need for GSI. Given the city of Philadelphia is a leader in GSI implementation in the United States, we use it as our research setting where we create citywide, multifaceted vulnerability indices that account for the spatial distribution of social, built environment, and maintenance vulnerabilities to flooding events. In addition to these indices, a GSI type decision table was created to suggest more equitable placements of different GSI types based on their maintenance needs and expected co-benefits. The results of this study reveal unequal distribution of social and built-environment vulnerabilities in the city at the Census block group scale, with high social vulnerability consistently spread across the central, southwest, and northwest neighborhoods of Philadelphia. Potential areas of severe GSI maintenance impacts appear to be concentrated in the downtown neighborhoods, while overall vulnerability appears elevated throughout the downtown and northwest neighborhoods. These results indicate that some communities in Philadelphia are highly vulnerable and should be prioritized for GSI implementation. In addition, the type of GSI implemented should be optimized to address the specific vulnerability impacts in different areas. A multifaceted vulnerability approach to planning can be applied in multiple areas of climate adaptation equity, with future studies continuing to update and add more dimensions of vulnerability where and when applicable.","[Homet, Kate; Kremer, Peleg; Strader, Stephen] Villanova Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Smith, Virginia] Villanova Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Villanova, PA USA",Villanova University; Villanova University,"Kremer, P (corresponding author), Villanova Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",peleg.kremer@villanova.edu,,,Department of Geography and the Environment at Villanova University; Villanova University's Falvey Memorial Library Scholarship Open Access Reserve (SOAR) Fund,Department of Geography and the Environment at Villanova University; Villanova University's Falvey Memorial Library Scholarship Open Access Reserve (SOAR) Fund,"The Department of Geography and the Environment at Villanova University supported this study by providing KH with Graduate Assistantship and a Graduate Summer Research Grant.

Multi-source data for site-specific soils, climates, and remotely sensed vegetation indices are essential for yield prediction. Algorithms of data-model fusion for crop growth monitoring and yield prediction are complicated and need to be optimized to deal with model uncertainty. This study integrated multi-source environmental variables (e.g., satellite-based vegetation indices, climate data, and soil properties) into random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models for wheat yield prediction in China. The performance of both RF and SVM models was investigated using different types of vegetation indices associated with other predictors. Relative importance and partial dependence analyses were used to identify the main predictors and their relationships with wheat yield. We found that using remotely sensed vegetation indices improved our model precision, and that near-infrared reflectance of terrestrial vegetation (NIRv) was slightly better than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in predicting yield. NIRv was better in detecting climate stress on crops, and could capture more information regarding crop growth and yield formation. Compared with the SVM model, the RF model with NIRv and other covariates had better performance in wheat yield prediction, with R-2 and RMSE being 0.74 and 758 kg/ha respectively. We also found that NIRv from jointing to heading was the most important predictor in determining yield, followed by solar radiation (especially during tillering-heading), relative humidity (during planting-tillering), soil organic carbon, and wind speed (throughout the growing season). In addition, wheat yield exhibited threshold-like responses to most factors based on our RF model.

The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) in the upper-midwest of the United States and south-central Canada, characterized by glacially sculpted landscapes and abundant wetlands, is one such vulnerable region. According to regional/global climate model predictions, drought occurrence will increase in the PPR region through the 21st century and thus will probably cause the amount of water in wetlands to decline. Water surface area (WSA) of Kidder County, ND, from 1984-2011 was measured by classifying TM/ETM+(Landsat Thematic Mapper / Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) images through the modified normalized difference water index. We then developed a linear model based on the WSA of these wetlands and historical climate data and used this to determine the wetland sensitivity to climate change and predict future wetlands WSA in the PPR. Our model based on Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) of the current year (PDSIt-0) and of the previous two years (PDSIt-2) can explain 79% of the annual wetland WSA variance, suggesting a high sensitivity of wetlands to drought/climate change. We also predicted the PPR wetlands WSA in the 21st century under A1B scenario (a mid-carbon emission scenario) using simulated PDSI based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR4 22-model ensemble climate. According to our prediction, the WSA of the PPR wetlands will decrease to less than half of the baseline WSA (defined as the mean wetlands WSA of the 2000s) by the mid of the 21st century, and to less than one-third by the 2080s, and will then slightly increase in the 2090s. This considerable future wetland loss caused only by climate change provides important implication to future wetland management and climate adaptation policy.

However, little is known on the effects of combined change in temperature, CO2 concentration, and extreme events on barley grain quality and how capable are the current process-based crop models capture the signal of climate change on quality traits. Here in this review, we initially explored the response of quality traits of barley to heat, drought, and CO2 concentration from experiential studies. Next, we reviewed the state of the art of some of the current modeling approaches to capture grain quality. Lastly, we suggested possible opportunities to improve current models for tracking the detailed quality traits of barley. Heat and drought stress increase the protein concentration which has a negative effect on malting quality. The rise of CO2 concentration significantly reduces the grain protein, again resulting in a decline of the malting and brewing quality since the nitrogen concentration of grains needs to be kept at a specific level. The current crop models that simulate barley grain quality are limited to simulation of grain nitrogen concentration, size, and number in response to climate extremes and CO2. Nevertheless, crop models fail to account for the complex interactions between the conflicting effects of rising temperatures and droughts as well as increasing CO2 concentrations on grain protein. They have mainly adapted wheat models that cannot capture barley's protein composition and whole grain malting quality. Implementation of experiments from gene to canopy scales which are explicitly designed to detect the interactions among environmental variables on detailed quality traits and couple the remote sensing plus data-driven approaches to crop models are possible opportunities to improve modeling of barley grain quality. The development of modeling routines can capture the detailed grain quality provide valuable tools for forming climate adaptive strategies. Equally important, they can guide breeding programs to develop climate-resilient but high-quality barley genotypes.","[Rezaei, Ehsan Eyshi; Zhu, Wanxue] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, Muncheberg, Germany; [Rojas, Luis Vargas; Cammarano, Davide] Purdue Univ, Dept Agron, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Zhu, Wanxue] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Cammarano, Davide] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Circular Bioecon CBIO, Dept Agroecol, iClimate, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Gottingen; Aarhus University,"Cammarano, D (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Ctr Circular Bioecon CBIO, Dept Agroecol, iClimate, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark.",davide.cammarano@agro.au.dk,"朱, 婉雪/F-9506-2017","朱, 婉雪/0000-0002-2635-0688; Vargas Rojas, Luis/0000-0001-8610-9901; Eyshi Rezaei, Ehsan/0000-0003-2603-8034",,,,,127,0,0,24,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-4290,1872-6852,,FIELD CROP RES,Field Crop.

These sea-level changes pro-jected over the next century are up to an order of magnitude larger than those observed over the previous century. At these cities, year 2150 sea-level changes of between 29 and 55 cm are projected under the very low emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), whilst changes of between 99 and 123 cm are projected under the very high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5). These differences highlight the potentially significant impact of remaining opportunities for climate change mitigation. Due to this increase in mean sea level, the mean recurrence time between historically extreme events is expected to decrease. Under the very high emissions scenario, the historical 100-year storm flood event will become a 1-to 5-year event at most Danish harbours by 2100. There is considerable uncertainty associated with these sea-level projections, primarily driven by uncertainty in the future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet and future sterodynamic changes in ocean volume. The AR6 characterises collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet as a low-probability but high-impact event that could cause several metres of sea-level rise around Denmark by 2150. In climate adaptation policy, the scientific landscape is shifting fast. There has been a tremendous proliferation of diverse sea-level projections in recent years, with the most relevant planning target for Denmark increas-ing c. 50 cm in the past two decades. Translating sea-level rise projections into planning targets requires value judgments about acceptable sea-level risk that depend on local geography, planning timeline and climate pathway. This highlights the need for an overarching national sea-level adap-tation plan to ensure municipal plans conform to risk and action standards.","[Colgan, William; Henriksen, Hans Jorgen; Riberio, Sofia; Keiding, Marie; Seidenfaden, Ida Karlsson; Hopper, John; Sonnenborg, Torben; Skjerbaek, Maria Rebekka; Kjeldsen, Kristian K.] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland GEUS, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bennike, Ole] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland GEUS, Aarhus, Denmark; [Graversgaard, Morten; Fruergaard, Mikkel] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Busck, Anne Gravsholt; Knudsen, Michael Helt; Bjork, Anders Anker] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Steffen, Holger] Lantmateriet, Gavle, Sweden; [Tarasov, Lev] Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NL, Canada; [Nerem, R.

Northern cropping systems may benefit from longer and warmer growing seasons, but the sustainability of production will be challenged due to increased production risks. Concentrated efforts are needed to find ways to adapt cropping to changing conditions and sustainably intensify production. OBJECTIVE: This study combined stakeholder knowledge and simulation modelling to find means for the sustainable intensification of cereal production in the North Savo region in Finland. METHODS: Stakeholders identified promising intensification measures in two workshops. Alternative options for sustainable intensification and climate adaptations and their combinations were assessed using the APSIM cropping system model. The model was used to assess cereal yields, the grain nitrogen (N) content, nitrate leaching and water productivity for a historical baseline (1981?2010) and mid-century conditions (2041?2070) projected by five general circulation models for different emission scenarios. Simulated management options included improved cultivars with later maturing characteristics, improved heat/drought resistance and nitrogenuse efficiency, increased N fertilisation levels, improved crop rotations together with improved soil, as well as supplementary and full irrigation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The simulation results indicated that although a warming climate in conjunction with elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations generally increase yield levels, N uptake and water productivity, risks associated with higher N leaching due to increased precipitation are a challenge for the sustainability of crop production. Overall, different SI options affected the sustainability indicators studied more than future projected climate, strongly suggesting that there is a large potential for sustainably intensifying crop production in northern conditions, particularly when applying more than one intensification measure at a time. Among a wide set of SI options tested for their sustainability impacts, improved crop cultivars showed the firmest positive impacts. This was supported by the views of agricultural stakeholders in the region. SIGNIFICANCE: While the agricultural stakeholder?s suggestions for alternative SI options challenged the simulation approach to some extent, the simulations provided robust information for comparing the sustainability impacts of alternative measures.","[Palosuo, Taru; Lehtonen, Heikki S.] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Hoffmann, Munir P.; Roetter, Reimund P.] Univ Gottingen, Trop Plant Prod & Agr Syst Modelling TROPAGS, Grisebachstr 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Hoffmann, Munir P.] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Hoffmann, Munir P.] AGVOLUTION GmbH, Gottingen, Germany; [Roetter, Reimund P.] Univ Gottingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use CBL, Buesgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Gottingen; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); University of Gottingen,"Palosuo, T (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland.",taru.palosuo@luke.fi; mhoffma@gwdg.de; reimund-paul.roetter@agr.uni-goettingen.de; heikki.lehtonen@luke.fi,"Palosuo, Taru/B-9593-2012; Rötter, Reimund/Y-9579-2019","Palosuo, Taru/0000-0003-4322-3450; Rötter, Reimund/0000-0002-3804-9964",Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Finland; BoostIA project - Luke; DivCSA project - Academy of Finland [316215]; BMBF [01LL1802A]; BARISTA project [031B0811A]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [316215] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Finland; BoostIA project - Luke; DivCSA project - Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); BARISTA project; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),"The authors are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for the valuable comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Damages of building structures by windborne debris impacts have been reported in almost all the previous major wind events. The windborne debris usually imposes localized impact loading and creates an opening on the building envelope, which might trigger serious damages to the building structures such as roof lift-up and collapse because strong wind pressures propagating into the structure. To withstand the impact of such extreme event, climate adaptation engineering solutions and technique need to be provided or improved for the building protection. The capacity requirement of panels to resist windborne debris impact is given in the Australian Wind Loading Code (AS/NZS 1170.2:2011) [1]. Corrugated metal panel, widely used as building envelope such as roof and wall cladding, might subject to the windborne debris impact. This study evaluates the capacity of corrugated panels to resist wind borne debris impact. Laboratory tests were carried out on corrugated metal panels of dimension 0.76 m by 1.2 m subjected to 4 kg wooden projectile impacts. The effect of various impact locations, impact velocities and boundary conditions on their performance has been studied. The failure and deformation modes under various impact scenarios were observed and compared. The dynamic responses were examined based on the deformations and the strains on the panel back face. The perforation resistance capacity of panels subjected to windborne debris impact were assessed and analyzed. In addition, a numerical model was developed in LS-DYNA to simulate the response and failure of the corrugated panel under windborne debris impact. The accuracy of the numerical model was calibrated with the test data. The validated numerical model was then used to obtain the results such as impact force, boundary reaction force and energy absorption. The vulnerability curve of the corrugated panel against windborne debris impact was also derived. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Rising air temperature will reduce winter snowfall and increase earlier snowmelt, subsequently reducing summer flows. Longer crop-growing season caused by higher temperatures will lead to increases in evapotranspiration and irrigation water demand, which could exacerbate drought damage. However, the impacts of climate change on drought risk will vary over space and time. Thus, spatially explicit drought assessment can help water resource managers and planners to better cope with risk. This study seeks to identify possible drought-vulnerable regions in the Willamette River Basin of the PNW. In order to estimate drought risk in a spatially explicit way, relative Standardized Precipitation Index (rSPI) and relative Standardized Runoff Index (rSRI) were employed. Statistically downscaled climate simulations forcing two greenhouse gas emission scenarios, A1B and B1, were used to investigate the possible changes in drought frequency with 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month time scales. The results of rSPI and rSRI showed an increase in the short-term frequency of drought due to decreases in summer precipitation and snowmelt. However, long-term drought showed no change or a slight decreasing pattern due to increases in winter precipitation and runoff. According to the local index of spatial autocorrelation analysis, the Willamette Valley region was more vulnerable (hot spot) to drought risk than the mountainous regions of the Western Cascades and the High Cascades (cold spot). Although the hydrology of the Western Cascades and the High Cascades will be affected by climate change, these regions will remain relatively water-rich. This suggests that improving the water transfer system could be a reasonable climate adaptation option. Additionally, these results showed that the spatial patterns of drought risk change were affected by drought indices, such that appropriate drought index selection will be important in future studies of climate impacts on spatial drought risk.","[Jung, Il Won; Chang, Heejun] Portland State Univ, Inst Sustainable Solut, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Jung, Il Won; Chang, Heejun] Portland State Univ, Dept Geog, Portland, OR 97201 USA",Portland State University; Portland State University,"Chang, H (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Inst Sustainable Solut, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",changh@pdx.edu,,"JUNG, IL WON/0000-0002-3978-4119",Institute for Sustainable Solutions (ISS) at Portland State University; US National Science Foundation [CR-1038925]; Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1038899] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Institute for Sustainable Solutions (ISS) at Portland State University; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This research was supported by the Institute for Sustainable Solutions (ISS) at Portland State University.

However, there is little evidence on how to get CBA mainstreaming feasible and to work effectively. This paper aims to investigate two major questions: (1) what kind of policies favour mainstreaming CBA; and (2) what kinds of approaches or practices are required to operationalize CBA mainstreaming in the case of Nepal? The field research for this paper was conducted in the Dhading, Nawalparasi and Pyuthan districts of Nepal. The research used a mix of approaches and methods for data generation and analysis. The findings reveal that policies to operationalize CBA mainstreaming should build on past policy successes and include community-centric provisions that empower local institutions and encourage them to practice inclusive decision-making and benefit-sharing mechanisms. One lesson from this analysis of the practices of mainstreaming in Nepal is that an integrated co-management approach to mainstreaming is necessary to overcome the barriers related to knowledge, finance and technology. It is concluded that the operational mechanisms of mainstreaming CBA in development should have an inclusive local structure and be responsive to national policies and governance arrangements.","[Regmi, Bimal Raj; Star, Cassandra] Flinders Univ S Australia, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Sch Social & Policy Studies, Discipline Polit & Publ Policy, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Regmi, BR (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Sch Social & Policy Studies, Discipline Polit & Publ Policy, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",regm0003@flinders.edu.au,,"Star, Cassandra/0000-0003-2648-6603",,,,,42,14,14,1,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Interviews and focused group meetings were also held to overcome the limitation of data availability. This study finds that the consistent increase in rice productivity has been offset by the reduction in rice harvest area, resulting in almost no growth in rice production over the last decade in North Sumatra. In contrast, oil palm plantations, particularly smallholder estates, have been expanding in the province. Four factors are identified as those affecting the change in land use: (1) climate conditions, (2) economic environment, (3) rice planting index, and (4) distance from palm oil enterprise estates. At the time of substantial reduction in rice harvest area, unusual climate conditions were observed across different regencies in North Sumatra, as was the case in 2006, when Medan, the provincial capital, recorded the highest annual rainfall during the last 20 years. The responses of the farmers to the rice planting index and the proximity to palm oil enterprise estates, both of which vary across the province, are differentiated into three types: (1) land use conversion from rice production to oil palm plantation, (2) conversion to other cash crops, and (3) staying with rice production. As oil palm is more resilient to rainfall variability, land use conversion from rice to oil palm can be considered a good adaptation from the farmers perspective. The large scale of the conversions, however, may be a threat to the food security of the society as a whole. This indicates that the countermeasures face trade-offs between different social groups, as well as between adaptation actions and other development priorities.","[Kawanishi, Masato] Ibaraki Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Hitachi, Ibaraki 3168511, Japan; [Mimura, Nobuo] Ibaraki Univ, Ctr Water Environm Studies, Hitachi, Ibaraki 3168511, Japan",Ibaraki University; Ibaraki University,"Kawanishi, M (corresponding author), Ibaraki Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, 4-12-1 Nakanarusawa, Hitachi, Ibaraki 3168511, Japan.",Kawanishi.Masato@jica.go.jp,,,JICA,JICA,"The authors would like to thank the members of the Working Group on Adaptation and other stakeholders of the provincial government of North Sumatra under the 'Capacity Development for Climate Change Strategies in Indonesia,' supported by JICA.

This article aims at investigating the determinants of fund allocation and the consequences of rearrangement considering the case of the Adaptation Fund (AF). This research conducts a mixed-method approach including binary logistic regression and multiple regressions to analyze the factors that influence access to and volume of funding from the AF, respectively, along with a qualitative assessment of the AF's institutional features. The findings suggest that the level of vulnerability of a country is likely to affect accessibility to and the volume of funding from the AF. Besides, low-income countries are more likely while least developed countries are less likely to access the fund. Readiness of country is not significant for accessing the AF; however, it affects the volume of funding. Funding allocation rearrangement may put the AF on pressure for effective use of the readiness program.","[Mori, Akihisa] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Global Environm Econ, Kyoto, Japan; [Rahman, Syed M.] Amer Int Univ Bangladesh, Fac Business Adm, 408-1 Kuratoli, Dhaka 1229, Bangladesh; [Uddin, Md.

While previous studies have provided estimates of populations potentially exposed to various climate impacts, little work has been done to assess the number of people that may actually be displaced or where they will choose to go. Here we modify a diffusion-based model of human mobility in combination with population, geographic, and climatic data to estimate the sources, destinations, and flux of potential migrants as driven by sea level rise (SLR) in Bangladesh in the years 2050 and 2100. Using only maps of population and elevation, we predict that 0.9 million people (by year 2050) to 2.1 million people (by year 2100) could be displaced by direct inundation and that almost all of this movement will occur locally within the southern half of the country. We also find that destination locations should anticipate substantial additional demands on jobs (594 000), housing (197 000), and food (783 x109 calories) by mid-century as a result of those displaced by SLR. By linking the sources of migrants displaced by SLR with their likely destinations, we demonstrate an effective approach for predicting climate-driven migrant flows, especially in data-limited settings.","[Davis, Kyle Frankel] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Davis, Kyle Frankel] Nature Conservancy, New York, NY 10001 USA; [Bhattachan, Abinash] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [D'Odorico, Paolo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Suweis, Samir] Univ Padua, CNISM, Dept Phys & Astron, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Suweis, Samir] INFN, I-35131 Padua, Italy",Columbia University; Nature Conservancy; North Carolina State University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Padua; Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN),"Davis, KF (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10025 USA.;Davis, KF (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, New York, NY 10001 USA.",kd2620@columbia.edu,"Davis, Kyle/AEI-8432-2022; Bell, E/M-9188-2018; Suweis, Samir/G-7001-2014","Davis, Kyle/0000-0003-4504-1407; Bell, E/0000-0003-4896-3327; Suweis, Samir/0000-0002-1603-8375",Nature Conservancy's NatureNet Science fellowship,Nature Conservancy's NatureNet Science fellowship,"K F D, A B, P D, andS Sdesigned the experiment.

Understanding the likelihood and impacts to system components from extreme weather events can be fundamental to prudent strategic, operational and financial decision making. This article describes the development and implementation of a methodology for evaluating the vulnerability of various types of critically identified infrastructure located within the Tennessee State Parks system to future extreme weather events. The methodology calculates a vulnerability score for each combination of type of infrastructure and weather event based on historical and anticipated weather events, and infrastructure performance when exposed to these events. It was found that hydrologic events, strong thunderstorm winds, and winter storms are the extreme weather events that pose the greatest risk to critical infrastructure within Tennessee State Parks. Locations that are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events include Shelby, Wilson, Dickson, Pickett, Carter, Putnam, Hamilton, Sullivan and Union counties.

In order to bring some clarity and consistency in the exploration of these complex interactions in context, elements of the policy sciences, primarily problem orientation, were utilised. The exploratory nature of the study, including its objectives and intended use, meant that goal clarification and analyses of trends were based on limited available information. Despite these shortcomings, the study was able to elucidate and clarify on important factors to consider in consultation with relevant participants. Diversification of livelihood options as well as preserving local culture were found to be highly valued-both by the local communities that were consulted as well as for those advocating for a tourism experience that is unique to this region. Harmonising these valued outcomes could be achieved by incorporating and legitimising local traditional knowledge.

The studies use a suite of governance related indicators to explore adaptive capacity in relation to past extreme hydrological events. Analysis is based on qualitative open ended interviews and questionnaires. Results indicate that tensions persist in developing proactive capacity and mobilising reactive capacity at different scales of governance to different scales of change.

To explore the contribution and influence of multi-dimensional spatial indices on the mitigation of UHIs, the green space of the riparian buffer along 18 river channels in Shanghai was considered as a case study. The spatial distribution data of the land surface temperature (LST) in the study area were obtained by using remote sensing images. By selecting the related spatial structure morphological factors of the waterfront green space as the quantitative description index, the growth regression tree model (BRT) was adapted to analyze the contribution of various indexes of the waterfront green space on the distribution of the LST and the marginal effect of blue-green synergistic cooling. In addition, mathematical statistical analysis and spatial analysis methods were used to study the influence of the morphological group (MG) types of riparian green spaces with different morphological characteristics on the LST. The results showed that in terms of the spatial structure variables between blue and green spaces, the contribution of river widths larger than 30 m was more notable in decreasing the LST. In the case of a larger river width, the marginal effect of synergistic cooling could be observed in farther regions. The green space that had the highest connectivity degree and was located in the leeward direction of the river exhibited the lowest LST. In terms of the spatial morphology, the fractional cover values of the vegetation (Fv) and area (A) of the green space were the main factors affecting the cooling effect of the green space. For all MG types, a large green patch that had a high green coverage and connectivity degree, as well as was distributed in the leeward direction of the river, corresponded to the lowest LST. The research presented herein can provide methods and development suggestions for optimizing spatial thermal comfort in climate adaptive cities.","[Jiang, Yunfang; Huang, Jing] East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yunfang; Huang, Jing] East China Normal Univ, Ctr Modern Chinese City Studies, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yunfang; Huang, Jing] East China Normal Univ, Res Ctr China, Adm Div, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Shi, Tiemao] Shenyang Jianzhu Univ, Inst Spatial Planning & Design, Shenyang 110168, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hongxiang] Sichuan Int Studies Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Chongqing 400031, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; East China Normal University; East China Normal University; Shenyang Jianzhu University; Sichuan International Studies University,"Jiang, YF (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.;Jiang, YF (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Ctr Modern Chinese City Studies, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.;Jiang, YF (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Res Ctr China, Adm Div, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.;Shi, TM (corresponding author), Shenyang Jianzhu Univ, Inst Spatial Planning & Design, Shenyang 110168, Peoples R China.",yfjiang@re.ecnu.edu.cn; jhuang@stu.ecnu.edu.cn; tiemaos@sjzu.edu.cn; elainewhx@163.com,,"Jiang, Yunfang/0000-0002-5025-4741","National Natural Science Foundation of China project [51878279, 51878418, 51578344]",National Natural Science Foundation of China project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China project (grant numbers 51878279, 51878418, and 51578344).",,82,11,11,57,153,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

All of them show a more or less strong retreat trend with alternated fluctuations, e.g., weak retreat likely due to sea level rise, significant erosion very likely due to storm surges, and processes of loss of sediment stock, as well as episodes of sand recovery. Therefore, these beaches require interventions to preserve their beach prism and dry sand surface. In search for answers to better understand why and under what conditions the process of advance and retreat of the coastline occur, we have analysed different teleconnections and carried out reanalyses for wind anomalies during ENSO events from 1951 to 2010. Both weak and moderate erosion accretion periods are likely related to atmospheric anomalies, e.g., wind direction changes and the consequent swell and littoral drift changes, related' to El Nino and La Nina events. The former associated with accretion and the latter with erosion. In the past most interventions have been reactive. Increased knowledge of climate and weather relationship with the sedimentary balance provides an approach that would allow developing beach risk-management, pro-active strategies and climate adaption measures focused on the generation and recovery planning based on the analysis of the occurrence and prediction of El Nino/La Nina events.

A systematic map protocol,ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Natural climate solutions; Climate change; Nature-based solutions; Mitigation; Land cover and land use change; Conservation; Restoration; Land management,SERVICES; ACCESS,"Background: Natural climate solutions (NCS)-actions to conserve, restore, and modify natural and modified ecosystems to increase carbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-are increasingly regarded as important pathways for climate change mitigation, while contributing to our global conservation efforts, overall planetary resilience, and sustainable development goals. Recently, projections posit that terrestrial-based NCS can potentially capture or avoid the emission of at least 11 Gt (gigatons) of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, or roughly encompassing one third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris Climate Agreement goals by 2030. NCS interventions also purport to provide co-benefits such as improved productivity and livelihoods from sustainable natural resource management, protection of locally and culturally important natural areas, and downstream climate adaptation benefits. Attention on implementing NCS to address climate change across global and national agendas has grown-however, clear understanding of which types of NCS interventions have undergone substantial study versus those that require additional evidence is still lacking. This study aims to conduct a systematic map to collate and describe the current state, distribution, and methods used for evidence on the links between NCS interventions and climate change mitigation outcomes within tropical and sub-tropical terrestrial ecosystems. Results of this study can be used to inform program and policy design and highlight critical knowledge gaps where future evaluation, research, and syntheses are needed. Methods: To develop this systematic map, we will search two bibliographic databases (including 11 indices) and 67 organization websites, backward citation chase from 39 existing evidence syntheses, and solicit information from key informants. All searches will be conducted in English and encompass subtropical and tropical terrestrial ecosystems (forests, grasslands, mangroves, agricultural areas). Search results will be screened at title and abstract, and full text levels, recording both the number of excluded articles and reasons for exclusion. Key meta-data from included articles will be coded and reported in a narrative review that will summarize trends in the evidence base, assess gaps in knowledge, and provide insights for policy, practice, and research. The data from this systematic map will be made open access.","[Cheng, Samantha H.; Sterling, Eleanor J.; Taylor, Auset; Tinsman, Jen] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Costedoat, Sebastien; Chamberlain, Catherine; Jagadish, Arundhati; Nowakowski, A.

Conservation Agriculture (CA) systems can be effective in mitigating yield loss in environments with increased weather risk. This study aimed to evaluate CA cropping systems that can minimize both economic and climatic risks under erratic climatic conditions in West Africa. We tested upland rice-based CA systems and conventional systems with tillage (CT), in rotation with maize in some of the cases, without and with fertilization, at different sowing windows in the Bouake region, Cote d'Ivoire, from 2015 to 2020. Sowing in June showed in a higher rice yield (1183 kg ha(-1) and 1370 kg ha(-1) without and with fertilization, on average over the 2017-2020 period) than in March (521 kg ha(-1) and 495 kg ha(-1) without and with fertilization) or in July or August (335 kg ha(-1) and 498 kg ha(-1) without and with fertilization). During the first four years, rice yields tended to be lower under the CA systems than under the CT systems, especially when water availability was not a major constraint. However, after this transition period, and especially when water stress occurred, as in 2020, rice yields under CA systems (1835-2021 and 2147-2254 kg ha(-1) without and with fertilization) were higher than under CT systems (1350 kg ha(-1) and 1435 kg ha(-1) without and with fertilization). CA systems having relatively longer duration for growing cover crops tended to produce higher upland rice yield grown in the subsequent season. In both CT and CA systems, the impact of fertilization on rice yield was small over the study period, and the mean rice yield increase due to fertilization was on average 451 kg ha(-1) even when rice was sown in the summer season, resulting in negative economic return. These results indicate that whereas low-input CA upland rice-based systems together with optimizing sowing window for rice could be promising options for sustaining rice yield and mitigating yield loss in environments with increased weather risk, further research is needed for reducing transition period to CA systems in order to enhance their adoption by smallholder farmers. Desirable cover crops should be less labor-demanding, generate incomes from their products, and produce large biomass under erratic climatic conditions.","[Husson, Olivier] UPR AIDA, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Husson, Olivier] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, AIDA, Montpellier, France; [Tano, Bernard F.] Inst Natl Polytech Felix Houphouet Boigny INP HB, Dept Format & Rech Agr & Ressources Anim, Unite Mixte Rech & Innovat UMRI, Sci Agron & Genie Rural, Yamoussoukro BP 1313, Yamoussoukro, Cote Ivoire; [Saito, Kazuki] Africa Rice Ctr AfricaRice, BP 2551, Bouake 01, Cote Ivoire",CIRAD; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CGIAR; Africa Rice Center,"Husson, O (corresponding author), UPR AIDA, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",Olivier.husson@cirad.fr,,,CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on rice agri-food systems; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) [DCI-FOOD/2015/360-968]; European Union,CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on rice agri-food systems; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); European Union(European Commission),"This study was financially supported by the CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on rice agri-food systems, and the European Union and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) under the project Sustainable and Diversified Rice-based Farming Systems [DCI-FOOD/2015/360-968] under the program Putting Research into Use for Nutrition, Sustainable Agriculture and Resilience (PRUNSAR).",,63,4,5,3,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-4290,1872-6852,,FIELD CROP RES,Field Crop.

To summarise current guidance, we systematically compiled recommendations from reviews of scientific literature (74 reviews fitting inclusion criteria) about how to adapt conservation strategies in the face of climate change. We focussed on strategies for designation and management of protected areas in terrestrial landscapes, in boreal and temperate regions. Most recommendations belonged to one of five dominating categories: (i) Ensure sufficient connectivity; (ii) Protect climate refugia; (iii) Protect a few large rather than many small areas; (iv) Protect areas predicted to become important for biodiversity in the future; and (v) Complement permanently protected areas with temporary protection. The uncertainties and risks caused by climate change imply that additional conservation efforts are necessary to reach conservation goals. To protect biodiversity in the future, traditional biodiversity conservation strategies should be combined with strategies purposely developed in response to a warming climate.","[Ranius, Thomas; Widenfalk, Lina A.; Lindman, Ly; Hamalainen, Aino; Filyushkina, Anna; Ockinger, Erik] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Box 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Widenfalk, Lina A.] Greensway AB, Ulls Vag 24A, S-75651 Uppsala, Sweden; [Seedre, Meelis; Felton, Adam] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, Box 49, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Seedre, Meelis] Minist Environm Estonia, Forest Dept, Narva Mnt 7a, EE-15172 Tallinn, Estonia",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Ranius, T (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Box 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",thomas.ranius@slu.se; lina@greensway.se; seedre@gmail.com; ly.lindman@slu.se; adam.felton@slu.se; aino.hamalainen@slu.se; anna.filyushkina@gmail.com; erik.ockinger@slu.se,"Filyushkina, Anna/GWQ-8377-2022; Seedre, Meelis/C-5595-2013; Ockinger, Erik/F-4154-2010","Seedre, Meelis/0000-0002-3635-6354; Ockinger, Erik/0000-0001-7517-4505; Ranius, Thomas/0000-0001-7403-3348; Lindman, Ly/0000-0003-2724-2424","Swedish Research Council Formas [2017-01952, 2019-02007]",Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),This project was funded by The Swedish Research Council Formas (Grant 2017-01952 to TR and Grant 2019-02007 to AdF).,,62,0,0,18,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0044-7447,1654-7209,,AMBIO,Ambio,JAN,2023,52,1,,,,,68,80,,10.1007/s13280-022-01779-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-022-01779-z,,AUG 2022,13,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6G9RR,35997987,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000843413300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, the impacts on shallow groundwater levels, which can lead to both flooding and drought, have major implications for agriculture, adaptation, and urban planning. Predicting such hydrological impacts is typically performed using physically based hydrological models (HMs). However, such models are computationally expensive, especially at high spatial resolutions. This study is based on the Danish national groundwater model, set up as adistributed, integrated surface-subsurface model at a 500 m horizontalresolution. Recently, a version at a higher resolution of 100 m was created, amongst others, to better represent the uppermost groundwater table and to meet end-user demands for water management and climate adaptation. However, the increase in resolution of the hydrological model also increases computational bottleneck. To evaluate climate change impacts, a large ensemble of climate models was run with the 500 m hydrological model, while performing the same ensemble run with the 100 m resolution nationwide model was deemed infeasible. The desired outputs at the 100 m resolution were produced by developing a novel, hybrid downscaling method based on machine learning (ML). Hydrological models for five subcatchments, covering around 9 % of Denmark and selected to represent a range of hydrogeological settings, were run at 100 m resolutions with forcings from a reduced ensemble of climate models. Random forest (RF) algorithms were established using the simulated climate change impacts (future - present) on water table depth at 100 m resolution from those submodels as training data. The trained downscaling algorithms were then applied to create nationwidemaps of climate-change-induced impacts on the shallow groundwater table at 100 m resolutions. These downscaled maps were successfully validated against results from a validation submodel at a 100 m resolution excluded from training the algorithms, and compared to the impact signals from the 500 m HM across Denmark. The suggested downscaling algorithm also opens for the spatial downscalingof other model outputs. It has the potential for further applications where, for example, computational limitations inhibit running distributedHMs at fine resolutions.","[Schneider, Raphael; Koch, Julian; Troldborg, Lars; Henriksen, Hans Jorgen; Stisen, Simon] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland GEUS, Dept Hydrol, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark",Geological Survey Of Denmark & Greenland,"Schneider, R (corresponding author), Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland GEUS, Dept Hydrol, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",rs@geus.dk,"Schneider, Raphael/H-7499-2018; Koch, Julian/D-2509-2015; Stisen, Simon/Q-2832-2017; troldborg, lars/G-8754-2018","Schneider, Raphael/0000-0001-9628-0809; Henriksen, Hans Jorgen/0000-0003-4821-5310; Koch, Julian/0000-0002-7732-3436; Stisen, Simon/0000-0001-6695-8412; troldborg, lars/0000-0002-7366-1438",HIP4Plus project,HIP4Plus project,"This research has been supported by the HIP4Plus project, funded as part of the Danish Digital Strategy 2016-2020, initiative 6.1 common data on topography, climate and water (Den Faellesoffentlige Digitaliseringsstrategi Initiativ 6.1, Faelles data om terraen, klima og vand, FODS6.1).",,59,1,1,5,5,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

If CA does provide a better sustainability with adapted cropping patterns when adopted, a question is, whether CA is able to alleviate the impact of climatic variations thanks to the mulching effect and to which extent. We took the example of medium altitude zones in the Lake Alaotra area to illustrate farmers' perceptions. If climate change is not proven in these areas, climatic variations are very high and erratic rainfall patterns at the beginning of the rainy season induce serious risks of crop failure. Two surveys were implemented in 2013: (i) on CA changing practices of 92 farmers (during the 10 years project duration) and (ii) on the evolution of behavior among 28 farmers who have recently adopted CA (less than 5 years). In CA systems, the mulch contributes to better cropping systems resilience and helps alleviating the effect of climatic variations. If a limited number of farmers have effectively adopted CA practices, in the long run, most farmers have developed innovative cropping systems between conventional agriculture and CA, to address their own constraints, leading to a widespread range of agro-ecological practices.

It involves approaching farming by using economical, ecologically-friendly, and resource -conserving methods. Many farmers do not have a clear understanding of IRF, which is challenging in many countries and regions with different environmental conditions due to the lack of a systematic theoretical knowledge base and supporting technical tools.OBJECTIVE: In this paper, to gain a clearer understanding of the current IRF models used in China and other countries, we reviewed the different types of IRF and animals used for co-culture farming by analyzing the economic and ecological benefits and ecological adaptability of IRF, and then assessed the adaptability of various IRF models according to their current application in China.METHODS: We reviewed 205 published papers on IRF models, including articles, theses, reports, statistical yearbooks, and other relevant publications, to provide an overview of the diversity, and economic and ecological benefits of IRF models worldwide, and to analyze the ecological adaptability according to the yield character-istics of IRF in China.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the rice-shrimp system, particularly rice-crayfish system, can produce more economic benefits in China. By comparing the economic and ecological benefits of different IRF models, we found that rice-fish and rice-duck systems are suitable for large-scale application because of their high climatic adaptability. The analysis also found that (a) the development and distribution of IRF are influ-enced by geographical location and climatic conditions in China, (b) the area of IRF is consistent with the dis-tribution of rainfall amount, and (c) co-cultured animals were more affected by temperature than rice growth. This indicates that when developing IRF in a specific region, co-culture animals and ecological adaptability must be considered in advance.SIGNIFICANCE: Integrated rice-animal farming is an effective measure to promote the combination of planting, cultivating, and driving sustainable agriculture. Therefore, differences in the development of integrated rice -animal farming among regions must be considered to ensure the successful use of IRF under variable climatic conditions. In this review, the advantages and ecological adaptability of each IRF model are summarized, which can help guide the development of IRF in the future.","[Li, Yifan; Liu, Hongyan; Li, Jiaolong] Hainan Univ, Hainan Yazhou Bay Seed Lab, Sanya Nanfan Res Inst, Sanya 572025, Peoples R China; [Li, Yifan; Wu, Tiaoyan; Wang, Shaodong; Ku, Xucan; Zhong, Zhaoman; Liu, Hongyan; Li, Jiaolong] Hainan Univ, Coll Trop Crops, Haikou 570228, Peoples R China",Hainan University; Hainan University,"Liu, HY; Li, JL (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Hainan Yazhou Bay Seed Lab, Sanya Nanfan Res Inst, Sanya 572025, Peoples R China.",liuhy@hainanu.edu.cn; jiaolong.li@hainanu.edu.cn,,,Key Research and Development Pro-gram of Hainan [ZDYF2022XDNY174]; Natural Science Foundation of Hainan [320QN183]; Scientific Research Project of Universities in Hainan [Hnky2021-4],Key Research and Development Pro-gram of Hainan; Natural Science Foundation of Hainan; Scientific Research Project of Universities in Hainan,Acknowledgments This work was supported by Key Research and Development Pro-gram of Hainan (ZDYF2022XDNY174) ; Natural Science Foundation of Hainan (320QN183) ; and Scientific Research Project of Universities in Hainan (Hnky2021-4) .,,205,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-521X,1873-2267,,AGR SYST,Agric.

Determinations were made of the temperatures required to kill 50% of the flower buds [T-50 (FB)] and 50% of the shoot xylem [T-50 (SX)]. The 27 genotypes in this study differed significantly from each other in T-50 (FB) and T-50 (SX). Using 'Goldcot' as the climatically adapted hardy standard, 27 genotypes were placed in three hardiness classes; those more hardy than 'Goldcot,' those equally hardy as 'Goldcot' and those less hardy than 'Goldcot'. The mean T-50 (FB) was 28.7C and the mean T-50 (SX) was -35.3C, indicating that shoot xylem hardiness of apricots was at least several degrees greater than flower bud hardiness. The range in newer bud hardiness among the 27 genotypes was 2.8C while that for shoot xylem hardiness was 6.7C. Seven genotypes had hardier flower buds than 'Goldcot' including two named Harrow cultivars ('Harlayne' and 'Haggith'), four numbered Harrow selections (H7814180, HW-446, H8205044 and HW460) and one other cultivar ('Manchu'). Among 16 genotypes equally bud hardy as 'Goldcot,' four were named narrow cultivars ('Harcot,' 'Harglow,' 'Hargrand' and 'Harogem') and eight were numbered Harrow selections. One named Harrow cultivar ('Hag-gith') was more wood hardy than 'Goldcot'; while three Harrow cultivars ('Harlayne,' 'Harcot' and 'Hargrand') and seven numbered Harrow selections were equally wood hardy. The goal of breeding apricot cultivars equal to or more cold hardy than 'Goldcot' was achieved because bud hardiness of six of the seven Harrow introductions was equal to or greater than 'Goldcot.' The potential breeding value of the 14 named cultivars was estimated by using their total long term performance ratings for 14 attributes, then applying the bud and wood hardiness classifications made here as additional factors. The ranking of breeding value for the 14 named cultivars from highest to lowest was as follows: 'Harlayne' > 'Harcot' = 'Hargrand' = 'Harval' > 'Harglow' = 'Harogem' > 'J.L. Budd' > 'Manchu' > 'Gibbs' = 'Sunglo' > 'Haggith' = 'Veecot' > 'Stella' > 'Goldcot.' The potential breeding value of the six named Harrow introductions for the fresh market exceeded that of the eight other cultivars, including 'Veecot' and 'Goldcot,' the two commercial standards. Consequently, they warrant greater use as parents and wider testing as cultivars.",,,"LAYNE, REC (corresponding author), AGR & AGRI FOOD CANADA, RES CTR, HARROW, ON N0R 1G0, CANADA.",,,,,,,,0,16,17,0,2,AMER POMOLOGICAL SOC,UNIVERSITY PK,"102 TYSON BUILDING, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",0091-3642,,,FRUIT VARIETIES J,Fruit Var.

This one-hour shift in working hours, however, also impacts the current and future heating and cooling demand of buildings, which is yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, daylight saving time-induced heating and cooling demand of archetype offices across the United States are simulated for 15 cities for different representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate trajectories. DST reduces cooling more than it increases heating. Maximum savings of up to 5.9% for cooling and 4.4% increase in heating were simulated under current climatic conditions, noting that cooling dominates the buildings' demand during the DST period. Climate change increases future cooling demand, but does not significantly affect the combined (heating and cooling) potential of reducing energy demand when DST is introduced. However, the relative reduction (i.e. decrease in the percentage of total cooling demand) is smaller when considering climate change. The impact of DST on cooling and heating energy demand depends on the geographical location, which determines the amount and temporal pattern of cooling and heating demand. For the considered case studies, introducing DST with climate change generally resulted in overall combined savings with a maximum saving of 3% for Port Angeles, assuming an RCP 4.5 scenario. Policies that shift working hours need to be evaluated considering their impact on building energy demand and it is necessary to establish whether saving cooling or saving heating energy demand can achieve higher CO2 emission reductions.","[Eggimann, Sven; Mutschler, Robin; Orehounig, Kristina] Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Urban Energy Syst Lab, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Fiorentini, Massimo] Aarhus Univ, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, Inge Lehmanns Gade 10, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA); Aarhus University,"Eggimann, S (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Urban Energy Syst Lab, Dubendorf, Switzerland.",sven.eggimann@empa.ch,"Fiorentini, Massimo/R-8978-2019; Eggimann, Sven/K-5046-2016","Fiorentini, Massimo/0000-0002-9995-6672; Eggimann, Sven/0000-0003-3655-2328",,,,,36,0,0,4,4,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

There is a need for sustainable systems to reduce heat stress in urban areas. Evaporative cooling by water spray systems is increasingly used for this purpose. However, the evaluation of the cooling potential of such systems is difficult. To our knowledge, a systematic investigation of the cooling potential of such a system in an actual urban area has not yet been performed. This paper presents high-resolution Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations based on the 3D unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations to assess the cooling potential by a water spray system with 15 hollow-cone nozzles. The system is numerically implemented for a courtyard in the Bergpolder Zuid region of Rotterdam, the Netherlands and operated during the heat wave period of July 2006. The simulations are validated based on wind-tunnel measurements of an evaporative cooling process and satellite imagery data during the heat wave period. The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) is used to assess the heat stress reduction due to evaporative cooling. The results show that for given values of injected water flow rate (m) overdot(w) = 9.01/min) and height of the spray system (H = 3 m), a maximum temperature reduction and UTCI reduction of about 7 and 5 degrees C are achieved at pedestrian height. In addition, a thermal comfort improvement from strong heat stress (without spray system) to moderate heat stress up to a distance of 5 m from the spray line is obtained. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Some measures intended to increase local resilience may actually decrease the ability to cope with large-scale disasters. In the context of flood management, this work looks at activities supported in the name of resilience and whether they will result in long-term adaptive outcomes. It is proposed that the interpretation of resilience in emergency management has been influenced by pre-existing disaster management concepts, such as the prevent-prepare-respond-recover (PPRR) framework. These have not been adequately reassessed in the light of resilience theories. Disaster resilience was examined using the PPRR framework as a lens. With a focus on flooding, national disaster resilience policy documents from four countries and the global arena were studied to find out which activities were linked to resilience and whether this varies between countries. Subnational policies were also examined in areas that had recently experienced major flooding. Resilience interpretations in some countries were found to support resistance strategies while others were more accommodating. The continued development of floodplains, facilitated by structural mitigation, is an example of a highly resilient but maladaptive feedback loop. This results in risk accumulation and higher consequences during extreme floods. Research explores ways interventions could alter feedbacks and transform to more desirable resilience regimes. It is proposed that negotiating long-term adaptation pathways should be the ultimate aim for planners and emergency managers rather than resilience, which tends to support the status quo. Emergency management concepts and frameworks need to be amended in the light of resilience theories to make it easier to achieve adaptive outcomes.","[Wenger, Caroline] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Wenger, Caroline] Bushfire & Nat Hazards Cooperat Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Australian National University,"Wenger, C (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;Wenger, C (corresponding author), Bushfire & Nat Hazards Cooperat Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,,Commonwealth of Australia through its Australian Postgraduate Award program; Commonwealth of Australia through its Bushfire; Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre program,Commonwealth of Australia through its Australian Postgraduate Award program; Commonwealth of Australia through its Bushfire; Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre program,"This research was supported by the Commonwealth of Australia through its Australian Postgraduate Award program and the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre program.

The objective of this study is to understand the rural farming community's perception of drought impacts on their socio-economic activities and environment, their adaptation at the household level and opinions on government drought mitigation measures. This study is based on both secondary and primary data collected via a survey of 223 farming households. The results show that decrease in yield of cereals, horticultural crops, livestock production and loss of employment, all associated with decreased income of farmers, were the most immediate economic impacts of drought. Social impacts such as population migration, impacts on health and schooling of children, hopelessness and sense of loss, conflicts in society for water, and malnutrition due to changed food preferences were also reported. The environmental impacts such as increases in average atmospheric temperature, pasture-forest degradation, deteriorated water quality, damage to fish habitat wild life, and groundwater depletion were perceived by farmers to high extent. In spite of good perception of severity of drought impacts by farmers and their familiarity with various adaptation options, the preference given for their adoption in agriculture was not good enough. Also to mitigate drought, the government provided various mitigation measures, but the level of satisfaction amongst farmers was low. It is expected that this study will help policy makers to develop more appropriate drought adaptation policies in India. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Salmon provide large seasonal pulses of energy and nutrients via carcasses, eggs and juveniles to many freshwater consumers, and conversely, predation can represent a significant source of mortality for juvenile salmon. Recent declines of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations in Alaska have raised concern that predation might inhibit their recovery. Here, we quantify patterns of predation by freshwater fishes on juvenile salmon across seasons, habitats, predator sizes and streamflow levels in the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region of Alaska. We analysed piscivore stomach contents and identified prey using DNA sequence barcoding. In coastal rivers, juvenile pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon contributed heavily to Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and Dolly Varden char (Salvelinus malma) diets, coho salmon (O. kisutch) prey were rare, and Chinook salmon were not detected. In interior rivers, Arctic grayling, burbot (Lota lota) and northern pike (Esox lucius) consumed small numbers of Chinook salmon. Predation on Chinook salmon was documented disproportionately in sloughs during a summer of exceptionally high streamflow. Dietary and distributional patterns suggested northern pike and burbot may exclude salmon from sloughs in low-gradient river reaches that would otherwise provide suitable rearing habitat. The data also provided tentative support for the hypothesis that high streamflow induces juvenile Chinook salmon to move from mainstem habitats into sloughs, where they face an increased risk of mortality. Incorporating predation risk into climate adaptation, fisheries management and habitat restoration decisions may help to facilitate Chinook salmon recovery.","[Schoen, Erik R.; Sellmer, Kristen W.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Alaska Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Wipfli, Mark S.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, US Geol Survey, Alaska Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Lopez, Juan A.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Lopez, Juan A.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Univ Alaska Museum, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Ivanoff, Renae] Norton Sound Econ Dev Corp, Unalakleet, AK USA; [Meyer, Benjamin E.] Kenai Watershed Forum, Soldotna, AK USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Schoen, ER (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",eschoen@alaska.edu,,"Meyer, Benjamin Everett/0000-0002-2751-5958; Wipfli, Mark/0000-0002-4856-6068; Schoen, Erik Robert/0000-0001-8301-6419; Lopez, Andres/0000-0002-2845-9871",Alaska Department of Fish and Game; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; NSF Alaska EPSCoR; Norton Sound Economic Development Corporation; State of Alaska,Alaska Department of Fish and Game; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); NSF Alaska EPSCoR; Norton Sound Economic Development Corporation; State of Alaska,Alaska Department of Fish and Game; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; NSF Alaska EPSCoR; Norton Sound Economic Development Corporation; State of Alaska,,79,0,0,5,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

The impact of climate change on drought is uncertain, which makes it challenging to quantify how future droughts will affect society. This study uses downscaled rainfall data from 4 global climate models (GCMs) and 2 time windows (1990-2009; 2060-2079) to estimate changes in the average length and intensity of single drought events, and the total number of months experiencing drought during each time window for the Hunter region of Australia. This region was chosen as it is economically important for Australia, and will be the focus of future work that examines the social and policy implications of projected climate change impacts on drought and human displacement. The changes in drought characteristics are assessed using Standardised Precipitation Index and deciles approaches, and 2 datasets: (1) downscaled GCM rainfall; and (2) historical gridded rainfall adjusted via a quantile-quantile approach conditioned on the GCM rainfall. Key findings are that the changes in drought characteristics vary spatially across the study region, and are highly dependent on the downscaled GCM rainfall used, with some regions showing opposing changes in drought characteristics between the ensemble members. Further, the change in drought characteristics between the current and future time windows tends to be greater using the downscaled GCM rainfall when compared with the GCM-adjusted historical rainfall. These results pose the question of how GCM projections should be used to develop robust but cost-effective climate adaptation strategies.","[Lockart, Natalie] Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn Environm Engn, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Kiem, Anthony S.] Univ Newcastle, Fac Sci Earth Sci, Ctr Water Climate & Land, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Chiong, Raymond] Univ Newcastle, Sch Elect Engn & Comp, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Askland, Hedda H.] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Social Res & Reg Futures, Ctr 21st Century Humanities, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Maguire, Amy] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Law Sch, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Rich, Jane L.] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Resources Hlth & Safety, Sch Publ Hlth & Med, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle; University of Newcastle; University of Newcastle; University of Newcastle; University of Newcastle; University of Newcastle,"Lockart, N (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn Environm Engn, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",natalie.lockart@newcastle.edu.au,"Kiem, Anthony/D-9307-2013; MAGUIRE, AMY/G-7764-2013","Kiem, Anthony/0000-0002-3994-6958; MAGUIRE, AMY/0000-0002-3038-5517","DVC (Research and Innovation) Office of The University of Newcastle, Australia","DVC (Research and Innovation) Office of The University of Newcastle, Australia","This work used data derived from RCM simulations performed as part of the NSW and ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project (see Evans et al. 2014).

We developed agro-hydrological models to assess the water footprint (WF) of barley by simulating future crop yield (Y) and consumptive water use (CWU) within the agricultural region of Alberta. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to develop rainfed and irrigated barley Y simulation models adapted to sixty-seven and eleven counties, respectively through extensive calibration, validation, sensitivity, and uncertainty analysis. Eighteen downscaled climate projections from nine General Circulation Models (GCMs) under the Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6 and 8.5 for the 2040-2064 period were incorporated into the calibrated SWAT model. Based on the ensemble of GCMs, rainfed barley yield is projected to increase while irrigated barley is projected to remain unchanged in Alberta. Results revealed a considerable decrease (maximum 60%) in WF to 2064 relative to the simulated baseline 1985-2009 WF. Less water will also be required to produce barley in northern Alberta (rainfed barley) than southern Alberta (irrigated barley) due to reduced water consumption. The modeled WF data adjusted for water stress conditions and found a remarkable change (increase/decrease) in the irrigated counties. Overall, the research framework and the locally adapted regional model results will facilitate the development of future water policies in support of better climate adaptation strategies by providing improved WF projections.

Investigating the differential adoption of 'climate-smart' agricultural practices in western Kenya",JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate smart agriculture; Conservation agriculture; Adoption; Climate change; Political economy,CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; SOIL CONSERVATION; EAST-AFRICA; NARRATIVES; ZIMBABWE; FARMER,"This study assesses factors influencing the adoption of land management practices associated with a World Bank-financed project on' climate-smart' agriculture: the Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project. Drawing upon mixed-methods research with participating farmers in Bungoma County, western Kenya, we find modest reported adoption rates overall for project-encouraged practices, amounting to 53.6 percent on average. However, we also find that there are systematic differences in the reported adoption rates of individual practices. Disaggregating our sample into three classes or 'wealth groups', we find that the 'very poor' and 'poor' groups exhibit substantially lower adoption rates (42 percent and 49 percent, respectively) relative to the 'less poor' wealth group (73 percent). Across these groups, practices related to livestock management and pest management are systematically less adopted (0-45 percent) than more popular practices such as agroforestry and tillage management, the reported adoption of which both range from 60 to 80 percent. Consequently, we suggest that barriers to the adoption of apparently 'climate smart' agricultural practices at scale may increasingly be political-economic rather than simply technical-managerial in nature. This reflects the poorest strata of farmers' struggles to negotiate the increasingly externally imposed imperatives of climate adaptation and mitigation with the necessity of 'simple reproduction' or survival of the household as a socioeconomic unit. Future generations of 'climate smart' agricultural programmes may thus benefit from disaggregating adaptation and mitigation objectives in order to avoid unduly burdening the poorest strata of participating households in rural African contexts.

United Nations international conferences like the Beijing Platform for Action have highlighted the key role of women in ensuring sustainable development. In the context of climate change, women are affected the most while they display knowledge and skills to orient themselves toward climate adaptation activities within their societies. Objective: To investigate how the gender perspective is addressed as an issue in research and policy-making concerning climate change and global health. Methods: A broad literature search was undertaken using the databases Pubmed and Web of Science to explore the terms 'climate change,' 'health,' 'gender,' and 'policy.' Climate change and health-related policy documents of the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Communications and National Adaptation Programs of Action reports submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of selected countries were studied. Assessment guidelines to review these reports were developed from this study's viewpoint. Results: The database search results showed almost no articles when the four terms were searched together. The WHO documents lacked a gender perspective in their approach and future recommendations on climate policies. The reviewed UN reports were also neutral to gender perspective except one of the studied documents. Conclusion: Despite recognizing the differential effects of climate change on health of women and men as a consequence of complex social contexts and adaptive capacities, the study finds gender to be an underrepresented or non-existing variable both in research and studied policy documents in the field of climate change and health.","[Preet, Raman; Nilsson, Maria; Schumann, Barbara; Evengard, Birgitta] Umea Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Clin Med Epidemiol & Global Hlth, Umea, Sweden; [Evengard, Birgitta] Umea Univ, Dept Clin Microbiol, Div Infect Dis, Umea, Sweden",Umea University; Umea University,"Evengard, B (corresponding author), Umea Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Microbiol, Div Infect Dis, SE-90185 Umea, Sweden.",birgitta.evengard@climi.umu.se,"Schumann, Barbara/ABD-4246-2020","Schumann, Barbara/0000-0002-9722-0370; Preet, Raman Kaur/0000-0002-4371-5941",,,,,33,19,19,1,30,CO-ACTION PUBLISHING,JARFALLA,"RIPVAGEN 7, JARFALLA, SE-175 64, SWEDEN",1654-9880,,,GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION,Glob.

We aim to answer two questions: 1) which of the ecosystem services indicators defines the placement of wetlands today? 2) Based on the ecosystem services indicator assessment, what are the recommendations for future selection of catchments for potential wetland reconstruction (i.e. restoration)? Five key ecosystem services indicators produced or affected by wetlands in Denmark were mapped (recreational potential, biodiversity, nitrogen mitigation potential, inverse land rent, and flash-flood risk). These services were compared to current placements of wetlands. Furthermore, scenario testing and hotspot analysis were combined to provide future recommendations for optimal placements of wetlands. The scenarios investigated were Climate Adaptation and Protection of Aquatic Environment, Land-Based Economy, and Rich Nature. Based on these scenarios, the most suitable areas for wetland reconstruction were mapped, taking both the scenarios and attached weightings of ecosystem services indicators into account. According to statistical results current reconstructed wetlands are situated in catchments with lower biodiversity, higher nitrogen mitigation potential, higher land rent (i.e. agricultural intensive areas), and to some extent higher flash flood risk compared to the median of catchments with wetlands. Hence, recreation potential, high biodiversity, and low land rent has not been prioritized. 35 out of the 3023 catchments investigated were identified with an especially high suitability when optimizing all scenarios. This coincides with a high suitability around peri-urban and urban areas and near natural areas, hence capturing both supply and demand services. Of the 35 identified catchments with potentially high suitability, only 2 actually hold a presently reconstructed wetland. This indicates a prior placement with almost no consideration of maximizing ecosystem services benefits. We recommend a systematic approach, such as the ecosystem service value-driven method demonstrated in the present case study, to target more services and improve the overall benefit from wetlands. This approach seeks to inform decision makers of synergies in the landscape, which is likely to transcend future policy implementations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, studies on the issue have disproportionately focused on the lost or preserved soils, expressed in tons per hectare, while the impacts on the lost or preserved moisture were inadequately addressed. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of soil and water conservation practice on soil moisture in the Debre Mewi and Sholit watersheds, Abbay basin, Ethiopia. We compared soil moisture between the treated (Debre Mewi) and the untreated (Sholit) watersheds with SWCs, based on Sentinel-1A data and the field-measured soil moisture, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and water cloud model (WCM). Field-measurement was based on satellite-synchronized 63 soil moisture samples, systematically collected from the two treatment slope positions, two treatment positions, and two depths. We employed ANOVA to compare samples and discern patterns along space and time. The result indicated that the LAI, a predictor of crop yield, was higher in the SWC treated watershed, demonstrating the potential of conserving moisture for boosting crop production. In addition, the results reveal that the higher soil moisture was recorded on the grasslands of the treated watershed at a depth of 15-30 cm, while the lowest was from croplands and eucalyptus trees at 0-15 cm depth. A higher correlation was observed between the measured and estimated soil moisture across three stages of crop development. The soil moisture estimation using WCM from the Sentinel-1 satellite data gives promising results with good correlation (R-2 = 0.69, 0.43 and 0.75, RMSE = 0.16, 2.24 and 0.02, and in Sholit (0.7539, 0.933, and 0.3673 and the RMSEs are 0.17%, 0.02%, and 1.02%) for different dates: August, September, and November 2020, respectively. We conclude that in the face of climate change-induced rainfall variability in tropical countries, predicted to elongate the dry spell during the cropping season, the accurate measurement of soil moistures with the mix of satellite and in-situ data could support rain-fed agriculture planning and assist in fine-tuning the climate adaptation measures at the local and regional scales.","[Damtie, Bekele Bedada; Mengistu, Daniel Ayalew] Bahir Dar Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Bahir Dar 079, Ethiopia; [Damtie, Bekele Bedada] Bahir Dar Univ, Inst Land Adm, Bahir Dar 079, Ethiopia; [Damtie, Bekele Bedada; Mengistu, Daniel Ayalew; Meshesha, Derege Tsegaye] Bahir Dar Univ, Geospatial Data & Technol Ctr, Bahir Dar 079, Ethiopia; [Waktola, Daniel Kassahun] Austin Community Coll, Dept GIS, Austin, TX 78752 USA; [Meshesha, Derege Tsegaye] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Bahir Dar 1289, Ethiopia",Bahir Dar University; Bahir Dar University; Bahir Dar University; Bahir Dar University,"Damtie, BB (corresponding author), Bahir Dar Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Bahir Dar 079, Ethiopia.;Damtie, BB (corresponding author), Bahir Dar Univ, Inst Land Adm, Bahir Dar 079, Ethiopia.;Damtie, BB (corresponding author), Bahir Dar Univ, Geospatial Data & Technol Ctr, Bahir Dar 079, Ethiopia.",bekelebedada031@gmail.com; daniel.kassahun@gmail.com; dan952003@gmail.com; derege2014@gmail.com,,"Bedada, Bekele/0000-0003-3673-8560",Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Ethiopia (MoSHE),Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Ethiopia (MoSHE),"This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Ethiopia (MoSHE).

The African continent is particularly vulnerable to climate-related extreme weather events due to an already overburdened health system, lack of early warning signs, poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and variable adaptive capacity. Emergency care services are not only utilized during these events but also threatened by these hazards. Considering that the effects of climate change are expected to increase in intensity and prevalence, it is increasingly important for emergency care to prepare to respond to the changes in presentation and demand. The aim of this study was to perform a scoping review of the available literature on the relationship between climate change and emergency care on the African continent.Methods: A scoping review was completed using five databases: Pubmed, Web of Science, GreenFILE, Africa Wide Information, and Google Scholar. A 'grey' literature search was done to identify key reports and references from included articles. Two independent reviewers screened articles and a third reviewer decided conflicts. A total of 1,382 individual articles were initially screened with 17 meeting full text review. A total of six articles were included in the final analysis. Data from four countries were represented including Uganda, Ghana, Tanzania, and Nigeria.Results: Analysis of the six articles yielded three key themes that were identified: climate-related health impacts that contribute to surges in demand and resource utilization, opportunities for health sector engagement, and solutions to improve emergency preparedness.

This may be due to the widespread use of cross-sectional survey designs, which infer causality from theoretical considerations alone. The present longitudinal study, in contrast, builds on the logic that cause precedes effect to confirm the direction of effects. Drawing on two-wave survey data from 554 flood-prone households in Austria, cross-lagged autoregressive models analyze pairwise combinations between risk perception, fear, five nonprotective responses (fatalism, denial, wishful thinking, reliance on social support, reliance on public protection), and seven specific protective responses (ranging from coordination with neighbors to structural modifications of the building). These factors show substantial temporal stability, in particular for nonprotective responses and fear. Only in very few instances can effects over time be confirmed statistically. Nonprotective responses emerge as the major drivers; foremost, denial, and reliance on public protection limit private flood mitigation. This overall null finding on causality may trace back to the 1.5 years' time span and the absence of any policy intervention or flood disaster between survey waves, and the high stability of protection motivation theory components. This finding puts into question the theoretically assumed causal relationships and the effects found in cross-sectional studies. The high trait-like stability requires perseverance in risk management efforts to change attitudes and capabilities. Finding nonprotective responses as key determinants in an overall picture of stability suggests that this factor merits a stronger role in future risk research.","[Seebauer, Sebastian; Babcicky, Philipp] Joanneum Res Forsch Gesell mbh, LIFE, Inst Climate Energy & Soc, Waagner Biro Str 100, A-8020 Graz, Styria, Austria",,"Seebauer, S (corresponding author), Joanneum Res Forsch Gesell mbh, LIFE, Inst Climate Energy & Soc, Waagner Biro Str 100, A-8020 Graz, Styria, Austria.",sebastian.seebauer@joanneum.at,,"Babcicky, Philipp/0000-0002-5616-4958","Austrian Climate and Energy Fund [B286284, B368603, B670283]",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund,"We thank area editor Michael Siegrist and an anonymous reviewer for valuable comments on an earlier version of the article.

Climate change is expected to result in higher temperatures, thus increasing the incidence of heat stress, but lowering the risk of frosts in mid-altitude areas. Increasing ambient carbon dioxide levels can enhance photosynthetic rates and reduce water use of potato. This study assessed the impact of climate change on potential yield and water use efficiency (WUE) in twelve potato production regions of South Africa using the LINTUL-POTATO crop model. With current planting times, simulated yields between 1 961 and 2 050 increased by 0.02 and 0.40 t ha(-1)y(-1)and WUE by 0.00 and 0.08 g l(-1)y(-1)evapotranspired. Improvements in yields and WUE were close to zero when the crop was grown in hot periods, as an increasing incidence of heat stress and higher evapotranspiration largely discounted benefits of higher CO(2)levels. This was particularly the case in the interior production regions, where expected temperature increases were most severe. In many regions, potato growers are likely to respond to climate change by advancing planting time. Often a trade-off existed between maximising yield and WUE. A compromise could be achieved by planting as early as possible in the optimum spring planting window for summer crops.","[Franke, A. C.; Muelelwa, L.

These studies have filled a gap in the literature to allow for more effective policymaking by considering the trade-offs between land use, energy infrastructure as well as the use of water for agriculture and providing energy services. Though these studies fill a significant gap in the modelling literature, we argue that more work is needed to effectively consider policy trade-offs between the 17 United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) to avoid missing important interactions. Results We examine the 17 SDGs individually to determine if it should be included in a modelling framework and the challenges of doing so. We show that the nexus of climate, land, energy and water needs to be expanded to consider economic well-being of both individuals and the greater economy, health benefits and impacts, as well as land use in terms of both food production and in terms of sustaining ecological diversity and natural capital. Such an expansion will allow energy systems models to better address the trade-offs and synergies inherent in the SDGs. Luckily, although there are some challenges with expanding the nexus in this way, we feel the challenges are generally modest and that many model structures can already incorporate many of these factors without significant modification. Finally, we argue that SDGs 16 and 17 cannot be met without open-source models and open data to allow for transparent analysis that can be used and reused with a low cost of entry for modellers from less well-off nations. Conclusions To effectively address the SDGs, there is a need to expand the common definition of the nexus of climate, land, energy, and water to include the synergies and trade-offs of health impacts, ecological diversity and the system requirements for human and environmental well-being. In most cases, expanding models to be able to incorporate these factors will be relatively straight forward, but open models and analysis are needed to fully support the SDGs.","[Niet, Taco; Kuling, Kamaria] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Sustainable Energy Engn, Fac Appl Sci, 10285 Univ Dr, Surrey, BC V3T 4B7, Canada; [Arianpoo, Nastaran; Wright, Andrew S.] Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Environm, Pacific Water Res Ctr, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University; Simon Fraser University,"Niet, T (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Sustainable Energy Engn, Fac Appl Sci, 10285 Univ Dr, Surrey, BC V3T 4B7, Canada.",Taco_Niet@sfu.ca,"Wright, Andrew/HDM-9615-2022","Kuling, Kamaria/0000-0002-1842-208X; Niet, Taco/0000-0003-0266-2705",,,,,42,8,9,7,106,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2192-0567,,,ENERGY SUSTAIN SOC,Energy Sustain.

The arid and semi-arid regions of China are undergoing the effects of climate change across the entire northern hemisphere. Their ecological environments are fragile and in conflict with anthropogenic activities, which significantly altered more ecosystems services in these regions. Therefore, estimating the effects of anthropogenic activities on ecosystem services is important for formulating ecological policy and regional environmental mitigation plans of these regions. This study employed the model of ecosystem service value (ESV) assessment and the bivariate spatial autocorrelation method to reveal the spatiotemporal variations in the characteristics of ecosystem value in the arid and semi-arid ecological regions of China and its interaction with human activities. Results showed that (1) the total value of ES of the study area increased from USD 487,807 billion in 2000 to USD 67,831,150 billion 2020; (2) the ES value provided by forest land first increased by 5.60% from 2000 to 2020; (3) the ESV provided by grassland showed an overall decline over the 20 years. Food and raw material production showed the lowest ES value, and climate regulation and soil conservation decreased from 2000 to 2020; (4) the index of human footprint patches decreased from 45.80% in 2000 to 17.63% in 2020, while the high and very high human footprint index areas increased significantly, mainly due to the rapid urbanization and improvement of railway networks in these areas. Spatially, the regions with high human footprint were mostly dispersed in the northeastern of China such as Shanxi and Gansu, whereas the regions with a low human footprint remained mainly located in the central and southwestern parts of China; (5) significant spatial dependencies between changes in ESV and the human footprint index were recorded. Our study could provide a scientific basis for ecosystem functions regulation and land development security in arid and semi-arid ecological regions.","[Fan, Xin; Tiando, Damien Sinonmatohou; Eme, Chan; Li, Jiangfeng] China Univ Geosci Wuhan, Sch Publ Adm, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Fan, Xin] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Yu, Haoran; Liang, Zhe] Anhui Urbanizat Dev Res Ctr, Hefei 230022, Peoples R China; [Rong, Yuejing] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Rong, Yuejing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Luo, Wenxu] China Univ Geosci, Int Educ Coll, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Ou, Shengya] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Tourism, Xian 710119, Peoples R China","China University of Geosciences; Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; China University of Geosciences; Shaanxi Normal University","Li, JF (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Wuhan, Sch Publ Adm, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",worldwin2020@sina.com; watt2020521@163.com; damientiando90@gmail.com; yjrong_st@rcees.ac.cn; intlstudents@cug.edu.cn; emechan340@gmail.com; osy201705598@snnu.edu.cn; jfli@cug.edu.cn; liazhe_320@163.com,"Yu, Haoran/HHS-8869-2022","Yu, Haoran/0000-0003-2912-9273","Natural Science Foundation of China [42001218]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology [2021-KF-03]; Beijing Normal Univer-sity, China","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology; Beijing Normal Univer-sity, China","FundingThis research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 42001218.The project was also supported by State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology (2021-KF-03), Beijing Normal Univer-sity, China.",,53,3,4,28,106,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

A smooth transition to sustainability requires decision makers to assess the future perspectives of hydropower: about its future revenue and related uncertainty. This investigation requires a multidisciplinary approach as both streamflow and energy mix will evolve. We simulated future streamflow based on eight climate scenarios using a semi-distributed hydrological model for our case study, the Tremorgio hydropower plant located in southern Switzerland. Next, using a hydropower management model we generated income according to these streamflows and twenty-eight electricity price scenarios. Our results indicate that climate change will modify the seasonality of inflows and volumes exploitable for hydropower generation. However, adaptive strategies in the management of reservoirs could minimize revenue losses/maximize revenue gains. In addition, most market scenarios project an increase in revenues, except in the case of high wind and solar energy penetration.

The concept is thought to foster sustainability of livelihoods against impacts of climate change. This paper analyses the mainstreaming of NAPA into national development plans in Lesotho as accentuated by policies and programmes. Design/methodology/approach-The analysis is broadly qualitative and reviews policies and projects on agriculture and food security, environment, forestry, water and irrigation aimed at sustaining rural livelihoods. Data from relevant government documents, commissioned studies' reports, literature and key stakeholders are used. Findings-Although the mainstreaming entry point for NAPA is identified in the country's Vision 2020 and National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2012/13-2016/17, financial, technical, human and other resources are inadequate to ensure its effective implementation. There is little evidence of NAPA mainstreaming into development plans by the line ministries of finance and economic development other than donor-funded projects. Absence of climate change policy influence means NAPA is not well-factored into the national development agenda, as mainstreaming is difficult without appropriate policies. Most projects with effect on climate change impact abatement originate from specific sectors and are disconnected from each other. Originality/value-Based on the findings, ways to leverage NAPA via mainstreaming are discussed. It is concluded that NAPA mainstreaming offers a promising avenue for initiating and promoting sustainable livelihoods in Lesotho. The study demonstrates the applicability of the presented sustainable livelihood framework.","[Gwimbi, Patrick] Natl Univ Lesotho, Dept Environm Hlth, Maseru, Lesotho",,"Gwimbi, P (corresponding author), Natl Univ Lesotho, Dept Environm Hlth, Maseru, Lesotho.",pgwimbi@yahoo.com,,,,,,,47,4,4,1,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

If intraspecific variability in the response to elevated CO2 (e[CO2]) can be found, then it should be possible to select for greater responsiveness in crop breeding programs. Our experiment aimed to determine the effects of e[CO2] on the yield, biomass, leaf and grain nitrogen content of a range of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivars subjected to rainfed and supplemental irrigation conditions. Plants were grown under Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) at the Australian Grains FACE facility in Horsham, Victoria, Australia under e[CO2] (550 ppm) or at ambient CO2 (390-400 ppm) under rainfed conditions and supplemental irrigation during three seasons, 2010-2012. Yields were significantly increased by 26% under e[CO2] due to an increase in the number of pods per area. Grain size, the number of grains per pod and the harvest index remained unaffected by e[CO2]. Grain nitrogen concentration ([N]) was slightly, but significantly, decreased by e[CO2], but this was not consistent across cultivars under all water regimes. The dual purpose cultivar PBA Hayman consistently maintained grain [N] in response to e[CO2] while the response in grain [N] in the cultivars Sturt and PBA Twilight depended on the irrigation treatment. While there was no evidence for consistent differences in seed yield response to e[CO2] for the chosen cultivars, understanding the mechanisms for why some cultivars are able to maintain [N] under e[CO2] would allow breeding programs to develop varieties resistant to decreases in [N] under e[CO2].

The semiarid conditions of the region and tight coupling of livelihood enterprises with ecosystem services creates a situation of increased sensitivity to climate changes and enhanced vulnerability among the rural communities and Native American nations across the region. Recent climate conditions associated with warming trends, and altered atmospheric flows have resulted in rapid onset of drought conditions and other extreme weather events across the region that are changing seasonal patterns of temperature and precipitation and warming trends. Projected climate changes provided in the fourth US National Climate Assessment indicate that potential warming and variability of precipitation will further increase drought and extreme weather events. Recent research and assessment efforts of current and projected climate changes in the Great Plains indicate that rural communities and ecosystems are becoming more vulnerable to changes associated with warming trends, droughts, and increased variability in precipitation. These climate changes are having differential impacts on ecosystem services that are critical to livelihood enterprises.

To inform adaptation planning, we quantified the effects of incremental relative sea-level rise (RSLR) on exposed land area, number and replacement value of buildings within Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand. The assessment compared three coastal hazards: flooding, permanent inundation and erosion. Increasingly frequent coastal flooding will be the dominant trigger for adaptation in Tauranga. In the absence of adaptation, coastal flooding, recurring at least once every 5 years on average, will overtake erosion as the dominant coastal hazard after about 0.15-0.2 m RSLR, which is likely to occur between the years 2038-2062 in New Zealand and will rapidly escalate in frequency and consequence thereafter. Coastal erosion will remain the dominant hazard for the relatively-few properties on high-elevation coastal cliffs. It will take 0.8 m more RSLR for permanent inundation to reach similar impact thresholds to coastal flooding, in terms of the number and value of buildings exposed. For buildings currently within the mapped 1% annual exceedance probability (AEP) zone, the flooding frequency will transition to 20% AEP within 2-3 decades depending on the RSLR rate, requiring prior adaptive action. We also compared the performance of simple static-planar versus complex dynamic models for assessing coastal flooding exposure. Use of the static-planar model could result in sea level thresholds being reached 15-45 years earlier than planned for in this case. This is compelling evidence to use dynamic models to support adaptation planning.","[Stephens, Scott A.; Paulik, Ryan; Reeve, Glen; Wadhwa, Sanjay; Popovich, Ben] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, POB 11115, Hamilton 3251, New Zealand; [Shand, Tom; Haughey, Rebecca] Tonkin & Taylor Ltd, POB 317, Tauranga 3140, New Zealand",National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand,"Stephens, SA (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, POB 11115, Hamilton 3251, New Zealand.",scott.stephens@niwa.co.nz; Ryan.Paulik@niwa.co.nz; Glen.Reeye@niwa.co.nz; Sanjay.Wadhwa@niwa.co.nz; Ben.Popoyich@niwa.co.nz; TShand@tonkintaylor.co.nz; RHaughey@tonkintaylor.co.nz,,"Stephens, Scott/0000-0002-6573-8757; Paulik, Ryan/0000-0003-1147-6816","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) [3710440]; Strategic Science Investment Fund (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research) [CAVA2104]; Coastal Programme of the Resilience to Nature's Challenges Kia Manawaroa-Nga Akina o Te Ao Turoa [GNS-RNC040-Coastal]","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)); Strategic Science Investment Fund (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research); Coastal Programme of the Resilience to Nature's Challenges Kia Manawaroa-Nga Akina o Te Ao Turoa","The research was funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) under (a) the Natural Hazard Research Platform Climate Change Impacts on Weather-Related Hazards project 3710440 and (b) Strategic Science Investment Fund (Project CAVA2104-National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research).

At the same time, disaster losses continue to rise at a rapid rate, due to the combined effects of long-standing settlement patterns and growth in areas prone to natural hazards and an increase in the frequency and magnitude of disastrous weather events. This article explores how New Urbanism, an increasingly ubiquitous approach to urban design, and its associated transect can be modified for better disaster resilience through the proposed creation of Hazard Transect Overlay Districts (H-Transect) that remain true to New Urbanism and disaster resilience. Two types of HTransect Overlay Districts-protect/accommodate and managed retreat/avoidance-are created and visually superimposed on the New Urbanist transect in the coastal zone, spanning riverine, tidal, and shoreline environments. Our results suggest that the proposed H-Transect Overlay District can be used in New Urbanist communities to advance resilience by actively involving land use planners, recognizing the need to further test and calibrate the concept over time.","[Smith, Gavin] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Anderson, Allison] Univ Texas, Architecture, Austin, TX USA; [Anderson, Allison] Louisiana State Univ, Architecture, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Anderson, Allison] Tulane Univ, Architecture, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Perkes, David] Mississippi State Univ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Perkes, David] Gulf Coast Community Design Studio, Gulfport, MS USA",North Carolina State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Tulane University; Mississippi State University,"Smith, G (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",,,,,,,,77,2,2,0,4,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0277-2426,1553-2704,,LANDSC J,Landsc.

However, there remains an adaptation deficit among agricultural producers: action to reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change is insufficient. To motivate adaptation, diverse incentives are in place most notably through the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy which offers financial incentives to farmers. However, the effect of incentives on behaviour appears to be low. To better understand adaptation intentions, we report on the results of a survey experiment assessing framing effects on German farmers. Four framings of adaptation motifs-financial, norms, risk awareness, and technological innovation-are tested against a socio-cognitive model based on Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). According to PMT, adaptation intentions are a function of an individual's risk and coping appraisal. Results show that, contrary to assumptions of profit maximizing individuals, economic incentives trigger fewer overall change intentions. Economic rewards do act on risk perception, but are less likely to trigger coping perception, while other treatments do. As coping perception is one of two socio-cognitive reactions to climate change, financial incentive structures fail to act on about half the factors leading to adaptation intentions. These effects dependent on subgroups, farm structures, and are mediated by climate experience. To support transitions towards robust adaptation, adaptation incentives must move beyond financial framings alone, and leverage on farmers' recent experiences with adverse climate impacts, understandings of climate change, and the influence of social norms.","[Buelow, Franca; Cradock-Henry, Nicholas] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Governance & Policy, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand",Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Cradock-Henry, N (corresponding author), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Governance & Policy, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand.",buelowf@landcareresearch.co.nz; cradockhenryn@landcareresearch.co.nz,,"Buelow, Franca/0000-0002-2328-5024; Cradock-Henry, Nicholas/0000-0002-4409-9976",Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research,Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research,"The authors are thankful for comments from two anonymous reviewers and the editor of this journal.

Because of the need for societal responses, an in-depth understanding of individual and collective forms of engagement with climate change is of growing relevance. To contribute to close this gap, this paper applies a place-based approach for investigating how people's place attachments and meanings inform individual and collective engagement with climate change. As a case study, the district of North Frisia (Germany) was chosen, a region between climate-change vulnerability and renewable-energy potential. Qualitative interviews and a household survey with coastal dwellers of the municipality of Reuenkoge have been conducted, a group discussion with the Country Youth (Landjugend) and further interviews with experts from government, companies and associations spread over North Frisia and in Kiel. The results reveal two main findings: firstly, place-dependent attachments and meanings play a pivotal role for understanding people's engagement with climate change, and secondly, the behavioural dimension of engagement involves diverse adaptation and mitigation measures adopted on individual and collective level. In sum, the findings conceptually and empirically reveal the importance of memories, experiences, knowledge and creativity for how people engage with climate change, but also exhibit the importance of policies mobilising community-based actions.","[Suesser, Diana] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Human Dimens Coastal Areas, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Suesser, Diana] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, Hamburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Max Planck Society; University of Hamburg,"Susser, D (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Human Dimens Coastal Areas, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.;Susser, D (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, Hamburg, Germany.",diana.suesser@posteo.de,,"Susser, Diana/0000-0002-9757-3491","Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (Regional Climate Change); North Frisian municipalities, in Germany","Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (Regional Climate Change); North Frisian municipalities, in Germany","This research has been financed by the Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (Regional Climate Change) and was conducted within the working group 7 'Risk analysis and risk management for integrated climate strategies'.

This is particularly true at the strategic level of emergency management, which involves planning for and managing non-routine, high-consequence events. Drawing on the literature, a survey, and interviews and workshops with Australia's senior emergency managers, this paper presents an analysis of five core challenges that these pressures are creating for strategic-level emergency management. It argues that emphasising emergency management' as a primary adaptation strategy is a retrograde step that ignores the importance of addressing socio-political drivers of vulnerabilities. Three key suggestions are presented that could assist the country's strategic-level emergency management in tackling these challenges: (i) reframe emergency management as a component of disaster risk reduction rather than them being one and the same; (ii) adopt a network governance approach; and (iii) further develop the capacities of strategic-level emergency managers.","[Bosomworth, Karyn] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Owen, Christine] Univ Tasmania, Fac Educ, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Owen, Christine; Curnin, Steven] Bushfire & Nat Hazards Cooperat Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Curnin, Steven] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Law Enforcement Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Bosomworth, K (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",karyn.bosomworth@rmit.edu.au,"Curnin, Steven/O-5620-2017; Bosomworth, Karyn/A-6435-2016","Curnin, Steven/0000-0001-5248-7250; Bosomworth, Karyn/0000-0001-9907-0858",,,,,59,13,13,3,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0361-3666,1467-7717,,DISASTERS,Disasters,APR,2017,41,2,,,,,306,323,,10.1111/disa.12196,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/disa.12196,,,18,"Environmental Studies; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Social Sciences - Other Topics,EM7KS,27170415,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000395490500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative (CRSCI) provides funding to state and local health departments to anticipate and respond to health impacts from climate change using the Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) framework. This paper explores the barriers to and enablers of successful adaptation projects among BRACE West CRSCI grantees, including Arizona, California, Oregon, and the city and county of San Francisco. The barriers included competing demands such as the COVID-19 pandemic, dependence on partners with similar challenges, staff and leadership turnover, uncertain and complex impacts on at-risk populations, and inadequate resources. The enablers included effective partnerships, leadership support, dedicated and skilled internal staff, and policy windows enabling institutional change and reprioritization. These findings highlight effective strategies in the field that state and local health departments may use to anticipate potential barriers and establish their work in an environment conducive to successful adaptation.","[Mallen, Evan; Joseph, Heather A.; McLaughlin, Megan] US Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Climate & Hlth Program, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; [English, Dorette Quintana; Vargo, Jason] Calif Dept Publ Hlth, Climate Change & Hlth Equ Sect, Off Hlth Equ, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA; [Olmedo, Carmen; Wolff, Matt] San Francisco Dept Publ Hlth, Populat Hlth Div, San Francisco, CA 94102 USA; [Roach, Matt; Tirdea, Carmen] Arizona Dept Hlth Serv, Off Environm Hlth, Climate & Hlth Program, Phoenix, AZ 85007 USA; [York, Emily] Oregon Hlth Author, Publ Hlth Div, Oregon Climate & Hlth Program, Portland, OR 97232 USA",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; California Department of Public Health; San Francisco Department of Public Health; Arizona Department of Health Services,"Mallen, E (corresponding author), US Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Climate & Hlth Program, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA.",qxd5@cdc.gov; hbj7@cdc.gov; qxd4@cdc.gov; dqe1@att.net; carmen.olmedo@sfdph.org; matthew.roach@azdhs.gov; carmen.tirdea@azdhs.gov; jason.vargo@sf.frb.org; matt.wolff@sfdph.org; emily.a.york@dhsoha.state.or.us,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Vargo, Jason/0000-0002-4785-6936; Mallen, Evan/0000-0001-6151-752X; Joseph, Heather/0000-0003-0470-6759",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative grant [CDC Ue1 EH001045],Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative grant,The authors of this paper were funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Ue1 EH001045) Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative grant to implement the Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) framework.,,69,1,1,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

One issue when it comes to measuring, for example, impacts, vulnerabilities, and resilience in preparation of adaptation action is the abundance of conceptual frameworks and associated definitions. Frequently, those definitions contradict each other and shift over time. Prominently, in the transition from the IPCC AR (International Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report) 4 to the IPCC AR 5, a number of conceptual understandings have changed. By integrating common concepts, the literature review presented intends to thoroughly investigate frameworks applied to assess climate change effects on urban areas, creating an evidence base for research and politically relevant adaptation. Thereby, questions concerning the temporal development of publication activity, the geographical scopes of studies and authors, and the dominant concepts as applied in the studies are addressed. A total of 50 publications is identified following screening titles, abstracts, and full texts successively based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Major findings derived from our literature corpus include a recently rising trend in the number of publications, a focus on Chinese cities, an imbalance in favor of authors from Europe and North America, a dominance of the concept of vulnerability, and a strong influence of the IPCC publications. However, confusion regarding various understandings remains. Future research should focus on mainstreaming and unifying conceptual frameworks and definitions as well as on conducting comparative studies.","[Klopfer, Florian; Westerholt, Rene; Gruehn, Dietwald] TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Spatial Planning, August Schmidt Str10, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Klopfer, F (corresponding author), TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Spatial Planning, August Schmidt Str10, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",florian.klopfer@tu-dortmund.de; rene.westerholt@tu-dortmund.de; dietwald.gruehn@tu-dortmund.de,"Westerholt, René/P-5634-2019","Westerholt, René/0000-0001-8228-3814; Klopfer, Florian/0000-0001-7386-5492; Gruehn, Dietwald/0000-0002-7570-4104",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Technische Universitat Dortmund/TU Dortmund University,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Technische Universitat Dortmund/TU Dortmund University,We acknowledge financial support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and Technische Universitat Dortmund/TU Dortmund University within the funding program Open Access Publishing.,,81,4,4,10,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2021,13,19,,,,,,,10794,10.3390/su131910794,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su131910794,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WI1ZU,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000708167300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An observed decline in South Africa's maize production over the last few decades has raised questions about the capacity of institutions responsible for providing climate change-related adaptive support to maize farmers in the country. This study assessed the adaptive capacity of management institutions in South Africa supporting maize producers, using a combination of literature review, document analysis, and in-depth interviews applied in the adaptive capacity wheel (ACW) assessment tool. On the basis of the results obtained from this analysis, the adaptive capacity of South African institutions responsible for climate change response processes was scored as medium. Findings from the research suggest that the advances made to date in South Africa in terms of climate change-related policy development, resource allocation, and capacity development could be inadequate, given the extent of identified institutional weaknesses, capacity constraints, knowledge, and information limitations. The study concludes that an inability to address current institutional limitations, considering the threats associated with climate change, may result in intensified social and economic challenges in the maize production sector. The study recommends the consistent revision and capacitation of these institutions to enable them to provide the type of support that will ensure effective adaptive responses for farmers involved in maize production in the country.

We respond to the gap in evidence by piloting the Climate Change and Social Learning initiative's monitoring and evaluation framework for social learning. Our objectives are to begin building an evidence base and to test the theory of change behind the framework. Using a peer-assist approach, we apply the framework to eight case studies in partnership with five initiatives. We analyse trends in evidence gathered across the case studies in four dimensions of social learning (engagement, iterative learning, capacity development, and challenging institutions) along three dimensions of change (process, learning outcomes, and changes in values and practice).","[Van Epp, Marissa] Wageningen Univ & Res, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Lumen Bldg,Droevendaalsesteeg 3a, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Van Epp, Marissa; Garside, Ben] IIED, London, England",CGIAR; Wageningen University & Research,"Van Epp, M (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Lumen Bldg,Droevendaalsesteeg 3a, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",m.vanepp@cgiar.org,,"Van Epp, Marissa/0000-0003-3318-6107","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)",,36,18,18,3,23,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

Hence adaptation by incorporating infrastructures is essential, but it has been seldom explicitly included in the simulations projecting climate change impacts on flood risk in these countries. Quantifying the effects of infrastructure is the key to climate change impact and adaptation assessment. Therefore, this study was conducted in the Chao Phraya River Basin (CPRB) in Thailand to examine the adaptation potential of (i) existing structural and non-structural measures that include reservoir and diversion dams, diversion canals, and water retention areas, and (ii) the combined adaptation measures, a combination of alterations made to the existing diversion canals and retention areas, on reducing future floods using the H08 global hydrological model (GHM). The results revealed that the impact of existing measures on the future flood reduction was smaller than the increase caused by warming in the CPRB. Conversely, the combined adaptation measures successfully mitigated the effect of warming by redirecting nearly 50 % of the diverted river flow to the ocean and storing 30 % of the diverted flow in the retention areas. Although a remarkable reduction was noted in the basin-wide flood risk, the effect of adaptation measures greatly varied across the basin. The combined adaptation measures largely reduced the number of flooding days by close to 100 at many of the considered stations within the basin, except for extreme flood events (historical 1 percentile flood events). This further reveals that the feasibility of adaptation measures in alleviating the extreme future floods will be limited in flood-vulnerable basins and thus require area-based prioritization for flood management. The modelling framework implemented in this study can be easily adapted to different GHMs and regions and should be examined for their applicability.","[Gopalan, Saritha Padiyedath; Hanasaki, Naota] Natl Inst Environm Studies NIES, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Champathong, Adisorn; Sukhapunnaphan, Thada] Royal Irrigat Dept, 811 Samsen Rd, Bangkok, Thailand; [Nakamura, Shinichiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Chikusa Ku, Bldg 9,Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Nagoya University,"Gopalan, SP (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies NIES, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",pgsaritha@nies.go.jp,"Hanasaki, Naota/C-2932-2009; Nakamura, Shinichiro/ACF-3536-2022","Hanasaki, Naota/0000-0002-5092-7563; ",Science and Technology Research Partnership,Science and Technology Research Partnership,This study was carried out as a part of the research project entitled ?

This research employed an online survey to investigate the perceptions of BGI held by professional stakeholders in four cities with established BGI programs: Newcastle (UK), Ningbo (China), Portland (Oregon USA), and Rotterdam (The Netherlands) (64 respondents). The results show that challenges associated with having too much water (e.g., pluvial and fluvial flood risk, water quality deterioration) are driving urban water management agendas. Perceptions of governance drivers for BGI implementation, BGI leaders, and strategies for improving BGI uptake, are markedly different in the four cities reflecting the varied local, regional and national responsibilities for BGI implementation. In addition to managing urban water, BGI is universally valued for its positive impact on residents' quality of life; however, a transformative change in policy and practice towards truly multifunctional infrastructure is needed to optimise the delivery of multiple BGI benefits to address each city's priorities and strategic objectives. Changes needed to improve BGI uptake, e.g., increasing the awareness of policy-makers to multifunctional BGI, has international relevance for other cities on their journeys to sustainable blue-green futures.","[O'Donnell, Emily C.; Gosling, Simon N.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Netusil, Noelwah R.] Reed Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97202 USA; [Chan, Faith K.

A key point that surfaces from these discussions is that the cooperation of non-military organizations is essential for effective responses to climate change-related threats. This overlaps considerably with debates on security in Japan, where the use of force is constitutionally restricted. Therefore, it is possible to localize the concept of climate security to the genealogy of Japan's security policy that, in the 1980s and 1990s, sought a non-traditional security strategy that did not rely solely on military power in the name of comprehensive security, environmental security, and human security. In Japan, the perspective of climate security is rare. However, the introduction of a unique climate security concept into security policy enables the maintenance of national security and environmental conservation. Additionally, struggling with climate change alongside neighboring countries contributes to mutual confidence building and stability in international relations in Northeast Asia. To achieve this objective, we first show that climate security includes many kinds of security concerns by surveying previous studies and comparing Western countries' climate security policies. Second, we follow the evolution of Japan's security policy from 1980 to 2021.

Where do the 'local' and the 'global' intersect in the search for effective coping measures - and do they?

Most of the academic literature tends to naturalize green bonds as an eminently technical solution to reconcile economic growth and environmental sustainability. Filling an epistemological gap, the present article leverages a world-ecology approach to embed the financial phenomenon of green bonds within the broader picture of the capitalist political economy and the expansion of its ecological frontier. In light of the ongoing experiences that the authors have been following in the Brazilian legal,financial and political context, the article unpacks and makes sense of green bonds as a tool in the hands of climate finance that reproduces global patterns of North-South uneven development and the shifting of ecological costs. To test the potential of the interpretative framework offered by a world-ecology approach, we mobilize it in the concrete case of green bonds issuances directed to fund the forestry sector in Brazil. Aware that the current phenomenon only represents a blip in comparison to the largeer temporal (the longue duree) and spatial (the world system) scales usually deployed by world-ecology, we nonetheless discuss how the ideological, technical and power dynamics behind the issuance of green bonds unleash capital accumulation, produce a financialized and subordinated construction of nature, and entail an institutional arrangement. The article is organized around 3 main sections. After the introduction, section 1 describes green bonds as one of the most fashionable financial topics of the moment, and one that promotes a shift in discourses towards the need of actively building a green economy. Although from a legal standpoint green bonds embody no significant difference from regular bonds, our focus is to describe the promises around them, the current (private) governance structure, and the trends in the issuance of these debt instruments both in the Global North and South, with a specific focus on the case of Brazil. In section 2, we look at the operations of green bonds emissions on the ground, i.e. taking as an example the context of green debt underpinning the Brazilian forestry sector. The analysis reveals how the emissions, made predominantly by large multinational companies actively present on the global market, feed off great efforts deployed by both the public and the private sector in constructing an image of the sector as a key player in the emergent bioeconomy and in the strengthening of Brazil's goals in the Paris Agreement. However,we describe how green bond revenues that are officially committed to the implementation of sustainable management of forests are associated with the expansion of the ecological frontier in the Brazilian territory, stretching the boundaries of the area dedicated to tree plantations and amplifying social and environmental tensions. The backstage of the emissions shows how capital accumulation through green bonds is associated with the coproduction of nature for the purpose of accumulation, generating concerns that are often diluted or transformed into procedural requirements. Debt generated by the subscription of green bonds, we argue, is not only financial, but also social and ecological. In section 3, we put forward that for private accumulation to be successful, green bonds in the forestry sector demand an institutional arrangement that combines state support and private governance of debt in its financial, social and ecological dimensions. Rather than being the result of an idealized and spontaneous market, a set of institutional transformations have to be considered in order to comprehend the feasibility of green bonds in the Brazilian forestry sector. We thus describe the historic connection between forestry and the state, the endless public incentives to put nature to work, the functional adaptations of the Brazilian environmental legislation and the regulation concerning the demarcation, access and use of land. In this context, we argue that green bonds add yet a new institutional layer to the process of creating and validating specific forms of nature, through a governance structure that dilutes the tensions between the promise of environmental benefits and its concrete negative social and environmental impacts. We conclude the article by reassembling these findings as part of the capitalist world ecology dialectical unity of capital accumulation, co-production of nature and power. We suggest that the world-ecology approach allows us to grasp green bonds as a complex form that has so far been ignored in the relevant literature. As any other phenomenon of financialization, a green bond should not be understood in isolation from its material basis, since it is from that basis - and its social and environmental conditions and contradictions - that it appropriates value. As the example of the Brazilian forestry sector illuminates, the greenness of the financial debt inscribed in green bonds may come into existence at the expense of the social and environmental debt that underlie the forestry sector productive model. Hence, although the explicit inclusion of environmental concerns into financial considerations and project implementation has been praised as a step towards the recognition that finance has a material impact on the planet and that these externalities shall be accounted for, the article warns of the typical green arithmetic move put forward by green bonds. Green bonds inevitably co-produce nature and social relations, but in a very unequal way that emphasizes capital accumulation and that does not necessarily protect the environment (even when standards are introduced). Much to the contrary, green bonds may come into being at the expense of other ways of living ecologically, and by restoring injustices of the past and creating a regenerative future - in other words, by creating debt.","[Miola, Iage] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Miola, Iage; Prol, Flavio] Ctr Brasileno Anal & Planificac CEBRAP Brasil, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Junqueira, Gabriela de Oliveira] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Derecho, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Ferrando, Tomaso] Univ Amberes, Fac Derecho, Grp Invest Derecho & Desarrollo, Antwerp, Belgium; [Ferrando, Tomaso; Herrera, Hector] Univ Amberes, Inst Polit Desarrollo IOB, Antwerp, Belgium; [Vecchione-Goncalves, Marcela] Univ Fed Para, Program Postgrad Desarrollo Sostenible Trop Hume, Relac Int & Desairollo, Belem, Para, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal do Para,"Miola, I (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.;Miola, I (corresponding author), Ctr Brasileno Anal & Planificac CEBRAP Brasil, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",iage.miola@unifesp.br; goliveirajunqueira@gmail.com; fmprol15@gmail.com; marcela.vecchione@gmail.com; tomaso.ferrando@uantwerpen.be; hector.herrera@uantwerpen.be,,"de Oliveira Junqueira, Gabriela/0000-0002-3853-2817",,,,,75,1,1,4,21,UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID,MADRID,"UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, MADRID, 00000, SPAIN",1699-3950,,,RELAC INT-MADR,Relac.

Adaptive neurofuzzy interface system (ANFIS), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models are used for predicting solar radiation (SR). Grasshopper algorithm (GOA) is utilized to improve the performance of ANFIS, RBFNN, and MLP models. Three stations in Iran, namely Rasht (humid climate), Yazd (semi-arid) and Tehran (slightly arid), are considered as the case studies. The accuracy of GOA is benchmarked against particle swarm optimization (PSO) and salp swarm algorithm (SSA). The results reveal that the best-input combination is relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and temperature at these three stations. A comprehensive study is performed to select the best-input combination. The main contribution of paper is to create new hybrid ANFIS models for predicting monthly solar radiation in different climates. Besides, effects of different parameters are comprehensively investigated on solar radiation. This study indicates that temperature is the most effective parameter for estimating SR in dry and semi-dry climate. It is found that rainfall plays a key role for estimating SR in a wet region. The main finding of this paper is that the determination of the most suitable input scenario for predicting SR is an important issue because different input scenarios in different climates provide different performances. Besides, the use of a robust optimization algorithm as a training method is a significant step of the modeling process of SR. Results indicate that mean absolute error (MAE) of ANFIS-GOA is 3.8% and 8.9% less in comparison with that of MLP-GOA and RBFNN-GOA, respectively during the training stage at Yazd station. Besides, MAE of ANFIS-GOA is 26% and 31% less than that of MLP-GOA and RBFNN-GOA, respectively during the training stage at Tehran station. Results indicate that NSE values of ANFIS-GOA, ANFIS-SSA, ANFIS-PSO, and ANFIS models are 0.94, 0.88, 0.84, and 0.79, respectively during the testing stage at Rasht station. It is found that ANFIS-GOA attains higher accuracy in predicting SR under different climates.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

The need for multi-perspective data analyses in historical landscape studies: The example of Schokland (NL),JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,World heritage; Historical landscapes; Heritage management and conservation; Historical geographical information systems (hgis); Landscape archaeology; Multi-perspective data integration,,"The awareness that cultural heritage plays an influential role in shared identities and in both spatial and environmental development has significantly increased in recent years. International collaboration and treaties, such as the 'FARO-convention' in 2005 emphasize the importance of heritage in relation to aspects of human rights and demography. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that historical perspectives are essential for making well-informed choices regarding environmental challenges (e.g. spatial planning, sustainable development, climate adaptation). This increased awareness not only emphasizes the importance of cultural heritage for present-day challenges, but equally presents a new set of conditions and standards, and requires the development of new methodologies. Besides conservation, more than ever there is a need for cultural heritage to become contextualized and sustainably accessible. The organisational pinnacle of cultural-heritage conservation is world heritage: sites that are judged to contain a set of cultural and/or natural values which are of outstanding value to humanity. However, to what extent world heritage meets these newly set criteria is unknown. Nevertheless, these sites often reflect an eminent status, scientifically as well as economically (i.e. through tourism). Consequently, world heritage often enjoys interest from multiple stakeholders including governmental, scientific, public, and commercial parties, all of whom engage in contrasting activities and have different interests and needs. As a result the need for accessibility and integrated overviews of these sites is high but equally challenging. In this paper we will focus on the world-heritage site of Schokland (NL). This former island in the Dutch Zuiderzee both reflects outstanding historical and archaeological importance. We will show that the dynamics surrounding this site require tailormade conservation methodologies, which greatly depend on data integration. We present a new Historical Geographical Information System (HGIS) specifically designed to integrate cultural and geoscientific data and facilitate dynamic heritage management. Results show that such a system greatly adds to the contextualization and (digital) accessibility of the heritage site and is essential for substantiating conservation methodologies. Furthermore, it shows great research potential for diachronological reconstructions of dynamic-lowland development. The system facilitates multidisciplinary scientific analyses, integrated monitoring, and public outreach and shows great application potential for other (world-)heritage sites. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Following deforestation, ET is typically observed to decrease substantially as a consequence of decreases in leaf area and roots and increases in runoff. Changes in ET (latent heat flux) revise the surface energy and water budgets, which further affects large-scale atmospheric dynamics and feeds back positively or negatively to long-term forest sustainability. In this study, we used observations from a recent synthesis of 29 pairs of adjacent intact and deforested FLUXNET sites to improve model parameterization of stomatal characteristics, photosynthesis, and soil water dynamics in version 1 of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELMv1). We found that default ELMv1 predicts an increase in ET after deforestation, likely leading to incorrect estimates of the effects of deforestation on land-atmosphere coupling. The calibrated model accurately represented the FLUXNET observed deforestation effects on ET. Importantly, the search for global optimal parameters converged at values consistent with recent observational syntheses, confirming the reliability of the calibrated physical parameters. Applying this improved model parameterization to the globe scale reduced the bias of annual ET simulation by up to -600 mm/year. Analysis on the roles of parameters suggested that future model development to improve ET simulation should focus on stomatal resistance and soil water-related parameterizations. Finally, our predicted differences in seasonal ET changes from deforestation are large enough to substantially affect land-atmosphere coupling and should be considered in such studies. Plain Language Summary Deforestation changes Earth's surface characteristics and affects the water cycle and climate. Although Earth system modeling is an important tool to understand the effects of deforestation, current models have large uncertainties. Here we used FLUXNET-based observations to identify biases in representing deforestation effects on evapotranspiration (ET) in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). Results showed these biases are mostly associated with the representation of trees, not with smaller vegetation types (e.g., grasses). We then used the observations to optimize model parameters and improved simulations of ET and sensible heat fluxes following deforestation. Globally, these improvements led to a reduction in ET bias of 600 mm/year. This improved model allows improved estimates of the effects of deforestation on the water cycle and climate and could benefit forest management and climate adaptation strategies.","[Cai, Xitian; Riley, William J.; Zhu, Qing; Tang, Jinyun; Bisht, Gautam] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zeng, Zhenzhong] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Zhenzhong] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Randerson, James T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Southern University of Science & Technology; Princeton University; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Cai, XT (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",xtcai@lbl.gov,"Zeng, Zhenzhong/A-2212-2019; Zhu, Qing/G-2433-2015; Riley, William J/D-3345-2015; Tang, Jinyun/M-4922-2013; Cai, Xitian/N-4526-2013; Bisht, Gautam/J-4822-2014","Zeng, Zhenzhong/0000-0001-6851-2756; Zhu, Qing/0000-0003-2441-944X; Riley, William J/0000-0002-4615-2304; Tang, Jinyun/0000-0002-4792-1259; Cai, Xitian/0000-0002-4798-4954; Randerson, James/0000-0001-6559-7387; Bisht, Gautam/0000-0001-6641-7595","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy under Regional and Global Climate Modeling program through the Reducing Uncertainties in Biogeochemical Interactions through Synthesis and Computation Scien [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy under Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy under Regional and Global Climate Modeling program through the Reducing Uncertainties in Biogeochemical Interactions through Synthesis and Computation Scien; Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy under Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported by the Director, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 as part of their Regional and Global Climate Modeling program through the Reducing Uncertainties in Biogeochemical Interactions through Synthesis and Computation Scientific Focus Area (RUBISCO SFA) project and as part of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project.

This challenge is elevated by population and income growth. Increased climate water stress levels reduce water supplies in many river basins and elevate competition for water among sectors. Organized information is needed to guide river basin managers and stakeholders who must plan for a changing climate through innovative water allocation policies, trade-off analysis, vulnerability assessment, capacity adaptation, and infrastructure planning. Several hydroeconomic models have been developed and applied assessing water use in different sectors, counties, cultures, and time periods. However, none to date has presented an optimization framework by which historical water use and economic benefit patterns can be replicated while presenting capacity to adapt to future climate water stresses to inform the design of policies not yet been implemented. This paper's unique contribution is to address this gap by designing and presenting results of a hydroeconomic model for which optimized base conditions exactly match observed data water use and economic welfare for several urban and agricultural uses at several locations in a large European river basin for which water use supports a population of more than 3.2 million. We develop a state-of-the arts empirical dynamic hydroeconomic optimization model to discover land and water use patterns that optimize sustained farm and city income under various levels of climate-water stress. Findings using innovative model calibration methods allow for the discovery of efficient water allocation plans as well as providing insight into marginal behavioral responses to climate water stress and water policies. Results identify that water trade policy under climate water stress provides more economically efficient water use patterns, reallocating water from lower valued uses to higher valued uses such as urban water. The Ebro River Basin in Spain is used as an example to investigate water use adaptation patterns under various levels of climate water stress. That basin's issues and challenges can be of relevance to other river basins internationally.","[Baccour, Safa] CITA Govt Aragon, Dept Agr & Nat Resource Econ, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Ward, Frank A.] New Mex State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Albiac, Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Ward, FA (corresponding author), New Mex State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",fward@nmsu.edu; maella@unizar.es,"Baccour, Safa/GSE-3851-2022; Albiac, Jose/J-8827-2012","Albiac, Jose/0000-0002-9074-2942",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [RTA 2017-00082-00-00]; European Regional Development Fund; Spanish Ministry,"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Spanish Ministry(Spanish Government)","Acknowledgements This study has been financed by the project RTA 2017-00082-00-00 from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, which includes partial funding from the European Regional Development Fund.

The study uses institutional ethnography research methods with informants drawn from government organisations, local academic institutions, and development partners, together with content analysis of key policy documents. It was found that the Cambodian national planning process restricts the involvement of other actors such as researchers, civil society, and private sector; yet flexible, in that it provides opportunities for the inclusion of climate change and other related concerns. The study identified specific entry points in key policy documents, such as the National Strategic Development Plans, and ministries' plans. Other entry points were identified in the development planning process, for example, in the process of development departments and ministries' plans, and actors such as department planners, and departments of planning of line ministries. Climate-informed planning is now plausible; more significant integration of concerns with future climate change, however, will require more commitment and stronger connections among national planning stakeholders, adaptation actors, and research communities.","[Dany, Va; Bajracharya, Bhishna; Regan, Michael] Bond Univ, Inst Sustainable Dev & Architecture, Gold Coast, Qld 4229, Australia; [Dany, Va] Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Dept Environm Sci, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Taplin, Ros] Univ New South Wales, ACSMP, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Lebel, Louis] Chiang Mai Univ, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand",Bond University; University of New South Wales Sydney; Chiang Mai University,"Dany, V (corresponding author), Bond Univ, Inst Sustainable Dev & Architecture, Gold Coast, Qld 4229, Australia.;Dany, V (corresponding author), Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Dept Environm Sci, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.",dva@bond.edu.au; r.taplin@unsw.edu.au; bbajrach@bond.edu.au; mregan@bond.edu.au; llebel@loxinfo.co.th,"Bajracharya, Bhishna/ABC-6656-2021","Bajracharya, Bhishna/0000-0003-2560-468X",Fogarty International Center/National Institutes of Health [D43 TW000642]; United Board Fellowship Program,Fogarty International Center/National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); United Board Fellowship Program,This work was supported by the United Board Fellowship Program and Fogarty International Center/National Institutes of Health (funds from D43 TW000642).,,56,7,7,2,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

These resilience pillars are important both before and after the occurrence of extreme weather events. Extreme weather insurance can influence these pillars of resilience depending on how particular insurance mechanisms are structured. We explore how the lessons learnt from the current best insurance practices can improve resilience to extreme weather events. We employ an extensive inventory of private property and agricultural crop insurance mechanisms to conduct a multi-criteria analysis of insurance market outcomes. We draw conclusions regarding the patterns in the best practice from six European countries to increase resilience. We suggest that requirements to buy a bundle extreme weather event insurance with general insurance packages are strengthened and supported with structures to financing losses through public-private partnerships. Moreover, support for low income households through income vouchers could be provided. Similarly, for the agricultural sector we propose moving towards comprehensive crop yield insurance linked to general agricultural subsidies. In both cases a nationally representative body can coordinate the various stakeholders into acting in concert.","[Hudson, P.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany; [De Ruig, L.

Yet, little existing empirical work examines how decision-makers can facilitate such responses. This paper suggests that in order to assess whether responses to climate risks and threats are transformational, it is necessary to move away from a focus only on outcomes and scale and towards the multiple dimensions of social responses and the processes through which transformational changes are realized. In so doing, the paper seeks to move the discussion on transformational change towards the processes and sustainability of adaptation interventions, and the changes they trigger. Drawing on the literature on transformational change in organizational theory and social-ecological systems, the paper first develops a framework with which to examine and assess development and adaptation interventions. The framework is then applied to eight interventions made between 2005 and 2011 in diverse socioecological settings across Africa. All interventions were underpinned by participatory action research methodologies. Our analysis shows how a focus on change agents, generalizability of field-scale adaptation mechanisms and pathways, and sustainability of outcomes, combined with attention to the scale and scope of change processes, provides information that can inform policy on the kinds of intervention that are likely to support long-term and sustainable responses to climate impacts. Although several of the cases mainly illustrate incremental adaptations, use of the analytical framework pointed towards the wider processes of systems change that might lead to transformative trajectories.","[Mapfumo, Paul] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Mapfumo, Paul] Univ Zimbabwe, Soil Fertil Consortium Southern Africa SOFECSA, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Onyango, Mary] Bondo Univ Coll, Directorate Gender Mainstreaming & Dev, Bondo, Kenya; [Honkponou, Said K.] Initiat Dev Integre & Durable, Porto Novo, Benin; [El Mzouri, El Houssine] INRA, Rabat, Morocco; [Githeko, Andrew] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Climate & Human Hlth Res Unit, Kisumu, Kenya; [Rabeharisoa, Lilia] Univ Antananarivo, Dept Agr, ESSA, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Obando, Joy] Kenyatta Univ, Dept Geog, Nairobi, Kenya; [Omolo, Nancy] Kenya Agr Res Inst, CCU, Nairobi, Kenya; [Majule, Amos] Inst Resource Assessment, Dar Es Salaam, Kinondoni, Tanzania; [Denton, Fatima] UN Econ Commiss Africa, Africa Climate Policy Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Ayers, Jessica] UK Govt, Dept Energy & Climate Change, Strategy Directorate, London, England; [Agrawal, Arun] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Zimbabwe; University of Zimbabwe; Kenya Medical Research Institute; University Antananarivo; Kenyatta University; UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA); University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Mapfumo, P (corresponding author), Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, Harare, Zimbabwe.;Mapfumo, P (corresponding author), Univ Zimbabwe, Soil Fertil Consortium Southern Africa SOFECSA, Harare, Zimbabwe.",pmapfumo@agric.uz.ac.zw,"Majule, Amos/ABD-5185-2020; Majule, Amos/ABD-5726-2020","Majule, Amos/0000-0002-9928-7632; ",,,,,39,45,45,2,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Nevertheless, the impact of biochar on qualitative traits of agricultural production needs to be further assessed. The effect of biochar application on vine yield and grape quality parameters is here investigated in a non-irrigated vineyard in Tuscany (central Italy). Results from four harvest-years showed a higher productivity, up to 66%, of treated plots with respect to their controls, while no significant differences were observed in grape quality parameters. The observed increase in productivity was inversely correlated with rainfall in the vegetative period, confirming the key role of biochar in regulating plant water availability. These findings support the feasibility of a biochar-based strategy as an effective adaptation measure to reduce the impact of water stress periods with no negative effects on grape quality.

The increasing occurrence of temporary intra-seasonal droughts and waterlogging longer than a week demands climate-smart solutions. Research has focused on water deficits since the 1980s. However, besides droughts, waterlogging can restrict productivity of sensitive cash and staple crops as cotton and corn. The year 2019 offered the historically unique opportunity to monitor waterlogging effects with 1088 mm precipitation in the rural commune Cinzanawith an isohyet of 681 mm. Impacts of two extreme downpours on three sorghum cultivars were monitored in a farmers-field experiment with three replications. All sorghum cultivars performed well in 2019 with significantly higher grain and above ground biomass yields than in the reference year 2007, with well distributed rainfall in Cinzana. Jakumbe (CSM63E) produced significantly higher grain yields than the hybrid cultivar PR3009B bred for high harvest index. The local cultivar Gnofing selected by local farmers produced significantly higher above ground biomass. All cultivars tolerated without severe stress symptoms 20 days waterlogging and 72 h inundation. Further waterlogging resilience research of other crops and other sorghum cultivars is needed to strengthen food security in Mali with expected increasing precipitation variation in the future.","[Mueller, Manuel; Gaiser, Thomas] Univ Bonn, DE Katzenburgweg 5, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Dembele, Siaka] Inst Econ Rurale IER, BP 214, Segou, Mali; [Zougmore, Robert B.; Partey, Samuel T.] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, BP 320, Bamako, Mali",University of Bonn; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT),"Muller, M (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, DE Katzenburgweg 5, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",manuel.mueller@gmx-topmail.de; siaka.bioscience@gmail.com; r.zougmore@cgiar.org; tgaiser@uni-bonn.de; s.partey@cgiar.org,"Gaiser, Thomas/AAD-6326-2021; Muller, Manuel/B-1722-2018","Gaiser, Thomas/0000-0002-5820-2364; Dembele, Siaka/0000-0001-5571-2185; Muller, Manuel/0000-0002-3023-4719; Partey, Samuel/0000-0001-5223-0367; Zougmore, Robert/0000-0002-6215-4852","fiat panis foundation; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR; CGIAR Fund Council; Australia-ACIAR; European Union; International Fund for Agricultural Development-IFAD; USAID, UK","fiat panis foundation; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund Council(CGIAR); Australia-ACIAR; European Union(European Commission); International Fund for Agricultural Development-IFAD; USAID, UK(United States Agency for International Development (USAID))","This research was funded by fiat panis foundation and by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Fund Donors and through several bilateral funding agreements (the CGIAR Fund Council, Australia-ACIAR, European Union, International Fund for Agricultural Development-IFAD, Ireland, New Zealand, Netherlands, Switzerland, USAID, UK, and Thailand).

Firstly, we evaluated how affect the seasonal rainfall amount and patterns on rice yield and production through regression analysis by using the meteorological and agricultural statistic data. 8 province had positive correlation R>0.3 with Jul-Sep accumulated rainfall. And then, probability analysis was applied to monthly rainfall which was employed for insurance index value. As a result, setting amount and periods of insurance index was suitable. Secondly, household survey was conducted to investigate farmers' conditions of water use, cultivation, income balance.

The principal aim of the research was to explore the factors that shape differentiated vulnerability and adaptive capacity within the two communities, with a focus on extremely poor community members. Findings indicate that climate-related vulnerability is differentiated at the sub-community level, both among different socio-economic, livelihood and social groups, as well as within them. Some of the central factors highlighted by respondents as underpinning differentiation had clear power and inequality dimensions. These include political ties and corruption; community and family networks; and the capability to enforce one's own rights, for example to land, in lieu of access to impartial law enforcement and justice institutions. The article concludes with implications of these findings for supporting adaptive capacity and mainstreaming climate change into planning processes at different levels. In particular, interventions focused on assets may be less important than those directed at power relations, networks and the security dimensions of extreme poverty.","[Coirolo, Cristina] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Rahman, Atiq] BCAS, Dhaka, Bangladesh",University of Sussex,"Coirolo, C (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",ccoirolo@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,18,18,1,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Due to limitations of current flood management strategies, evacuation is likely to become increasingly prominent in many coastal areas. Thus it is important to think critically about challenges for successful evacuation planning, particularly for vulnerable communities. This paper brings together the evacuation planning, climate change and environmental justice literatures. We describe the unique challenges that environmental justice communities face with evacuation, and identify best practice guidelines to improve the quality of evacuation planning for these communities. The guidelines presented, while not comprehensive, provide a framework for planners and policymakers to consider when developing evacuation plans, both for current and future climate conditions, and could improve the quality of evacuation planning.","[Kuhl, Laura] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Ctr Int Environm & Resource Policy, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Kirshen, Paul H.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Civil Engn, Environm Res Grp, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Kirshen, Paul H.] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Ruth, Matthias] Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ruth, Matthias] Northeastern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Douglas, Ellen M.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA",Tufts University; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Northeastern University; Northeastern University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Kuhl, L (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Ctr Int Environm & Resource Policy, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",laura.kuhl@tufts.edu; paul.kirshen@unh.edu; m.ruth@neu.edu; ellen.douglas@umb.edu,,"Kuhl, Laura/0000-0002-1379-9435",NOAA Sectoral Applications Research Program (SARP) [NAO08OAR4310722]; NSF research grant IGERT: Water Diplomacy [0966093]; BP,NOAA Sectoral Applications Research Program (SARP); NSF research grant IGERT: Water Diplomacy; BP,"This research was funded by grants from the NOAA Sectoral Applications Research Program (SARP; NAO08OAR4310722), NSF research grant 0966093 IGERT: Water Diplomacy, and a research grant from BP to the Center for International Environment and Resource Policy at the Fletcher School.",,87,11,11,2,80,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

However, the uptake of CSA remains low, which is related to anthropogenic, or human-related, decisions about CSA and agricultural land use. This paper assesses households' decisions to allocate agricultural land to CSA technologies across space and over time. We use the state-contingent theory, mixed methods, and mixed data sources. While agricultural land is increasing, forest land is decreasing across countries in SSA. The results show that household decisions to use CSA and the extent of agricultural land allocation to CSA remain low with a negative trend over time in SSA. Owned land and accessing land through rental markets are positively associated with allocating land to CSA technologies, particularly where land pressure is high. Regarding adaptation, experiencing rainfall shocks is significantly associated with anthropogenic land allocation to CSA technologies. The country policy assessment further supports the need to scale up CSA practices for adaptation, food security, and mitigation. Therefore, scaling up CSA in SSA will require that agriculture-related policies promote land tenure security and land markets while promoting climate-smart farming for food security, adaptation, and mitigation.","[Tione, Sarah Ephrida] Minist Agr, Dept Planning, POB 30134, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Nampanzira, Dorothy; Nalule, Gloria] Makerere Univ, Coll Vet Med Anim Resources & Biosecur, Dept Livestock & Ind Resources, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda; [Kashongwe, Olivier] Leibniz Inst Agr Engn & Bioecon, Dept Engn Livestock Management, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Kashongwe, Olivier] Egerton Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Anim Sci, POB 536, Nakuru 20115, Kenya; [Katengeza, Samson Pilanazo] Lilongwe Univ Agr & Nat Resources LUANAR, Directorate Res & Outreach, POB 219, Lilongwe, Malawi",Makerere University; Leibniz Institut fur Agrartechnik und Biookonomie (ATB); Egerton University; Lilongwe University of Agriculture & Natural Resources,"Tione, SE (corresponding author), Minist Agr, Dept Planning, POB 30134, Lilongwe, Malawi.",sarahtione@gmail.com,"Tione, Sarah/GXG-8891-2022","Tione, Sarah/0000-0002-3849-2915; Kashongwe, Olivier/0000-0002-6107-4084",African Economic Research Consortium under the Climate Change and Economic Development in Africa (CCEDA) [RC21595]; African Economic Research Consortium,African Economic Research Consortium under the Climate Change and Economic Development in Africa (CCEDA); African Economic Research Consortium,"This research was funded by the African Economic Research Consortium under the Climate Change and Economic Development in Africa (CCEDA) collaborative research project grant number RC21595 and the APC was also funded by the African Economic Research Consortium.

However, with the growth enhancement common to crops grown under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (e[CO2]), there is a risk that too much early growth might deplete soil water and lead to more severe terminal drought stress in environments where production relies on stored soil water content. If this is the case, the incorporation of such a trait in wheat breeding programmes might have unintended negative consequences in the future, especially in dry years. We used selected data from cultivars with proven expression of high and low early vigour from the Australian Grains Free Air CO2 Enrichment (AGFACE) facility, and complemented this analysis with simulation results from two crop growth models which differ in the modelling of leaf area development and crop water use. Grain yield responses to e[CO2] were lower in the high early vigour group compared to the low early vigour group, and although these differences were not significant, they were corroborated by simulation model results. However, the simulated lower response with high early vigour lines was not caused by an earlier or greater depletion of soil water under e[CO2] and the mechanisms responsible appear to be related to an earlier saturation of the radiation intercepted. Whether this is the case in the field needs to be further investigated. In addition, there was some evidence that the timing of the drought stress during crop growth influenced the effect of e[CO2] regardless of the early vigour trait. There is a need for FACE investigations of the value of traits for drought adaptation to be conducted under more severe drought conditions and variable timing of drought stress, a risky but necessary endeavour.","[Bourgault, Maryse] Montana State Univ, Northern Agr Res Ctr, Havre, MT USA; [Bourgault, Maryse; Fitzgerald, Glenn J.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Creswick, Vic, Australia; [Webber, Heidi A.; Gaiser, Thomas; Siebert, Stefan; Ewert, Frank] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat INRES, Bonn, Germany; [Webber, Heidi A.; Ewert, Frank] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Brandenburg, Germany; [Chenu, Karine] Univ Queensland, Queensland Alliance Agr & Food Innovat QAAFI, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [O'Leary, Garry J.; Fitzgerald, Glenn J.] Grains Innovat Pk, Agr Victoria, Horsham, Vic, Australia; [Siebert, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Gottingen, Germany; [Dreccer, Fernanda] Univ Queensland, Agr & Food Cooper Lab, CSIRO, Gatton, Qld, Australia; [Huth, Neil] CSIRO Agr & Food, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Tausz, Michael] CQ Univ, Dept Agr Sci & Environm, Norman Gardens, Qld, Australia; [Bourgault, Maryse] Univ Saskatchewan, Coll Agr & Bioresources, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A0, Canada",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; University of Melbourne; University of Bonn; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); University of Queensland; University of Gottingen; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Central Queensland University; University of Saskatchewan,"Bourgault, M (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Coll Agr & Bioresources, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A0, Canada.",maryse.bourgault@usask.ca,"Dreccer, Maria Fernanda/F-2150-2010; Gaiser, Thomas/AAD-6326-2021; Huth, Neil I/F-7882-2010; Tausz, Michael/AHC-9128-2022; Siebert, Stefan/B-8621-2009; Chenu, Karine/A-8967-2009","Dreccer, Maria Fernanda/0000-0003-3528-9580; Gaiser, Thomas/0000-0002-5820-2364; Huth, Neil I/0000-0002-4197-830X; Tausz, Michael/0000-0001-8205-8561; Siebert, Stefan/0000-0002-9998-0672; Ewert, Frank/0000-0002-4392-8154; Chenu, Karine/0000-0001-7273-2057; Webber, Heidi/0000-0001-8301-5424; Fitzgerald, Glenn/0000-0001-6972-4443; Bourgault, Maryse/0000-0001-7756-7353",Australian Commonwealth Department of Agriculture and Water Resources; Grains Research and Development Corporation,Australian Commonwealth Department of Agriculture and Water Resources; Grains Research and Development Corporation(Grains R&D Corp),Australian Commonwealth Department of Agriculture and Water Resources; Grains Research and Development Corporation,,56,10,11,3,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

It shows why the adoption of a systemic perspective, i.e. complex and dynamic, of resilience can offer a pertinent frame, under specific conditions, to envisage sustainable futures for urbanized territories faced with present and forthcoming climate risks. Secondly, considering the actual uses and meanings of resilience, this article interrogates the operational feature of this concept to re-think about the urban fabric in an integrated manner with the climate risks prevention. Finally, it aims to clarify why planned adaptation strategies aimed at reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing proactive resilience of cities, that have progressively become in both academic and institutional discourses a key feature, and even a tipping point, for urban sustainable development pathways, can revealed to be ambiguous.","[Quenault, Beatrice] Univ Rennes 2, Maitre Conf Econ, Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; Universite Rennes 2,"Quenault, B (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 2, Maitre Conf Econ, Rennes, France.",beatrice.quenault@univ-rennes2.fr,,,,,,,88,0,0,0,2,RESEAU DEVELOPPEMENT DURABLE & TERRITOIRES FRAGILES,VILLENEUVE D ASCQ,"RESEAU DEVELOPPEMENT DURABLE & TERRITOIRES FRAGILES, VILLENEUVE D ASCQ, 00000, FRANCE",1772-9971,,,DEV DURABLE TERRIT,Dev.

To respond to and mitigate these threats, there is a need to first systematically understand and categorise them. This paper reviewed 226 articles from the period 2010-2020 on threats to Australia's oceans and coasts, resulting in the identification of a total of 307 threats. Threats were grouped into three broad categories - threats from use and extraction; environmental and human -induced threats; and policy and socio-political threats -then ranked by frequency. The most common 'threats from use and extraction' were recreational activities, non-point source pollution, and urban development; the most common 'environmental and human-induced threat' was increased temperatures; and the most common 'policy and socio-political threat' was policy gaps and failures (e.g., a lack of coastal climate adaptation policies). The identification of threats across all three categories increased over time; however, the identification of 'threats from use and extraction' increased most rapidly over the last four years (2017-2020). Threats were most often described for their impacts on environmental values (68%), followed by economic (14%), socio-cultural (12%), and Indigenous (6%) values. Only 45 of the 226 papers (20%) discussed multiple threats. The threats facing Australia's oceans and coasts are rising, cumulative, and multi-faceted, and the inherent tensions between varied uses, along with intensification of uses that derive short-term anthropogenic benefit, will continue to degrade the ecological sustainability of ocean and coastal systems if actions are not taken.","[Laubenstein, Taryn; O'Donnell, Tayanah] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Smith, Timothy F.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Law & Soc, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia; [Smith, Timothy F.] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON, Canada; [Smith, Timothy F.] Uppsala Univ, SWEDESD, Dept Womens & Childrens Hlth, Uppsala, Sweden; [Hobday, Alistair J.; Evans, Karen; Fulton, Elizabeth A.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.; Pecl, Gretta T.; Fulton, Elizabeth A.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Pecl, Gretta T.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",Australian National University; University of the Sunshine Coast; Brock University; Uppsala University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Laubenstein, T (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",taryn.laubenstein@anu.edu.au,,,Australian Government through the Australian Research Council [FT180100652],Australian Government through the Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This publication was linked to the Future Earth Australia and Australian Academy of Science National Strategy for Sustainable Oceans and Coasts 2021-2030'.

Urbanization has critical implications for global land cover. Relevant literature has provided evidence attributing climatic effects to urban expansion; however, few studies have investigated the effect on public health and pollutant sensitivity to emissions. This study aimed to characterize the effect of urbanization-induced changes in regional climate on ozone (O-3), to evaluate ozone sensitivity to nitrogen oxide (NOx) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, and to estimate premature mortalities due to O-3 exposure. We employed atmospheric models with the higher-order decoupled direct method to simulate effects of urbanization on O-3 and to determine O-3 sensitivity to NOx and VOC emissions. China-specific concentration response functions were utilized to estimate cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities due to ozone exposure. Urbanization increased O-3, which translated to a 39.6% increase in O-3-induced premature mortality (1,100 deaths). Moreover, O-3 has become less/more sensitive to unit changes in NOx and VOC emissions in various cities. Urban greening may reduce urban temperature, but it may increase O-3 in some cities due to the additional VOC emissions of greening. These findings highlight the strong interactions between land use policies, urban climate adaptation strategies, and air quality policies, suggesting the need of cobeneficial strategies and policies. We proposed a precision environmental management concept that emphasizes the importance of considering the specific atmospheric condition and composition of a city when formulating its environmental policies.","[Yim, Steve Hung Lam; Wang, Mengya; Gu, Yefu] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yim, Steve Hung Lam; Yang, Yuanjian] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Environm Energy & Sustainabil, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yim, Steve Hung Lam] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Stanley Ho Big Data Decis Analyt Res Ctr, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuanjian] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Phys, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Dong, Guanghui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou Key Lab Environm Pollut & Hlth Risk Ass, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Dong, Guanghui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Prevent Med, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Dong, Guanghui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Qingxiang] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Informat Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Qingxiang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Engn Technol Res Ctr Environm Poll, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; China Meteorological Administration; Sun Yat Sen University,"Yim, SHL (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Yim, SHL (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Environm Energy & Sustainabil, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Yim, SHL (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Stanley Ho Big Data Decis Analyt Res Ctr, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",steveyim@cuhk.edu.hk,"Li, Qingxiang/AAN-5841-2020; Dong, Guanghui/AAN-4630-2020; Li, Qingxiang/G-3834-2013; Yang, Yuan-Jian/AAR-2465-2021; yang, yang/HGT-7999-2022; , LQ/AAP-2047-2020; yang, yang/GWB-9426-2022; Yang, Yuanjian/AAC-7494-2020","Li, Qingxiang/0000-0002-1424-4108; Yang, Yuan-Jian/0000-0003-3486-6286; , LQ/0000-0002-1424-4108; Dong, Guang-Hui/0000-0002-2578-3369; GU, Yefu/0000-0002-3370-3971",Vice-Chancellor's Discretionary Fund of The Chinese University of Hong Kong [4930744]; Early Career Scheme of Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [ECS-24301415]; Focused Innovations Scheme of The Chinese University of Hong Kong [1907001]; Environment and Conservation Fund (ECF project) [07/2014],Vice-Chancellor's Discretionary Fund of The Chinese University of Hong Kong; Early Career Scheme of Research Grants Council of Hong Kong; Focused Innovations Scheme of The Chinese University of Hong Kong; Environment and Conservation Fund (ECF project),"This work was jointly funded by The Vice-Chancellor's Discretionary Fund of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Grant 4930744), the Early Career Scheme of Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (Grant ECS-24301415), the Focused Innovations Scheme of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (project 1907001), and the Environment and Conservation Fund (ECF project 07/2014).

CASE STUDY IN THE BASQUE COUNTRY,DYNA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate Change; Adaptation to Climate Change; Energy Demand; Energy Economics,WORLD MAP; TEMPERATURE; IMPACTS; LEVEL,"This article analyzes the sensitivity of electricity demand by sector to temperature, in the context of climate change. The paper outlines a methodology to incorporate climate variables into energy decision making. This methodology is based on the evolution of the thermal distance on cold and warm days with respect to established thresholds (Heating Degree Days and Cooling Degree Days) and its influence on demand. This approach has been tested in the Basque Country. Results show that the residential sector is the most sensitive to these changes, and future demand is projected according to multiple climate change scenarios. Due to the greater statistical significance of temperature differences on cold days, and the current limited use of air conditioning, it is estimated that residential demand could fall by as much as 4%, which could translate to nearly 20 million euros in annual savings and emission reductions of around 30,000 t. of CO2 per year.","[Solaun, Kepa] Univ Navarra, Sch Sci, Pamplona Campus, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Solaun, Kepa] Factor CO2, Colon Larreategui 26,1 Floor, Bilbao 48009, Spain; [Cerda, Emilio] Univ Complutense Madrid, Complutense Inst Int Studies ICEI, Somosaguas Campus, Madrid 28223, Spain",University of Navarra; Complutense University of Madrid,"Solaun, K (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Sch Sci, Pamplona Campus, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain.;Solaun, K (corresponding author), Factor CO2, Colon Larreategui 26,1 Floor, Bilbao 48009, Spain.",ksolaun@factorco2.com; ecerdate@ccee.ucm.es,,,,,,,40,1,1,2,6,FEDERACION ASOCIACIONES INGENIEROS INDUSTRIALES ESPANA,BILBAO,"ALAMEDA DE MAZARREDO, BILBAO, 69-48009, SPAIN",0012-7361,1989-1490,,DYNA-BILBAO,Dyna,MAR,2020,95,2,,,,,163,+,,10.6036/9344,http://dx.doi.org/10.6036/9344,,,15,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,KS6BF,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000518391500018,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this context, it is important to perform vulnerability assessments in order to understand how this infrastructure may be at risk, and, if necessary, adapt and maintain functionality of infrastructure systems. This study investigates the vulnerability of the wastewater collection and disposal infrastructure (i.e. pipelines and manholes, pumping stations and wastewater treatment plants) to sea-level rise in eThekwini Municipality, South Africa. By using geographical information systems (GIS) and a multi-criteria analysis considering elevation, operational capacity and connectivity, a scale of vulnerability was established and the most vulnerable infrastructural elements were identified in the municipality. These should be prioritised for detailed monitoring and adaptive interventions in order to maintain the functionality of the wastewater system as sea level is predicted to rise.

However, these technical fixes may ultimately prove to be dangerous shortcuts that do little to address the concerns of irrigators, Indigenous People, environmental groups, and local communities about water scarcity, access, security, and sustainability. In the absence of transparent and rigorous governance safeguards, irrigation efficiency upgrades can result in higher water consumption, demand, and ultimately, increased water scarcity. Upgraded irrigation systems also tend to capture return flows and redistribute them to high value consumptive water uses, potentially displacing other users and uses, including Indigenous Peoples. In this article, we critique current approaches to governing irrigation efficiency, using a water justice lens to identify four key insights and their implications for governance.

Yet there remains a startling lack of international agreement on how to address the issue. This article examines the problem climate change-related migration poses in terms of international responsibility and provides a review of two approaches to addressing this challenge. First, the idea that migration in the context of climate change requires the development of a new international protection agreement and, second, the argument that migration should be managed and mitigated through in situ adaptation and development programmes These approaches differ in terms of how they understand the relationship between migration and climate change and thus differ also in terms of how they situate responsibility and address issues of climate justice. This paper explores these differences and outlines the benefits and challenges of both. Following this, we turn to the case of New Zealand's immigration tribunal appeals involving claims for climate-refugee status and look at how in situ adaptation, development narratives and arbitrary risk thresholds have been used to legitimise the denial of these claims. Throughout the article, we ask to what extent these approaches acknowledge climate justice, and we conclude by looking at ways that climate (mobility) justice might be better incorporated into solutions that prioritise the needs of migrants in the context of rapid climate change.","[Neef, Andreas; Benge, Lucy] Univ Auckland, Sch Social Sci, Dev Studies, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Neef, A (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Social Sci, Dev Studies, Auckland, New Zealand.",a.neef@auckland.ac.nz; lucyalicebenge@gmail.com,"Neef, Andreas/F-6102-2010","Neef, Andreas/0000-0002-5079-3323",CAUL; Worldwide Universities Network (WUN); Royal Society of New Zealand [19-UOA-036-FRG],CAUL; Worldwide Universities Network (WUN); Royal Society of New Zealand(Royal Society of New Zealand),"Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions The research for this article was made possible by a Research Development Fund grant from the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN) for the project 'Climate-Induced Migration: Global Scope, Regional Impacts and National Policy Frameworks' and a Royal Society of New Zealand Catalyst: Seeding grant for the project entitled 'International Climate Migration and Climatic Poverty Traps in the Asia-Pacific Region' (19-UOA-036-FRG).",,78,1,1,5,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Anthropogenic climate change has increased the intensity, frequency and duration of heatwaves over Australia in the past several decades and these trends are projected to worsen in the future. Despite the strong knowledge of heatwave characteristics and their projected changes, there remains a gap in understanding how the Australian population will be exposed to future heatwaves. This study estimates changes in future exposure to heatwaves over Australia. We find that both for continental Australia and its capital cities, the trends in exposure are not projected to increase, but accelerate in the future. For RCP4.5-SSP2 and RCP8.5-SSP5 scenarios, the mean exposure to heatwaves in Australia is projected to increase by similar to 29 and similar to 42 times by the end of 21st century. Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide are the major cities where the population is most exposed to future heatwaves, with this exposure projected to increase by 52, 61, and 56 times respectively under the RCP8.5-SSP5 scenario. The results demonstrate that anthropogenic climate change is the key contributor (over 95%) in enhancing future heatwave exposure and population change on its own plays a relatively minor role (less than 5%). The results of this study are crucial for planning where adaptation measures might be necessary to protect large group of vulnerable Australians to future heatwave exposure.","[Nishant, Nidhi; Ji, Fei; Di Virgilio, Giovanni; Riley, Matthew L.] NSW Dept Planning Ind & Environm, Sci Econ & Insights Div, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Nishant, Nidhi; Green, Donna; Di Virgilio, Giovanni] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Nishant, Nidhi; Ji, Fei; Green, Donna; Di Virgilio, Giovanni; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah] Univ New South Wales, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Guo, Yuming] Monash Univ, Air Qual Res Unit, Climate, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Herold, Nicholas] Appl Climate Sci Pty Ltd, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Beyer, Kathleen] Univ Tasmania, Climate Futures Res Grp, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah] UNSW Canberra, Sch Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Monash University; University of Tasmania; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Nishant, N (corresponding author), NSW Dept Planning Ind & Environm, Sci Econ & Insights Div, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Nishant, N (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Nishant, N (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",n.nidhi@unsw.edu.au,"Guo, Yuming/I-8353-2018; Riley, Matthew/K-9038-2018","Guo, Yuming/0000-0002-1766-6592; Riley, Matthew/0000-0002-9181-782X; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah/0000-0001-9443-4915","NSW Climate Change Fund through NSW/ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project; Australian Research Council [DP210102076, CE170100023, FT170100106]; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [APP2000581]; Australian Commonwealth Government; Career Fellowship of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [APP1163693]; Australian Research Council [FT170100106] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",NSW Climate Change Fund through NSW/ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Australian Commonwealth Government(Australian Government); Career Fellowship of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This work is made possible by funding from the NSW Climate Change Fund through NSW/ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project, Australian Research Council (DP210102076; CE170100023; FT170100106), and Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (APP2000581).

Focusing on the highly climate-affected north-eastern floodplain region of Bangladesh, this paper presents the results of a literature synthesis supported by primary field data to identify how existing policy barriers can threaten institutional responses to climate change impacts, while institutional rigidity and the non-inclusiveness of bureaucratic polity work to undermine efficiency, effectiveness, and equitabilitysome important considerations for sustainable adaptation.

We explore China's options for introducing and implementing adaptation policies that link with farmer strategies to respond more effectively to water stresses induced by climate change and other forces.","[Su, Yufang; Xu, Jianchu; Wilkes, Andy; Lu, Juliet; Li, Qiaohong; Ma, Xing] World Agroforestry Ctr, Heilongtan 650204, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Su, Yufang] Yunnan Acad Social Sci, Inst Econ, Kunming 650034, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jianchu; Li, Qiaohong; Fu, Yao; Grumbine, R.

Saltwater intrusion from sea level rise converts freshwater-dependent coastal forests to more salt-tolerant marshes, leaving 'ghost forests' of standing dead trees behind. Although recent research has investigated the drivers and rates of coastal forest decline, the associated changes in carbon storage across large extents have not been quantified. We mapped ghost forest spread across coastal North Carolina, USA, using repeat Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys, multi-temporal satellite imagery, and field measurements of aboveground biomass to quantify changes in aboveground carbon. Between 2001 and 2014, 15% (167 km(2)) of unmanaged public land in the region changed from coastal forest to transition-ghost forest characterized by salt-tolerant shrubs and herbaceous plants. Salinity and proximity to the estuarine shoreline were significant drivers of these changes. This conversion resulted in a net aboveground carbon decline of 0.13 +/- 0.01 TgC. Because saltwater intrusion precedes inundation and influences vegetation condition in advance of mature tree mortality, we suggest that aboveground carbon declines can be used to detect the leading edge of sea level rise. Aboveground carbon declines along the shoreline were offset by inland aboveground carbon gains associated with natural succession and forestry activities like planting (2.46 +/- 0.25 TgC net aboveground carbon across study area). Our study highlights the combined effects of saltwater intrusion and land use on aboveground carbon dynamics of temperate coastal forests in North America. By quantifying the effects of multiple interacting disturbances, our measurement and mapping methods should be applicable to other coastal landscapes experiencing saltwater intrusion. As sea level rise increases the landward extent of inundation and saltwater exposure, investigations at these large scales are requisite for effective resource allocation for climate adaptation. In this changing environment, human intervention, whether through land preservation, restoration, or reforestation, may be necessary to prevent aboveground carbon loss.","[Smart, Lindsey S.; Vukomanovic, Jelena; Mitasova, Helena; Meentemeyer, Ross K.] North Carolina State Univ, Ctr Geospatial Analyt, 2800 Faucette Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Taillie, Paul J.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Poulter, Benjamin] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Biospher Sci Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Vukomanovic, Jelena] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Parks Recreat & Tourism Management, 2800 Faucette Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Singh, Kunwar K.] Coll William & Mary, Inst Global Res, AidData, 424 Scotland St, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Singh, Kunwar K.] Coll William & Mary, Ctr Geospatial Anal, 400 Landrum Dr, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Swenson, Jennifer J.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, 9 Circuit Dr, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Mitasova, Helena] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, 2800 Faucette Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Smith, Jordan W.] Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, 5215 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Meentemeyer, Ross K.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, 2800 Faucette Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; North Carolina State University; William & Mary; William & Mary; Duke University; North Carolina State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; North Carolina State University,"Smart, LS (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Ctr Geospatial Analyt, 2800 Faucette Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",lssmart@ncsu.edu,"Smith, Jordan/AAR-9126-2021; Poulter, Ben/ABB-5886-2021; Smith, Jordan/GVU-3480-2022; Singh, Kunwar/K-4432-2017","Poulter, Ben/0000-0002-9493-8600; Taillie, Paul/0000-0001-7172-3589; VUKOMANOVIC, JELENA/0000-0001-6477-6551; Singh, Kunwar/0000-0002-9788-1822; Smith, Jordan/0000-0001-7036-4887; Swenson, Jennifer J./0000-0002-2069-667X; Mitasova, Helena/0000-0002-6906-3398; Smart, Lindsey/0000-0002-1366-6528","NOAA's North Carolina Sea Grant Program; NASA's North Carolina Space Grant Program [NA14OAR4170073, NNX15AH81H]; College of Natural Resources Innovation Grant at NC State University; NASA [NNX15AH81H, 804889] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",NOAA's North Carolina Sea Grant Program; NASA's North Carolina Space Grant Program; College of Natural Resources Innovation Grant at NC State University; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This research was funded by a joint fellowship through NOAA's North Carolina Sea Grant Program and NASA's North Carolina Space Grant Program (NOAA award #NA14OAR4170073, NASA award #NNX15AH81H).

In general, arable and ex arable lands are used for this type of water storage. However, inundation may lead to problems, as excess phosphorus (P) stored in these soils may be released and result in the eutrophication of the overlying surface waters. Clearly, water and nature managers need to be able to determine for which areas temporary water storage would be a feasible option without causing eutrophication problems. Here, using a controlled experimental approach, a simple predictive tool for the P mobilization rates from soils upon short-term inundation has been developed. A large suite of soil characteristics and P mobilization rates were determined during flooding for different soil types (peat and sand), at two different depths to mimic topsoil removal (topsoils and soils from -30 to -60 cm below ground level), and at two temperatures to test seasonal influence (8 degrees C and 18 degrees C). Increasing the temperature from 8 to 18 degrees C almost tripled P mobilization rates, but the variation could not be linked to any of the soil characteristics measured - average Q(10) (temperature coefficient) values were 2.8 (2.9 for peaty soils, 2.6 for sandy soils). Although P mobilization was related to P saturation of amorphic Fe, water-extractable P was found to be by far the best predictor for short-term P mobilization rates, explaining 86.9% of the variation. The predictive tool for P mobilization after short-term rewetting is simple, low-cost and widely applicable, and can support water managers during their decision-making processes concerning the optimal location for the construction of water storage areas, the restoration of riparian wetlands, and the combinational use of different ecosystem services.

Vulnerability assessments provide the basis for developing strategies to reduce social vulnerability and plan for climate adaptation. Primary industries have been identified as the most vulnerable industry sector globally. We review how primary producers might be socially vulnerable to climate change and develop a 'vulnerability typology' of cattle producers based on survey responses from 240 producers across northern Australia. We measured social vulnerability according to ten indicators of climate sensitivity (resource dependency) and four indicators of adaptive capacity. Using a K-means clustering analysis we identified four main types' of cattle producers. Type 1 producers (43%) were vulnerable because they had low strategic skills and low interest in changing behaviour. Mean age was 59 years old, they were weakly networked within the industry and businesses were small. Type II producers (41%) had low strategic skills, poorly managed risk and uncertainty, had medium sized businesses and were 51 years old on average. Only 16% of producers (Type III and IV) appeared to have resilience to change. Type III producers (13.4%) had a stronger psychological and financial buffer, were 52 years old on average, were well networked and managed or owned larger businesses. Type IV producers (2.6%) managed risk well, liked to experiment with options and were interested in change. They were 41 years old on average, managed extremely large properties, were well networked, perceived themselves as responsible for the future productivity of their land and were early adopters of new technology. By providing knowledge of the different ways in which people can be vulnerable to climate change, vulnerability assessments can enable decision-makers to prioritise their efforts, provide a basis for early engagement, and tailor a range of adaptation approaches to most effectively accommodate and support the divergent requirements of different types of resource-users.

To provide these, regional atmospheric models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, need to be optimized in their physical setup to the region of interest. The objective of this study is to evaluate four cumulus physics (CU), two microphysics (MP), two planetary boundary layer physics (PBL), and two radiation physics (RA) schemes in WRF according to their performance in dynamically downscaling the precipitation over two typical South American regions: one orographically complex area in Ecuador/Peru (horizontal resolution up to 9 and 3 km), and one area of rolling hills in Northeast Brazil (up to 9 km). For this, an extensive ensemble of 32 simulations over two continuous years was conducted. Including the reference uncertainty of three high-resolution global datasets (CHIRPS, MSWEP, ERA5-Land), we show that different parameterization setups can produce up to four times the monthly reference precipitation. This underscores the urgent need to conduct parameterization sensitivity studies before weather forecasts or input for impact modeling can be produced. Contrarily to usual studies, we focus on distributional, temporal and spatial precipitation patterns and evaluate these in an ensemble-tailored approach. These ensemble characteristics such as ensemble Structure-, Amplitude-, and Location-error, allow us to generalize the impacts of combining one parameterization scheme with others. We find that varying the CU and RA schemes stronger affects the WRF performance than varying the MP or PBL schemes. This effect is even present in the convection-resolving 3-km-domain over Ecuador/Peru where CU schemes are only used in the parent domain of the one-way nesting approach. The G3D CU physics ensemble best represents the CHIRPS probability distribution in the 9-km-domains. However, spatial and temporal patterns of CHIRPS are best captured by Tiedtke or BMJ CU schemes. Ecuadorian station data in the 3-km-domain is best simulated by the ensemble whose parent domains use the KF CU scheme. Accounting for all evaluation metrics, no general-purpose setup could be identified, but suited parameterizations can be narrowed down according to final application needs.","[Portele, Tanja C.; Laux, Patrick; Lorenz, Christof; Fersch, Benjamin; Kunstmann, Harald] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, Campus Alpin, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Portele, Tanja C.; Laux, Patrick; Kunstmann, Harald] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Augsburg, Germany; [Janner, Annelie] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany; [Horna, Natalia; Iza, Maylee] Inst Nacl Meteorol & Hidrol, Direcc Estudios Invest & Desarrollo Hidrometeorol, Quito, Ecuador",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Augsburg; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Portele, TC (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, Campus Alpin, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.;Portele, TC (corresponding author), Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Augsburg, Germany.",tanja.portele@kit.edu,"Laux, Patrick/A-7671-2013; Kunstmann, Harald/A-7071-2013","Laux, Patrick/0000-0002-8657-6152; Kunstmann, Harald/0000-0001-9573-1743; Iza Wong, Angela Maylee/0000-0001-5280-1035; Lorenz, Christof/0000-0001-5590-5470; Portele, Tanja Christina/0000-0001-9436-710X",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [02WGR1421],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was supported by the funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for the SaWaM project (Seasonal Water Resources Management: Regionalized Global Data and Transfer to Practice) under the financial assistance agreement No 02WGR1421.,,70,1,1,0,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

Inner Peripheries are fragile territories covering rural Europe, which suffer from depopulation, low economic potential, and weak territorial cohesion. However, these territories are extremely important for the provision of goods and services, and the stewardship of natural and semi-natural environments. Such dichotomous condition poses several challenges for planning in the EU context, particularly regarding the implementation of the Rural Development Policy. Therefore, current planning needs to contextualize the policy implementation by considering local needs and territorial resources in the Inner Peripheries. With a focus on the Italian case, the main aim of the present work is to explore to what extent Inner Peripheries cope with Rural Development targets, in the light of improving the effectiveness of planning interventions. We create and implement a set of context indicators to describe the Inner Peripheries' territorial characteristics through fine scale analyses and test their alignment with the Rural Development Policy through ANOVA and PCA. The results show that the indicators' set is significant and robust in depicting the current territorial potentialities and limitations of the Inner Peripheries towards strengthening rural development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Inner Peripheries exhibit alignments and misalignments with rural development targets, depending on localities, and exogenous and endogenous characteristics. We find that the Inner Peripheries in Italy need to develop holistic strategies incorporating different Rural Development Priorities, such as increased competitiveness in agriculture and forestry sectors, sustainable use of resources and climate adaptation, which may also contribute to foster territorial cohesion. We argue that strategies with less consideration of environmental and social aspects may be counterproductive for the local development in Inner Peripheries. Performing an ex-ante assessment of the main characteristics of the Inner Peripheries through e.g. the use of the indicators' framework as proposed, may support the decision-making processes in selecting planning priorities. Considering the large replicability and comparability of the indicators' set, the findings of the present study are useful to further understand how rural development is considered in territorial strategies for Inner Peripheries in similar contexts in Europe.","[De Toni, Andrea; Di Febbraro, Mirko; Lasserre, Bruno; Di Martino, Paolo] Univ Molise, Dipartimento Biosci & Terr, Pesche, Isernia, Italy; [De Toni, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture & Urban Studies, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Vizzarri, Matteo] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Ispra, Italy; [Noguera, Joan] Univ Valencia, Inst Local Dev, Valencia, Spain",University of Molise; Polytechnic University of Milan; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Valencia,"De Toni, A (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture & Urban Studies, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",andrea.detoni@polimi.it; matteo.vizzarri@ec.europa.eu; mirko.difebbraro@unimol.it; lasserre@unimol.it; joan.noguera@uv.es; dimartin@unimol.it,"Vizzarri, Matteo/H-9544-2019; De Toni, Andrea/AAT-2273-2020; Di Febbraro, Mirko/GQA-4462-2022; Di Febbraro, Mirko/I-3167-2019; Lasserre, Bruno/G-1409-2011","Vizzarri, Matteo/0000-0002-9505-783X; De Toni, Andrea/0000-0002-3573-7585; Lasserre, Bruno/0000-0003-1150-8064; Di Febbraro, Mirko/0000-0001-8898-7046; Di Martino, Paolo/0000-0001-8853-7520",,,,,113,9,9,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,JAN,2021,100,,,,,,,,104899,10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104899,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104899,,,14,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PF2ZP,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000598929300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

To achieve a step-change in food production and climate adaptation, livelihoods must rapidly transform. Food security programs continue to apply the pipeline model of scaling-out technological innovations, but do not account for the social-ecological complexity of islands. We tested the feasibility of scaling-out adaptation strategies in two provinces in the region: Nusa Tenggara Barat in Indonesia, and West New Britain in Papua New Guinea. Guided by a sub-district typology of resource use, we trialled a participatory, systems-based livelihood adaptation pathways approach in sub-district case studies. The process aimed to mainstream social learning and future uncertainty into community development decision-making, yielding 'no regrets' adaptation strategies to transform livelihoods. We tested two assumptions: first, that because the contexts of all villages were homogenous, strategies were sufficiently similar to enable scaling-out across the provinces; second, that the sub-district typologies would assist scaling-out within each type. The results showed that the first assumption was untenable: there was very little similarity amongst villages' strategies; only sustainable fisheries management was scalable amongst coastal villages. The second was marginally tenable, because there were strong similarities amongst villages in an off-shore island type. When pooled into classes of adaptation strategy, most related to practice and behaviour change, and addressed systemic social issues; very few were technological. Our results suggest that scaling-out livelihood and food system innovations is not feasible due to the complex social-ecological contexts within islands, caused by steep climate gradients, natural resource and cultural diversity. We discuss the limitations of a resource use typology that aimed to mitigate this complexity and guide scaling-out. Instead we argue that appropriate social learning approaches akin to livelihood adaptation pathways must be mainstreamed into existing community development decision cycles, thereby scaling-up and scaling-deep to tackle institutional, political and cultural barriers to transformation. We discuss the implications of our recommendations for government and donor support for food security programs in islands of the Asia-Pacific region, and future research priorities.","[Butler, James R.

Within centralised governments, climate action becomes challenging. Moreover, in developing countries, development needs are usually prioritised, while climate action is viewed as an unaffordable luxury. In a centralised, middle-income country like Egypt, climate action is a challenge for all government levels. This research investigates the current state and the prospect of urban climate change governance on the subnational level in Egypt. A twofold methodology is used. First, through desk research, a comprehensive list of urban climate governance enabling factors was extracted. The list was used to assess the practices of 3 international case studies (Delhi, Durban, and Amman) and then refined and used to assess the first subnational level climate change strategy in Egypt. Second, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a few selected experts working on climate change and urban policies in Egypt. Two sets of recommendations were formulated to expedite urban climate change governance in Egypt, especially on the subnational and local levels. While the research focuses on Egypt, the methodology and recommendations could be adopted and adapted by local governments functioning within centralised systems.","[Yara, Eissa; Essam, Khalil Heba Allah E.] Cairo Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Architecture, 1 Gamaa St, Giza 12613, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Yara, E (corresponding author), Cairo Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Architecture, 1 Gamaa St, Giza 12613, Egypt.",eissayara@gmail.com; hebakhalil@eng.cu.edu.eg,"Khalil, Heba Essam E./ABI-5738-2020","Khalil, Heba Essam E./0000-0002-8994-6286",,,,,35,2,2,0,4,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1015-3802,1874-6330,,URBAN FORUM,Urban Forum,JUN,2022,33,2,,,,,197,221,,10.1007/s12132-021-09441-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12132-021-09441-9,,SEP 2021,25,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,1U7JP,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000695801400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Findings indicate that efforts toward adaptation were limited to disaster preparedness for hurricanes, reflecting a short-term focus in the face of climate change uncertainties. In addition to the lack of finances and knowledge for incorporating adaptation measures, their capacity to adapt is diminished due to a lack of access to climate change information, skilled staff, and specific climate change planning reflecting limited human and institutional capitals.

Yet, to date very few frameworks are formulated with a robust impact assessment in mind. This study uses the Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) research design to develop the BACI Adaptation Impact Evaluation Framework. The framework compares participating and non-participating households across time and was applied to panel data of 291 households, combined with ethnographic data, to evaluate the impacts of one of the Global Climate Change Alliance's (GCCA+) flagship adaptation and resilience projects in Tanzania. The results illustrate various benefits of the project, including strengthening social networks, providing education and diversifying information sources among the participating households. However, evidence of unintended consequences and maladaptation also exist, particularly among poorer non-participating households. We conclude that equitable adaptation requires longer projects that better target poorer households, engage with a broader array of climatic events, support the transfer of knowledge into action, and are more responsive to emergent trade-offs, ensuring that unintended impacts are minimized. The paper demonstrates how the application of the BACI Adaptation Impact Evaluation Framework provides a robust tool to assess the impacts of adaptation interventions.","[Gaworek-Michalczenia, M.

Adaptation pathways, for example, are increasingly used to identify and evaluate adaptation options against a range of plausible futures. The process is applied to both large-scale infrastructure and investment decisions, as well as smaller-scale, sub-national issues associated in part, with climate change impacts and implications. Consequently, pathways are being developed in the context of multiple contested values, competing with other, more immediate, non-climate-related or indirectly related planning processes, such as freshwater management, community resilience and wellbeing, and biodiversity conservation. In this Short Communication we reflect specifically on place-based adaptation pathways constructed, presented, and implemented within limited budgets and without recourse to resourceintensive research capacities. We emphasise the need to meet criteria for local credibility, legitimacy, and relevance. Specifically, we suggest there is a need to accommodate the complexities of local conditions; establish affordable and accessible processes; and build technical and participatory capability. These considerations may assist with co-creating place-based pathways and incorporate a wider range of complex issues both political and contextual with multiple constituencies including, as necessary, where science itself is increasingly questioned or disregarded. In turn this might lead to sets of country specific, nested local hierarchical adaptation options developed through pluralist approaches.","[Cradock-Henry, Nicholas A.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Landscape Policy & Governance, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Frame, Bob] Univ Canterbury, Gateway Antarctica, Christchurch, New Zealand",Landcare Research - New Zealand; University of Canterbury,"Cradock-Henry, NA (corresponding author), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Landscape Policy & Governance, Lincoln, New Zealand.",cradockhenryn@landcareresearch.co.nz; research@frameworks.nz,,"Cradock-Henry, Nicholas/0000-0002-4409-9976",New Zealand Ministry of Business and Innovation's Resilience to Nature's Challenges National Science Challenge 'Resilience in Practice Model'; Ministry for Primary Industries through the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change (SLMACC) programme,New Zealand Ministry of Business and Innovation's Resilience to Nature's Challenges National Science Challenge 'Resilience in Practice Model'; Ministry for Primary Industries through the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change (SLMACC) programme,"This research was funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Business and Innovation's Resilience to Nature's Challenges National Science Challenge 'Resilience in Practice Model', and the Ministry for Primary Industries through the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change (SLMACC) programme.",,81,9,9,2,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

The research compared the actions taken by communities that had engaged in a mid- to long-term DRR program with those that had not. The DRR program prioritised disability inclusion and women's participation in, and leadership of, the community. Early warnings were widely heard across all communities but the communities that had engaged with the DRR program had greater understanding of, and trust in, the early warnings. They took earlier and more coordinated action and were safer during the cyclone. Compared with their past experiences, there was increased respect for women's voices and roles, women and men collaborated more, and people with disability were supported by the whole community. The research concludes that tropical cyclone early warnings are necessary but not sufficient to ensure there is community and household preparation.

The research explores the role of culture and local politics, and differences among various age and gender groups within the community regarding preferred adaptation pathways for coping with the impacts of future sea-level rise. A participatory action approach, in the form of a community workshop, was employed, which separated participants into community identified groupings. Differences in community groups' adaptation preferences emerged, though the range of adaptation measures considered were limited, probably due to the participants' limited exposure to adaptation mechanisms in their immediate surroundings. Overall, the communities surveyed tended to be conservative, especially in their attitudes towards western adaptation solutions developed in non-island contexts.","[Crichton, Richard Nathan; Onuki, Motoharu] Univ Tokyo, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778563, Japan; [Esteban, Miguel] Waseda Univ 60 106, Shinjuku Ku, 3-4-1 Okubo, Tokyo 1698555, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Crichton, RN (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778563, Japan.",crichton.richard@gmail.com,,,"Japanese Ministry of Education, Monbukagakusho; University of Tokyo, Graduate School of Frontier Science; Graduate Program in Sustainability Science - Global Leadership Program","Japanese Ministry of Education, Monbukagakusho; University of Tokyo, Graduate School of Frontier Science; Graduate Program in Sustainability Science - Global Leadership Program","A part of the present work was performed as a part of activities of The Research Institute of Sustainable Future Society, Waseda Research Institute for Science and Engineering, Waseda University.

Yet, given the current and future complex large-scale challenges like climate change, such responses are increasingly inadequate. Calls are now made for societies to implement transformative approaches in order to manage complex problems in a more sustainable and adaptive manner. However, the discussion around transformative change is still emerging and it is not clear as to what transformation means, how it can be evaluated, and how the conceptions of transformation fit within the current understanding of dealing with policy problems in practice. This paper explores the range of current understandings on transformation and its characteristics, and uses Handmer and Dovers' (2007, 2009, 2013) three-staged typology to investigate different approaches to identifying and managing policy problems and the potential scope for transformation. Examples from policy and practice within disaster risk management are used to demonstrate how different management approaches attempt to deal with particular problems and to investigate to what extent these could be transformative. It is argued that not all transformation is positive and welcome, and that greater focus needs to be placed on how complex problems are managed in a manner that enables long-term positive transformation.

Design/methodology/approach The paper analyses content of scientific journals produced by the not-for-profit Kyushu Environmental Evaluation Association in Fukuoka since the 1970s. The aim is to evaluate the shifting understanding and conception of a liveable urban environment within Fukuoka over time and assess how this narrative has informed capability to understand and manage extreme heat as an emergent disaster risk. Findings The strong technical competences enabling Fukuoka to undertake evidence-based management of risks from climate-related disasters today exist at least partially because of earlier environmental concerns within the city and an early emergence of techno-scientific competence within the city's research institutions working at the science-policy interface. Originality/value The findings suggest a need to avoid uncritically exporting lessons from apparent urban climate success stories, without full recognition of the historical context enabling production and utilisation of weather and climate knowledge in specific locations.","[Mabon, Leslie] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban, Argyll, Scotland",UHI Millennium Institute,"Mabon, L (corresponding author), Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban, Argyll, Scotland.",leslie.mabon@sams.ac.uk,,"Mabon, Leslie/0000-0003-2646-6119",,,,,52,0,0,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0965-3562,1758-6100,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

Knowledge integration is one of the most important challenges of transdisciplinary research. This article exemplifies the process of transdisciplinary knowledge integration using a case study on water sensitive urban planning that aims at implementing strategies to protect urban living areas and infrastructure from flooding due to heavy precipitations. Five steps can be identified to characterize the process of knowledge integration to develop a concept of water sensitive urban planning. The results show that increasing torrential rains cannot be handled by conventional measures applied separately, but by a combination of measures. Finally, the process of knowledge integration is evaluated in respect to central analytical dimensions in the philosophy of science.","Fachhsch Dortmund, Fachbereich Angew Sozialwissensch, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany",,"Hunecke, M (corresponding author), Fachhsch Dortmund, Fachbereich Angew Sozialwissensch, Emil Figge Str 44, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",marcel.hunecke@fh-dortmund.de,,,,,,,24,5,5,1,27,OEKOM VERLAG,MUNICH,"WALTHERSTR 29, MUNICH, 80337, GERMANY",0940-5550,,,GAIA,GAIA,,2011,20,2,,,,,104,111,,10.14512/gaia.20.2.7,http://dx.doi.org/10.14512/gaia.20.2.7,,,8,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,792PC,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000292758000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Identifying management actions for climate adaptation requires an understanding of how wildlife (i) might vary in their response to habitat conditions across their range and (ii) the spatial scale of environmental effects. We quantified breeding habitat use of the Interior population of Band-tailed Pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata) in the Southwestern U.S. by analyzing data from satellite-tagged birds with a resource selection function. We used Reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) to quantify habitat use of Band-tailed Pigeons across vegetation, topography, and precipitation, examining the possibility for differences in habitat selection and estimated the most ecologically relevant spatio-temporal scale for these habitat features (i.e., the optimal scale of effect). Our RJMCMC results indicated that Band-tailed Pigeon intensity of use was characterized by precipitation x conifer cover and precipitation x basal area interactions. In drier areas, Band-tailed Pigeons were more likely to use areas with more conifer cover; as precipitation increased, Band-tailed Pigeons were more likely to use areas with less conifer cover. Increased precipitation facilitated greater use of forests with higher basal area, and drier areas were associated with use of forests with lower basal area. Conifer cover was primarily selected at the 1 km scale, and basal area was selected at the 2 km scale in response to precipitation during the winter preceding the breeding season. Although Band-tailed Pigeons have long been known to associate with conifer forests, we found that their use of conifer forest varied across a gradient of precipitation. Using our approach to select the scale of effect for forest habitat and basal area in response to changes in precipitation can provide more precise, spatially relevant habitat management recommendations than approaches using model selection such as Akaike's Information Criterion.","[Ross, Beth E.; Boggie, Matthew A.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Sci Applicat, Albuquerque, NM 87102 USA; [Collins, Daniel P.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Div Migratory Birds, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Coxen, Christopher] RTI Int, Ctr Data Sci, Raleigh, NC USA; [Carleton, Scott] Natl Pk Serv, Nat Resource Stewardship & Sci Directorate, Omaha, NE USA; [Jones, Gavin M.] US Dept Agr, Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Jones, Gavin M.] Univ New Mex, Biol Dept, Albuquerque, NM USA",United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; Research Triangle Institute; United States Department of the Interior; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Ross, BE (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Sci Applicat, Albuquerque, NM 87102 USA.",beth_ross@fws.gov,,"Collins, Dan/0000-0003-1113-4736; Coxen, Christopher/0000-0002-7894-0639",U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Region 2 Migratory Birds Program; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Webless Migratory Game Bird Program; New Mexico Department of Game and Fish,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Region 2 Migratory Birds Program; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Webless Migratory Game Bird Program; New Mexico Department of Game and Fish,"We would like to thank USDA FS biologists (Leslie Hay, Jerry Monzingo, Andre Silva, and Rhonda Stewart) for their insights on forest management in New Mexico and S. and J.

Particularly, extreme weather events (e.g. heavy precipitations), together with changing exposure and vulnerability patterns, are expected to increase the damaging effect of storms, pluvial floods and coastal flooding. Developing climate and adaptation services for local planners and decision makers is becoming essential to transfer and communicate sound scientific knowledge about climate related risks and foster the development of national, regional and local adaptation strategies. In order to analyze the effect of climate change on pluvial flood risk and advice adaptation planning, a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology was developed and applied to the urban territory of the municipality of Venice. Based on the integrated analysis of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk, RRA allows identifying and prioritizing targets and sub -areas that are more likely to be affected by pluvial flood risk due to heavy precipitation events in the future scenario 2041-2050. From the early stages of its development and application, the RRA followed a bottom-up approach taking into account the requests, knowledge and perspectives of local stakeholders of the North Adriatic region by means of interactive workshops, surveys and discussions. Results of the analysis showed that all targets (i.e. residential, commercial -industrial areas and infrastructures) are vulnerable to pluvial floods due to the high impermeability and low slope of the topography. The spatial pattern of risk mostly reflects the distribution of the hazard and the districts with the higher percentage of receptors' surface in the higher risk classes (i.e. very high, high and medium) are Lido-Pellestrina and Marghera. The paper discusses how risk -based maps and statistics integrate scientific and local knowledge with the final aim to mainstream climate adaptation in the development of risk mitigation and urban plans.

Although semi-arid regions have always been dry, human activities and climate change are acerbating the problem. In Chinese Yellow River basin, the river is the major source of freshwater for those living there, and they have long suffered from serious water shortages. However, increasing population and decreasing streamflow are making these shortages more acute. This study seeks to quantify changes in available water in the Yellow River basin over the last 100 years and attempts to determine causes for these changes. To do this, the study evaluated changing trends and regime shifts of streamflow using long term historical records at different hydrological stations in the Yellow River basin over the past century. The results show that annual streamflow has a significant decreasing trends (P < 0.01) in the mid-lower reaches of the basin. Streamflow decomposition by the breaks for additive seasonal and trend approach suggest that this trend can be decomposed into four distinct annual stages (1919-1933, 1934-1969, 1970-1986 and 1987-2011), while the seasonal component demonstrated an evident regime shift in 1986. This regime shift is mainly related to the construction of large reservoirs in the basin. The flow duration curves illustrate a decrease in the magnitude of streamflow over the last century with a relatively uniform flow regime at all stations. The reconstructed streamflow at Toudaoguai station suggests that agricultural irrigation is predominantly responsible for streamflow reductions between Lanzhou and Toudaoguai stations with approximately 9.1 km(3)/a of water extracted between 1997 and 2006. Meanwhile, a decrease of incoming water from upper reaches and soil and water conservation measures were responsible for the significant decline in annual streamflow at mid-lower reaches station. The result of this paper should be of use for water resources planning, watershed management and climate adaptation as they demonstrate how natural and anthropogenic drivers influence water availability in semi-arid regions.","[Zhao, Guangju; Mu, Xingmin; Wen, Zhongming] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Guangju; Mu, Xingmin; Wen, Zhongming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Guangju; Mu, Xingmin; Wen, Zhongming] Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Guangju] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Erhui] Nortjwest A&F Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Rayburg, Scott] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn & Ind Sci, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Tian, Peng] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Ministry of Water Resources; Tsinghua University; Swinburne University of Technology; Northwest A&F University - China","Mu, XM (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",xmmu@ms.iswc.ac.cn,"WEN, Zhongming/F-1215-2010","Zhao, Guangju/0000-0002-4233-9403; Zhao, Guangju/0000-0001-7756-4494","Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZZD-EW-04-03]; National Science and Technology Ministry [2012BAB02B05]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [QN2013071]; State key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering, Tsinghua University [SKLHSE-2012-B-01]; West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Science [2011ZD03]","Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Science and Technology Ministry; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); State key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering, Tsinghua University; West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Science(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","This work was supported by the Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. KZZD-EW-04-03), the Key Project of the National Science and Technology Ministry (No. 2012BAB02B05), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (QN2013071) and the Open Research Fund Program of State key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering, Tsinghua University (SKLHSE-2012-B-01) and West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Science (2011ZD03).

The analysis is based on the Water Availability and Adaptation Policy Analysis (WAAPA) model, which focuses on the quantitative evaluation of maximum potential water withdrawal for different types of demands. The Water Availability and Adaptation Policy Analysis model performs the simulation of water resources systems at the monthly time scale and allows the estimation of the demand-reliability curve in every subbasin of the river network. Over sixty River Basin Districts of Southern Europe have been analyzed, taking basic information from publicly available databases: basin topology from the Hydro1K database, average runoff from the University of New Hampshire Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) composite runoff field, population from the Global Rural-urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) and irrigation area from the Global Map of Irrigated Area dataset. Streamflow monthly time series were obtained from the results of the ENSEMBLES project in four climate scenarios for time horizon 2070-2100. Climate change vulnerability of irrigation demands is estimated from changes in maximum potential water withdrawals for irrigation in current and future scenarios. Maximum potential water withdrawal for irrigation was computed as the largest value of irrigation demand that could be supplied with a given reliability requirement once the existing urban demand is adequately satisfied. The results show significant regional disparities in vulnerability to climate change in the irrigation sector across Europe. The greatest vulnerabilities have been obtained for Southwest Europe (Iberian Peninsula) and some basins in Italy and Greece.","[Garrote, Luis; Granados, Alfredo; Mediero, Luis; Martin-Carrasco, Francisco] Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Hydraul & Energy Engn, Madrid, Spain; [Iglesias, Ana] Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Econ & Agr Social Sci, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Garrote, L (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Hydraul & Energy Engn, Madrid, Spain.",l.garrote@upm.es,"Granados, Alfredo/AAA-6648-2019; Garrote, Luis/B-5925-2013; Iglesias, Ana/AEN-3261-2022; Mediero, Luis/K-6430-2014","Garrote, Luis/0000-0001-9087-3638; Mediero, Luis/0000-0002-9346-6592; Martin-Carrasco, Francisco J./0000-0001-6960-293X","European Union [308337, 505539]; Spanish Ministry of the Environment, Rural and Marine affairs [200800050084350]; CYTED [410 AC0399]","European Union(European Commission); Spanish Ministry of the Environment, Rural and Marine affairs; CYTED","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support received from the European Union through the Project BASE (Bottom Up Climate Adaptation Strategies Towards a Sustainable Europe, Grant Agreement No. 308337), from the Spanish Ministry of the Environment, Rural and Marine affairs through the ARCO project (200800050084350), and from CYTED through the VIAGUA action (410 AC0399).

We examine the trade-off between risk reduction and affordability in a model of public private flood insurance in France and Germany estimating household flood adaptation decisions in response to financial insurance incentives. An integrated model of household level mitigation behaviour and insurance premiums is developed. The model investigates how aggregated household adaptation behaviour differs under financial incentives as compared to when households act on their own subjective risk beliefs. The results indicate that insurance based incentives are able to promote adaptation. The incentives could reduce residential flood risk by 12% in Germany and 24% in France by 2040. The higher level of flood risk in France results in a strong present incentive to reduce risk. Rapid growth of flood risks in Germany results in more effective incentives in later periods. Insurance is unaffordable for approximately 20% of households at risk. Providing vouchers, to correct for unaffordability, after 2040 has a lower cost than the total incentivised damage reduction. A policy recommendation is that strengthening the link between flood insurance and financial incentives can guide household level adaptation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Identification of sites where future lakes will possibly form is, therefore, an essential step to initiate early planning of measures for risk reduction and sustainable use as part of adaptation strategies with respect to impacts from climate change. In order to establish a corresponding knowledge base, a systematic inventory of glacier-bed overdeepenings and possible future lakes was compiled for the still glacierized parts of the Peruvian Andes using the 2003-2010 glacier outlines from the national glacier inventory and the SRTM DEM from the year 2000.

Moreover, climate change will put greater pressure on these resources. This research aims to assess the impact of climate change on the water demands for one of the most important Egyptian food crops which is the wheat crop. In addition, a number of adaptation strategies were tested to mitigate the negative impact of climate change on wheat productivity and its water relations. The current study was carried out in the Middle Egypt region. Two models were used, the first is the climate model (MAGICC/SCENGEN), which is used to simulate the impact of global greenhouse gas emissions on the rate of rise in temperature at the regional level. The second is the irrigation model (CROPWAT8.0), which is used to simulate the irrigation water requirements under current and likely climate change conditions. The results indicated that the increase in greenhouse gas emissions will cause the temperature to rise over the study area by about 2.12 degrees C in 2050 and 3.96 degrees C by 2100. As a result, wheat productivity is likely to drop by 8.6 and 11.1% in 2050 and 2100, respectively.

By perturbing near-surface temperatures from a 9-km dynamically downscaled simulation, a series of offline land surface model experiments explore how Sierra Nevada hydrology has already been impacted by historical anthropogenic warming and how these impacts evolve under future warming scenarios. Results show that historical warming reduced 2016-2017 Sierra Nevada snow water equivalent by 20% while increasing early-season runoff by 30%. An additional one third to two thirds loss of snowpack is projected by the end of the century, depending on the emission scenario, with middle elevations experiencing the most significant declines. Notably, the number of days in the future with runoff exceeding 20mm nearly doubles under a mitigation emission scenarios and triples under a business-as-usual scenario. A smaller snow-to-rain ratio, as opposed to increased snowmelt, is found to be the primary mechanism of temperature impacts to Sierra snowpack and runoff. These findings are consequential to the prevalence of early-season floods in the Sierra Nevada. In the Feather River Watershed, historical warming increased runoff by over one third during the period of heaviest precipitation in February 2017. This suggests that historical anthropogenic warming may have exacerbated runoff conditions underlying the Oroville Dam spillway overflow that occurred in this month. As warming continues in the future, the potential for runoff-based flood risk may rise even higher. Plain Language Summary This study investigates temperature impacts to snowpack and runoff-driven flood risk over the Sierra Nevada during the extremely wet year of 2016-2017. Significant findings have been revealed related to recent public aware precipitation extremes. With a reasonably accurate representation of the historical precipitation and snowpack over the Sierra Nevada, results from the offline simulations with perturbed near-surface temperature reveal significant impacts of warming on snow water equivalent loss and flood risk. As the drought condition predicts to be more severe and precipitation to be more extreme, the loss of snowpack and intensified flood risk informs policymakers for better climate adaptation strategies for water resources supply and flood control.","[Huang, Xingying; Hall, Alex D.; Berg, Neil] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Huang, XY (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",xingyhuang@ucla.edu,,"Huang, Xingying/0000-0003-2494-9897","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science project (An Integrated Evaluation of the Simulated Hydroclimate System of the Continental US) [DE-SC0016605]; Metabolic Studio; Annenberg Foundation [12-469]","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science project (An Integrated Evaluation of the Simulated Hydroclimate System of the Continental US); Metabolic Studio; Annenberg Foundation","We would like to thank two reviewers and the Editor for very helpful comments and input.

This paper proposes a new conceptual framework for assessing city plans based on the idea of sustainability and planning countering climate change. It applies this framework to assess the recent master plan for the city of New York City: PlaNYC 2030. The framework consists of eight concepts that were identified through conceptual analyses of the planning and interdisciplinary literature on sustainability and climate change. Using the proposed conceptual framework to evaluate PlaNYC 2030 reveals some of the merits of the Plan. PlaNYC promotes greater compactness and density, enhanced mixed land use, sustainable transportation, greening, and renewal and utilization of underused land. With regard to the concept of uncertainty, it addresses future uncertainties related to climate change with institutional measures only. From the perspective of ecological economics, the Plan creates a number of mechanisms to promote its climate change goals and to create a cleaner environment for economic investment. It offers an ambitious vision of reducing emissions by 30% and creating a greener, greater New York, and links this vision with the international agenda for climate change. On the other hand, the assessment reveals that PlaNYC did not make a radical shift toward planning for climate change and adaptation. It inadequately addresses social planning issues that are crucial to New York City. NYC is socially differentiated in terms of the capacity of communities to meet climate change uncertainties, and the Plan fails to address the issues facing vulnerable communities due to climate change. The Plan calls for an integrative approach to climate change on the institutional level, but it fails to effectively integrate civil society, communities, and grassroots organizations into the process. The lack of a systematic procedure for public participation throughout the city's neighborhoods and among different social groupings and other stakeholders is a critical shortcoming, particularly during the current age of climate change uncertainty. Practically, the proposed conceptual framework of evaluate appears to be an effective and constructive means of illuminating the Plan's strengths and weaknesses, and appears to be an easy-to-grasp evaluation method, and should be easily understood and applied by scholars, practitioners and policy makers.","Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & City Planning, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Jabareen, Y (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & City Planning, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",jabareen@technion.ac.il,,"Jabareen, Yosef/0000-0002-0858-9994",,,,,64,15,15,2,81,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2014,6,9,,,,,5898,5919,,10.3390/su6095898,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su6095898,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AQ6EI,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000342902000020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Water-energy saving technologies such as rainwater harvesting, solar water heaters, and micro water turbines, reduce water-related energy consumption and mitigate greenhouse gases emissions; thereby illustrating the potential to generate climate change mitigation and adaptation co-benefits. The paper relies on primary data collected through interviews and a survey as well as secondary data in order to assess the extent to which water-energy saving technologies influence the water-energy nexus in Cuenca's urban water metabolic cycle.

The CDFDM outputs were compared with historical weather data. Obtained results showed that discrepancies between SINTEX-F and the historical weather data were significantly reduced through CDFDM for both sites. ORYZA, an ecophysiological rice growth model that simulate agroecological rice growth processes, was used to evaluate the applicability of the SINTEX-F for grain yield predictions. Obtained results from on-farm field validation showed that the predicted grain yield was close to the actual grain yield that was obtained through optimum sowing timing given by the predictions. A normalized root mean square error between predicted and actual grain yield showed satisfactory model fit in predictions. This implies that SINTEX-F was applicable for improving rainfed rice production through CDFDM. However, CDFDM has a limitation in orographic precipitation, the high-resolution daily weather data or a sophisticated special interpolation method should be considered in order to improve the representation of the geographical pattern for the parameters derived from CDFDM.","[Hayashi, Keiichi; Llorca, Lizzida] Int Rice Res Inst, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Hayashi, Keiichi] Japan Int Res Ctr Agr Sci, 1-1 Ohwashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058686, Japan; [Rustini, Sri] Cent Java Assessment Inst Agr Technol, Ungaran 50501, Central Java, Indonesia; [Setyanto, Prihasto] Indonesian Agr Environm Res Inst, Pati 59182, Central Java, Indonesia; [Zaini, Zulkifli] IRRI Indonesia Off, Bogor 59182, West Java, Indonesia",CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"Hayashi, K (corresponding author), Japan Int Res Ctr Agr Sci, 1-1 Ohwashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058686, Japan.",k.hayashi@irri.org,,,"Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan(Ministry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan)","This study was conducted through the IRRI-Japan collaborative research project funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan.",,44,24,24,3,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-521X,1873-2267,,AGR SYST,Agric.

The paper highlights such concepts presenting two case studies of important coastal cities: Venice, in Northern Italy, and Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. Although characterized by completely different climatic conditions and living habits, these two metropolises are highly impacted by humans and threatened by similar factors like subsidence and sea-level rise, which increase their exposure to future calamities principally driven by climate change but strictly related to anthropic pressures.

However, in 2063 the environment and economy are out of balance; citizens are constantly forced to make difficult trade-offs. Climate warming, geopolitical pressures such as environmental refugees, an aging population, and a sluggish economy have overwhelmed the region's efforts to find a balance that would have ensured human prosperity without diminishing the integrity of the Great Lakes basin. This narrative illustrates the time period 2013 to 2063, depicting how the collision of multiple drivers of change cause declining social and environmental conditions, and force a gradual transformation in societal values. While society was initially complacent, the groundwork for social transformation was laid over three decades. Impacts of education programs, opposition to environmentally degrading natural resource extraction, and widespread effects of both failing social services and physical infrastructure galvanize grassroots mobilization of communities around iceless hockey rink meetings. These meetings act as a catalyst, translating this social movement into governance that works towards a common vision based on shared values. However, despite innovative technologies and cohesive efforts, it becomes obvious that attempts to oppose the complex and interrelated forces driving changes in the Great Lakes region are limited. These efforts come at huge economic costs, and the harsh reality forces people in the region to make difficult decisions that threaten some facets of economic, social and environmental well-being while protecting others.

Towards Economic Efficiency and Financial Sustainability,"FEB 13-15, 2022","Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA","Arab Fund Econ & Social Dev,Saudi Minist Environm Water & Agr,Water Sci & Technol Assoc,Saline Water Convers Corp",,,,"The Arab region is one of the most water scarce regions in the world with 19 states below the water scarcity threshold including 13 states below the absolute water scarcity. Groundwater is heavily relied upon and it is the primary source of freshwater in more than 11 Arab States, yet the invisible and complex character of groundwater being underground and out of sight has not given it the due attention it deserves. Hence, this report explores the importance of groundwater and the challenges it is facing, with the aim of bolstering its status to a strategic resource for the Arab region. Amid the water scarcity situation, limited renewable groundwater resources continue to be exploited at an unsustainable rate, exceeding the natural recharge rates. Excessive use of groundwater, especially by the agricultural sector combined with low efficiency, has led to the decline in groundwater storage in more than two thirds of the Arab region, where the area of decline has doubled in 2018-2019 compared to 2002. In some countries over 88% of all irrigation water comes from groundwater compared to a global average of just over 37%. Moreover, it is projected that by 2050, available groundwater per capita will have decreased by more than half since the beginning of the century and 17 Arab States, accounting for 79% of the total population, will be below the absolute water scarcity threshold. In addition to their excessive use, groundwater resources are also threatened by anthropo-genic pollution sources, from agricultural and industrial practices and from sea water intrusion in coastal cities. The deterioration in the quality of groundwater resources, both due to overexploita-tion and pollution is aggravating the problem of water scarcity. For example, in Beirut, seawater intrusion has shifted inland between 500 and 1,200 m from 1970 reference point. In Gaza, only 25% of wastewater is treated due the lack of proper wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure, which is further complicated by the occupation that has restricted access to natural resources. This is alarming knowing that groundwater is central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets adopted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the region. It is directly linked to SDG6 and central to achieving many other SDGs such as SDG2 for ending hunger. It is also an important component of climate change adaptation, having a high buffer capacity against drought. Accordingly, the projected impacts of climate change on water resources in the region, will further increase dependency on groundwater at a time when groundwater recharge is also projected to decrease, necessitating conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater. The impacts of climate change on groundwater at the aquifer level is showcased by ESCWA on the Beni-Amir aquifer, Morocco and the Eocene aquifer, Palestine. Results from the study on Beni-Amir aquifer indicate that the water table is expected to decrease 10 to 25 m (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) by end of century, resulting in partial depletion of resources in the top three layers of the aquifer system, particularly in the northern Beni-Amir area. In the case of Palestine, the results on the Eocene aquifer showed that in the 2041-2060 horizon, the average precipitation is expected to decrease in all scenarios between 3% and 12%, whereas the recharge in 5 out of 6 precipitation scenarios showed a reduction by 12%-16%. Consequently, with no decrease in the aquifer pumping, the water levels in all scenarios will drop. The declining availability of groundwater resources due to increased consumption, develop-ment demands, inefficient use and climate change should prompt Arab States to explore innova-tive and integrated governance frameworks to improve groundwater resources management and ensure equitable access for current and future generations to this strategic resource. Groundwater governance has been historically weak in the Arab region, characterized by fragmented legislations and policies, limited funding, lack of coordination and lack of data and knowledge. More recent evaluation of the management of groundwater resources through the SDG indicator 6.5.1 report-ing mechanisms on the degree of implementation of IWRM has unfortunately reinforced some of the main challenges listed above in the Arab region mainly in terms of lack of implementation of management tools and proper financing. In response to the lack or fragmentation of groundwater management policies, ESCWA developed regional groundwater abstraction management guidelines offering a unified approach to deal with uncontrolled groundwater exploitation and use. Groundwater governance is further complicated by transboundary aquifers. In fact, all coun-tries, except for Comoros, share at least one aquifer with their neighboring countries. These trans-boundary aquifers cover almost 58% of the Arab region's total area. Some of these aquifers are directly connected to surface-water hydrological systems and should also be conjunctively man-aged. Other transboundary aquifers contain fossil groundwater reserves requiring specialized legal, policy and management frameworks that consider their non-renewable character. The status of regional transboundary water cooperation is captured in a recent regional report prepared by ESCWA on the progress on SDG indicator 6.5.2 in the Arab region for the year 2021. The report revealed the challenges faced by the Arab states that hinder the establishment of well-developed cooper-ation frameworks which are mainly linked to lack of knowledge and data exchange and financial constraints. However, there are encouraging signs where cooperation on transboundary aquifers has progressed, including a Joint Authority for the Nubian sandstone Aquifer, a cooperation framework for the Senegalo-Mauritanian Aquifer, a signed agreement for the Saq-Ram Aquifer, and a consulta-tion mechanism on the North Western Sahar Aquifer System. These cooperation agreements should be maintained and further developed by holding regular meetings, coordinating objectives and management plans, and regularly exchanging data and information. Regional knowledge exchange around these agreements should be enforced. Advances in technologies provide an opportunity to fill the data and information gap that hin-ders the management of groundwater. Integrated remote sensing data offer a solution to assess the groundwater status. In addition, Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is one of the most important solutions to consider for securing water supply and for improving groundwater quality where it is deteriorating. MAR is already used in more than 44 sites across the Arab region. Technologies can assist in selection of where MAR can be a potential solution for the region and for improving the water security. Furthermore, in response to the need for availing more data and information on groundwater and improving access to such data as established through the reporting on SDG indicators 6.5.1 and 6.5.2, ESCWA will be initiating an Arab Groundwater Digital Knowledge Platform. This platform aims to increase access to regional knowledge and information on groundwater resources through a dedicated digital interactive platform. Finally, the relation of groundwater to water scarcity, human activity, transboundary water cooperation, climate change, and water governance is highlighted in the following key findings.","[Khiyat, Ziad] Econ & Social Commiss Western Asia UN ESCWA, Beirut, Lebanon",,"Khiyat, Z (corresponding author), Econ & Social Commiss Western Asia UN ESCWA, Beirut, Lebanon.",khayat@un.org,,,,,,,0,1,1,11,11,DESALINATION PUBL,HOPKINTON,"36 WALCOTT VALLEY DRIVE,, HOPKINTON, MA 01748 USA",1944-3994,1944-3986,,DESALIN WATER TREAT,Desalin.

To fully realize the potential of urban agriculture, it is necessary to better understand the implications of urban agriculture and climate change on the food-energy-water nexus. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of local climate change on irrigation requirements, and green and blue water usages for turf grass and three common urban agriculture crops (carrots, spinach, and sweet corn) in eight mid-sized U.S. cities. Baseline (1980-2010) and Future (2040-2050) daily climate data were combined with site-specific crop water uptake data to calculate irrigation requirements using the Irrigation Management System Model, IManSys, a numerical simulation model that uses a water balance approach. The irrigation requirements (IRRs) were further used to calculate the energy requirements and associated greenhouse gas emissions for the four crops in each location. Results showed the spatio-temporal impact of climate change on precipitation and evapotranspiration and consequently on crop IRRs. On the east coast, increases in summer precipitation during the crop growing seasons result in relatively small increases in blue water contributions (<222%) to crop water demands. On the west coast, though, decreases in precipitation lead to more drastic increases in blue water contributions (>222%) for these same crops. The energy requirements and greenhouse gas footprints of urban agriculture were weakly correlated to the blue water portion of the IRRs in individual cities but were largely impacted by the source of the water used. Overall, the results highlight the importance of appropriate and thoughtful crop selection for urban agriculture paired with environmentally sustainable water sourcing to maintain, or even reduce, future water and energy footprints of urban agriculture.","[Cooper, Carolyn M.; Troutman, Jacob P.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 301 East Dean Keeton St,Stop C1700, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Troutman, Jacob P.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem, 100 East 24th St,Stop A1590, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Awal, Ripendra; Habibi, Hamideh; Fares, Ali] Prairie View A&M Univ, Coll Agr & Human Sci, Prairie View, TX 77446 USA; [Habibi, Hamideh] 1780 Hughes Landing Blvd,Suite 450, The Woodlands, TX 77380 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Texas A&M University System; Prairie View A&M University,"Fares, A (corresponding author), Prairie View A&M Univ, Coll Agr & Human Sci, Prairie View, TX 77446 USA.",alfares@pvamu.edu,"Awal, Ripendra/G-1973-2011; Awal, Ripendra/AAF-1906-2020","Awal, Ripendra/0000-0002-2453-2592; Awal, Ripendra/0000-0002-2453-2592; Troutman, Jacob/0000-0002-2026-8886; Cooper, Carolyn/0000-0003-3311-6555",National Science Foun-dation [DGE-1828974]; U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture Evans-Allen Project [1021753],National Science Foun-dation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture Evans-Allen Project,Funding Funding for this work was provided by the National Science Foun-dation under Grant No. DGE-1828974 and the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture Evans-Allen Project 1021753.,,90,6,6,14,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Strategies formulated and implemented to curb these impacts can thus be more effective if scientific findings on the response to climate change and SLR impacts on coastal communities are taken into consideration and not based merely on the need for coastal protection due to physical coastal erosion. There is also the need to determine the level of awareness of sea-level rise and responses in coastal communities to improve adaptation planning. This study assesses the impact of future erosion on the coastal land cover of Ghana. This assessment estimates approximately 2.66 km(2), 2.77 km(2), and 3.24 km(2) of coastal settlements, 2.10 km(2), 2.20 km(2) and 2.58 km(2) of lagoons, 1.39 km(2), 1.46 km(2) and 1.71 km(2) of wetlands to be at risk of inundation by the year 2050 based on coastal erosion estimates for the 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) used in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This study also assesses the level of awareness of respondents to SLR on the coast of Ghana and explores the availability and level of integration of scientific knowledge of SLR into coastal adaptation strategies in Ghana. Assessment of the awareness of SLR responses to the changing climate in Ghana is made through semi-structured interviews at national, municipal/district and coastal community scales. Although settlements may be inundated based on the coastal erosion estimates, coastal dwellers interviewed cherish their proximity to the sea and are determined to maintain their occupancy close to the sea as spatial location influences their source of livelihood (fishing). Respondents lack knowledge/understanding of SLR, as the majority of household interviewees attributed the rise or fall in sea level to God. Respondents from Ngiresia alleged that the ongoing coastal sea defence project in their community has led to increased malaria cases.","[Evadzi, Prosper I.

The lake has undergone significant changes: (1) the water level was lowered in the 1600s and in the 1850s; (2) planktivorous coregonid fish were successfully introduced in the early 1900s; (3) nutrient input from intensified agriculture has increased since the 1950s and (4) the effects of the current variable climate on the lake and its catchment have become more evident since the 1990s. We determined the phases of oligotrophication, eutrophication and recovery and elucidated the ecosystem changes by combining palaeolimnological records with detailed neolimnological data. The sedimentary diatom and cladoceran assemblages first showed a relatively eutrophic period followed by oligotrophic periods, linked with the artificial changes in water level and consequent shifts in macrophyte abundance. The oligotrophic period in the early 1900s is thought to represent the target trophic state for the lake. After the 1950s, introduction of vendace resulted in higher planktivory reflected by an increased relative abundance of small-bodied pelagic cladocerans. Signs of eutrophication occurred due to increased nutrient load. During the last 10 years, signs of recovery have been recorded. A complex history such as that of Lake Pyhajarvi illustrates the difficulties in selecting management targets, and the risk of setting false targets, for lakes based solely on monitoring data-both neolimnological and palaeolimnological approach are needed.","[Ventela, Anne-Mari; Kirkkala, Teija] Pyhajarvi Inst, Sepantie 7, Kauttua 27500, Finland; [Amsinck, Susanne Lildal; Johansson, Liselotte Sander; Jeppesen, Erik; Sondergaard, Martin] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Kauppila, Tommi] Geol Survey Finland, Kuopio 70211, Finland; [Jeppesen, Erik] Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res SDC, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Weckstrom, Jan] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Sarvala, Jouko] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland",Aarhus University; Geological Survey of Finland (GTK); University of Helsinki; University of Turku,"Ventela, AM (corresponding author), Pyhajarvi Inst, Sepantie 7, Kauttua 27500, Finland.",anne-mari.ventela@pji.fi,"Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Sarvala, Jouko/J-8962-2019; Weckstrom, Jan/N-7665-2013","Søndergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Sarvala, Jouko/0000-0002-5016-3049; Weckstrom, Jan/0000-0001-5604-617X",,,,,92,15,16,2,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,SEP,2016,778,1,,,,,273,294,,10.1007/s10750-015-2552-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2552-2,,,22,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Marine & Freshwater Biology,DR1DF,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000379645500020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The computer climate models adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), such as the General Circulation Models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), projected that the global surface temperature could rise more than 1.5 degrees C by 2030 and more than 4-5 degrees C by 2100 relative to the pre-industrial period (1850-1900) because of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. These computer projections are being used to justify expensive mitigation policies to drastically reduce CO2 emissions due to the use of fossil fuel. However, these models must be validated before their interpretation of climate change could be considered reliable. Herein, I summarize recent scientific research pointing out that these GCMs fail to properly reconstruct the natural variability of the climate throughout the entire Holocene and at multiple time scales such as: (1) the Holocene Climatic Optimum (9000-6000 years ago) with the subsequent cooling from 5000 years ago to now, (2) the large millennial oscillations observed throughout the Holocene that were responsible, for example, for the Medieval Wann Period; (3) several shorter climatic oscillations with periods of about 9.1, 10.4, 20, 60 years; (4) the climate change trend after 2000 to date, which the models greatly overestimate; and many other patterns. These different pieces of evidence imply two main facts: (1) the models' equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to radiative forcing, such as to an atmospheric CO2 doubling, is overestimated at least by a factor of 2, which implies a more realistic ECS between 1 degrees C and 2 degrees C; (2) there area number of solar and astronomical forcings that are still missing in the models or are poorly understood yet. Consequently, these GCMs are not physically reliable for properly interpreting past and future climatic changes. Alternatively, semi-empirical climatic models should be used. Data analysis found that the climatic natural variability is made of several oscillations from the decadal to the millennial scales (e.g. periods of about 9.1, 10.4, 20, 60, 115, 1000 years) and others. These oscillations are coherent with solar, lunar and astronomical oscillations. A semi-empirical climate model that makes use of these oscillations plus a reduced ECS reconstructs with great accuracy the climate variability observed since 1850 and projects a very moderate warming until 2040 and a warming lower than 2 degrees C from 2000 to 2100 using the same anthropogenic emission scenarios used for the 21st-century climate simulations of the CMIP5 models. This result suggests that climatic adaptation policies, which are far less expensive than the mitigation ones, could be sufficient to address the consequences of climatic changes that could occur during the 21st century.","[Scafetta, Nicola] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Earth Sci Environm & Georesources, Complesso Univ Monte S Angelo Via Cinthia 21, I-80126 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Scafetta, N (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Earth Sci Environm & Georesources, Complesso Univ Monte S Angelo Via Cinthia 21, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",nicola.scafetta@unina.it,"Scafetta, Nicola/K-5628-2018; Scafetta, Nicola/AAE-2558-2021","Scafetta, Nicola/0000-0003-0967-1911; Scafetta, Nicola/0000-0003-0967-1911",,,,,69,3,3,3,18,UNIV STUDI ROMA LA SAPIENZA,ROME,"PIAZZALE ALDO MORO, 5, ROME, I-00185, ITALY",1825-6635,2035-5688,,ITAL J ENG GEOL ENV,Ital.

The city government has now recognized climate change as a serious threat, including it being a reason for loss of life and livelihoods. Even though governance has become a key mechanism to address a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions and vulnerability to climate change, the practice of climate-change governance has been undermined by different factors. Thus, this study examined factors affecting climate-change governance in the city. The research adopted a mixed research design and depends on primary and secondary data sources. The binary logistic regression model and descriptive statistics were both used to analyse the quantitative data, while the descriptive method was used for the qualitative data. The results reveal that a lack of coordination, political will and leadership are the major factors that hinder the practice of governance in the city, followed by inadequate finance, policy, strategy, and regulation. In addition, a shortage of knowledgeable experts, lack of access to information and technologies had their own contributions to the ineffectiveness of climate-change governance. Thus, the city administration should place emphasis on climate change, giving it comparable weight to other crosscutting issues, and enabling the functioning of the steering committee with a strong accountability system. In addition, the city administration should take aggressive measures, including revising or formulating new policy, strategy or regulation, and even creating an independent institution for climate-change issues. Furthermore, the Addis Ababa City environmental protection and green development commission should create an enabling environment to attract non-state actors, in general, and NGOs, in particular, and should assign one directorate to mobilise finance, following the approach taken by the federal environmental protection commission. The commission should implement a mechanism to efficiently utilize the budget by applying continuous monitoring and evaluation. The commission should also provide continuous training and capacity building for leaders and experts at sub-city and Woreda levels.","[Addis, Tigezaw Lamesgin; Birhanu, Belay Simane; Italemahu, Tesfaye Zeleke] Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Environm, Dev Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",,"Addis, TL (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr Environm, Dev Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",tigezaw2013@gmail.com,,,,,,,104,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2023,15,4,,,,,,,3235,10.3390/su15043235,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15043235,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,9M2ZK,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000942104200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Taking the position that new economic rationalities are needed, this study examines how transformative modes of resilience thinking that emerge from practice create tensions that can support a transformation toward the economic rationalities of the so-called doughnut economics, an alternative economic model that outlines a vision and a path toward ecological and social sustainability.","[Olsson, David] Karlstad Univ, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden",Karlstad University,"Olsson, D (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",david.olsson@kau.se,,"Olsson, David/0000-0003-0745-2133",myndigheten for samha llsskydd och beredskap (Societal Resilience in Sweden) [217-34],myndigheten for samha llsskydd och beredskap (Societal Resilience in Sweden),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research and/or authorship of this article: This work was supported by myndigheten for samha llsskydd och beredskap (Societal Resilience in Sweden, award number 217-34).",,63,4,4,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0304-3754,2163-3150,,ALTERNATIVES,Alternatives,MAY,2020,45,2,,,,,102,120,304375420938284,10.1177/0304375420938284,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0304375420938284,,JUL 2020,19,International Relations,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations,NJ2UF,,Green Published,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000548303500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among grassland ecologists, particularly those working in savannas of the seasonally dry tropics, an emerging fire-herbivore paradigm is generally accepted to explain grass dominance in climates and on soils that would otherwise permit development of closed-canopy forests. By contrast, adherents of the climate-soil paradigm, particularly foresters working in the humid tropics or temperate latitudes, tend to view fire and herbivores as disturbances, often human-caused, which damage forests and reset succession. Towards integration of these two paradigms, we developed a series of conceptual models to explain the existence of an extensive temperate forest-grassland mosaic that occurs within a 4.7 million km(2) belt spanning from central Europe through eastern Asia. The Eurasian forest-steppe is reminiscent of many regions globally where forests and grasslands occur side-by-side with stark boundaries. Our conceptual models illustrate that if mean climate was the only factor, forests should dominate in humid continental regions and grasslands should prevail in semi-arid regions, but that extensive mosaics would not occur. By contrast, conceptual models that also integrate climate variability, soils, topography, herbivores, and fire depict how these factors collectively expand suitable conditions for forests and grasslands, such that grasslands may occur in more humid regions and forests in more arid regions than predicted by mean climate alone. Furthermore, boundaries between forests and grasslands are reinforced by vegetation-fire, vegetation-herbivore, and vegetation-microclimate feedbacks, which limit tree establishment in grasslands and promote tree survival in forests. Such feedbacks suggest that forests and grasslands of the Eurasian forest-steppe are governed by ecological dynamics that are similar to those hypothesised to maintain boundaries between tropical forests and savannas. Unfortunately, the grasslands of the Eurasian forest-steppe are sometimes misinterpreted as deforested or otherwise degraded vegetation. In fact, the grasslands of this region provide valuable ecosystem services, support a high diversity of plants and animals, and offer critical habitat for endangered large herbivores. We suggest that a better understanding of the fundamental ecological controls that permit forest-grassland coexistence could help us prioritise conservation and restoration of the Eurasian forest-steppe for biodiversity, climate adaptation, and pastoral livelihoods. Currently, these goals are being undermined by tree-planting campaigns that view the open grasslands as opportunities for afforestation. Improved understanding of the interactive roles of climate variability, soils, topography, fire, and herbivores will help scientists and policymakers recognise the antiquity of the grasslands of the Eurasian forest-steppe.","[Erdos, Laszlo; Bede-Fazekas, Akos; Kroel-Dulay, Gyorgy] Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, Alkotmany Utca 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary; [Erdos, Laszlo; Torok, Peter] MTA DE Lendulet Funct & Restorat Ecol Res Grp, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Torok, Peter] Univ Debrecen, Dept Ecol, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Torok, Peter] Polish Acad Sci, Ctr Biol Divers Conservat Powsin, Bot Garden, Prawdziwka St 2, PL-02973 Warsaw, Poland; [Veldman, Joseph W.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecol & Conservat Biol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Batori, Zoltan] Univ Szeged, Dept Ecol, Kozep Fasor 52, H-6726 Szeged, Hungary; [Bede-Fazekas, Akos] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Environm & Landscape Geog, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Magnes, Martin] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Biol, Holteigasse 6, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Tolgyesi, Csaba] MTA SZTE Momentum Appl Ecol Res Grp, Kozep Fasor 52, H-6726 Szeged, Hungary",Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Ecological Research; University of Debrecen; Polish Academy of Sciences; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Szeged University; Eotvos Lorand University; University of Graz,"Erdos, L (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, Alkotmany Utca 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary.;Erdos, L (corresponding author), MTA DE Lendulet Funct & Restorat Ecol Res Grp, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",erdos.laszlo@ecolres.hu,"Peter, Torok/C-5514-2008","Peter, Torok/0000-0002-4428-3327; Batori, Zoltan/0000-0001-9915-5309","National Research, Development and Innovation Office [FK 134384, K 119225, K 137573, K 124796, PD 132131]; New National Excellence Programme of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology from the source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund [UNKP-21-5-SZTE-591, UNKP21-5-SZTE-581]; Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; USDA-NIFA Sustainable Agricultural Systems Grant [2019-68012-29819]; USDA-NIFA McIntire-Stennis Project [1016880]; National Science Foundation [DEB-1931232]","National Research, Development and Innovation Office(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary); New National Excellence Programme of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology from the source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund; Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences); USDA-NIFA Sustainable Agricultural Systems Grant; USDA-NIFA McIntire-Stennis Project; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was supported by the National Research, Development and Innovation Office (FK 134384 to L.

Climate scenarios were put against five adaptation scenarios presenting changes in land use and protective measures compared against a zero scenario of BaU (Business as Usual) kept in the future climate. Adaptation scenarios 1-5 are modifications of Scenario 0 (S-0). The 0-5 scenarios' analysis was based on comparing soil water content and total runoff, sediment yield, actual evapotranspiration. The first adaptation scenario (AS-1) assumes an increase in afforestation on soils from the agricultural suitability complex of soil 6-8 (semi-dry, permanent dry, semi-wet). The second adaptation scenario (AS-2) assumes the creation of a forested buffer for the Bystra River and its tributaries. The third adaptation scenario (AS-3) shows one of the erosion prevention practices, the so-called filter strips. The fourth adaptation scenario (AS-4) assumes the reduction in plowing on arable land. The fifth adaptation scenario (AS-5) involves increasing soil organic carbon to 2%. Simulations revealed that each of the adaptation scenarios 1, 2, 3, 5 does not generally contribute to increasing the water content in soil on BARL (spring crops), CANP (rape), WWHT (winter crops), CRDY (other crops) on arable lands (which together account for over 50% of the catchment area). However, they can contribute to the reduction in sediment yield, total runoff and changes in actual evapotranspiration. The adaptation scenario 4 (AS-4) shows a slight increase in the soil water content on Bystra catchment in the 2041-2050 perspective. Scenario 4 indicated a slight increase in total runoff and a decrease in sediment yield, which in combination with slightly higher water content reflects the protective role of plant residue mulch, lowering the evaporation from the bare soil surface during warm seasons. The no-till adaptation practice had the highest effect in positively affecting water balance at the catchment scale among the adaptation scenarios considered.","[Badora, Damian; Wawer, Rafal; Nierobca, Anna; Krol-Badziak, Aleksandra; Kozyra, Jerzy; Jurga, Beata; Nowocien, Eugeniusz] Inst Soil Sci & Plant Cultivat, State Res Inst, Ul Czartoryskich 8, PL-24100 Pulawy, Poland",Institute of Soil Science & Plant Cultivation,"Badora, D; Nierobca, A (corresponding author), Inst Soil Sci & Plant Cultivat, State Res Inst, Ul Czartoryskich 8, PL-24100 Pulawy, Poland.",dbadora@gmail.com; huwer@iung.pulawy.pl; anna.nierobca@iung.pulawy.pl; aleksandra.krol@iung.pulawy.pl; kozyr@iung.pulawy.pl; bjurga@iung.pulawy.pl; nowocien@iung.pulawy.pl,"Nieróbca, Anna/ABH-6299-2020","Nieróbca, Anna/0000-0002-8627-0583; , Damian/0000-0002-2497-8500; Wawer, Rafal/0000-0001-9266-9577",Polish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development [DC2.0/2021]; European commission,Polish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development; European commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"Research and ACP was funded by Polish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, DC2.0/2021 Programme and B-Ferst project funded by the European commission.",,107,1,1,6,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2022,14,15,,,,,,,2288,10.3390/w14152288,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14152288,,,25,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,3R5ZO,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000838990700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This accounts for considerable economic losses in the region. Regional adaptation strategies for costs minimization require a comprehensive assessment of the disasters' economic impacts at a multiple-region scale. This article adapts the flood footprint method for multiple-region assessment of total economic impact and applies it to the 2009 Central European Floods event. The flood footprint is an impact accounting framework based on the input-output methodology to economically assess the physical damage (direct) and production shortfalls (indirect) within a region and wider economic networks, caused by a climate disaster. Here, the model is extended through the capital matrix, to enable diverse recovery strategies. According to the results, indirect losses represent a considerable proportion of the total costs of a natural disaster, and most of them occur in nonhighly directly impacted industries. For the 2009 Central European Floods, the indirect losses represent 65% out of total, and 70% of it comes from four industries: business services, manufacture general, construction, and commerce. Additionally, results show that more industrialized economies would suffer more indirect losses than less-industrialized ones, in spite of being less vulnerable to direct shocks. This may link to their specific economic structures of high capital-intensity and strong interindustrial linkages.","[Mendoza-Tinoco, David] Autonomous Univ Coahuila, Fac Econ, Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico; [Hu, Yixin] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Stat & Data Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yixin] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Zeng, Zhao] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Chalvatzis, Konstantinos J.] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Zhang, Ning] Shandong Univ, Weihai Inst Interdisciplinary Res, Inst Blue & Green Dev, Weihai, Peoples R China; [Steenge, Albert E.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business Global Econ & Management, Groningen, Netherlands; [Guan, Dabo] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China; [Guan, Dabo] UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, London, England",Universidad Autonoma de Coahuila; Southern University of Science & Technology; University of East Anglia; Tianjin University; University of East Anglia; Shandong University; University of Groningen; Tsinghua University; University of London; University College London,"Guan, DB (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China.",guandabo@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Hu, Yixin/GSJ-0083-2022; Guan, Dabo/Y-2406-2019","Hu, Yixin/0000-0002-3986-9059; Guan, Dabo/0000-0003-3773-3403; Chalvatzis, Konstantinos/0000-0001-9829-7030; Zhang, Ning/0000-0002-5634-4203; Steenge, Albert/0000-0003-3019-198X; Mendoza-Tinoco, David/0000-0002-0974-4810; ZENG, ZHAO/0000-0002-9001-3029","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602604, 2018YFC0807 000, 2019YFC0810705]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41921005, 91846301, 71771113, 41629501]; Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen [KQJSCX20180322151418232]; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K013661/1, EP/K012770/1]; British Academy [NAFR2180103]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); British Academy,"The authors appreciate the time and effort of the editors and reviewers in providing constructive comments that had helped to improve the manuscript.

The current market for CS is still in its early stages. In this paper, we report the findings from our recent investigation into the actual and potential market for CS in the Austrian tourism sector. In close collaboration with tourism stakeholders and CS providers, we explored main barriers hampering the actual use and effectiveness of climate services and identified potential drivers to support further product development and widespread uptake of CS. Despite the high vulnerability of tourism to climate variability and change, the actual use of CS among Austrian tourism stakeholders is rather limited. The main barriers to the use of CS in tourism include wide-spread low levels of risk awareness, a certain degree of risk denial, a lacking sense of urgency due to (yet still) little financial pressure, and rather short business decision cycles, which lead to a low prioritization of climate issues. Furthermore, lack of knowledge of existing services and their benefits, lack of applicability, and distrust in climate services restrict their use. Recommendations for an enhanced uptake of CS thus include the improved demonstration and communication of their added value. In addition, the market would benefit from an increase in intermediaries who bridge the gap between research and applicability. It is further recommended to increasingly integrate climate information into existing services and products already in use.","[Damm, Andrea; Koeberl, Judith] Joanneum Res Forschungsgesell MbH, Ctr Climate Energy & Soc, Graz, Austria; [Stegmaier, Peter] Univ Twente, Dept Sci Technol & Policy Studies, Enschede, Netherlands; [Alonso, Elisa Jimenez] Acclimatise Grp Ltd, Cardiff, Wales; [Harjanne, Atte] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland",University of Twente; Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Damm, A (corresponding author), Joanneum Res Forschungsgesell MbH, Ctr Climate Energy & Soc, Graz, Austria.",andrea.damm@joanneum.at,,"Koberl, Judith/0000-0002-0971-9930","EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [730272, 730500]",EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,This research has received funding from the EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant Agreement No 730272 (MARCO - www.marco-h2020.eu) and No 730500 (EU-MACS - www.eu-macs.eu).,,42,18,18,0,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8807,,,CLIM SERV,Clim.

Relevant climatic variables from the ERA-Interim global atmospheric re-analysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) were downscaled for the study area, and perturbed with the anomalies of 23 global circulation models for three emission scenarios (B1, A1B and A2). Both a projected daily rainfall time series for the period 2010-2100, and a single precipitation event with a one-hundred year return period were used to assess the impact of climate change. The downscaled data were fed into a distributed hydro-sedimentary model (TETIS) with five land use configurations representative of future demographic tendencies, geographical characteristics and land management policies (e.g. European Union CAP). The projected changes showed a general decrease in runoff and sediment production by the end of the century regardless of land use configuration. Sediment production showed a positive relationship with an increase in agricultural land and a decrease in natural land under present day agricultural management. According to our simulations, some conservation practices in agriculture can effectively reduce net erosion while maintaining agricultural production. As such, they can play a critical role as an adaptation tool to reduce climate change impacts in the 21st century. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, the relative effects of these factors are evaluated for the Washington, DC metropolitan area water supply for the near (2010-2039), intermediate (2040-2069), and distant (2070-2099) future by repeated water resources model simulations. This system poses water management challenges because of long water-delivery travel times that increase uncertainty, multiple water jurisdictions that constrain potential decisions, and future scenarios that simultaneously increase demand and decrease water supply during the critical summer period. Adaptation strategies were developed for the system using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. Optimized reservoir management policies were compared using six distinct objectives ranging from reservoir storage to environmental and recreational benefits. Simulations of future conditions show water stress increasing with time. Reservoir sedimentation is projected to more than double (114% increase) the severity of reservoir storage failures by 2040. Increases in water demand and climate change are projected to further stress the system, causing longer periods of low flow and a loss of recreational reservoir storage. The adoption of optimized rules mitigates some of these effects, most notably returning simulations of 2070-2099 climate to near historical levels. Modifying the balance between upstream and downstream reservoirs improved storage penalties by 20.7% and flowby penalties by 50%. Changing triggers for shifting load to off-line reservoirs improved flowby (8.3%) and environmental (4.1%) penalties slightly, whereas changing demand restriction triggers provided only moderate improvements, but with few adverse effects.

In this study, we assess the extent to which historical climate trends have contributed to stagnating yields for maize (Zen mays) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), the two main staple crops in the country. We first analyze 40 years of historical weather data throughout Nicaragua to estimate trends, and assess the extent to which these trends correlate with spatial deforestation patterns. Then, we create a regression model linking department-level maize and bean yields with seasonal weather conditions, and use the model to estimate the impact of historical climate trends on yields. Regressions are run for yields on both harvested and sown area, with the latter accounting for the effect of complete crop losses. Results confirm strong warming trends throughout the country, with daytime temperatures in deforested areas warming at more than double the rate of global averages in the tropics. Decreases in rainfall frequency are also seen almost everywhere, along with an earlier end to the rainy season. Regression model results show, as expected, that red bean is a highly temperature-sensitive crop, and that maize is more water-limited than bean due to its longer seasonal duration. Warming temperatures and less frequent rainfall have led to drought-related losses for both crops in the main commercial production areas, while heavier rains at planting and harvest have also negatively affected yields, especially for bean. Moreover, reduced precipitation in December and January has negatively impacted production for bean in the commercially important apante, or dry season, on the humid Atlantic side of the country. In these areas, however, substantial model uncertainty remains for maize, with an alternative model formulation showing substantial benefits from drier and sunnier conditions. At an annual, national scale, beans have been more affected by climate trends since 1970 than maize, with -5% yield declines per decade on harvested area for bean and -4% for maize, and -12% and -7% yield declines respectively on sown area (with the alternative model showing gains for maize). Climate adaptation responses include government efforts to limit bean exports to control consumer prices, a switch from red to black bean for commercial sales and export, and area expansion and migration for bean in order to maintain production levels.

A popular example is the series of reference regions used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Adaptation (SREX). The SREX regions were slightly modified for the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC and used for reporting subcontinental observed and projected changes over a reduced number (33) of climatologically consistent regions encompassing a representative number of grid boxes. These regions are intended to allow analysis of atmospheric data over broad land or ocean regions and have been used as the basis for several popular spatially aggregated datasets, such as the Seasonal Mean Temperature and Precipitation in IPCC Regions for CMIP5 dataset. We present an updated version of the reference regions for the analysis of new observed and simulated datasets (including CMIP6) which offer an opportunity for refinement due to the higher atmospheric model resolution. As a result, the number of land and ocean regions is increased to 46 and 15, respectively, better representing consistent regional climate features. The paper describes the rationale for the definition of the new regions and analyses their homogeneity. The regions are defined as polygons and are provided as coordinates and a shapefile together with companion R and Python notebooks to illustrate their use in practical problems (e.g. calculating regional averages). We also describe the generation of a new dataset with monthly temperature and precipitation, spatially aggregated in the new regions, currently for CMIP5 and CMIP6, to be extended to other datasets in the future (including observations). The use of these reference regions, dataset and code is illustrated through a worked example using scatter plots to offer guidance on the likely range of future climate change at the scale of the reference regions.

Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to these changes. System responses to stressors are important for resource managers and environmental stewards to understand in order to best manage them. Thin layer sand or sediment application to drowning and eroding marshes is one approach to build elevation and resilience. The above-and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments were examined at varying inundation regimes between mean sea level and mean high water (0.82 m NAVD88 to 1.49 m NAVD88) in a field experiment at Laws Point, part of the Plum Island Sound Estuary (MA). Significantly lower salinities, pH, sulfides, phosphates, and ammonium were measured in the sand-amended sediments than in the natural sediments. In natural sediments there was a pattern of increasing salinity with increasing elevation while in the sand-amended sediments the trend was reversed, showing decreasing salinity with increasing elevation. Sulfide concentrations generally increased from low to high inundation with highest concentrations at the highest inundation (i. e., at the lowest elevations). High pore water phosphate concentrations were measured at low elevations in the natural sediments, but the sand-amended treatments had mostly low concentrations of phosphate and no consistent pattern with elevation. At the end of the experiment the lowest elevations generally had the highest measures of pore water ammonium. Soil carbon dioxide emissions were greatest in the sandamended mesocosms and at higher elevations. Differences in coarse root and rhizome abundances and volumes among the sediment treatments were detected with CT imaging, but by 20 weeks the natural and sand-amended treatments showed similar total belowground biomass at the intermediate and high elevations. Although differences in pore water nutrient concentrations, pH, salinity, and belowground root and rhizome morphology were detected between the natural and sand-amended sediments, similar belowground productivity and total biomass were measured by the end of the growing season. Since the belowground productivity supports organic matter accumulation and peat buildup in marshes, our results suggest that thin layer sand or sediment application is a viable climate adaptation action to build elevation and coastal resiliency, especially in areas with low natural sediment supplies.","[Wigand, C.; Hanson, A.; Davey, E.; Johnson, R.; Watson, E.] US EPA, Atlantic Ecol Div, ORD NHEERL, Narragansett, RI USA; [Sundberg, K.; Morris, J.] Univ South Carolina, Belle W Baruch Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Columbia, SC USA; [Sundberg, K.; Morris, J.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC USA; [Watson, E.] Drexel Univ, Acad Nat Sci, Biodivers Earth & Environm Sci Dept, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Drexel University,"Wigand, C (corresponding author), US EPA, Atlantic Ecol Div, ORD NHEERL, Narragansett, RI USA.",wigand.cathleen@epa.gov,"Watson, Elizabeth Burke/N-1638-2019; morris, james/ABC-8111-2020","Watson, Elizabeth Burke/0000-0002-8496-1647; ","NSF [OCE 1058747, OCE 123821]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by NSF #OCE 1058747 and #OCE 123821 (J.

However, the implementation of these measures raises significant individual and political resistance. The themes of this research relate specifically to the role of communication and to trust in the institutions responsible for implementing this measure. Communication has to be designed in a way to decrease distortions in individuals' risk perception and to help improving quality of the governance of the adaptation to coastal flooding due to sea level rise. We conducted a questionnaire among 782 French coastal residents to deal with these two main dimensions of the acceptability of relocation. Firstly, we question the conditions for a favourable communication strategy by estimating the differentiated impact of communication using fear or conversely humour. Secondly, we study trust in institutions in charge of the implementation of relocation policies with several criteria of governance quality. Our results underline that humour-based communication has the comparative advantage of inducing a stronger emotional response in terms of stimulating interest and thought. Furthermore, the survey highlighted the influence of governance quality. These results confirm the decisive role of governance mechanisms for the acceptability of relocation. They also suggest a need for ongoing support to awareness-raising measures taking into account, among other psychological factors, the need for people to feel that they have some control over implemented measures.","[Bazart, Cecile] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, INRA, Montpellier SupAgro,CEE M, Montpellier, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier,"Bazart, C (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, INRA, Montpellier SupAgro,CEE M, Montpellier, France.",cecile.bazart@umontpellier.fr,,,Programme of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique OHM (Observatoire Homme Milieu); Montpellier University,Programme of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique OHM (Observatoire Homme Milieu); Montpellier University,This work was financed by the Programme of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique OHM (Observatoire Homme Milieu) and by Montpellier University.

How they choose to transform will depend on what societal values they prioritize. Managed retreat can play a powerful role in expanding the range of possible futures that transformation could achieve and in articulating the values that shape those futures. Consideration of retreat raises tensions about what losses are unacceptable and what aspects of societies are maintained, purposefully altered, or allowed to change unaided. Here we integrate research on retreat, transformational adaptation, climate damages and losses, and design and decision support to chart a roadmap for strategic, managed retreat. At its core, this roadmap requires a fundamental reconceptualization of what it means for retreat to be strategic and managed. The questions raised are relevant to adaptation science and societies far beyond the remit of retreat.","[Mach, Katharine J.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Mach, Katharine J.] Univ Miami, Leonard & Jayne Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Siders, A.

Future changes will intensify the balancing act of maintaining ecological conditions and untrammeled character within wilderness areas. We assessed the quantitative and spatial changes in land use, land cover, and climate predicted to occur in and around wilderness areas by (1) quantifying projected changes in land use and land cover around wilderness areas; (2) evaluating if public lands surrounding wilderness areas can buffer future land-use change; (3) quantifying future climate conditions in and around wilderness areas; and (4) identifying wilderness areas expected to experience the most change in land use, land cover, and climate. We used projections of land use (four variables), land cover (five variables), and climate (nine variables) to assess changes for 707 wilderness areas in the contiguous United States by mid-21st century under two scenarios (medium-low and high). We ranked all wilderness areas relative to each other by summing and ranking decile values for each land use, land cover, and climate variable and calculating a multivariate metric of future change. All wilderness areas were projected to experience some level of change by mid-century. The greatest land-use changes were associated with increases in agriculture, clear cutting, and developed land, while the greatest land cover changes were observed for grassland, forest, and shrubland. In 51.6% and 73.8% of wilderness areas, core area of natural vegetation surrounding wilderness was projected to decrease for the medium-low and high scenarios, respectfully. Presence of public land did not mitigate the influence of land-use change around wilderness areas. Geographically, projected changes occurred throughout the contiguous U.S., with areas in the northeast and upper Midwest projected to have the greatest land-use and climate change and the southwestern U.S. projected to undergo the greatest land cover and climate change. Our results provide insights into potential future threats to wilderness areas and the challenges associated with wilderness stewardship and climate adaptation. Despite the high degree of protection and remoteness of wilderness areas, effective management and preservation of these lands must consider future changes in land use, land cover, and climate.","[Aycrigg, Jocelyn L.; Mccarley, T.

Rapid urbanization and heatwave events with increasing frequencies need a quantitative analysis on the supply and demand for an urban temperature regulating service, which is a gap in urban heat island (UHI) studies in rapidly urbanizing cities. In order to study the quantitative relationship between landscape metrics (including area index and shape index) and temperature regulating service, this study applied a temperature regulating service in an urban thermal environment study based on the source-sink landscape theory in western Shenzhen in different periods. The identification of source and sink landscapes is based on the spatial relationship of unusual surface features derived from Landsat-5 and -8 and the consideration of the temperature difference. We found that the source landscapes at different periods provide temperature regulating services for different distances, which directly lead to the difference between the theoretical service value based on the Alternative Cost Method and the actual service value considering demand, changing in the same trend. The results show that the supply distance of temperature regulating services in 2005, 2010, and 2013 is 150 m, 180 m, and 210 m, respectively. The temperature regulating service value is 3.043, 3.273, and 4.308 billion yuan in 2005, 2010, and 2013, which is lower than the estimation value without considering supply and demand (16.638, 23.728, and 37.495 billion yuan, respectively). The value of the temperature regulating service has a positive correlation with the increase of the patch area index. With the gradual complexity of the shape, the service value increases first and then decreases. Moreover, the landscapes with the smallest shape index and area index have the shortest distance for service supplying. The assessment of the temperature regulating service needs to consider the presence of demand landscapes. Furthermore, the interaction of landscapes under different conditions requires further consideration. The setting of the cooling landscape shape and area for mitigating the urban heat island effect can provide references to urban planners and policymakers in the practice of urban climate adaptation and regulation.","[Ma, Ruiming; Zhu, Dehai] China Agr Univ, Coll Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xie, Miaomiao] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Yun, Wenju] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Agr Land Qual, Beijing 100035, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; China University of Geosciences; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,"Xie, MM (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",B20163080543@cau.edu.cn; xiemiaomiao@cugb.edu.cn; yunwenju@lcrc.org.cn; zhudehai@cau.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771204],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.41771204.",,91,8,9,12,58,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

The findings are based on the results of three simulations covering the years of 2041-2050. The simulations were based on a calibrated and validated SWAT model (2010-2017). The first variant covers just the climate change and the existing structure of soil cultivation for the three regional climate models supported by the EC-EARTH global climate model in the emission scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Variants two and three are based on the first variant in terms of the changing climate. The second variant, however, involves placing a pond in each farm in the catchment, while the third variant involves designing huge reservoirs as a result of land consolidation. Variants two and three occur in five adaptation scenarios each. The first adaptation scenario (V2.1 and V3.1) involves only increasing the number of ponds on the farm or increasing the number of reservoirs for non-irrigated arable land crops, i.e., WWHT (winter cereals), BARL (spring cereals), CANP (rapeseed) and CRDY (other crops). The second adaptation scenario (V2.2 and V3.2) involves growing vegetables without irrigation (instead of cereals). The third adaptation scenario (V2.3 and V3.3) involves growing vegetables with irrigation (instead of cereals). The fourth adaptation scenario (V2.4 and V3.4) involves partial cultivation of vegetables and cereals. The fifth adaptation scenario (V2.5 and V3.5) involves partial cultivation of orchards and cereals. The adaptation scenarios of the irrigation of vegetables from deep water-bearing layers (second variant) or reservoirs (third variant) contribute to the increase in water content in the soil, especially in summer, in comparison with the adaptation scenarios for vegetable cultivation without irrigation. What is more, the actual evapotranspiration was higher in the adaptation scenarios involving irrigation than in scenarios without irrigation. It is known that the changes in water content in soil and the intensification of water erosion are gravely affected by modifications in crops and soil cultivation. A change from cereal cultivation to irrigated vegetable cultivation or orchards increased the water content in the soil in most climatic projections. However, the increase in the number of ponds in the second variant had little impact on the soil water content, actual evapotranspiration and overall runoff, while the erosion loss decreased. With the lower precipitation levels in the years 2041-2050 relative to 2010-2017, as presented in the emissive scenario RCP 4.5, the soil water content decreases by up to 14% for most variants. Total runoff for most variants will also be lower by 4-35%. The percentage change in sediment yield will fluctuate between -86% and 116%. On the other hand, the actual evapotranspiration for most variants will be higher. With higher precipitation levels in the years 2041-2050 relative to 2010-2017, as presented in the emissive scenario RCP 8.5, the soil water content changes slightly from -7% to +3%. Total runoff for most variants will also be higher by as much as 43%. Sediment yield for most scenarios may increase by 226%. The actual evapotranspiration for most variants will also be higher. Irrigation variants tend to increase soil available water while increasing evapotranspiration and total outflow in the catchment as compared to non-irrigated LULC. The largest increase in the soil water content is observed in most irrigation variants for RCP 4.5 (annual average 316-319 mm) (V2.3-V2.5, V3.2, and V3.3) and RCP 8.5 (annual average 326-327 mm) (V2.3-V2.5 and V3.3) as compared to V1 (BaU) (315 mm-RCP 4.5 and 324 mm-RCP 8.5) for the years 2041-2050. On the other hand, the lowest increase in soil water content is observed in the V3.5 variant, with an annual average of 292 mm for RCP 4.5 and an annual average of 311 mm for RCP 8.5. Thus, for future climate change scenarios, irrigation with water reservoirs (ponds and storage reservoirs) should be considered. The study proves the rationale behind building ponds in small catchments in order to increase water resources in a landscape and also to counteract adverse effects of climate changes, i.e., sediment outflow and surface water erosion.","[Badora, Damian; Wawer, Rafal; Krol-Badziak, Aleksandra] State Res Inst, Inst Soil Sci & Plant Cultivat, Ul Czartoryskich 8, PL-24100 Pulawy, Poland",Institute of Soil Science & Plant Cultivation,"Badora, D; Wawer, R (corresponding author), State Res Inst, Inst Soil Sci & Plant Cultivat, Ul Czartoryskich 8, PL-24100 Pulawy, Poland.",dbadora@iung.pulawy.pl; huwer@iung.pulawy.pl,,,,,,,95,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,FEB,2023,13,2,,,,,,,404,10.3390/agronomy13020404,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13020404,,,33,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,9G1HL,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000937911100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we conducted 411 site-year on-farm trials to assess the actual yield and WP of rainfed summer maize and its yield and WP potentials in Hebei Province, China. Each on-farm trial contained detailed information of three different treatments: no fertilizer application (CK), current farmers' practices (FP, depending on local farmer field fertilization management), and optimum fertilizer application (OPT, depending on soil testing and balanced fertilization). Results revealed that the yield and WP of rainfed summer maize in Hebei Province were 7635 kg ha(-1) and 20.7 kg ha(-1) mm(-1), respectively, and the yield and WP potentials were 12,148 kg ha(-1) and 32.0 kg ha(-1) mm(-1), respectively. Thus, the farmers attained 62.8% of the yield potential and 64.7% of the WP potential. A wide variation was observed in terms of the yield and WP across various types of farming. Compared with high-yield and high-WP (HYHW) farming, in low-yield and low-WP (LYLW) farming, the yield decreased by 24.9% and WP decreased by 44.4%. Nitrogen fertilizer application rate and rain were the most significant factors for yield and WP gaps among farmers, respectively. Other factors, such as solar radiation (tSola), soil available phosphorus content (AP), potassium fertilizer application rate, and grass-referenced evapotranspiration from planting to maturity (ET0), contributed the most to the variations in the yield and WP. Scenario analysis indicated that the optimization of fertilization levels from current to optimal for each farming could increase the yield and WP by 9.7% and 14.8%, respectively; closing gaps between the farming groups and achievement of the standard of HYHW farming by all farmers could increase the yield and WP by 14.8% and 35.5%, respectively; and achieving the yield and WP potentials could increase the yield and WP by 59.1% and 54.8%, respectively. These findings provided farming-based evidence that optimal nutrient management, advanced and climate-adapted agronomy practices, and higher soil fertility are essential for future maize production.","[Yang, Wenfang; Yang, Junfang; Xing, Suli; Yue, Zengliang; Huang, Shaohui; Yang, Yunma; Jia, Liangliang] Hebei Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Hebei Fertilizer Technol Innovat Ctr, Inst Agr Resources & Environm, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jingbao] Henan Acad Agr, Cereal Crops Inst, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ketong] Agr & Rural Affairs Dept Hebei Prov, Shijiazhuang 050021, Hebei, Peoples R China",Hebei Academy of Agricultural & Forestry Sciences; Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences,"Huang, SH; Yang, YM (corresponding author), Hebei Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Hebei Fertilizer Technol Innovat Ctr, Inst Agr Resources & Environm, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China.",shaohui1988@sina.com; yangyunma@163.com,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFD1901001]; HAAFS Science and Technology Innovation Special Project [2022KJCXZX-ZHS4, 2022KJCXZX-ZHS-6]; HAAFS Scientific and Technological Innovation Personnel Project [C22R1102]; Project of the Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment [ZHS-ZLXM2022-05]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; HAAFS Science and Technology Innovation Special Project; HAAFS Scientific and Technological Innovation Personnel Project; Project of the Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment,"This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFD1901001), the HAAFS Science and Technology Innovation Special Project (2022KJCXZX-ZHS4, 2022KJCXZX-ZHS-6), the HAAFS Scientific and Technological Innovation Personnel Project (C22R1102), and the Project of the Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment (ZHS-ZLXM2022-05).",,55,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,SEP,2022,12,9,,,,,,,1983,10.3390/agronomy12091983,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12091983,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,4S4LX,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000857415400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Exposure to extreme heat causes labor supply declines, but studies to quantify the economic effects from future climate changes are limited. In this study, we adopt two different exposure-response functions relating extreme heat to the loss of labor working minutes or labor productivity. We estimate that temperature differences between 2006 and 2016 relative to 1980-1990 led to labor losses of similar to$1.7 billion annually in the USA. Under the high emissions RCP8.5 scenario, approximately 1-1.8 billion workforce hours will be lost annually in the 2050s, and 1.5-4.4 billion hours will be lost by the 2100s, depending on the exposure-response function used. The lost hours lead to an estimated $51-119 billion in losses by the 2100s, without considering future climate adaptation, demographic, employment, wage structure, or economic changes. Whereas 2006-2016 losses correspond to 0.07% of the 2016 GDP, the 2100s losses rise roughly fourfold to 0.3%, which are mainly caused by the increases of extreme heat conditions with population growth a secondary factor. With the climate change mitigation strategies of the RCP4.5 scenario, 600-2600 million hours of lost labor per year could be avoided in the 2100s, saving $20-78 billion depending on the chosen exposure-response function. We also evaluated the effect of decarbonizing the energy sector in a manner consistent with the 1.5 degrees C target of the Paris Agreement, finding that these lead to similar to 77 million avoided lost work hours worth similar to$2.5 billion annually by the 2050s with global collaboration but insignificant impacts with US action alone. Though uncertainties and limitations exist in the study, we find that extreme heat will cause large economic losses to US businesses, especially in southern states (from California to Florida), though widespread climate change mitigation has the potential to substantially reduce these losses. We find that uncertainties among the exposure-response functions used to derive the economic effects of extreme heat on labor are much larger than those from the climate models. Previous studies using only one exposure-response function may exhibit substantial biases and likely underestimate uncertainties associated with the effect of climate changes on labor.","[Zhang, Yuqiang; Shindell, Drew T.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, 9 Circuit Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Shindell, Drew T.] Tel Aviv Univ, Porter Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel",Duke University; Tel Aviv University,"Zhang, YQ (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, 9 Circuit Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",Yuqiang.Zhang@duke.edu,"Zhang, Yuqiang Alan/C-5027-2015; Shindell, Drew/D-4636-2012","Zhang, Yuqiang Alan/0000-0002-9161-7086; Shindell, Drew/0000-0003-1552-4715",National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Funding from the National Science Foundation's EaSM3 program is gratefully acknowledged.,,37,9,9,2,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Firms need to adjust to these environmental changes, which offer many opportunities for wealth and growth. There are various historical examples of technological breakthroughs over the history of modern markets that have driven growth and wealth; such as, railways, electricity, automobiles, radio, microelectronics, personal computers, biotechnology, and the internet. The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement has given the green light to clean technology firms worldwide to start commercializing their patents.

As water becomes scarcer, water-related tensions are imminent on different scales. It is the interplay of these tensions with a number of socioeconomic, political, environmental and cultural factors that determine the probability of conflict. Lamu found in the coastal part of Kenya, is a unique location in that access to water is already a major challenge. Combined with the negative impacts of climate change, and the on-going large infrastructural development in the region, Lamu is on the verge of a water crisis. As such, there is a need for research into the context specific factors that play a part in heightening the potential for water-related conflict amidst increasing water scarcity. The focus of this study was to identify and evaluate the context-specific factors that will amplify the potential for water-related conflict in Lamu. The findings suggest religion, migration, and poverty are factors that would heighten the potential for water-related conflict in the region amidst increasing water scarcity. The study recommends that these factors need to be addressed urgently and should be part of any water management mechanism in Lamu, in order to avoid water-related conflicts. Additionally, the findings imply that anticipating the stressors for water-related conflict in Lamu, will play a significant role in managing conflict and facilitating negotiations over the region's water resources.","[Maingey, Yvonne; Opondo, Maggie; Olago, Daniel; Ouma, Gilbert] Univ Nairobi, Inst Climate Change & Adaptat, POB 30197-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi,"Maingey, Y (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Inst Climate Change & Adaptat, POB 30197-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.",ym727@nyu.edu,,,,,,,58,2,2,1,7,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1606-9749,1607-0798,,WATER SUPPLY,Water Supply,FEB,2022,22,2,,,,,1983,1994,,10.2166/ws.2021.299,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2021.299,,SEP 2021,12,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,ZG7LW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000695586400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such diffusion can occur directly between neighbours or, in recent years, through various forms of information technology. Land system models and policy initiatives do not generally account for this process, partly because of a lack of empirical studies of its spatial and temporal properties. We look for evidence of the existence and form of diffusion in UK agriculture and forestry between 1968 and 2015, using logistic models of spatial dependencies in the uptake of new crops and subsidies. Strong evidence is found of spatial diffusion, with no clear evidence that its form has changed systematically over recent decades. We conclude that improved understanding of diffusion is necessary for land use policy-making and modelling to account for the spatial aggregations and time lags that remain characteristic of the uptake of new management practices.","[Brown, Calum; Rounsevell, Mark] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Environm Res IMK IFU, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Alexander, Peter; Rounsevell, Mark] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Alexander, Peter] Univ Edinburgh, Global Acad Agr & Food Secur, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Easter Bush Campus, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh,"Brown, C (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Environm Res IMK IFU, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",calum.brown@kit.edu,"Rounsevell, Mark D A/AAC-4498-2021; Brown, Calum/ABH-4673-2020","Rounsevell, Mark D A/0000-0001-7476-9398; Brown, Calum/0000-0001-9331-1008; Alexander, Peter/0000-0001-6010-1186","Helmholtz Association; UK's Global Food Security Programme project Resilience of the UK food system to Global Shocks (RUGS) [BB/N020707/1]; European Union [603542, 603416]; BBSRC [BB/N020707/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/N020707/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); UK's Global Food Security Programme project Resilience of the UK food system to Global Shocks (RUGS); European Union(European Commission); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),"This research was supported by the Helmholtz Association, the UK's Global Food Security Programme project Resilience of the UK food system to Global Shocks (RUGS, BB/N020707/1), and the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme projects LUC4C (grant no. 603542) and IMPRESSIONS (grant no. 603416).",,54,13,13,1,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1747-423X,1747-4248,,J LAND USE SCI,J.

In particular, impermeable surfaces and the removal of vegetation reduce the ability to intercept, store and infiltrate rainwater. Consequently, the volume of stormwater runoff and the risk of local flooding rises. This is further amplified by the anticipated effects of climate change leading to an increased frequency and intensity of heavy rain events. Hence, urban adaptation strategies are required to mitigate those impacts. A nature-based solution, more and more promoted in politics and academia, is urban green infrastructure as it contributes to the resilience of urban ecosystems by providing services to maintain or restore hydrological functions. However, this poses a challenge to urban planners in deciding upon effective adaptation measures as they often lack information on the performance of green infrastructure to moderate surface runoff. It remains unclear what type of green infrastructure (e.g. trees, green roofs), offers the highest potential to reduce discharge volumes and to what extent. Against this background, this study provides an approach to gather quantitative evidence on green infrastructure's regulation potential. We use a micro-scale scenario modelling approach of different variations of green cover under current and future climatic conditions. The scenarios are modelled with MIKE SHE, an integrated hydrological simulation tool, and applied to a high density residential area of perimeter blocks in Munich, Germany. The results reveal that both trees and green roofs increase water storage capacities and hence reduce surface runoff, although the main contribution of trees lies in increasing interception and evapotranspiration, whereas green roofs allow for more retention through water storage in their substrate. With increasing precipitation intensities as projected under climate change their regulating potential decreases due to limited water storage capacities. The performance of both types stays limited to a maximum reduction of 2.4% compared to the baseline scenario, unless the coverage of vegetation and permeable surfaces is significantly increased as a 14.8% reduction is achieved by greening all roof surfaces. We conclude that the study provides empirical support for the effectiveness of urban green infrastructure as nature-based solution to stormwater regulation and assists planners and operators of sewage systems in selecting the most effective measures for implementation and estimation of their effects.","[Zoelch, Teresa] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Urban Ecol & Climate Adaptat, Munich, Germany; [Henze, Lisa; Pauleit, Stephan] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Munich, Germany; [Keilholz, Patrick] DHI WASY GmbH, Off Munich, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI),"Zolch, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Urban Ecol & Climate Adaptat ZSK, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",teresa.zoelch@tum.de,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Pauleit, Stephan/0000-0002-0056-6720",Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection [TLK01U-63929],Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection,This work was supported by the Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection [project number TLK01U-63929].

Climate change will affect the distribution, productivity and profitability of coffee production in Central America, negatively impacting national economies and small farmer livelihoods. There is a need to understand how climate change affects small coffee farmers in the region in order to promote measures that allow them to cope with and adapt to these changes. Objective. The objective of this study was to describe Costa Rican small-scale coffee systems in two vulnerable agricultural landscapesand explorethe adaptation efforts that coffee farmers have implemented in these two coffee systems. Materials and methods. Structured surveys were conducted with coffeeproducing households in two highly vulnerable landscapes, Turrialba and Los Santos, in Costa Rica, from March-May 2014. The study was based on farmers' perceptions of changes in temperature and rain, reported impacts of these changes and the adaptation actions implemented at farm level. Results. Ninety-eight percentof farmers perceived changes in local climate and most of them related these changes with impacts on production (increase in pests and diseases, floweringproblems and other reported impacts). Sixty percentof the surveyed farmers had modified the management of their farms in order to reduce climate change impacts. The most common adaptation measures used by farmers were the planting of trees and the increased use of agrochemical inputs, mostly in response to perceptions of increasing temperatures. Conclusion. This study highlights the nerd for greater technical, financial and policy support to help smallholder coffee farmers implement adaptation practices and become more resilient to climate change.","[Viguera, Barbara; Alpizar, Francisco] CATIE, Apdo 7170, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [Harvey, Celia A.; Ruth Martinez-Rodriguez, M.] Moore Ctr Sci, Conservat Int, 2011 Crystal Dr,Suite 500, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Ruth Martinez-Rodriguez, M.] Unidad Cambio Climat, Programa Naciones Unidas Ambiente PNUMA, Oficina Reg Amer Latina & Caribe, Panama City, Panama; [Saborio-Rodriguez, Milagro] Univ Costa Rica, Escucla Econ, Apdo 11501, San Pedro, Costa Rica; [Saborio-Rodriguez, Milagro] Univ Costa Rica, Inst Invest Ciencias Econ, Apdo 11501, San Pedro, Costa Rica",CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; Conservation International; Universidad Costa Rica; Universidad Costa Rica,"Viguera, B (corresponding author), CATIE, Apdo 7170, Turrialba, Costa Rica.",bviguera@catie.ac.cr; falpizar@catie.ac.cr; celiaharvey@stanforda-lumni.org; ruth.martinez@un.org; milagro.saborio@ucr.ac.cr,"Martinez-Rodriguez, M Ruth/GZK-6596-2022","Martinez-Rodriguez, M Ruth/0000-0002-4690-6794; Alpizar, Francisco/0000-0001-8479-081X",,,,,49,5,6,2,38,UNIV COSTA RICA,SAN JOSE,"CENTRO INVESTIGACIONES AGRONOMICAS, APDO POSTAL 183-4050, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA",,2215-3608,,AGRON MESOAM,Agron.

Many meteorological studies have simulated potential cool roof air temperature reductions. However, economic and logistical challenges make it difficult to perform the large-scale demonstrations needed to verify these model results. This work assesses whether a neighborhood-scale cool roof demonstration could yield an observable air temperature change. We use both an idealized theoretical framework and a meteorological model to estimate the air temperature reduction that could be induced by increasing roof albedo over similar to 1 km(2) area of a city. Both the idealized analysis and model indicate that an air temperature reduction could be detected, with the model indicating a reduction of 0.5 degrees C and the idealized analysis indicating a larger reduction of 1.3 degrees C. Follow-on modeling is recommended prior to design of a neighborhood-scale demonstration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We examine major obstacles to agroforestry adoption and possible incentives proposed by farmers and civil-society organizations, and relate them to governance and international mechanisms that might play a role in agroforestry adoption. Market access for produce from diversified agroforestry remains difficult, as does its processing and transport. Moreover, farmers have difficulties in achieving the quantities and homogenous quality demanded by markets in the major cities. But most importantly, farmers and civil-society organizations saw little government support, although 'ecological production in harmony with Mother Earth' is prescribed by law and the constitution. Agroforestry farmers needed support most urgently in the initial phase, when investment costs are high and returns low. They suggested affordable credits, subsidies for diversified farming systems, and insurance against fire. We identified important albeit small steps towards developing markets for agroforestry products, but government support - mostly in the form of diesel subsidies, materials, and infrastructure - mainly benefitted largescale monocultures and cattle ranching. In response to this, interviewees opted for strengthening farmers' organizations, for demanding support with the help of civil-society organizations, and for disseminating best practices.","[Jacobi, Johanna; Altieri, Miguel A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rist, Stephan] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Bern, Switzerland",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Bern,"Jacobi, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",johanna.jacobi@berkeley.edu,"Jacobi, Johanna/AAE-6575-2019","Jacobi, Johanna/0000-0003-3432-4938",Swiss National Science Foundation (Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung) [P2BEP1_148876],Swiss National Science Foundation (Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung),The research was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung) under Grant P2BEP1_148876.,,71,11,13,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

The traditional engineering approach to flooding is designing single-purpose drainage systems, dams, and levees. These methods, however, are known to increase the long-term flood risk and harm the riverine ecosystems in urban as well as rural areas. In the present paper, we depart from resilience theory and suggest a concept to improve urban flood resilience. We identify areas where contemporary challenges call for improved collaborative urban flood management. The concept emphasizes resiliency and achieved synergy between increased capacity to handle stormwater runoff and improved experiential and functional quality of the urban environments. We identify research needs as well as experiments for improved sustainable and resilient stormwater management namely, flexibility of stormwater systems, energy use reduction, efficient land use, priority of transport and socioeconomic nexus, climate change impact, securing critical infrastructure, and resolving questions regarding responsibilities.","[Sorensen, Johanna; Larsson, Rolf; Berndtsson, Ronny] Lund Univ, Water Resources Engn, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Persson, Andreas; Pilesjo, Petter] Lund Univ, GIS Ctr Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Sternudd, Catharina] Lund Univ, Architecture & Built Environm, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Aspegren, Henrik; Jonsson, Karin; Mottaghi, Misagh] Lund Univ, Water & Environm Engn, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Nilsson, Jerry] Malmo Univ, Fac Culture & Soc, SE-20506 Malmo, Sweden; [Nordstrom, Jonas] Lund Univ, Econ Ctr, AgriFood, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Becker, Per] Lund Univ, Risk Management & Societal Safety, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Berndtsson, Ronny] Lund Univ, Ctr Middle Eastern Studies, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Mobini, Shifteh] VA Syd, SE-21120 Malmo, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; Malmo University; Lund University; Lund University; Lund University,"Berndtsson, R (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Water Resources Engn, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.;Berndtsson, R (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Middle Eastern Studies, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",johanna.sorensen@tvrl.lth.se; andreas.persson@nateko.lu.se; catharina.sternudd@arkitektur.lth.se; Henrik.Aspegren@vasyd.se; jerry.nilsson@mah.se; jonas.nordstrom@agrifood.lu.se; karin.jonsson@chemeng.lth.se; misagh.mottaghi@chemeng.lth.se; per.becker@risk.lth.se; petter.pilesjo@gis.lu.se; rolf.larsson@tvrl.lth.se; ronny.berndtsson@tvrl.lth.se; Shifteh.mobini@tvrl.lth.se,"Aspegren, Henrik/K-1452-2019; Sörensen, Johanna Lykke/AAG-3189-2019; Nordström, Jonas/AAR-6623-2020; Berndtsson, Ronny/C-7449-2015; Aspegren, Henrik/Q-1200-2018","Aspegren, Henrik/0000-0001-5805-1589; Sörensen, Johanna Lykke/0000-0002-2312-4917; Nordström, Jonas/0000-0001-8608-7976; Berndtsson, Ronny/0000-0003-1473-0138; Aspegren, Henrik/0000-0001-5805-1589; Mottaghi, Misagh/0000-0003-0424-8655; Nilsson, Jerry/0000-0003-1063-7833; Becker, Per/0000-0001-9379-9461; Mobini, Shifteh/0000-0002-3365-7346","Swedish Research Council Formas [942-2015-149]; Sweden Water Research, Goteborg City; Hoje a Water Council; Skane Region; Lansforsakringar Skane","Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Sweden Water Research, Goteborg City; Hoje a Water Council; Skane Region; Lansforsakringar Skane","This research was funded by The Swedish Research Council Formas under contract 942-2015-149.

Our objective is to use Social Network Analysis (SNA) as a tool to identify potential opportunities for improving weather and market advisory dissemination to rural communities and to explore the relationship between farmers' access to information and yield and selling price. As a case study, we applied SNA to 313 farmers in Bangladesh to analyze weather and market information networks and farmers' friendship networks as a potential proxy for information exchange. Farmer access to information, dominant sources of information and potential speed of information transfer were key criteria for our analysis. Our results indicate that weather and market information networks in coastal Bangladesh depended on certain key sources of information, while the friendship network was decentralized and interconnected, with few isolated farmers. We showed that farmers networks are significantly correlated with several socio-agroeconomic variables; however, there was little indication of a relationship between information access and yield and selling price. We conclude that a mixed approach of targeting central actors and broadcasting information to farmers may be a suitable strategy to reach a maximum number of farmers as well as the most isolated farmers. Our study highlights that SNA can be a promising tool to reveal hidden structures of information flows in farmer communities and provide valuable insights for developing information dissemination strategies that reach even the most remote and underserved farmers.","[Simon, Wolfram J.; Groot, Jeroen C.

There is increasing sectoral evidence on the implementation of successful adaptation actions. However, the success of these actions when we consider the interdependencies among sectors remains debatable. This paper aims to assess who benefits from implementing adaptation options in a multiuser river basin to both climate-induced and demographic stress on water use. Our analysis relies on a hydro-economic model that considers two sets of water users: agriculture and urban households. We innovate in our modelling approach by analyzing and explicitly integrating the household-level economic behavior through its water demand. We assess the cross-user consequences of autonomous and planned adaptation actions. We provide insights into the different trade-offs at the basin level, demonstrating the compatibilities and divergences between agriculture and household-level water demand. We found different consequences of implementing either autonomous or planned adaptation measures. For instance, a decentralized scheme would drive negative implications for the entire basin, although the less water-intensive sector will be better off. On the other hand, different policy interventions would drive positive consequences for the entire basin, with the most water-intensive sector benefiting the most. These results highlight the distributional consequences across users of different adaptation measures.","[Ponce Oliva, Roberto D.; Vasquez-Lavin, Felipe] Univ Desarrollo, Sch Business & Econ, Ainavillo 456, Concepcion, Chile; [Ponce Oliva, Roberto D.; Fernandez Jorquera, Francisco; Vasquez-Lavin, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile; [Ponce Oliva, Roberto D.] ANID FONDAP 15130015, Water Res Ctr Agr & Min, Victoria 1295, Concepcion, Chile; [Arias Montevechio, Esteban] Univ Concepcion, Dept Econ, Victoria 471, Concepcion, Chile; [Fernandez Jorquera, Francisco] Univ Mayor, Fac Sci, Sch Agron, Santiago, Chile; [Vasquez-Lavin, Felipe] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, CR2, Santiago, Chile; [Vasquez-Lavin, Felipe] Millennium Nucleus Ctr Socioecon Impact Environm, Santiago, Chile; [Stehr, Alejandra] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Ambientales, Dept Ingn Ambiental, Concepcion, Chile; [Stehr, Alejandra] Univ Concepcion, Ctr EULA, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad del Desarrollo; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad Mayor; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion,"Oliva, RDP (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Sch Business & Econ, Ainavillo 456, Concepcion, Chile.;Oliva, RDP (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile.;Oliva, RDP (corresponding author), ANID FONDAP 15130015, Water Res Ctr Agr & Min, Victoria 1295, Concepcion, Chile.",robertoponce@udd.cl,"Stehr, Alejandra/ABE-6307-2021; Fernández, Francisco/L-7905-2017; Arias, Esteban/AAN-1465-2021","Stehr, Alejandra/0000-0002-8323-654X; Fernández, Francisco/0000-0001-8655-0748; Vasquez Lavin, Felipe/0000-0002-0767-998X; Ponce, Roberto D./0000-0001-5024-7456",International Development Research Centre (IDRC-Canada) [106924-001]; ANID PIA/BASAL [FB0002];  [ANID/FONDAP/15130015];  [NSFC190002],International Development Research Centre (IDRC-Canada)(CGIAR); ANID PIA/BASAL; ; ,"International Development Research Centre (IDRC-Canada) (No 106924-001): Roberto D.

We, conclude that some of the explanation for low levels of adaptation relates to a desire to defend existing sensemaking structures and associated identities. Sensemaking structures are only revised if these structures are not critical to business identity, or if a flood constitutes an ontological shock' and renders untenable existing assumptions regarding long-term business continuity. This article has implications for adaptation to the growing risk of flooding, climate change and external shocks. Future research analysing external shocks would benefit from using a sensemaking approach and survey studies should include measurements of ontological' impact as well as material and financial damage.

We compare different levels of trust in local governments, volunteers in emergency and relief services, and neighbours, and how trust in these groups shapes citizens' perceptions and actions relating to flood risks. Structural equation modelling is applied to a sample of 2007 flood-prone households in Austria. A series of cognitive and behavioural responses to flood risks is regressed on trust shown to the three groups. Our findings show that citizens show great trust and attribute high competence to volunteers, which increases risk perception and reduces denial and wishful thinking. Trust in local government downplays risks, makes citizens rely on external help, and promotes fatalism and wishful thinking. Trust in neighbours increases reliance on social support and reinforces wishful thinking. These trust effects reflect the roles and risk narratives of the respective groups.

This will enable engineers to address the challenges of Africa's vulnerability to climate change and variability which has direct impacts on water availability, access and use which is the source of food and livelihood security for millions of the continent's population. Climate change and variability is projected to affect the hydrological cycle, which, in turn, may alter the balance between water availability leading to uncertainty as to the onset of rainy seasons, dry spells, and more frequent extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods. Using case studies, the authors outline adaptation strategies to be adopted using an integrated approach in the consideration of climate change in engineering design and management of water resources systems that also link to operational aspects of water development projects. The paper also provides a set of suggested best practices in engineering design and innovative approaches to water development involving operation and management of dams and catchments in the face of climate change and variability.","[Alemaw, Berhanu F.] Univ Botswana, Dept Geol, Gaborone, Botswana; [Sebusang, Nako M.] Univ Botswana, Dept Civil Engn, Gaborone, Botswana",University of Botswana; University of Botswana,"Alemaw, BF (corresponding author), Univ Botswana, Dept Geol, Gaborone, Botswana.",bfalemaw@gmail.com,,"Alemaw, Berhanu Fanta/0000-0002-2588-9016",NUFU Project 'Capacity Building in Water Sciences for Improved Assessment and Management of Water Resources' [NUFUPRO-2007/10079]; CGIAR Challenge Programme on Water and Food (CPWF) in the Limpopo Basin,NUFU Project 'Capacity Building in Water Sciences for Improved Assessment and Management of Water Resources'; CGIAR Challenge Programme on Water and Food (CPWF) in the Limpopo Basin,"This manuscript is the result of the first author's research activities conducted at University of Dar es Salaam (1995-1999) and the University of Botswana (2001 to date) as well as experience in the involvement in various water development projects in Africa and with major funded research projects including the NUFU Project 'Capacity Building in Water Sciences for Improved Assessment and Management of Water Resources (NUFUPRO-2007/10079)', and the CGIAR Challenge Programme on Water and Food (CPWF) especially in the Limpopo Basin.

Participatory action research with environmental and natural resource management (NRM) planners, revealed that the contested, complex nature of NRM challenges the ready utility of AP planning implied by many other published examples. Findings indicate this is because current AP approaches do not yet engage with contested goals and knowledge, and tend to assume that actions to achieve goals are largely technical and unproblematic. Drawing on these findings, this paper develops an argument for a diagnostic, problem-structuring approach as one way of improving the utility of AP planning in contested, complex problems. We posit this approach could help guide selection of 'fit-for-problem' analysis and planning methods to develop practicable AP plans that support efforts towards transformational adaptation. Issues of engaging with diverse problem frames, scientific contestations, and institutional dimensions of governance remain potentially fruitful research foci in AP planning.","[Bosomworth, Karyn] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Climate Change & Resilience Grp, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Leith, Peat] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Private Bag 98, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Harwood, Andrew] Univ Tasmania, Geog & Spatial Sci, Sch Land & Food, Private Bag 98, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Wallis, Phillip J.] Victorian Dept Environm Land Water & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Bosomworth, K (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Climate Change & Resilience Grp, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",karyn.bosomworth@rmit.edu.au,"Bosomworth, Karyn/A-6435-2016; Harwood, Andrew/C-2388-2014; Leith, Peat/ABB-2829-2021","Bosomworth, Karyn/0000-0001-9907-0858; Harwood, Andrew/0000-0003-4562-2906; ",Australian Government through the Regional Natural Resource Management Planning for Climate Change Fund,Australian Government through the Regional Natural Resource Management Planning for Climate Change Fund,The research from which this paper draws received funding from the then Australian Government through the Regional Natural Resource Management Planning for Climate Change Fund.

From these maps, the most vulnerable areas for each basin are identified using GIS mapping software. Sixteen inundation risk maps were generated, four for each river basin, in terms of built-up areas, roads, bridges, and dams. Results showed that the northern part of Cagayan River Basin and the central parts of the Agno and Mindanao River Basins are the most flood-prone areas, while the Buayan-Malungon River Basin will have no significant inundation problems.

After this a series of workshops were held, where an RDM method was used on local situations and follow-up interviews assessed the success and potential of the tool. Results suggest that the process addresses uncertainty, encourages bottom-up approaches and provides a tool for creating adaptive pathways in a clear and concise manner.

However, Coase did not elaborate on transitions between institutions which incur positive transaction costs that are characterized by numerous institutional complementarities; that is, feedback loops that inform the need for, and pathways toward, institutional change. Economic investigations of complementary modes of (re)allocation are rarely undertaken, let alone studies of transitions between modes. However, modes of (re)allocation that achieve similar results at less cost are generally viewed as having production-raising value. This paper measures the costs of transitioning drought management institutions in Italy toward informal, participatory, and consensus-based approaches during several recent drought events. The chosen model is Drought Steering Committees, which offer a substitute for current formal (less flexible) planning approaches, and where lower transaction costs that are associated with the transition are inferred. Our results highlight the relevance of empirical assessments of 'costly' transitions based on a historical study of transaction costs, as well as supporting previous works that highlight the value of contextual analysis in economic studies, in order to identify the benefits of institutional investment.","[Loch, Adam] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Santato, Silvia; Mysiak, Jaroslav] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-30175 Venezia Marghera, Italy; [Santato, Silvia; Mysiak, Jaroslav] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Dionisio Perez-Blanco, C.] Univ Salamanca, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Salamanca 37007, Spain",University of Adelaide; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of Salamanca,"Perez-Blanco, CD (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",adam.loch@adelaide.edu.au; silvia.santato@cmcc.it; Dionisio.perez@usal.es; jaroslay.mysiak@cmcc.it,"Mysiak, Jaroslav/A-8683-2019; Loch, Adam/F-4246-2013; Perez-Blanco, C.

Because of these rapid shifts, some conventional adaptation strategies may have limited success in reducing the impact of climate change. In some circumstances, there will be a need for considering transformative changes as part of adaptation strategies that can provide long-term benefits and address the root causes of vulnerability. However, to date, there is limited understanding of how societies respond to, or drive, transformative changes in social-ecological systems due to climate change impact. We reviewed 60 empirical case studies of shifts in trajectories of social-ecological systems in tropical and subtropical countries that were driven by climate change to identify how societies responded to these shifts and the extent to which societies used transformative adaptation as part of this response. In the case studies, we identified three types of shifts driven by climate change depending on whether the shift occurred in the ecological, social, or social-ecological system. Climate change shifted the trajectories of social-ecological systems by altering the feedback loops connecting soil, water, or vegetation conditions with peoples livelihoods and well-being. In response to these shifts, people adjusted land use policies and practices, but only one-quarter of the reported adaptation actions included transformative adaptation. A more holistic understanding of how climate change modifies interactions in social-ecological systems and leads to shifts in system trajectories could help identify appropriate adaptation responses, including transformative adaptation, that provide long-term and sustainable benefits.","[Fedele, Giacotno; Donatti, Camila I.; Harvey, Celia A.; Hannah, Lee; Hole, David G.] Conservat Int, Moore Ctr Sci, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Donatti, Camila I.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagsraff, AZ USA; [Harvey, Celia A.] Monteverde Inst, Puntarenas, Costa Rica; [Hannah, Lee] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Hole, David G.] Univ Durham, Dept Biosci, Durham, England",Conservation International; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Durham University,"Fedele, G (corresponding author), Conservat Int, Moore Ctr Sci, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",,"Donatti, Camila I./AAV-2324-2020",,"Ann and Tom Friedman Fellowship for Science at Conservation International, Arlington, VA","Ann and Tom Friedman Fellowship for Science at Conservation International, Arlington, VA","This work was supported by the Ann and Tom Friedman Fellowship for Science at Conservation International, Arlington, VA.",,79,17,17,3,27,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

The built environment can mitigate the public health risk of overheating and recommendations for precautionary actions on homes have been published by government and industry. A key player in improving resilience is the householder, who can determine whether precautionary measures will be installed in their home. Previous research on flooding has applied Protection Motivation Theory to examine determinants of householder response to risk. However, flooding risks differ from those of overheating in several ways. The current study builds on this work to address the gap on understanding householder propensity to install precautionary measures against overheating. A large-scale survey (n = 1007) of householders was conducted in the south of England and regression analyses applied to the data. While threat appraisal (perception of threat risk and severity) had an influence on motivation to take action, coping appraisal (perception of ability to make changes, of the effectiveness of the changes and of convenience) was a stronger predictor, particularly for flat dwellers. Previous experience of overheating did not directly influence protection motivation. Age was negatively related to intentions to act but income was not a significant factor. Recommendations for policy and practice include focusing on enhancing coping appraisal, targeting older citizens, customising initiatives by type of property and occupancy, and framing mitigating actions in ways other than protection from overheating.

We discuss a case study project investigating possible interactions between climate change impacts and a proposed major port expansion in Australia. The study engaged participants from the private sector, government and environmental groups, with input from college students from the local area. Semi-structured interviews and a scenario workshop were employed, creating individual space for expression of ideas, then a collaborative space for sharing these, exploring differences of perception and meaning, and developing a set of possible and plausible scenarios. Whilst the workshop resulted in consensus on key issues and proposed actions, intended to inform policy formation and planning, there was an unforeseen lack of short term follow up and of the groups working more closely together. We discuss the reasons for this through reflective critical analysis of both our own process and of contingent factors in the wider contextual environment. We conclude that the basic scenario approach is valuable, but does not itself act as a catalyst for effecting change when multiple agencies, interests and agendas and strong contingent factors are present.

The results reveal that there are considerable gaps in current planning for SLR. Almost one-third of municipalities lack guiding planning documents for SLR, and more than two-thirds do not discuss SLR beyond 2100.

Furthermore, it significantly limits the infiltration of stormwater into the ground; this, in turn, reduces groundwater supply, ultimately intensifying drought effects. In order to adapt urbanized areas to climate change, the objective is to stop these unfavorable processes and strive for recreating the natural water cycle through developing decentralized stormwater management practices on private properties. An important management instrument that motivates property owners to invest is economic incentives, such as stormwater or impact fees associated with a system of rebates/discounts that depend on the applied stormwater runoff reduction solutions. Herein, we analyze a new economic instrument-a fee for reducing natural field retention-which is planned to be introduced in Poland. We assessed the incentive and funding (income-generating) function of the fee based on the example of the Sudol river catchment in Krakow, Poland. The research involved conducting simulation calculations and assessing the incentive impact through calculating investment Net Present Value (NPV), which is the investor's response to the proposed economic incentives included in the structure of the fee and the rebate system. This study demonstrated errors and loopholes in the suggested fee rules-too low rates that prevent achieving profitability (negative NPV) for small-scale stormwater retention practices, and incorrect conditions that enable obtaining discounted fees. We also estimated the fee rate that ensures investment profitability.","[Godyn, Izabela; Muszynski, Krzysztof; Grela, Agnieszka] Politech Krakowska, Fac Environm Engn & Energy, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Technology,"Godyn, I (corresponding author), Politech Krakowska, Fac Environm Engn & Energy, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland.",izabela.godyn@pk.edu.pl; krzysztof.muszynski@pk.edu.pl; agnieszka.grela@pk.edu.pl,"Godyń, Izabela/S-6405-2018","Godyń, Izabela/0000-0002-2749-1167; Muszynski, Krzysztof/0000-0003-0073-789X",Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange [PPI/APM/2018/1/00027/U/001],Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange(Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA)),FundingThis research was funded by the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange within the framework of the grant: E-mobility and sustainable materials and technologies EMMAT (grant number: PPI/APM/2018/1/00027/U/001).,,114,4,4,3,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2022,14,4,,,,,,,560,10.3390/w14040560,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14040560,,,28,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,ZJ7YA,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000762517700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analysis shows that if a risk-mitigating policy is based on the perceived riskiness of that risk, it will call for disproportionate responses (compared to what the real' risk suggests) by either under- or over-investing in risk-reducing policies, depending on the characteristics of the problem, implying significant volatility in the policy response. This type of response provides at least three challenges to society: policy cycles where implementation lags behind the actual change in risk, a lock-in to inefficient technologies and additional costs. Finally, this paper addresses the question of how the above-mentioned challenges can be managed through proper risk communication.","Univ So Denmark, Dept Business & Environm Econ, Esbjerg, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Brandt, US (corresponding author), Univ So Denmark, Dept Business & Environm Econ, Esbjerg, Denmark.",usb@sam.sdu.dk,"brandt, urs steiner/GZL-6844-2022",,,,,,56,7,7,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-9877,1466-4461,,J RISK RES,J.

In considering this issue, it is useful to distinguish between two different time scales: inter-annual and inter-decadal. Inter-annual adjustments in international trade can play an important role in shifting supplies from food surplus regions to regions facing food deficits which emerge as a consequence of extreme weather events, civil strife, and/or other disruptions The first section of the paper explores the evidence on increased inter-annual supply side volatility, as well as historical and prospective analyses of adaptation to such volatility and the role international trade can play in mitigating the adverse impacts on food security. In the long run, we expect that the fundamental patterns of comparative advantage will be altered by the changing climate as well as availability of technology and endowments (water for irrigation, labor force, capital stock). In a freely functioning global economy, long run trade patterns will respond to this evolving comparative advantage. However, historical food trade has not been free of obstacles, with both tariff and non-tariff barriers often limiting the adjustment of trade to the changing economic landscape. This section of the paper capitalizes on a newly available library of climate impact results in order to characterize the tails (both optimistic and pessimistic) of this distribution. We then explore the potential for a more freely functioning global trading system to deliver improved long run food security in 2050.","[Baldos, Uris Lantz C.; Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Baldos, ULC (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ubaldos@purdue.edu,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Integrated Assessment Research Program [DE-SC005171]; OECD Cooperative Research Programme on Biological Resource Management for Sustainable Agricultural Systems","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Integrated Assessment Research Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); OECD Cooperative Research Programme on Biological Resource Management for Sustainable Agricultural Systems(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","The authors acknowledge support for the underlying research into the climate-food-energy-land-water nexus from U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Integrated Assessment Research Program, Grant No. DE-SC005171.; This paper was part of a workshop sponsored by the OECD Cooperative Research Programme on Biological Resource Management for Sustainable Agricultural Systems.",,54,68,69,17,98,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1876-4517,1876-4525,,FOOD SECUR,Food Secur.,APR,2015,7,2,,,,,275,290,,10.1007/s12571-015-0435-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-015-0435-z,,,16,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Food Science & Technology,CF6YG,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000352702200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Flood-proofing of buildings is often advocated as an effective strategy for limiting damage caused by floods. However, few empirical studies have estimated the damage that can be avoided by implementing such flood damage mitigation measures. This study estimates potential damage savings and the cost-effectiveness of specific flood damage mitigation measures that were implemented by households during major flood events in France. For this purpose, data about flood damage experienced and household flood preparedness were collected using a survey of 885 French households in three flood-prone regions that face different flood hazards. Four main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, using regression analysis results in improved estimates of the effectiveness of mitigation measures than methods used by earlier studies that compare mean damage suffered between households who have, and who have not, taken these measures. Second, this study has provided empirical insights showing that some mitigation measures can substantially reduce damage during floods. Third, the effectiveness of the mitigation measures is very regional dependent, which can be explained by the different characteristics of the flood hazard in our sample areas that experience either slow onset river flooding or more rapid flash and coastal flooding. Fourth, the cost-efficiency of the flood damage mitigation measures depends strongly on the flood probability faced by households. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in sub-Saharan Africa where rainfed agriculture is the dominant livelihood strategy, climate change is increasingly undermining rural livelihoods. Despite several policy efforts to improve climate adaptation in this context, smallholders' lack of access to credit constitutes one of the crucial dimensions of climatic vulnerability. Using an ordered logistic regression model, this study analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey (n = 1,100) in the Upper West Region to examine the relationship between smallholder farmers' access to credit and their perceived climate change resilience. Findings show that households with access to credit from informal sources were more likely (OR = 1.73, p <= 0.05) to report good resilience compared to those without access. Households that received remittances were also more likely (OR = 3.26, p <= 0.001) to report good resilience compared to non-receiving households. Further, households that did not rear any livestock surprisingly emerged more likely (OR = 2.00, p <= 0.001) to report good resilience compared to those that reared livestock. On the contrary, households that had experienced any climatic events in the past 12 months before the study were less likely (OR = 0.29, p <= 0.01) to report good resilience compared to households that did not experience any events. These findings highlight the potential contribution of informal credit sources to improving rural agricultural productivity and climate change resilience. Informal credit sources may be capable of providing smallholder farmers with the needed access to more flexible financial credit options. The study provides policy recommendations on what might be useful to vulnerable groups, and others in similar contexts.","[Batung, Evans Sumabe; Mohammed, Kamaldeen; Luginaah, Isaac] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog & Environm, 1151 Richmond St, Richmond, ON, Canada; [Kansanga, Moses Mosonsieyiri] George Washington Univ, Dept Geog, 2121 1 St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson] Univ Denver, Dept Geog & Environm, 2050 East Iliff Ave, Denver, CO 80210 USA",Western University (University of Western Ontario); George Washington University; University of Denver,"Batung, ES (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog & Environm, 1151 Richmond St, Richmond, ON, Canada.",ebatung@uwo.ca,,"Luginaah, Isaac/0000-0001-7858-3048; Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson/0000-0002-6407-1970; Batung, Evans/0000-0003-1943-8646",Western Internal Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Explore grant [46416],Western Internal Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Explore grant,This study was funded by Western Internal Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Explore grant (Grant Number: ROLA #46416).,,110,2,2,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Yet, little is known about what the predominantly Inuit population of Kalaallit Nunaat thinks about adaptation opportunities arising from the melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Here we conduct a nationally representative survey (N = 939) of Kalaallit (Greenlanders') views on glacially derived sand extraction, finding that large majorities support extracting and exporting sand but oppose foreign involvement. This pattern of support persists at both the national and subnational levels. Public preferences largely align with Kalaallit Nunaat's current mineral policy mandating environmental and economic impact assessments of new resource opportunities. In addition, those aware of human-caused climate change have significantly higher odds of both supporting sand extraction and prioritizing environmental impact assessment. Our results reveal broad support for domestically involved, environmentally assessed and economically appraised opportunistic adaptation to Greenland's melting ice sheet and accumulating sand resources. Sand has become an increasingly scarce critical resource. As a result of changing climate, Greenland now receives large deposits of glacially derived sand along its coasts.

The results indicate that existing infrastructure design approaches have varying levels of validity for addressing climate change across spatial and temporal scales.

In this context we study the impact of climate shocks on the agricultural practices of farmers who grow two main staples: maize and potato. We focus on four types of agricultural techniques: (a) those that reduce soil degradation, (b) those that conserve water, (c) the application of inorganic fertilizer, and (d) the application of pesticides and herbicides. We combine three rounds of cross-sectional data from the Peru National Agricultural Survey with long-term climate data to construct georeferenced shocks of abnormal rainfall levels and variation. Our empirical strategy controls for time-invariant characteristics of small localities, secular time trends, and farmer and farm characteristics to estimate how shocks affect farmers' choices in subsequent growing cycles. Our findings show that: (a) farmers reduce soil conservation practices after one year of high rainfall, but multiple years of low rainfall increase adoption significantly; (b) the rate of pesticide use increases by eight percentage points following a drought year but is insensitive to multiple shock years; (c) water conservation measures are used less after high precipitation or when volatility was unusually low, and multiple years of insufficient rain tend to enhance this response; and (d) fertilizer use is less sensitive than other outcomes to weather fluctuations. These findings suggest that understanding how responsive farmers' practices are to weather shocks can inform policy design and help mitigate risks from changing weather patterns.","[Tambet, Heleene] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Stopnitzky, Yaniv] Univ San Francisco, Dept Econ, San Francisco, CA USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of San Francisco,"Tambet, H (corresponding author), Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",htambet@cgiar.org,,,,,,,64,6,6,8,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Infrastructure designed to control or regulate natural resources may serve as an important lens through which people experience climate, and thus may influence perceptions. Likewise, perceptions may be influenced by personal beliefs about climate change and whether it is human-induced. Here we examine farmer perceptions of historical climate change, how perceptions are related to observed trends in regional climate, how perceptions are related to the presence of irrigation infrastructure, and how perceptions are related to beliefs and concerns about climate change. We focus on the regions of Marlborough and Hawke's Bay in New Zealand, where irrigation is utilized on the majority of cropland. Data are obtained through analysis of historical climate records from local weather stations, interviews (n = 20), and a farmer survey (n = 490). Across both regions, no significant historical trends in annual precipitation and summer temperatures since 1980 are observed, but winter warming trends are significant at around 0.2-0.3 degrees C per decade. A large fraction of farmers perceived increases in annual rainfall despite instrumental records indicating no significant trends, a finding that may be related to greater perceived water availability associated with irrigation growth. A greater fraction of farmers perceived rainfall increases in Marlborough, where irrigation growth has been most substantial. We find those classes of farmers more likely to have irrigation were also significantly more likely to perceive an increase in annual rainfall. Furthermore, we demonstrate that perceptions of changing climate - regardless of their accuracy - are correlated with increased belief in climate change and an increased concern for future climate impacts. Those farmers that believe climate change is occurring and is human induced are more likely to perceive temperature increases than farmers who believe climate change is not occurring and is not human induced. These results suggest that perceptions are influenced by a variety of personal and environmental factors, including infrastructure, which may in turn alter decisions about climate adaptation.

In recent years, promoting agriculture in cities seemed counterintuitive. Nevertheless, during the last decades, agricultural practices in the urban realm have been encouraged, and with great effort, by a group of cities worldwide. Quito is one of them. The Participatory Urban Agriculture Project (AGRUPAR) has promoted and supported urban agriculture in Quito for almost 20 years. However, aware that the food situation of its population requires stronger efforts, the city has decided to go beyond urban agricultural production. Led by AGRUPAR, and together with other municipal actors, such as the Metropolitan Directorate of Resilience, and the Secretariat of Productive Development, the Municipality of the Metropolitan District of Quito (MDMQ) is implementing public food policies that have outlined, as one of their central objectives, the need to strengthen the city's food security and food resilience. This text presents a brief history of urban agriculture in Quito and reviews some of the achievements of AGRUPAR. Based on this experience, the authors hypothesize that cities that have gone from promoting urban orchards to establishing urban agricultural programs are in a better position to implement food policies as a contribution to resilience and sustainable urban development. This article displays the importance of clearly understanding the food value chain and the set of strategic dimensions that currently shape the agri-food system. The aim is to better connect the production, processing and transformation, distribution, sale and storage, commercialization, consumption, and post-consumption with the right to food, the right to the city, and a healthy environment to achieve food security. Although the results achieved thus far are valuable, if the benefits of urban agriculture are to contribute to improving Quito's food security and resilience, additional progress is necessary. Therefore, it is imperative that a proposal be presented which includes urban agriculture as part of a city-scale urban policy.","[Rodriguez, Alexandra] Head Participatory Urban Agr Project AGRUPAR, Agcy Econ Promot CONQUITO, Quito, Ecuador; [Jacome-Polit, David] Univ Amer UDLA, Rikolto Int, Quito, Ecuador; [Santandreu, Alain] Consortium Hlth Environm & Dev ECOSAD, Lima, Peru; [Paredes, Denisse] Univ Tecnol Equinoccial UTE, Rikolto Int, Quito, Ecuador; [alvaro, Nataly Pinto] Rikolto, Quito, Ecuador",Universidad de Las Americas - Ecuador,"Rodriguez, A (corresponding author), Head Participatory Urban Agr Project AGRUPAR, Agcy Econ Promot CONQUITO, Quito, Ecuador.;Jacome-Polit, D (corresponding author), Univ Amer UDLA, Rikolto Int, Quito, Ecuador.",arodriguez@conquito.org.ec; cdjacomepolit@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,0,0,5,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

The poorest people are the most vulnerable, as they do not have sufficient means to cope with environmental risks. In the absence of effective safety nets, poor people become trapped in chronic poverty due to the recurrent damage caused by natural disasters. Recently, there has been growing optimism among policy makers and practitioners about the role of microinsurance as a safety net against weather risks for the poorest and most vulnerable people of Bangladesh. This article sheds light on this issue by synthesizing the findings of half a decade of research on the prospects of weather microinsurance in Bangladesh. Three key conclusions are drawn from the synthesis. First, the market for a standard, stand-alone weather microinsurance in Bangladesh is characterized by low demand, poor governance, and lack of prospects for commercial viability. Second, although the index-based flood insurance model has theoretical appeal (i.e., no moral hazard or adverse selection and low transaction cost), high economic cost might be associated with its highly complex practical implementation. Finally, the current (un)regulatory arrangement of microinsurance supply in Bangladesh, which does not guarantee accountability and protect clients' rights, is likely to increase rather than decrease poor people's vulnerability. The study makes two key recommendations: (1) exploring options for nontraditional insurance models (e.g., group-based and ex-post premium-based models), and (2) considering regulatory reforms to ensure good governance and to foster market efficiency through low-cost delivery and product innovation.","UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Akter, S (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",sonia.akter@ufz.de,"Akter, Sonia/J-2208-2014","Akter, Sonia/0000-0001-5644-9403",,,,,56,17,17,0,41,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1070-4965,,,J ENVIRON DEV,J.

An incentivised economic lab experiment is conducted on a sample of students in Bilbao (Basque Country, Spain). A 2 x 2 between-subject design is used to measure investment behaviour with and without exposure to a flood risk map and after exposure to impacts framed as economic losses versus number of persons affected. Experience is measured through a 2-period repeated game within-subject design. Flood risk maps and impacts framed as number of persons affected were conducive to more experiential forms of decision-making, while decisions based on impacts framed as economic losses were more cognitive in nature. Those that saw text-only framings used a combination of cognitive and experiential factors for making decisions. While exposure to maps evoked more affect-driven responses, they were associated with lower ratings of positive affect and self-efficacy, and resulted in lower investments in protection compared to text-only framings. Greater experiential processing was found for impact framings based on persons affected, but they were not especially effective at increasing personal relevance of the issue or in driving investments. Individuals who experienced losses from a hypothetical flood event had greater ratings of negative affect, and made subsequent decisions that were more affect-driven in nature. In contrast, individuals who did not experience losses had greater ratings of positive affect, and made subsequent decisions based on primarily cognitive factors. Investments in protection reduced for those who did not experience losses, and remained the same for those who did experience losses. Results suggest that changes in adaptation investments between decision points may be dependent on both the experience (or lack thereof) of losses, as well as the extent to which individuals were risk-averse or risk-taking in previous investment decisions.","[Markanday, Ambika; Galarraga, Ibon] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Parque Cient UPV EHU, Leioa, Spain; [Galarraga, Ibon] Univ Basque Country, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Bilbao, Spain",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of Basque Country,"Markanday, A (corresponding author), BC3, Edificio Sede 1,Planta 1,Parque Cient UPV EHU, Leioa 48940, Spain.",Ambika.markanday@bc3research.org; ibon.galarraga@bc3research.org,,,Horizon 2020 COACCH Project [776479]; Basque Government through the BERC; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through the BC3 Maria de Maetzu [MDM-2017-0714],Horizon 2020 COACCH Project; Basque Government through the BERC(Basque Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through the BC3 Maria de Maetzu,"This research was supported by the Horizon 2020 COACCH Project (grant agreement no. 776479).

Yet under certain circumstances, the impact of weather fluctuations in the current year can be carried over into the future. Using agricultural production as an example, we empirically investigate how past weather fluctuations affect economic decision-making by shifting agents' subjective expectations over future climate. We find that agricultural producers do not form expectations on future climate using only long-run normals, and instead engage in a combination of heuristics, including the availability heuristic and the reinforcement strategy. Adopting these learning mechanisms causes farmers to significantly over-react to more recent fluctuations in weather and water availability when making ex ante acreage and crop allocation decisions.","[Ji, Xinde] Brandeis Univ, 415 South St MS 021, Waltham, MA 02453 USA; [Cobourn, Kelly M.] Virginia Tech, 310 West Campus Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Brandeis University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Ji, XD (corresponding author), Brandeis Univ, 415 South St MS 021, Waltham, MA 02453 USA.",xji@brandeis.edu; kellyc13@vt.edu,,"Ji, Xinde/0000-0002-1453-4949","NASA Land Cover/Land Use Change (LCLUC) Program [NNX14AH15G]; Virginia Tech Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science; National Science Foundation's Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) program [1517823]; NASA [674564, NNX14AH15G] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",NASA Land Cover/Land Use Change (LCLUC) Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Virginia Tech Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science; National Science Foundation's Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) program; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the NASA Land Cover/Land Use Change (LCLUC) Program (Award NNX14AH15G), the Virginia Tech Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science, and the National Science Foundation's Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) program (Award 1517823).

However, there is growing evidence that ethnocentrism and privilege are shaping coastal management policies while many communities with climate justice issues struggle to build resilience. Particularly, rural coastal communities, contrasting urban areas, have limited access to centralized planning efforts, unique local contexts for outreach, compounding social vulnerabilities (job loss, out-migration, limited social services), and receive less attention from resilience researchers. Following calls to integrate climate justice into resilience praxis, we assess perceptions of adaptive capacity within predominately African American communities in a rural low-lying coastal region in eastern North Carolina. We add a climate justice lens to evaluate the previously-validated Rural Coastal Community Resilience (RCCR) framework. The RCCR is intended to improve planning efforts by providing climate change information, initiating conversations, and contributing to resilience theory. In contrast to its previous applications, engagement led to declines in perceived adaptive capacity. This result highlights that the information sharing goals of the engagement efforts were poorly aligned with community concerns and threat perceptions. Additionally, perceived climate injustices emerged revealing instances of adaptation oppression. This study recommends strategies to rethink traditional extension efforts to improve inclusiveness by deeply interrogating the inherent whiteness of standard modes of communicating climate science.","[Jurjonas, Matthew; Seekamp, Erin; Cutts, Bethany] NC State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Rivers, Louie, III] NC State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Cutts, Bethany] NC State Univ, Ctr Geospatial Analyt, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University,"Seekamp, E (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Coll Nat Resources, 3028C Biltmore Hall,Campus Box 8004,2820 Faucette, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",elseekam@ncsu.edu,,"Seekamp, Erin/0000-0001-5082-1921; Cutts, Bethany/0000-0001-7879-526X","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program Office [NA11OAR4310148, NA16OAR4310163]; College of Natural Resources at NC State University's Building Interdisciplinary Strengths initiative",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); College of Natural Resources at NC State University's Building Interdisciplinary Strengths initiative,This work was inspired by and contributes to a research project partially supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program Office (grant no.

The system combines quantitative and qualitative analysis methods to develop an estimated fiscal cost, in addition to estimates of GHG emissions, transportation time and cost savings, and a prioritization metric focusing on social impact of road construction. The IPSS system has been applied in several case studies, including South Africa, Mozambique, Vietnam, a pan-African analysis, and several Asian countries including China, South Korea, Mongolia, and Japan. This paper serves as the first comprehensive explanation of the IPSS system, including the literature review, background, and methodology. The results section focuses on the costs of climate change in an illustrative case study of the State of Colorado in the United States, due to specific data and outputs required for the other analysis components.

Several individual strategies can reduce NO3 loading to freshwater ecosystems (i.e. optimize N fertilizer applications, planting cover crops, retention of active cycling N), but the potential for synergistic interactions among N management practices has not been fully examined. We applied portfolio effect (PE) theory, a concept originally developed for financial asset management, to test whether implementing multiple N management practices simultaneously produces more stable NO3 leaching mitigation outcomes than what would be predicted from implementing each practice independently. We analyzed simulated data generated using a validated process-based cropping system model (APSIM) that covers a range of soils, weather conditions, and management practices. Results indicated that individual management practices alone explained little of the variation in drainage NO3 loads but were more influential in the amount of residual soil NO3 at crop harvest. Despite this, we observed a general stabilizing effect from adopting well-designed multi-strategy approaches for both NO3 loads and soil NO3 at harvest, which became more pronounced in years with high spring rainfall. We use the PE principle to design multi-strategy management to reduce and stabilize NO3 leaching, which resulted in 9.6% greater yields, 15% less NO3 load, and 61% less soil NO3 at harvest than the baseline typical management. Our results make the case for applying the PE to adapt NO3 leaching mitigation to increased climate variability and change, and guide policy action and on-the-ground implementation.","[Feria, Rafael Martinez; Basso, Bruno] Michigan State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Nichols, Virginia; Archontoulis, Sotirios] Iowa State Univ, Dept Agron, Ames, IA USA",Michigan State University; Iowa State University,"Feria, RM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mart2225@msu.edu,"Basso, Bruno/A-3128-2012","Basso, Bruno/0000-0003-2090-4616","Iowa Nutrient Research Center; United States Department of Agriculture [IOW03814, IOW04414]; Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research; National Science Foundation (NSF) [1842097]",Iowa Nutrient Research Center; United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research; National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work is based on research supported by the Iowa Nutrient Research Center (project: 'Quantifying temporal and spatial variability in NO<INF>3</INF>-N leaching across Iowa'), the United States Department of Agriculture (Hatch projects: IOW03814, IOW04414), the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (project: Optimizing Agricultural Water Use), and the National Science Foundation (NSF Award No. 1842097).

As one means of exploring how thermal comfort is achieved under different climatic conditions, this paper reports on the findings of a pilot study exploring adaptive practices in relation to heat with people who have recently migrated to Spain. The paper explores how thermal comfort is accomplished through adaptation in everyday activities including cooling technologies, clothing and routines and rhythms.

This study examines major climate risks, farmers' adaptation strategies, and the factors affecting the choice of those strategies using data collected from 630 households in southwestern coastal Bangladesh. Farmers identified cyclones, excessive rain and flooding, and salinity as direct climate risks. Increased crop diseases/pests and livestock diseases were perceived as indirect risks resulting from climatic variability. Farmers used multiple adaptation strategies against those risks such as modifications in farm management, use of savings and borrowing funds from family and neighbors, and periodically reducing household food consumption. Off-farm employment and seeking assistance from governmental as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were also common adaptation strategies. The results show that male-headed households are more likely to change farming practices and reduce consumption compared with female-headed households that conversely tended to take assistance from NGOs as an adaptation strategy. Ownership of land and livestock, as well as farmers' prior exposure to climate change and educational training, also had a significant effect on the choice of adaptation strategy. Therefore, development interventions and policies that aimed at improving resource endowment and training to farmers on climatic risks and their adaptation strategies can help minimize the impact of climatic risks.","[Aryal, Jeetendra Prakash; Rahut, Dil Bahadur] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Carretera Mexico Veracruz Km 45 Batan, Texcoco, Mexico; [Sapkota, Tek Bahadur; Jat, M.

This implies that adequate flood insurance schemes are needed to adapt to increasing flood risk and to minimise welfare losses for households in flood-prone areas. Flood insurance markets may need reform to offer sufficient and affordable financial protection and incentives for risk reduction. Here, we present the results of a study that aims to evaluate the ability of flood insurance arrangements in Europe to cope with trends in flood risk, using criteria that encompass common elements of the policy debate on flood insurance reform. We show that the average risk-based flood insurance premium could double between 2015 and 2055 in the absence of more risk reduction by households exposed to flooding. We show that part of the expected future increase in flood risk could be limited by flood insurance mechanisms that better incentivise risk reduction by policyholders, which lowers vulnerability. The affordability of flood insurance can be improved by introducing the key features of public-private partnerships (PPPs), which include public reinsurance, limited premium cross-subsidisation between low- and high-risk households, and incentives for policyholder-level risk reduction. These findings were evaluated in a comprehensive sensitivity analysis and support ongoing reforms in Europe and abroad that move towards risk-based premiums and link insurance with risk reduction, strengthen purchase requirements, and engage in multi-stakeholder partnerships.","[Hudson, Paul] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany; [Botzen, W.

This survey of 160 experts (scientists and practitioners with specialized knowledge of the implications of climate change for biodiversity conservation) seeks to explain this deep incongruity. Specifically, we quantify current preferences for a diverse set of adaptation actions, and examine the choice logics that underpin them. We find near unanimous agreement in principle with the need for extensive active management and restoration interventions given climate change. However, when interventionist actions are provided as options alongside conventional actions, experts overwhelming prefer the latter. Four hypotheses, developed by linking the conservation adaptation literature with that of preference formation and risk and decision making, explore enduring preferences for conventional actions. They are (1) judged most ecologically effective, least risky and best understood; (2) linked with pro-ecological worldviews, marked by positive affective feelings, and an aversion to the hubris of managing nature; (3) a function of trust in biodiversity governance; and/or (4) driven by demographic factors such as gender. Overall, we find that experts prefer conventional over unconventional actions because they are viewed as relatively more effective and less risky from an ecological point of view, and because they are linked with positive affect ratings, and worldviews that are strongly pro-ecological. We discuss the roles of value-based and affective cues in shaping policy outcomes for adaptation specifically, and sustainable resource management more broadly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The call for effective adaptation to this challenge becomes increasingly stronger. This paper presents the results of a survey exploring Dutch expert perspectives on adaptation responses to climate change impacts on infectious disease risk in Western Europe. Additionally, the survey explores the expert sample's prioritization of mitigation and adaptation, and expert views on the willingness and capacity of relevant actors to respond to climate change. An integrated view on the causation of infectious disease risk is employed, including multiple (climatic and non-climatic) factors. The results show that the experts consider some adaptation responses as relatively more cost-effective, like fostering interagency and community partnerships, or beneficial to health, such as outbreak investigation and response. Expert opinions converge and diverge for different adaptation responses. Regarding the prioritization of mitigation and adaptation responses expert perspectives converge towards a 50/50 budgetary allocation. The experts consider the national government/health authority as the most capable actor to respond to climate change-induced infectious disease risk. Divergence and consensus among expert opinions can influence adaptation policy processes. Further research is necessary to uncover prevailing expert perspectives and their roots, and compare these.","[Akin, Su-Mia; Martens, Pim; Huynen, Maud M. T.

It is well known that the reduction in ice cover in the Arctic Ocean further contributes to increasing the atmospheric Arctic temperature due to the reduction of the albedo effect and increase in heat absorbed by the ocean's surface. The Arctic ice cover also works like an insulation sheet, keeping the heat in the ocean from dissipating into the cold Arctic atmosphere. Increasing the salinity of the Arctic Ocean surface would allow the warmer and less salty North Atlantic Ocean current to flow on the surface of the Arctic Ocean considerably increasing the temperature of the Arctic atmosphere and release the ocean heat trapped under the ice. This paper argues that if the North Atlantic Ocean current could maintain the Arctic Ocean ice-free during the winter, the longwave radiation heat loss into space would be larger than the increase in heat absorption due to the albedo effect. This paper presents details of the fundamentals of the Arctic Ocean circulation and presents three possible approaches for increasing the salinity of the surface water of the Arctic Ocean. It then discusses that increasing the salinity of the Arctic Ocean would warm the atmosphere of the Arctic region, but cool down the oceans and possibly the Earth. However, it might take thousands of years for the effects of cooling the oceans to cool the global average atmospheric temperature.","[Hunt, Julian David; Nascimento, Andreas] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Nascimento, Andreas] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Sao Mateus, Brazil; [Nascimento, Andreas] Univ Leoben, Leoben, Austria; [Diuana, Fabio A.; Castro, Gabriel Malta] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Energy Planning Program, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Brasil Weber, Natalia de Assis; Schneider, Paulo Smith] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Chaves, Ana Carolina] Brazilian Sch Stat Sci, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Amarante Mesquita, Andre Luiz] Fed Univ Para, Tucurui, Brazil; [Colling, Angeli Viviani] State Univ Rio Grande, Rio Grande, Brazil",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo; University of Leoben; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Para,"Hunt, JD (corresponding author), IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria.",hunt@iiasa.ac.at,"Nascimento, Andreas/AAI-5605-2021; Mesquita, André/F-5227-2017; Hunt, Julian/E-4028-2018","Nascimento, Andreas/0000-0002-4465-5450; Mesquita, André/0000-0001-5559-5580; Catolico, Ana Carolina/0000-0001-8521-1402; Hunt, Julian/0000-0002-1840-7277",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES Brazil); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES) [001],International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES Brazil)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),Open access funding provided by International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA).

How do the Halligen adapt to these impacts, and what are the controversies and conflicts surrounding the adaptation process? In line with the recent political turn in critical adaptation research, we understand adaptation as a social and political-and therefore inherently contested-process. To uncover the contested nature of adaptation, we carried out a case study of Hallig Hooge, the largest inhabited Hallig, based on semi-structured interviews with Hallig residents. We first examine how the local population on Hallig Hooge perceives and responds to the impacts of climate change. In a second step, we then identify tensions or controversies that surround the adaptation process. The interviews reveal a high level of climate change awareness. The local population notices many different changes, but does not necessarily perceive these as threatening, not least because a range of adaptation measures is available and partly already being implemented. While the population approves of adaptation in principle, there are inherent tensions. Notably, we identify three partly overlapping controversies regarding, first, a general dichotomy of man vs. nature; second, the role of different actors and types of knowledge; and third, the objective of adaptation. Hence, the local population questions many regulations and restrictions associated with environmental protection; feels that their experience and local knowledge is not taken seriously enough; and worries that too many innovations may fundamentally change the character of the Hallig. Overall, the adaptive capacity of Hallig Hooge is high, but long-term climate change and adaptation to it raise the question of what it is that should be protected and preserved. This question is a political one, and it can only be answered through dialogue with the local population.","[Klock, Carola] Sci Po Paris, CERI, F-75006 Paris, France",,"Klock, C (corresponding author), Sci Po Paris, CERI, F-75006 Paris, France.",carola.kloeck@sciencespo.fr,,,"Hochschuldidaktik Gottingen and its programme Forschungsorientiertes Lernen and Lehren (FOLL) (Research -oriented teaching and learning, Gottingen Campus QP1us) [01PL11061]","Hochschuldidaktik Gottingen and its programme Forschungsorientiertes Lernen and Lehren (FOLL) (Research -oriented teaching and learning, Gottingen Campus QP1us)","This project was carried out with support from the Hochschuldidaktik Gottingen and its programme Forschungsorientiertes Lernen and Lehren (FOLL) (Research -oriented teaching and learning, Gottingen Campus QP1us, project 01PL11061).

It is an increasingly widespread concept whose success depends, among other things, on the promise of its rapid transfer from science into practice and its operational character for the sustainable management of SESs. However, tangible examples of management methods based on resilience remain limited in the scientific literature. Here, we test the resilience management framework proposed by Brian Walker and David Salt by applying it to the case of mountain summer pastures in the French Alps, which are complex SESs in which human and ecological dimensions are closely linked and subject to substantial perturbations due to climate change. Three steps were implemented: (1) building a conceptual model based on expert knowledge of the functioning of summer pastures; (2) building, from the model, a template for summer pasture resilience analysis; and (3) testing the operational character of the model and the template for two pairs of contrasting cases. This heuristic tool enables understanding the ways in which farmers and herders manage the resilience of their system but does not aim to quantify resilience. The method developed, together with the resilience concept, provide insights into the functioning of summer pastures from both biophysical and management perspectives. The modeling process constitutes a learning process, which will support the implementation of adaptive management. We identified three critical points for making the method truly operational: basing modeling on an equal consideration of social and ecological dimensions, defining the boundaries of the modeled system based on the social dimension, and selecting a scale of analysis coherent with the type of development actions to be implemented.","[Nettier, Baptiste; Dobremez, Laurent] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Irstea, UR DTGR, BP 76, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Nettier, Baptiste; Brunschwig, Gilles] Univ Clermont Auvergne, VetAgro Sup, Herbivores UMR1213, BP 10448, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Nettier, Baptiste; Brunschwig, Gilles] INRA, Herbivores UMR1213, F-63122 St Genes Champanelle, France; [Lavorel, Sandra] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, CS 40700, F-38058 Grenoble 9, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); VetAgro Sup; INRAE; VetAgro Sup; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie,"Nettier, B (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, Irstea, UR DTGR, BP 76, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France.;Nettier, B (corresponding author), Univ Clermont Auvergne, VetAgro Sup, Herbivores UMR1213, BP 10448, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.;Nettier, B (corresponding author), INRA, Herbivores UMR1213, F-63122 St Genes Champanelle, France.",,,,French Ministry of Ecology (Directorate for Water and Biodiversity); General Commission for Territorial Equity (FNADT-CIMA); European Union (FEDER-POIA massif alpin); Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes Region; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur Region; ANR BiodivERsA REGARDS project [ANR-12-EBID-004-01],French Ministry of Ecology (Directorate for Water and Biodiversity); General Commission for Territorial Equity (FNADT-CIMA); European Union (FEDER-POIA massif alpin); Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes Region(Region Auvergne-Rhone-AlpesRegion Bourgogne-Franche-ComteRegion Hauts-de-FranceRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine); Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur Region(Region Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur); ANR BiodivERsA REGARDS project(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"We thank all of the experts who participated in the different participatory modeling phases: Simon Vieux, Ariane Silhol, Laurent Garde (Cerpam); Julien Vilmant, Bruno Caraguel (FAI), Thomas Romagny (ADEM), Muriel Dellavedova, Clotilde Sagot, Cedric Dentant, Richard Bonet (Ecrins National Park); Vincent Auge, (Vanoise National Park), Philippe Choler, Monica Cecilia Corona Lozada, Marine Gabillet (LECA), and Olivier Senn.

The mean annual precipitation is generally projected to increase, with future changes between -25 and +75% (RCP8.5). AET in the Lake Bunyonyi catchment was simulated to increase for the future by approximately +8 mm/month in the median of all GCMs for RCP8.5 for the far future. The runoff for future periods showed much uncertainty, but with an overall increasing trend. A combination of no-regrets adaptation options in the five categories of: governance; communication and capacity development; water, soil, land management and livelihoods improvement; data management; and research, was identified and validated with stakeholders, who also identified additional adaptation actions based on the model results. This study contributes to improving scientific knowledge on the impacts of climate change on water resources in Uganda with the purpose to support adaptation.","[Mehdi, Bano; Herrnegger, Mathew] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Vienna BOKU, Inst Hydrol & Water Management, Vienna, Austria; [Dekens, Julie] Int Inst Sustainable Dev IISD, Secretariat NAP Global Network, Winnipeg, MB, Canada","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Mehdi, B (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Vienna BOKU, Inst Hydrol & Water Management, Vienna, Austria.",bano.mehdi@boku.ac.at,"Herrnegger, Mathew/ABA-6465-2021","Herrnegger, Mathew/0000-0002-5388-2831; Mehdi-Schulz, Bano/0000-0003-1085-3683",University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU); NAP Global Network,University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU); NAP Global Network,"Open Access funding provided by University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU).

Proper management of marine and coastal areas and their ecosystems is of the upmost importance in this country. Almost 60% of the population and a substantial segment of the economy are concentrated on coastal territory, which barely accounts for 13% of the surface area of the country. In addition, this is the natural region with less water resources but has generated the majority of recent economic growth. Artisanal fishing stands out as one of the predominant economic activities for management consideration. This study is comprised of ten key elements that have been chosen in order to analyse national coastal management: Policy, Normative, Institutions, Strategies, Instruments, Information, Education, Resources, Managers and Participation. The results obtained are of great interest due to important advances that have been found in a number of these management elements (normative and instruments). Other results point to opportunities that could potentially have a great impact in the future (policy and institutions). However, deficiencies have also been detected and consequently it is recommended that they be corrected urgently (managers, resources and participation). Peru is currently working with other international institutions with the aim of advancing the definition of its National Policy in Integrated Coastal Zone Management, and its corresponding National Programme. Important decisions related with the contribution of regional and local scale to national efforts are key decisions in this process.","[Barragan, Juan M.] Univ Cadiz, Res Grp Integrated Coastal Zone Management, Cadiz, Spain; [Lazo, Oscar] Univ Natl Agr La Molina, Av Molina, Lima, Peru",Universidad de Cadiz; University Nacional Agraria La Molina,"Barragan, JM (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Res Grp Integrated Coastal Zone Management, Cadiz, Spain.",juan.barragan@uca.es,"Barragán, Juan Manuel/AAT-8425-2020",,,,,,64,16,17,1,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,MAY 1,2018,157,,,,,,203,216,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.03.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.03.003,,,14,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,GD5DS,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000430525800019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Low Impact Development (LID) techniques have a high potential to mitigate their impacts. This study investigates the consequences of climate change and urbanization on the urban runoff in the Risvollan catchment in Trondheim, Norway, and the effects of LID implementation and the influence of LID spatial distributions on their performance. A SWMM model of Risvollan was implemented, along with different scenarios of urbanization and climate change. The performance of various spatial distributions of LID infrastructures in the catchment was investigated, using the outflow volume and the peak runoff at the outfall as indicators. The rainfall event-based simulation results confirmed the negative effects of urbanization and climate change on urban runoff. These effects were partially mitigated by a homogenous LID implementation. The different spatial distributions of LID had little impact on volume reduction but targeting the most downstream zones of the model was more efficient in reducing the peaks at the catchment's outlet. These findings confirm that the spatial configuration of LID might be a determinant parameter towards an efficient design of LID infrastructure in urban settings, depending on the local stakes and criteria of urban water management.","[Le Floch, Ninon; Pons, Vincent; Abdalla, Elhadi Mohsen Hassan; Alfredsen, Knut] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Andersens Vei 5, N-7031 Trondelag, Norway; [Pons, Vincent] Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, DEEP, EA7429, 11 Rue Phys, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon,"Pons, V (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Andersens Vei 5, N-7031 Trondelag, Norway.;Pons, V (corresponding author), Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, DEEP, EA7429, 11 Rue Phys, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France.",vincent.pons@ntnu.no,,"Mohsen Hassan Abdalla, Elhadi/0000-0002-9871-9034",Norges Forskningsr?d [237859/030],Norges Forskningsr?d,Financial support: This research has been supported by the Norges Forskningsr?d (grant no. 237859/030) .,,55,0,0,32,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

For landslide predictions, the probability distribution of precipitation in the representative concentration pathway scenario 8.5 was used. We accounted for future uncertainties by using several regional climate model scenarios. Comparing the performances of different ML algorithms, the overall prediction accuracy of the random forest (0.932) was excellent. Susceptibility to landslides in the future determined using the random forest and five other regional climate models exhibited minor differences, but the average susceptibility increased over time. In addition, many urban areas are distributed around forest areas that have high landslide vulnerabilities, which provide important perspectives for urban and environmental planning.","[Park, Sang-Jin; Lee, Dong-kun] Seoul Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Landscape Architecture, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Sang-Jin; Lee, Dong-kun] Seoul Natl Univ, Integrated Major Smart City Global Convergence, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Dong-kun] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, DK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Landscape Architecture, Seoul, South Korea.;Lee, DK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Integrated Major Smart City Global Convergence, Seoul, South Korea.;Lee, DK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Seoul, South Korea.",dklee7@snu.ac.kr,"Park, Sangjin/GSI-6980-2022","Park, Sangjin/0000-0003-4240-5682",Korea Environment Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Decision Support System Development Project for Environmental Impact Assessment - Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) [2020002990009],"Korea Environment Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Decision Support System Development Project for Environmental Impact Assessment - Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE)(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the Korea Environment Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Decision Support System Development Project for Environmental Impact Assessment, funded by the Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) (No. 2020002990009).",,50,5,5,9,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1947-5705,1947-5713,,GEOMAT NAT HAZ RISK,Geomat.

However, little attention has been paid to the sector's vulnerability to climate change. This paper investigates the impacts of severe weather events and changes in climate variables on the power sector in developing countries, focusing on Indonesia as a country with growing electricity infrastructure, yet being vulnerable to natural hazards. We obtain empirical evidence concerning weather and climate impacts through interviews and focus group discussions with electric utilities along the electricity supply chain. These data are supplemented with reviews of utilities' reports and published energy sector information. Our results indicate that severe weather events often cause disruptions in electricity supply-in the worst cases, even power outages. Weather-related power outages mainly occur due to failures in distribution networks. While severe weather events infrequently cause shutdowns of power plants, their impact magnitude is significant if it does occur. Meanwhile, transmission networks are susceptible to lightning strikes, which are the leading cause of the networks' weather-related failures. We also present estimates of financial losses suffered by utilities due to weather-related power disruptions and highlights their adaptation responses to those disruptions.","[Handayani, Kamia; Filatova, Tatiana; Krozer, Yoram] Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Handayani, Kamia] PT PLN Persero, Jakarta 12160, Indonesia; [Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Informat Syst & Modeling, Fac Engn & IT, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Twente; Perusahaan Listrik Negara; University of Technology Sydney,"Handayani, K (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.;Handayani, K (corresponding author), PT PLN Persero, Jakarta 12160, Indonesia.",k.handayani@utwente.nl; t.filatova@utwente.nl; krozer@xs4all.nl,"Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930; Handayani, Kamia/0000-0001-5253-5056",Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) [PRJ-2570/LPDP/2015],Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP)(Ministry of Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (RISTEK)),"This research was funded by the Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP), grant number PRJ-2570/LPDP/2015.",,62,6,6,5,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,OCT,2019,12,19,,,,,,,3640,10.3390/en12193640,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12193640,,,25,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,JP2AL,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000498072600051,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this article, life cycle assessment is used to compare two ways to maintain the state of a coastal urban area in a changing climate with increasing flood risk. On one side, the construction of a dike, a hard and proactive scenario, is modelled using a bottom up approach. On the other, the systematic repair of houses flooded by sea surges, a post-disaster measure, is assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation allowing for aleatory uncertainties in predicting future sea level rise and occurrences of extreme events. Two metrics are identified, normalized mean impacts and probability of dike being most efficient. The methodology is applied to three case studies in Denmark representing three contrasting areas, Copenhagen. Frederiksvaerk. and Esbjerg. For all case studies the distribution of the calculated impact of repairing houses is highly right skewed, which in some cases has implications for the comparative LCA. The results show that, in Copenhagen, the scenario of the dike is overwhelmingly favorable for the environment, with a 43 times higher impact for repairing houses and only 0% probability of the repairs being favorable. For Frederiksvaerk and Esbjerg the corresponding numbers are 5 and 0.9 times and 85% and 32%, respectively. Hence constructing a dike at this point in time is highly recommended in Copenhagen, preferable in Frederiksvaek, and probably not recommendable in Esbjerg. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Among the efforts to overcome this implementation gap, there has been a growing interest in understanding the role of law in adaptive management. In this article, we provide an analysis of adaptive management in two jurisdictions struggling with coastal erosion in the context of their legal arrangements for coastal management: (i) Byron Shire, a local government area in the State of New South Wales, Australia; and (ii) Florian acute accent opolis, a municipality in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Methods included document analysis and inductive thematic coding of 50 semi-structured interviews with key informants from four different stakeholder groups. Our results indicate that both legal certainty and legal flexibility are relevant for adaptive management success. Three directions towards coupling adaptive coastal management with law are suggested: (i) to incorporate adaptive management into coastal management legislation; (ii) to address legal path dependencies that cause maladaptation; and (iii) to integrate adaptive coastal management and adaptive coastal governance through adaptive coastal management law. Our suggestions contribute to improved knowledge on adaptive coastal management law by emphasising the need for an optimal balance between legal flexibility and legal certainty, which represents an avenue for further research and policy development beyond the jurisdictions analysed.","[Frohlich, Miguel; Fidelman, Pedro; Jacobson, Chris] Univ Queensland, Ctr Policy Futures, Level 4,Bldg 20,Staff House Rd, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Frohlich, Miguel; Smith, Timothy F.; Fidelman, Pedro; Baldwin, Claudia; Carter, R.

Identification of the best options needs to be based on sound, localised assessments of risk, understood as the interaction of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Yet a review of the literature reveals that minimal research to date considers the perceived impacts of heat among urban residents. Based on a household survey in Bonn, Germany, this paper adopts an integrated approach to assess how different socioeconomic groups are affected by heat stress and explores the connections between perceived impacts of heat and indicators of exposure and vulnerability across groups. Results indicate that all socioeconomic groups are at risk of urban heat stress, though to differing extents and for different reasons. Exposure was found to be lowest in groups typically considered to be of higher risk, such as older respondents, who at the same time have the highest susceptibility. Students and other younger respondents, on the other hand, face comparably high exposure and have the lowest coping and adaptive capacities. At the same time, each group has its own capacities with the potential to mitigate risk. The study shows that urban inhabitants beyond classic risk groups usually addressed in literature and policy are affected by heat stress in ways that may not be accounted for in current urban policy.","[Sandholz, Simone; Sett, Dominic; Greco, Angelica] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Wannewitz, Mia; Garschagen, Matthias] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Sandholz, S (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",sandholz@ehs.unu.edu; sett@ehs.unu.edu; greco@ehs.unu.edu; Mia.Wannewitz@geographie.uni-muenchen.de; M.Garschagen@geographie.uni-muenchen.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01UR1613],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This research was conducted under the research project 'Futureoriented Vulnerability and Risk Analysis as an Instrument to Support Urban Infrastructure Resilience (ZURES) ', during 20162019, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research under the 'Sustainable Transformation of Urban Areas' funding measure (grant no. 01UR1613) .",,64,5,5,6,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,MAY,2021,37,,,,,,,,100857,10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100857,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100857,,MAY 2021,19,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,SU8FM,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000663366600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This review based work identified that the concept of climate change has conveyed into the contexts through disaster management discourse in Bangladesh. Climate change understanding and action programs could be divided into three groups (early-stage (1980-2000), mid-stage (2001-2010), and third stage (2011-2020). While early-stage works related to the basic understanding of ozone layer depletion, greenhouse effect, global warming, and their impacts on natural resources and physical functions, mid-stage reports contain impact narratives on different sectors and outlined action plans. The third stage reports have firm commitments to reduce climate change vulnerabilities of people, processes, and systems. In this stage, climate-resilient development is proposed through mainstreaming climate change investments/expenditures into regular development programs of the government. The roles of actors (both individual and institutional) from the government to non government entities, varied and conflicting interests (e.g., personal, thematic, and need-based), struggle among the institutions over control over actions/processes.

Many local governments have identified strategies to prepare for the impacts of sea level rise but often lack funding mechanisms. To date, the assumption that coastal adaptation is a public good has limited the tools used to finance responses to sea level rise. We argue that good characteristics - subtractability, excludability, heterogeneity, joint production, and capital intensity - combine in unique ways across adaptation strategies, and few strategies provide exclusively public goods. These good characteristics create political opportunities for application of financing mechanisms such as property taxes, district-level finance, and bonds that have been less commonly used for adaptation. Exploring the good characteristics of a particular adaptation strategy can help communities identify an appropriate and feasible mechanism for financing it.","[Woodruff, Sierra C.; Roy, Malini] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USA; [Mullin, Megan] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Duke University,"Mullin, M (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",megan.mullin@duke.edu,"Roy, Malini/GXN-3793-2022",,National Science Foundation (NSF) [CNH 1715638],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We would like to acknowledge the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) award CNH 1715638 for providing partial funding for this project.,,89,8,8,3,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

However, the risk of pluvial flooding is a growing challenge with a projected increase of extreme rainstorms compounding with an ongoing global urbanization. Considered as a flood type with minimal impacts when rainfall rates exceed the capacity of urban drainage systems, the aftermath of rainfall-triggered flooding during Hurricane Harvey and other events show the urgent need to assess the risk of pluvial flooding. Due to the local extent and small-scale variations, the quantification of pluvial flood risk requires risk assessments on high spatial resolutions. While flood hazard and exposure information is becoming increasingly accurate, the estimation of losses is still a poorly understood component of pluvial flood risk quantification. We use a new probabilistic multivariable modeling approach to estimate pluvial flood losses of individual buildings, explicitly accounting for the associated uncertainties. Except for the water depth as the common most important predictor, we identified the drivers for having loss or not and for the degree of loss to be different. Applying this approach to estimate and validate building structure losses during Hurricane Harvey using a property level data set, we find that the reliability and dispersion of predictive loss distributions vary widely depending on the model and aggregation level of property level loss estimates. Our results show that the use of multivariable zero-inflated beta models reduce the 90% prediction intervalsfor Hurricane Harvey building structure loss estimates on average by 78% (totalling U.S.$3.8 billion) compared to commonly used models.","[Roezer, Viktor; Kreibich, Heidi; Schroeter, Kai; Sairam, Nivedita; Merz, Bruno] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, Sect Hydrol, Potsdam, Germany; [Roezer, Viktor; Merz, Bruno] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany; [Mueller, Meike] Deutsch Ruckversicherung AG, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Sairam, Nivedita] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Doss-Gollin, James; Lall, Upmanu] Columbia Univ, Columbia Water Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Lall, Upmanu] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY USA",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; University of Potsdam; Humboldt University of Berlin; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Rozer, V (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, Sect Hydrol, Potsdam, Germany.;Rozer, V (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany.",vroezer@gfz-potsdam.de,"Schröter, Kai/B-1482-2013; Kreibich, Heidi/HNR-9624-2023; Doss-Gollin, James/J-4273-2014; Lall, Upmanu/B-7992-2009","Schröter, Kai/0000-0002-3173-7019; Kreibich, Heidi/0000-0001-6274-3625; Doss-Gollin, James/0000-0002-3428-2224; Merz, Bruno/0000-0002-5992-1440; Lall, Upmanu/0000-0003-0529-8128; Sairam, Nivedita/0000-0003-4611-9894",BMBF [03G0846B]; German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [0330701C]; University of Potsdam; German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ; Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG; German-American Fulbright Commission; NSF GRFP program [DGE 16-44869],BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); University of Potsdam; German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ; Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG; German-American Fulbright Commission; NSF GRFP program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),"The data collection campaign after the flood event in Munster, Germany, in 2014 was supported by the project 'EVUS Real-Time Prediction of Pluvial Floods and Induced Water Contamination in Urban Areas (BMBF, 03G0846B), the University of Potsdam, and Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG.

The findings draw on data from a household survey, community workshops, and key informant interviews. The largest challenge to effective adaptation is a lack of access to the social networks and institutions that allocate resources needed for adaptation. Results demonstrate the social differentiation of local knowledge, and how it is entwined with adaptive practices that emerge in relation to gendered mechanisms of access.

In theory, if done well, urban planning can lead to responses to sea-level rise that are socially and environmentally sustainable. In practice, urban planning processes may fall short of this ideal. We use multiple methods to describe and analyse how urban planning processes have led to adaptation to sea-level rise in Lakes Entrance in Victoria, Australia. Adaptation has principally taken the form of restrictions on development on low-lying land. In this town, which is considered particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise, the urban planning process and its outcomes have been controversial and divisive. Policies at the state level were imposed rapidly on this particular local community, and were later applied across the state. Our findings support the emerging consensus that to be sustainable, urban planning needs to: facilitate local ownership of adaptation responses; build collective action within local communities and between local communities and different arms and levels of government; and be fair in its application across space and over time. Addressing these social, dimensions of adaptation takes time, but they are a sine qua non of sustainable adaptation to sea-level, rise. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve the study objectives, in the qualitative part, in-depth interviews were held with 20 agricultural specialists in the field of wheat cultivation, and 9 elite wheat farmers were selected using a purposive sampling method. Using stratified random sampling, 391 wheat farmers participated in the quantitative part. From the agricultural specialists' viewpoint, the prime factor affecting vulnerability was the social factor farm management. The second factor was the environmental vulnerability factor Sunn pest and heat, and the final factor was the economic vulnerability factor the costs of fertilizer, equipment, and machines and their maintenance. In contrast, from the viewpoint of elite wheat farmers, the dominant factor affecting vulnerability was the economic factor the costs of equipment, fertilizer, and machines and their maintenance. Regarding social vulnerability, Governmental support was stressed and the most important environmental vulnerability factor was Sunn pest and cold. The results of confirmatory factor analysis were more in line with the views of agricultural specialists. According to the results, it is suggested that the agricultural extension system provides timely training to farmers in order to properly manage farms in times of crisis. The government should also compensate part of the costs of social and economic damage to farmers by providing free or low-interest loans.","[Nooghabi, Saeedeh Nazari] Agr Res Educ & Extens Org AREEO, Inst Agr Educ & Extens, Tehran, Iran; [Azadi, Hossein; Witlox, Frank] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium; [Azadi, Hossein] Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Dept Econ & Rural Dev, Liege, Belgium; [Azadi, Hossein; Janeckova, Kristina; Sklenicka, Petr] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Fleskens, Luuk] Wageningen Univ, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Witlox, Frank] Univ Tartu, Dept Geog, Tartu, Estonia; [Witlox, Frank] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Civil Aviat, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Ghent University; University of Liege; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Wageningen University & Research; University of Tartu; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Nooghabi, SN (corresponding author), Agr Res Educ & Extens Org AREEO, Inst Agr Educ & Extens, Tehran, Iran.",s_nazari@areeo.ac.ir,"Janeckova, Kristina/GZH-3540-2022; Azadi, Hossein/E-2361-2011; Witlox, Frank/A-5143-2008; Fleskens, Luuk/B-4004-2009; Sklenicka, Petr/B-9774-2012","Janeckova, Kristina/0000-0002-0017-5367; Azadi, Hossein/0000-0002-5108-1993; Witlox, Frank/0000-0002-8966-6823; Fleskens, Luuk/0000-0001-6843-0910; Sklenicka, Petr/0000-0001-9778-9674",,,,,105,0,0,7,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

Urban functions were classified into basic, developmental, sustainable, and maintenance functions, and were measured using 25 indicators. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to integrate each function into a single value. Cluster analysis was applied to 232 cities in Korea and analyzed for the years 2000, 2005, and 2010. The analysis revealed that clusters appeared between variables centered on metropolitan cities and variables of climate variability. In 2000 and 2005, Korean cities had similar clusters, but in 2010, they manifested a different pattern.

The proposed new epoch, driven in large part by human actions, enhances the need for new knowledge on how modernity could respond effectively to environmental extremes and change. New knowledge can be drawn from various sources, but one vital approach will be to learn from the wealth of ancient, traditional forms of cultural adaptation in societal margins, where people have interacted sustainably with difficult environments throughout the Holocene. To achieve that goal, adaptation research with the Anangu of the Alinytjara Wilurara region in South Australia is critically reviewed through the lens of socio-ecological theory. Complex, interactive local biophysical, cultural and political ecologies must be negotiated to learn to adapt to environmental extremes and change. A social learning approach successfully integrated local Indigenous and external knowledge to identify biophysical vulnerabilities, and generated risk narratives that are helping to guide spatial and systemic adaptation planning on heatwave, wildfire and bushfood management. Yet, political ecologies continue to inhibit support for Indigenous stewardship of local environments. Institutional investment into the knowledge and management activities of Indigenous people could generate sustainable development opportunities, while also providing universal lessons about stewarding local environments through periods of change.

Productive and trusted relations among social actors and effectual social norms can help local residents share resources, information and risks. The main objective of our study is to understand the ways in which social attributes and risk considerations influence adoption of resilient economic measures by individuals for reducing potential losses due to catastrophic rainstorm and flooding. This article provides evidence from China on how social capital contributes to anticipatory adaptation to environmental change. The inquiry is based on structured interviews with local residents of Tianjin, a flood-prone port city in China, and a standard regression analysis. Findings show that the intention to make preparation increases with the levels of social expectation, social relationship, and institutional trust. Perceived risk and damage experience, however, have no significant impacts. This suggests that building social capacity and trust will be more effective in enhancing community resilience than merely increasing awareness of hazard risks. We call for greater efforts on strengthening the capacity of formal and informal communal institutions. The structural changes required, however, are challenging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, current discourses and approaches to increase resilience tend to focus on broader socio-economic, physical and environmental systems. This reflects a failure by the academic and practitioner communities to consider the potential contribution of human interior dimensions in adaptation planning. Concomitantly, a growing body of knowledge highlights the need to bridge the gap between internal and external (systems) approaches for achieving sustainable transformations. Against this background, this article aims to increase knowledge on the operationalization of such more integrative approaches in marginal settings. Based on a case study of a flood adaptation project in Kibera, Kenya, we assess the need and potential ways to address interior dimensions in the context of project planning, design and implementation. We show how the integration of such dimensions occurs in existing adaptation projects and why this matters. On this basis, we provide methodological and operational recommendations regarding ways to support more integrative approaches that bridge subjective, intersubjective, objective and interobjective perspectives to support transformation.","[Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Sustainabil Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Mulligan, Joe] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mulligan, Joe; Bukachi, Vera] Kounkuey Design Initiat KDI, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mumbi, Charity] Kenya Federat Slum Dwellers, Nairobi, Kenya",Lund University; Royal Institute of Technology,"Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Box 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,,"Bukachi, Vera/0000-0003-0448-1983","Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency Sida; Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2016-06334, 2019-00390, 2019-01969]; Swedish Research Council VR [2016-06334, 2019-00390, 2019-01969]",Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency Sida; Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Research Council VR(Swedish Research Council),The work was supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency Sida and the Swedish Research Councils FORMAS and VR (2016-06334; 2019-00390; 2019-01969).,,66,1,1,6,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

It tackles a persistent puzzle about the limited adaptation to extreme weather among public organizations: why does adaptation remain deficit after public organizations have experienced repeated extreme weather and some catastrophic consequences? We develop a computational agent-based model that integrates extant theory and data from semi-structured interviews of U.S. public transit agency managers, and use the model to investigate how micro-level cognition and behavior interact with environmental constraints to facilitate or impede the diffusion of adaptation. We articulate in greater detail how experience with influential extreme weather events matters to adaptation, highlighting that such experience is insufficient for adaptation to occur. A key insight is that the potential benefits from both increased risk perception and additional financial resources stemming from disaster- or non-disaster-induced opportunities can be underutilized, absent effective coupling between heightened risk perception and availability of resources that creates windows for adaptation. Using this insight, we further identify managerial and policy interventions with maximum leverage to promote adaptation to extreme weather in public organizations. The experiments show that slowing risk perception decay and synchronizing opportunities with extreme weather occurrences can stimulate adaptation.","[Zhang, Fengxiu] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, Van Metre Hall,3351 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Maroulis, Spiro] Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 N Cent Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA",George Mason University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Zhang, FX (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, Van Metre Hall,3351 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",fzhang22@gmu.edu; Spiro.Maroulis@asu.edu,,"Zhang, Fengxiu/0000-0001-5784-9708",,,,,87,5,5,4,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

We describe three cases in eastern North Carolina, in the southeastern United States, with differing conceptions of economic development, environmental change, governance, property rights, and social collectivities. On the flat coastal plain and barrier islands, wetland conservation, soft engineering, and other coastal zone management options can protect shorelines from flooding and erosion, whereas hard engineered structures can cause long term problems. Fearing that scientific information would lower real estate values, a well-financed advocacy group averted public discussion of proactive policy by deploying discursive and legislative strategies to suppress scientific decision support. We find that a study site with high financial resources showed the most resistance to science-based adaptation in the public interest, whereas a study site with minimal financial resources was the most receptive.

Our research objective was to identify, implement, and assess a suite of interventions promoting climate change preparedness and poverty reduction for two traditional farming communities in Bajura District. Participatory processes were first used to identify priority problems and solutions. Residents then received an intervention package implemented over 16 months that was targeted for problem solving and founded on non-formal education (NFE) training modules. Following the intervention period, a random sample of households gave their trend perceptions for 24 socioeconomic and agroecosystem attributes, and findings were compared with those from adjacent control communities lacking interventions in a quasi-experimental approach. Results indicated that community-based participation was an effective diagnostic research tool that allowed priority problems to be ranked and linked to either climate change or other factors of under-development. This sharpened our focus for the intervention phase. The intervention package had positive effects (P <= .047) on 23 of 24 attributes with particularly notable impacts on altering previous attitudes and beliefs, improving skill sets, boosting cash incomes, and supporting a more diversified mix of agricultural enterprises largely based on existing technologies. Improved goat production and marketing, however, was the main driver for socioeconomic change. In sum, improved risk management, widespread adoption of a planning mentality, and expansion of community-based collaborations were keys to success. We estimated that the intervention package was generally inexpensive, costing from US$ 1.48 to 4.75 per beneficiary. We concluded that use of participatory processes and NFE-based interventions can achieve impact quickly here. These are important means to build human capacity and community resilience, especially in places where implementation of novel, climate-smart agricultural technologies is difficult.","[Coppock, D.

Our research identified and developed a diverse set of adaptation measures for Elwood, a suburb in Melbourne, Australia, that is vulnerable to pluvial and coastal flooding. We drew on methods from social science, urban design and environmental engineering to gain integrated insights into the opportunities for Elwood to increase its flood resilience and urban liveability. Results showed that an appropriate balance of social, infrastructural and urban design responses would be required to retreat from, accommodate and protect against flood risk. These would also deliver broader benefits such as securing water supplies through harvested stormwater and mitigating extreme heat through greener landscapes. Our interdisciplinary approach demonstrated the value of (i) engaging with the community to understand their concerns, aspirations and adaptation ideas, (ii) exploring design measures that densify and use urban forms in ways that implement adaptation measures while responding to local context, (iii) adopting modelling techniques to test the performance, robustness and economic viability of possible adaptation solutions, and (iv) innovating governance arrangements and principles needed to improve flood resilience in the Elster Creek catchment. Our research also provided valuable insight on how to operationalize interdisciplinary work in practice, highlighting the importance of sharing an impact agenda, taking a place-based approach, developing a common conceptual framework, and fostering a constructive team culture.

According to the Adaptigation Institutionalization Framework (included in the recent IPCC report), the implementation of such participatory structures is vital for the effective, joint institutionalization of climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support this claim. Against this background, this paper tests the Adaptigation Framework using the example of municipal advisory committees in Germany. Based on a review of 107 cities, and social network analyses of 20 cities, we develop a typology of advisory committees, examine their stakeholder constellations, and assess how they influence municipalities' capacity to institutionalize joint mitigation and adaptation goals in sector policy and planning. Our results and the developed social network analysis approach can be used by cities worldwide to systematically analyze and enhance participation structures to address climate change more effectively. We conclude with some recommendations for future research and policy.","[Goepfert, Christian; Lang, Werner] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Energy Efficient & Sustainable Design & Bldg, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ, Lund Univ Ctr Sustainable Studies LUCSUS, Box 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Technical University of Munich; Lund University,"Gopfert, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Inst Energy Efficient & Sustainable Design & Bldg, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",christian.goepfert@tum.de; christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se; w.lang@tum.de,"Göpfert, Christian Peter/A-6173-2016; Lang, Werner/Q-2152-2018","Göpfert, Christian Peter/0000-0002-1399-8020; Lang, Werner/0000-0002-6593-8388",,,,,77,12,12,4,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-2520,,,CITY ENVIRON INTERAC,City Environ.

This is achieved through the application of processes and approaches linked to policy themes to which the concept can significantly contribute. Taken together the processes, approaches and policy themes constitute the principles of UGI, which when adopted can promote, maintain and enhance quality of life in resource-efficient, compact and climate-resilient cities. In this study we explore the extent to which strategic greenspace planning in Europe is UGI compliant, as we hypothesised that the above principles are presently under-represented in planning documents and policies. This was accomplished by conducting a comparative analysis of the adoption of UGI principles in current practices of greenspace planning across European city-regions based on a systematic review of previous data and reports. The study found that many UGI principles and related concepts are present to some degree in strategic greenspace planning in Europe. However, gaps exist with regard to their scope and level of consideration. Presently, conservation emerges as the predominant task in strategic urban greenspace planning. However, enhancing network connectivity is key to the development of UGI, hence a greater focus on the restoration and creation of greenspace is required in the future. Based on our analysis it can be concluded that the advancement towards UGI planning is well established and progressing, although some areas are markedly under-represented. Strategic greenspace planning in Europe, with a few exceptions, requires further development to be effectively considered as UGI compliant.","[Davies, Clive; Lafortezza, Raffaele] Univ Bari A Moro, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Via Amendola 165-A, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Lafortezza, Raffaele] Michigan State Univ, CGCEO, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; [Davies, Clive] Newcastle Univ, Dept Architecture Planning & Landscape, Claremont Tower, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Michigan State University; Newcastle University - UK,"Davies, C (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",clive.davies@newcastle.ac.uk,"Lafortezza, Raffaele/G-2104-2018","Lafortezza, Raffaele/0000-0003-4642-8435; Hansen, Rieke/0000-0002-4230-1579","European project (Green Infrastructure and Urban Biodiversity for Sustainable Urban Development); European project (Green Economy [GREEN SURGE]) [FP7-ENV.2013.6.2-5-603567, 603567]",European project (Green Infrastructure and Urban Biodiversity for Sustainable Urban Development); European project (Green Economy [GREEN SURGE]),"We are grateful to the numerous contributors to the case studies without whom this work would not have been possible (see Supplementary Table S2).

Results show that preparedness in nearly pristine systems is noticeably different to that reported for altered systems. People adopt innovative and simple but efficient measures against floods, conditioned by (1) damage suffered during past floods, (2) perceived exposure to floods, and (3) the number of dependent people in the household. The studied system proved to be well adapted to floods but not resilient.

Impact studies of climate change on crop yields often ignore the potential of adaptation strategies such as rainwater harvesting (RWH). While RWH is bringing benefits to agricultural systems today, it is still unclear which regions could increasingly benefit from RWH under changing climatic conditions. Here we employ a continental scale modelling strategy using the latest CMIP5 data and explicitly take into account design factors of RWH to show that it is a valuable adaptation strategy to climate change in Africa for maize (Zea mays L.). We find that RWH can bridge up to 40 % of the yield gaps attributable to water deficits under current conditions and 31 % under future (2050s) climatic conditions during the main growing season for maize, hence providing an alternative to irrigation from scarce or inaccessible groundwater resources. RWH could increase maize yields by 14-50 % on average for the 2050s across Africa, by bridging water deficits. While in situ RWH strategies show great biophysical potential as an adaptation strategy to climate change, there remain locally specific barriers to their adoption, which will need to be addressed to ensure their successful implementation at a larger scale.","[Lebel, S.; Fleskens, L.; Lorenz, S.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Lebel, S.; Forster, P.

Using focus group discussions, key informant interviews and household surveys combined with the analysis of climate variability in the area, the study described key adaptation strategies commonly practiced at the household and community levels in relation to crop production and income generation, domestic and farm water supply, soil conservation, health and livelihood; and assessed the effectiveness and barriers in the implementation of these strategies. There were few variations in adaptation strategies across different crops grown by farmers. While few ineffective adaptation strategies were noted, current strategies were perceived to be generally effective although some barriers exist in their implementation. Among these barriers include high cost, limited adaptation options, and difficulty in implementation. Despite the perceived effectiveness, future uncertainty is a major concern since climate variability is likely to worsen, threatening health, food and livelihood security. Planned adaptation founded on robust current and future vulnerability assessments is necessary to address the future risks associated with the changing climate. Moreover, to realize effective farmers' adaptation to future climate change impacts, the anticipated critical adaptation barriers should be successfully overcome.","[Pulhin, Juan M.; Peras, Rose Jane J.; Gevana, Dixon T.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Dept Social Forestry & Forest Governance, CFNR, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Pulhin, Florencia B.] CFNR UPLB, Forestry Dev Ctr, College Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Pulhin, JM (corresponding author), Univ Philippines Los Banos, Dept Social Forestry & Forest Governance, CFNR, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines.",jmpulhin@up.edu.ph,"Pulhin, Juan Magboo/AAV-6489-2021",,"European Commission, the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)","European Commission, the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)","We thank the following institutions for conceptualizing and implementing the Advancing Capacity to Support Climate Change Adaptation (ACCCA) Project and for choosing the Philippines as one of the pilot areas: United Nations Institute for Training & Research (UNITAR); SEI (Oxford and Bangkok); Global Change SysTem for Analysis Research & Training (START); Southeast Asia START Regional Center; Temperate East Asia START Regional Center; Climate System Analysis Group - Cape Town (CSAG-UCT); Environnement et Developpement du Tiers Monde (ENDA-TM).

Futuring methods, such as scenarios, have been increasingly utilized around the world. In the US, however, there has been a limited uptake of these tools across public land management and a preference for more traditional forecasting tools. This article explores some possibilities about why this is the case and aims to identify potential pathways forward. Drawing on 28 exploratory interviews with public land managers from the US Forest Service and others, a variety of benefits to scenario use were identified including: (1) mitigation of climate skepticism; (2) more robust capture of uncertainty, complexity, and the potential for surprise posed by climate change; and (3) potential for social learning. Barriers identified included: (1) difficulty in understanding the process, (2) bureaucratic concerns about time, staffing, and funding, and (3) a lack of an agency 'champion'. However, concerns about the epistemological and institutional fit of nontraditional planning and decision-making tools like scenario processes predominated across the interviews. Interviewees also identified what we call 'streamlining' and 'mainstreaming' as potential pathways to integrate scenario processes into planning and decision-making.","[Murphy, Daniel J.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Anthropol, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Yung, Laurie; Miller, Brett Alan] Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Soc & Conservat, Missoula, MT USA; [Schultz, Courtney] Colorado State Univ, Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Wyborn, Carina] Australian Natl Univ, Inst Water Futures, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, Australia; [Williams, Daniel R.] USDA Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Murphy, Daniel J.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Anthropol, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; Colorado State University; Australian National University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Murphy, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Anthropol, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",murphdl@ucmail.uc.edu,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1920,1521-0723,,SOC NATUR RESOUR,Soc.

However, there is little practical guidance for those interested in characterising, identifying or assessing cascades, and few empirical examples. In this paper, we elaborate a systems-based methodology to identify and evaluate cascading climate change impacts and implications. We illustrate its application using the case of a participatory process with urban infrastructure managers, facing the legacy effects of damaging earthquakes and the prospect of future climate change. The results show the proposed approach and visualisation of cascades as causal diagrams provides a robust and flexible analytical framework. The use of systems thinking, visual aids, interactive discussion and expert elicitation generated valuable information about potential cascades, their interactions across domains of interest, and the implications for management. The process can provide a basis for further empirical application and advance methodological and conceptual development.

Among them, women are the most affected groups. Climate change increases their socioeconomic vulnerabilities by directly impacting their families' food security, water consumption, health, and overall livelihood. Unlike in many patriarchal societies, Bangladeshi women often face challenges of unequal social relations and hierarchies, which enforce gender differented vulnerabilities. In this context, this paper intends to reveal what barriers Bangladeshi women face and how they cope with many uncertainties relating to changing contexts, particularly at the household, community, and institutional levels. The paper draws from the author's Ph.D. research which was carried out in four districts of Bangladesh, focused on four types of climate change impacts and adaptation practices. Qualitative data collection methods were used such as focus group discussions, in-depth Interviews with women, and observations of their household and community-level activities for the study. In addition to that, key informant interviews were conducted with local and national level experts, government officials, and development workers to reveal institutional barriers confronted by women. Findings explore women's gendered struggles in preparing for and responding to climate change through their lived experiences. Moreover, the study sheds light on the limited gender-responsive environment drawing attention to the need for strategies and actions for gender-transformative approaches to develop climate-resilient households and communities with women at the center.","[Tanjeela, Mumita] East West Univ, Dept Sociol, Dhaka, Bangladesh",East West University Bangladesh,"Tanjeela, M (corresponding author), East West Univ, Dept Sociol, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",mtanjeela@ewubd.edu,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0971-8524,0973-0656,,GEND TECHNOL DEV,Gend.

However, to date, most studies have been based on short-term monitoring and/or modeling, making it difficult to assess their reliability in terms of estimating long-term changes. We present the results of a unique data set consisting of measurements of sediment loads from a 60 ha catchment - the Hydrological Open Air Laboratory (HOAL) - in Petzenkirchen, Austria, which was observed periodically over a time period spanning 72 years. Specifically, we compare Period I (1946-1954) and Period II (2002-2017) by fitting sediment rating curves (SRCs) for the growth and dormant seasons for each of the periods. The results suggest a significant increase in sediment loads from Period I to Period II, with an average of 5.8 +/- 3.8 to 60.0 +/- 140.0 t yr(-1). The sediment flux changed mainly due to a shift in the SRCs, given that the mean daily discharge significantly decreased from 5.0 +/- 14.5 L s-1 for Period I to 3.8 +/- 6.6 L s(-1) for Period II. The slopes of the SRCs for the growing season and the dormant season of Period I were 0.3 and 0.8, respectively, whereas they were 1.6 and 1.7 for Period II, respectively. Climate change, considered in terms of rainfall erosivity, was not responsible for this shift, because erosivity decreased by 30.4 % from the dormant season of Period I to that of Period II, and no significant difference was found between the growing seasons of periods I and II. However, the change in sediment flux can be explained by land use and land cover change (LUCC) and the change in land structure (i.e., the organization of land parcels). Under low- and median-streamflow conditions, the land structure in Period II (i.e., the parcel effect) had no apparent influence on sediment yield. With increasing streamflow, it became more important in controlling sediment yield, as a result of an enhanced sediment connectivity in the landscape, leading to a dominant role under high-flow conditions. The increase in crops that make the landscape prone to erosion and the change in land uses between periods I and II led to an increase in sediment flux, although its relevance was surpassed by the effect of parcel structure change under high-flow conditions. We conclude that LUCC and land structure change should be accounted for when assessing sediment flux changes. Especially under high-flow conditions, land structure change substantially altered sediment fluxes, which is most relevant for long-term sediment loads and land degradation. Therefore, increased attention to improving land structure is needed in climate adaptation and agricultural catchment management.","[Wang, Shengping; Song, Kepeng; Li, Yifan] North China Elect Power Univ, Coll Hydraul & Hydropower Engn, Dept Hydraul & Hydropower Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shengping; Krammer, Carmen; Schmaltz, Elmar; Strauss, Peter] Fed Agcy Water Management, Inst Land & Water Management Res, Petzenkirchen, Austria; [Wang, Shengping; Szeles, Borbala; Bloeschl, Gunter] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources Management, Vienna, Austria; [Szeles, Borbala; Bloeschl, Gunter] Vienna Univ Technol, Ctr Water Resource Syst, Vienna, Austria; [Zhang, Zhiqiang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University; Technische Universitat Wien; Technische Universitat Wien; Beijing Forestry University,"Wang, SP (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Coll Hydraul & Hydropower Engn, Dept Hydraul & Hydropower Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, SP (corresponding author), Fed Agcy Water Management, Inst Land & Water Management Res, Petzenkirchen, Austria.;Wang, SP (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources Management, Vienna, Austria.",shengping_wang@ncepu.edu.cn,"Strauss, Peter/I-2983-2015","Strauss, Peter/0000-0002-8693-9304; Szeles, Borbala/0000-0002-2006-5042",European Community [773993]; Austrian Science Funds (FWF) [W1219-N28]; TU Wien Risk network,European Community(European Commission); Austrian Science Funds (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); TU Wien Risk network,"This work has been supported by the SHui (Soil Hydrology research platform underpinning innovation to manage water scarcity in European and Chinese cropping systems) project within the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation action of the European Community (project no. 773993), the Austrian Science Funds (FWF; project no.

Modelling and quantifying extreme rainfall and its temporal changes in such environments could thus provide crucial information for design, insurance, management, ecology and climate adaptation. Rain gauge networks in the area are relatively sparse, and often characterized by missing data, which hamper the use of extreme-value methods for estimating extreme precipitation quantiles. In this study, we adopted the Simplified Metastatistical Extreme Value approach for the estimation of extreme return levels based on ordinary events (i.e., all the independent realizations of the variable of interest), which was shown to be more accurate than traditional extreme-value methods in the presence of short data records. We examined data from 66 rain gauges covering diverse hydro-climatic regions across Ghana with the aim of (i) validating the robustness of the statistical approach, (ii) characterising the climatic and altitudinal controls on the occurrence, frequency and intensity of rainfall extremes, and (iii) quantifying recent changes in the characteristics of extremes. We found that a two-parameter Weibull distribution well approximates the tail of the daily rainfall distribution throughout the area. Our statistical approach can quantify extremes with largely reduced uncertainties (7-17% uncertainty in the 100-year return levels computed using 10 years of data versus 11-62% of extreme-value based methods). Extreme precipitation statistics (daily intensity distribution, number of wet days, extreme rainfall quantiles) are found to significantly depend on latitude, so that the four latitudinally layered hydro-climatic regions typically adopted in the area well represent spatial variations. Elevation significantly affects the tail heaviness of the daily intensity distribution and thus extreme rainfall quantiles. Temporal changes during the period 1978-2018 are found to be non-homogeneous in the area as well as within the four hydro-climatic regions, but are homogeneous in three altitude-based regions. We report contrasting trends in extreme return levels in low-elevation (<200 m a.s.l.) and hilly regions, related to contrasting changes in the daily intensity distribution. Statistically significant positive trends in extreme daily rainfall amounts are observed in the inland low-elevation region of the Volta river basin, which call for further investigation of changes in future precipitation extremes in this extremely important hydrological region in SubSaharan Africa.","[Amponsah, William] KNUST, Coll Engn, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, Kumasi, Ghana; [Amponsah, William] KNUST, Coll Engn, WASCAL Climate Change & Land Use Ctr, Kumasi, Ghana; [Dallan, Eleonora] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Legnaro, Italy; [Nikolopoulos, Efthymios, I] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Civil Engn, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Marra, Francesco] Natl Res Council Italy CNR ISAC, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Padua; Florida Institute of Technology; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR),"Amponsah, W (corresponding author), KNUST, Coll Engn, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, Kumasi, Ghana.;Amponsah, W (corresponding author), KNUST, Coll Engn, WASCAL Climate Change & Land Use Ctr, Kumasi, Ghana.",wamponsah@knust.edu.gh,,"Amponsah, William/0000-0002-1010-1206",West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL); Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate of the National Research Council of Italy,West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL); Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate of the National Research Council of Italy,"y This study was not directly supported by any funding scheme.

After the abandonment of firewood production during the 1980s, current management practices attempt to convert coppices into coppices-with-standards through thinning and promoting forest regeneration via sexual reproduction. In this work, we used long-term data from repeated forest inventories and dendrometers in a thinning trial to assess the effects of thinning and climate on the intra- and inter-annual growth dynamics ofQuercus pyrenaicaWilld. coppices. Our results revealed that thinning favored the growth ofQ. pyrenaicatrees, especially when the stand density reduction was high (ca. 50% of the basal area extracted). Unthinned plots displayed more natural mortality i.e., self-thinning. Growth was enhanced with low vapor pressure deficit. Intense thinning treatments displayed higher intra-annual growth rates and interacted positively with rainfall to induce higher growth. We conclude that thinning, especially intensive thinning, may alleviate the negative effects of dry years and thus could provide a potential measure to adapt these stands to the different climatic scenarios with higher temperatures and less precipitation within the framework of sustainable forest management.","[Moreno-Fernandez, Daniel; Gea-Izquierdo, Guillermo; Canellas, Isabel; Martin-Benito, Dario] INIA CIFOR, Ctra A Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Moreno-Fernandez, Daniel] Univ Alcala, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Sci Bldg, Alcala De Henares 28805, Spain; [Aldea, Jorge] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, Sundsvagen 3, Alnarp, Sweden",Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Universidad de Alcala; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Moreno-Fernandez, D (corresponding author), INIA CIFOR, Ctra A Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain.;Moreno-Fernandez, D (corresponding author), Univ Alcala, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Sci Bldg, Alcala De Henares 28805, Spain.",danielmorenofdez@gmail.com,"Moreno-Fernández, Daniel/E-7958-2016; Canellas, Isabel/B-7658-2008; Aldea, Jorge/AAC-8852-2022; Gea-Izquierdo, Guillermo/AAZ-2645-2021; Martin-Bennito, Dario/HKW-0364-2023; Martin-Benito, Dario/B-2406-2009","Moreno-Fernández, Daniel/0000-0002-9597-6609; Canellas, Isabel/0000-0002-9716-7776; Aldea, Jorge/0000-0003-2568-5192; Gea-Izquierdo, Guillermo/0000-0003-0148-3721; Martin-Benito, Dario/0000-0002-6738-3312","Ministry of Agriculture [EG17-042]; INIA [EG17-042]; Juan de la Cierva Formacion Post-Doctoral program [FJC2018-037870-I]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [AGL2015-73190-JIN, RYC-2017-23389]","Ministry of Agriculture(Gida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi); INIA(Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA)); Juan de la Cierva Formacion Post-Doctoral program; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government)","We thank Adam Collins for revising and editing the English grammar.

While some changes may provide opportunities for higher productivity, others may severely increase agricultural vulnerability. Farmers attempt to adapt or cope with these changes by taking measures to decrease vulnerability or to take advantage of potential benefits, but little is known what outcomes these adaptation measures might have. This study identifies unintended negative impacts of adaptation measures, drawing on a literature review and interviews with farmers and agricultural officials and experts in Sweden and Finland. Based on the conceptual framework of maladaptation, this study identifies outcomes that either increase the vulnerability of the implementing actor, shift the vulnerability to other actors or sectors or affect common pool resources. While a large number of adaptation measures rebound vulnerability to the implementing actor, several potential maladaptive outcomes may shift vulnerability or affect common pool resources. The findings point to the large number of trade-offs that are involved in adaptation decision-making and lead to the conclusion that raising awareness of these aspects can support future adaptation strategies.","[Neset, Tina-Simone; Wirehn, Lotten; Klein, Natacha; Juhola, Sirkku] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden; [Kayhko, Janina; Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, Helsinki, Finland; [Kayhko, Janina; Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, Helsinki, Finland",Linkoping University; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Neset, TS (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden.",tina.neset@liu.se; lotten.wirehn@liu.se; janina.kayhko@helsinki.fi; sirkku.juhola@helsinki.fi,"Klein, Natacha/AAC-9270-2021; Käyhkö, Janina/AAW-6163-2021; Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Käyhkö, Janina/0000-0003-0904-5857; Neset, Tina-Simone/0000-0003-1151-9943; Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282; Wirehn, Lotten/0000-0003-4014-1441",Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2013-1557]; Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR) - Norden Top-Level Research Initiative sub-programme 'Effect studies and adaptation to climate change',Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR) - Norden Top-Level Research Initiative sub-programme 'Effect studies and adaptation to climate change',"This paper is funded by the Swedish Research Council FORMAS under Grant [No. 2013-1557].

CLC agriculture can greatly improve production of many different ecosystem services from agroecosystems, including climate adaptation and mitigation. To go to scale, CLC agriculture requires crops that not only provide continuous living cover but are viable in economic and social terms. At present, lack of such viable crops is strongly limiting the scaling of CLC agriculture. Gene editing (GE) might provide a powerful tool for developing the crops needed to expand CLC agriculture to scale. To assess this possibility, a broad multi-sector deliberative group considered the merits of GE-relative to alternative plant-breeding methods-as means for improving crops for CLC agriculture. The group included many of the sectors whose support is necessary to scaling agricultural innovations, including actors involved in markets, finance, policy, and R&D. In this article, we report findings from interviews and deliberative workshops. Many in the group were enthusiastic about prospects for applications of GE to develop crops for CLC agriculture, relative to alternative plant-breeding options. However, the group noted many issues, risks, and contingencies, all of which are likely to require responsive and adaptive management. Conversely, if these issues, risks, and contingencies cannot be managed, it appears unlikely that a strong multi-sector base of support can be sustained for such applications, limiting their scaling. Emerging methods for responsible innovation and scaling have potential to manage these issues, risks, and contingencies; we propose that outcomes from GE crops for CLC agriculture are likely to be much improved if these emerging methods are used to govern such projects. However, both GE of CLC crops and responsible innovation and scaling are unrefined innovations. Therefore, we suggest that the best pathway for exploring GE of CLC crops is to intentionally couple implementation and refinement of both kinds of innovations. More broadly, we argue that such pilot projects are urgently needed to navigate intensifying grand challenges around food and agriculture, which are likely to create intense pressures to develop genetically-engineered agricultural products and equally intense social conflict.","[Jordan, Nicholas R.] Univ Minnesota, Agron & Plant Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Kuzma, Jennifer] NC State Univ, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Genet Engn & Soc Ctr, Raleigh, NC USA; [Ray, Deepak K.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Foot, Kirsten; Snider, Madison; Amarteifio, Gifty] Univ Washington, Dept Commun, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Miller, Keith; Wilensky-Lanford, Ethan] Terraluna Collaborat, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; North Carolina State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Jordan, NR (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Agron & Plant Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",jorda020@umn.edu,"Ray, Deepak K/F-7720-2012","Ray, Deepak K/0000-0002-2856-9608; Kuzma, Jennifer/0000-0003-4456-9613",Walton Family Foundation [2019-1163]; University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,Walton Family Foundation; University of Minnesota-Twin Cities(University of Minnesota System),"This project was supported by a grant from the Walton Family Foundation, 2019-1163.

Here we identify case studies of compound hazard events of interest to the UK agricultural sector and present a framework for comparing the frequency and duration of compound events now to those projected in 50 years' time. We use high resolution (12 km) simulations from the UK Climate Projections to explore how the frequency and duration of instances of potato blight and thermal heat stress to dairy cattle may change locally under RCP 8.5 emissions forcing. We combine hazard (temperature and humidity data) with vulnerability (specific threshold exceedance) and exposure (regional dairy cattle numbers/potato growing area) to estimate risk. Regions where most potatoes are grown, and where the potato blight risk is greatest in both the current and future climate, include the East of England, Yorkshire and the Humber and Eastern Scotland. By 2070, potato blight occurrences may increase by 70% in East Scotland and between 20 and 30 % across the East of England, the Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber. Assuming dairy cattle spatial distributions remain the same, the area of greatest risk now and in the future is South West England, with notable increases in risk across Northern Ireland, Wales, the Midlands, North West England and North West Scotland. Dairy cattle heat stress (using a temperature-humidity index) is projected to increase by nearly 1000% in South West England, the region with the most dairy cattle. Finally, we consider projected changes to UK seasons, using 2018 as a template, where a cold spring followed by a warm/dry summer resulted in hay/silage shortages. In addition to reduced crop yields in 2018, cattle were kept inside for longer in the cold spring and in the warm/dry summer, due to heat stress and poor grass quality. UK Climate Projections indicate that the annual probability of cold spring/warm summer conditions will decrease in future, but the annual probability of longer dry/warm summers will increase. We conclude that the agricultural sector should consider suitable climate adaptation measures to minimise the risk of dairy cattle thermal heat stress, increased potato blight, and longer dry/warm summer conditions.","[Garry, Freya K.; Bernie, Dan J.; Davie, Jemma C.

The productivity of tree crops such as almond orchards, is particularly complex. To understand and mitigate these threats requires a collection of multi-layer large data sets, and advanced analytics is also critical to integrate these highly heterogeneous datasets to generate insights about the key constraints on the yields at tree and field scales. Here we used a machine learning approach to investigate the determinants of almond yield variation in California's almond orchards, based on a unique 10-year dataset of field measurements of light interception and almond yield along with meteorological data. We found that overall the maximum almond yield was highly dependent on light interception, e.g., with each one percent increase in light interception resulting in an increase of 57.9 lbs/acre in the potential yield. Light interception was highest for mature sites with higher long term mean spring incoming solar radiation (SRAD), and lowest for younger orchards when March maximum temperature was lower than 19 degrees C. However, at any given level of light interception, actual yield often falls significantly below full yield potential, driven mostly by tree age, temperature profiles in June and winter, summer mean daily maximum vapor pressure deficit (VPDmax), and SRAD. Utilizing a full random forest model, 82% (+/- 1%) of yield variation could be explained when using a sixfold cross validation, with a RMSE of 480 +/- 9 lbs/acre. When excluding light interception from the predictors, overall orchard characteristics (such as age, location, and tree density) and inclusive meteorological variables could still explain 78% of yield variation. The model analysis also showed that warmer winter conditions often limited mature orchards from reaching maximum yield potential and summer VPDmax beyond 40 hPa significantly limited the yield. Our findings through the machine learning approach improved our understanding of the complex interaction between climate, canopy light interception, and almond nut production, and demonstrated a relatively robust predictability of almond yield. This will ultimately benefit data-driven climate adaptation and orchard nutrient management approaches.","[Jin, Yufang; Chen, Bin] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lampinen, Bruce D.; Brown, Patrick H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Jin, YF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",yujin@ucdavis.edu,"Chen, Bin/ABD-5074-2021; Brown, Patrick/E-4085-2012","Chen, Bin/0000-0003-3496-2876; Brown, Patrick/0000-0001-6857-8608",USDA California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Specialty Crop Block Grant Program [SCB16036];  [CA-D-PLS-2016-H];  [CA-D-LAW-2296-H],USDA California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Specialty Crop Block Grant Program; ; ,This work was supported by a project (SCB16036) funded by the USDA California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Specialty Crop Block Grant Program.

However, evidence suggests such investments in adaptation science have not necessarily translated into adaptation implementation. One potential constraint on adaptation may be the underlying heuristics that are used as the foundation for both adaptation research and practice. Here, we explore the adaptation academic literature with the objective of identifying adaptation heuristics, assessing the extent to which they have become entrenched within the adaptation discourse, and discussing potential weaknesses in their framing that could undermine adaptation efforts. This investigation is supported by a multi-method analysis that includes both a quantitative content analysis of the adaptation literature that evidences the use of adaptation heuristics and a qualitative analysis of the implications of such heuristics for enhancing or hindering the implementation of adaptation. Results demonstrate that a number of heuristic devices are commonly used in both the peer-reviewed adaptation literature as well as within grey literature designed to inform adaptation practitioners. Furthermore, the apparent lack of critical reflection upon the robustness of these heuristics for diverse contexts may contribute to potential cognitive bias with respect to the framing of adaptation by both researchers and practitioners. We discuss this phenomenon by drawing upon heuristic-analytic theory, which has explanatory utility in understanding both the origins of such heuristics as well as the measures that can be pursued toward the co-generation of more robust approaches to adaptation problem-solving.","[Preston, Benjamin L.; Maloney, Megan C.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Preston, Benjamin L.; Maloney, Megan C.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Mustelin, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Griffith University,"Preston, BL (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Bldg 2040,MS 6301,One Bethel Valley Rd,POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",prestonbl@ornl.gov; j.mustelin@griffith.edu.au; maloneymc@ornl.gov,"Preston, Benjamin L/B-9001-2012; Nalau, Johanna/V-5692-2018","Preston, Benjamin L/0000-0002-7966-2386; Nalau, Johanna/0000-0001-6581-3967",Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; Griffith University,Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program; U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Griffith University(Griffith University),"Benjamin Preston and Megan Maloney's contributions to this research were sponsored through Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program.

This could be partly because of limited insight into the contextual underpinnings of its uptake. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between selected socioeconomic factors and the adoption of CSA in Gilgil Sub-County. This study's results were attained from a binary logistic regression model, using a sample of 120 smallholder potato farmers in two wards of Gilgil Sub-County of Nakuru County, Kenya. An analysis of the five hypothesized explanatory socioeconomic variables contained in the model disclosed that a relationship between socioeconomic factors and adoption of CSAPs was statistically significant at a 5% level of significance (chi(2) = 17.966, df = 5, p < 0.05). It further revealed that only two variables had a significant relationship with the adoption of CSAPs. Among these, included gender which was negative and statistically significant at a 5% level of significance (Wald chi(2) = 6.701, df = 1, p < 0.05) and annual farm income, which was positive and statistically significant at a 5% level of significance (Wald chi(2) = 8.402, df = 1, p < 0.05). Therefore, securing access to vital resources for women farmers is indispensable to enhance their capacity and compliance to adjust production methods in response to climate change. Facilitating increased farm output and income among the farmers is greatly recommended.","[Waaswa, Andrew; Nkurumwa, Agnes Oywaya] Egerton Univ, Dept Agr Educ & Extens, POB 536, Egerton, Kenya; [Kibe, Anthony Mwangi] Egerton Univ, Dept Crops Hort & Soils, Egerton, Kenya; [Ng'eno, Joel Kipkemoi] Egerton Univ, Dept Curriculum Instruct & Educ Management, Egerton, Kenya",,"Waaswa, A (corresponding author), Egerton Univ, Dept Agr Educ & Extens, POB 536, Egerton, Kenya.",waaswa22@gmail.com,"Waaswa, Andrew/AAI-8082-2021","Waaswa, Andrew/0000-0002-0120-1440",,,,,100,1,1,0,0,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-9984,,DISCOV SUSTAIN,Discov.

To resume their growth and for successful fruit production, they need to accumulate winter chill. It is expected that global warming will diminish winter chill availability with potentially negative impacts on the viability and yield of these crops. The objective of this study was to assess the viability of seven tree crops among the most relevant in peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands. For this purpose, chilling requirements were gathered from the literature to define a requirement range for each tree crop encompassing most of the varieties used in Spain. Then the bias-adjusted outputs of an ensemble of 10 regional climate models under the two representative concentration pathways (RCPs), 4.5 and 8.5, were used to feed a chilling model for calculating chill accumulation. The ensemble's outcome agreement index was applied to each combination of chill requirement and climate ensemble to assess crop viability. This was done by testing the hypothesis that the winter chill accumulation will be greater than the safe winter chill for the 2021-2050 (near future) and 2071-2100 (far future) periods and for both RCPs. A future reduction in the safe winter chill areas is projected with high agreement in climate projections across peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands independently of the RCP or future period. The crops studied would be viable in the near future period as long as varieties with low chilling requirements are used. These varieties, however, would not be adequate in the far future in some currently highly productive regions, where the situation would become more severe, especially under the RCP8.5 scenario. In these cases, adaptation would be possible by shifting the crop to adjacent areas together with careful variety selection in terms of chilling requirements. The results indicate that the RCP8.5 scenario in the far future has an especially negative impact on the crops analysed, calling for resolute mitigation measures to guarantee tree crop production and food security. Recommendations for adaptation, with low uncertainty regarding climate projections, were included here, using actual tree varieties, thereby facilitating interpretation and on-field application for farmers and agricultural technicians.","[Rodriguez, Alfredo; Perez-Lopez, David; Centeno, Ana; Ruiz-Ramos, Margarita] Univ Politecn Madrid, CEIGRAM, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Rodriguez, Alfredo] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ Anal & Finances, Toledo 45071, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Centro de Estudios e Investigacion para la Gestion de Riesgos Agrarios Medioambientales CEIGRAM; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Rodriguez, A (corresponding author), Calle Senda del Rey 13,Campus Pract, Madrid 28040, Spain.",alfredo.rodriguez@uclm.es,"Perez, David/HMV-6566-2023; Perez-Lopez, David/F-2285-2013; Rodríguez, Alfredo/E-9190-2017; Centeno, Ana/F-4913-2016","Perez, David/0000-0001-7188-4921; Perez-Lopez, David/0000-0002-2835-5896; Rodríguez, Alfredo/0000-0001-7987-1623; Centeno, Ana/0000-0001-5592-5447",Spanish National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology [MACSUR02 - APCIN2016-0005-00-00]; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion Grant [MACSUR02 - APCIN2016-0005-00-00]; Comunidad de Madrid (Spain) [AGRISOST-CM S2018/BAA-4330]; Structural Funds 2014-2020 (ERDF) [AGRISOST-CM S2018/BAA-4330]; Structural Funds 2014-2020 (ESF) [AGRISOST-CM S2018/BAA-4330],Spanish National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion Grant; Comunidad de Madrid (Spain)(Comunidad de Madrid); Structural Funds 2014-2020 (ERDF); Structural Funds 2014-2020 (ESF),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Regional Climate, and the Working Group on Coupled Modelling, the former coordinating body of CORDEX and responsible panel for CMIP5.

To better understand whether and how environmental outcomes are linked to these microlevel social relations or network structures, we quantified individual farm-and community-level biomass accumulation and carbon stocks associated with the adoption of agroforestry, a set of farming techniques for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. We also collected social network data on individual farmers across five communities. This empirical evidence was derived from primary fieldwork conducted in the Ghanaian semideciduous cocoa (Theobroma cacao)-growing region. This data set was examined using standard network analysis, combined with exponential random graph models (ERGMs). The key findings suggest that farmers with more biomass accumulation from the adoption of agroforestry practices also tend to be popular advisers to their peers at the local level. Presumably, farmers seek peers who demonstrate clear signs of achieving successful land management goals. Using ERGMs, we also show that commonly observed individual-level results might not scale to the collective level. We discuss how our individual-scale findings could be leveraged to foster farmer-to-farmer social learning and knowledge exchange associated with resource-conserving agricultural practices.

It was possible to understand that the project: (i) was conceived to take into account the effects of SLR in the long-term; (ii) incorporates specific adaptation measures (mainly regulatory measures); (iii) combines accommodation and protection as response options to SLR.","[Fernandes, Andre; de Sousa, Joao Figueira; Brito, Susana S.; Neves, Bruno] Fac Social Sci & Humanities FCSH NOVA, Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci CICS NOVA, Lisbon, Portugal; [Vicente, Tania] Fac Social Sci & Humanities FCSH NOVA, Inst Contemporary Hist, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Fernandes, A (corresponding author), Fac Social Sci & Humanities FCSH NOVA, Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci CICS NOVA, Lisbon, Portugal.",andre.fernandes@fcsh.unl.pt,"Neves, Bruno/Y-3149-2019; Vicente, Tânia/HGA-5452-2022","Neves, Bruno/0000-0003-4167-7301; ",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT/MCTES) [SFRH/BPD/110975/2015]; European Social Fund; POPH; CICS.NOVA - Interdisciplinary Centre of Social Sciences of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa [UID/SOC/04647/2013]; FCT/MCTES through National funds; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/SOC/04647/2013] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT/MCTES)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); POPH; CICS.NOVA - Interdisciplinary Centre of Social Sciences of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa; FCT/MCTES through National funds(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,"The work presented in this article was funded by Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT/MCTES) (Grant SFRH/BPD/110975/2015, co-funded by the European Social Fund and POPH) and supported by CICS.NOVA - Interdisciplinary Centre of Social Sciences of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa (UID/SOC/04647/2013), with the financial support of FCT/MCTES through National funds.",,40,2,2,3,15,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,COCONUT CREEK,"5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA",0749-0208,1551-5036,,J COASTAL RES,J.

For assessing potential changes in flood risk, this paper presents an integrated model chain quantifying flood hazards and losses while considering climate and land use changes. In the case study region, risk estimates for the present and the near future illustrate that changes in flood risk by 2030 are relatively low compared to historic periods. While the impact of climate change on the flood hazard and risk by 2030 is slight or negligible, strong urbanisation associated with economic growth contributes to a remarkable increase in flood risk. Therefore, it is recommended to frequently consider land use scenarios and economic developments when assessing future flood risks. Further, an adapted and sustainable risk management is necessary to encounter rising flood losses, in which non-structural measures are becoming more and more important. The case study demonstrates that adaptation by non-structural measures such as stricter land use regulations or enhancement of private precaution is capable of reducing flood risk by around 30 %. Ignoring flood risks, in contrast, always leads to further increasing losses-with our assumptions by 17 %. These findings underline that private precaution and land use regulation could be taken into account as low cost adaptation strategies to global climate change in many flood prone areas. Since such measures reduce flood risk regardless of climate or land use changes, they can also be recommended as no-regret measures.","[Thieken, Annegret H.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Cammerer, Holger; Dobler, Christian; Schoeberl, Fritz] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innrain 52f, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Lammel, Johannes] AlpS GmbH, Grabenweg 68, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Cammerer, Holger] DEVK Ruckversicherungs & Beteiligungs AG, Riehler Str 190, D-50735 Cologne, Germany; [Dobler, Christian] Govt Tyrol, Heiliggeiststr 7-9, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Lammel, Johannes] TIWAG Tiroler Wasserkraft AG, Eduard Wallnofer Pl 2, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Potsdam; University of Innsbruck,"Thieken, AH (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",thieken@uni-potsdam.de,"Thieken, Annegret Henriette/B-1946-2017","Thieken, Annegret Henriette/0000-0001-7068-2615",Klima-und Energiefonds [A963631]; University of Innsbruck; Tyrolean government,Klima-und Energiefonds; University of Innsbruck; Tyrolean government,"The authors thank the 'Klima-und Energiefonds' funding a large part of this study carried out in frame of the FloodTimeS project of the Austrian Climate Research Program (Contract No. A963631).

Demographic and socio-economic factors affect the extent to which a person is at risk from extreme heat, whilst empirical research of social vulnerability to heat outside a 'Western' context is relatively limited. Many countries still rely on expert judgements to draw locally specific context for heat vulnerability assessment. Yet, their view might not be evidence-informed and the result is influenced by who are involved. This paper reflects this point by eliciting expert views of social heat vulnerability in Taiwan through an expert questionnaire survey using the Analytic Hierarchy Process method, and the result was compared to existing empirical research. Our study finds that experts consider factors related to adaptive capacity, especially societal support, as the most important; but rate gender and ethnicity as the least important. Although experts point to the importance of adaptive capacity, there are relatively few empirical studies to date in societal support, and the low priority given to gender and ethnicity also contradicts prior empirical research. For heat risk assessment, our findings show that whilst systematic elicitation of expert judgement may help to fill gaps in empirical evidence specific to the local context, caution should be paid to the significant divergence with existing empirical data and expert opinions depending on who are selected to involve.","[Shih, Wan-Yu] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Disaster Management, 5 Ming Rd, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan; [Mabon, Leslie] Open Univ, Sch Engn & Innovat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",Ming Chuan University; Open University - UK,"Shih, WY (corresponding author), Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Disaster Management, 5 Ming Rd, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan.",shih@mail.mcu.edu.tw; leslie.mabon@open.ac.uk,,"Shih, Wan-Yu/0000-0003-4427-492X; Mabon, Leslie/0000-0003-2646-6119","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Royal Society of Edinburgh, United Kingdom [MOST 106 -2911-I-130 -502, MOST 107 -2911-I-130 -507]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Royal Society of Edinburgh, United Kingdom","This work was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Royal Society of Edinburgh, United Kingdom joint research project (MOST 106 -2911-I-130 -502, MOST 107 -2911-I-130 -507).",,118,5,5,2,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

However, mango is susceptible to climate change risk resulting in the adoption of innovations among mango farmers. Drawing on the protection motivation and the innovation diffusion the-ories, this study assesses the effect of climate change perceptions on the adoption of innovations among mango farmers in the Yilo Krobo Municipality, Ghana. The study used data collected from 204 randomly selected farmers through a questionnaire survey. Data collected were subjected to basic descriptive and inferential analysis. Results show that mango farmers associated post-harvest losses, frequent droughts, rising temperature, declining rainfall, and pests and diseases to climate change. The participants have adopted management, technological and process in-novations such as the application of improved seedlings and agrochemicals, practising irrigation farming and using social media and networks to market their business. Results further reveal that mango farmers' adoption of innovation is largely determined by their contextual and composi-tional demographic characteristics such as age, education, size of plantation and years of farming experience. In addition, climate change perceptions particularly frequent droughts influence smallholder farmers' adoption of innovation. Government and other stakeholders need to in-crease access to socioeconomic resources and education to enhance farmers' adaptive capacity and improve their adoption of innovations.","[Asare-Nuamah, Peter] Univ Environm & Sustainable Dev, Sch Sustainable Dev, Somanya, Ghana; [Antwi-Agyei, Philip] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Dick-Sagoe, Christopher] Univ Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana; [Adeosun, Oluyemi Theophilus] Univ Lagos, Dept Econ, Lagos, Nigeria",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Botswana; University of Lagos,"Asare-Nuamah, P (corresponding author), Univ Environm & Sustainable Dev, Sch Sustainable Dev, Somanya, Ghana.",pasare-nuamah@uesd.edu.gh,"DICK-SAGOE, CHRISTOPHER/J-4673-2015","DICK-SAGOE, CHRISTOPHER/0000-0001-5295-252X; ASARE-NUAMAH, PETER/0000-0002-3122-909X; Adeosun, Oluyemi/0000-0003-1683-4053; Antwi-Agyei, Philip/0000-0002-8599-474X",,,,,70,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-4645,2211-4653,,ENVIRON DEV,Environ.

Early warning systems have four components: (1) risk knowledge, (2) monitoring and warning, (3) warning dissemi-nation and communication, and (4) response capability. While there is room to improve all four of these components, we argue that the largest gaps in early warning systems fall in the latter two categories: warning dissemination/communication and response capability. We illustrate this by examining the four components of early warning systems for the deadliest and costliest meteo-rological disasters of this century, demonstrating that the lack of EWS protection is not a lack of forecasts or warnings, but rather a lack of adequate communication and lack of response capa-bility. Improving the accuracy of weather forecasts is unlikely to offer major benefits without resolving these gaps in communication and response capability. To protect vulnerable groups around the world, we provide recommendations for investments that would close such gaps, such as improved communication channels, impact forecasts, early action policies and infrastructure. It is our hope that further investment to close these gaps can better deliver on the goal of reducing deaths and damages with EWS.","[de Perez, Erin Coughlan; Easton-Calabria, Evan; Ezike, Theodore; Maxwell, Daniel G.; Poole, Leah B.; Rathod, Komal; Van Sant, Carolyn] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [de Perez, Erin Coughlan; Heinrich, Dorothy; Jack, Christopher; Poole, Leah B.] Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, The Hague, Netherlands; [Berse, Kristoffer B.; Depante, Lianne Angelico C.; Evidente, Elton Pierre R.; Lagmay, Alfredo Mahar Francisco A.] Univ Philippines, Resilience Inst, Quezon City, Philippines; [Berse, Kristoffer B.] Univ Philippines, Natl Coll Publ Adm & Governance, Quezon City, Philippines; [Jack, Christopher] Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Lendelvo, Selma; Pinto, Mecthilde] Univ Namibia, Multidisciplinary Res Serv, Windhoek, Namibia; [Marunye, Joalane] Natl Univ Lesotho, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Roma, Lesotho; [Murshed, Sonia Binte; Shampa] Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Inst Water & Flood Management IWFM, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Orach, Christopher Garimoi] Makerere Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Community Hlth & Behav Sci, Kampala, Uganda",Tufts University; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; University of Cape Town; University of Namibia; Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET); Makerere University,"de Perez, EC (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Boston, MA 02111 USA.;de Perez, EC (corresponding author), Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, The Hague, Netherlands.",,", Shampa/A-1567-2015",", Shampa/0000-0001-9650-960X; Depante, Lianne Angelico/0000-0002-1752-0382","Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Bureau for Management, U.S. Agency for International Development [720BHA21CA00044]","Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Bureau for Management, U.S. Agency for International Development","This publication was made possible through support provided by the Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Bureau for Management, U.S. Agency for International Development, under the terms of a Cooperative Agreement No. 720BHA21CA00044.

We focus on: extreme events; acute vs. chronic hazards (floods vs. droughts); a shorter event horizon (5 years vs. 75-100 years); and a shorter planning and operational cycle.

Prior research on Corn Belt farmers' perspectives on climate change employed a latent class analysis (LCA) that created a six-class typology-the Concerned, Uneasy, Uncertain, Unconcerned, Confident, and Detached-to develop a better understanding of farmer perspectives on climate change and inform more effective climate adaptation and mitigation outreach strategies. The LCA employed 34 variables that are generally unobservable- beliefs about climate change, experience with extreme weather, perceived risks of climate change, and attitudes toward climate action-to identify types. The research reported in this paper builds on this typology of Corn Belt farmers by exploring 33 measures of observable farm enterprise characteristics, land management practices, and farmer demographics to assess whether variations in these observable characteristics between the six farmer classes display systematic patterns that might be sufficiently distinctive to guide audience segmentation strategies. While analyses detected some statistically significant differences, there were few systematic, meaningful observable patterns of difference between groups of farmers with differing perspectives on climate change. In other words, farmers who believe that anthropogenic climate change is occurring, that it poses risks to agriculture, and that adaptive action should be taken, may look very much like farmers who deny the existence of climate change and do not support action. The overall implication of this finding is that climate change engagement efforts by Extension and other agricultural advisors should use caution when looking to observable characteristics to facilitate audience segmentation. Additional analyses indicated that the farmer types that tended to be more concerned about climate change and supportive of adaptive action (e.g., Concerned and Uneasy) reported that they were more influenced by key private and public sector actors in agricultural social networks. On the other hand, farmers who were not concerned about climate change or supportive of adaptation (e. g., the Unconcerned, Confident, and Detached groups, comprising between one-third and one-half of respondents) were less integrated into agricultural networks.

This article conceptualizes proportionality as a feature of policy design to compare different policy strategies launched in response to current and expected changes in the policy context and contributes to comparative policy theory and practice. The conceptual framework is operationalized with climate change as a complex policy problem that challenges policymakers in designing proportionate strategies to enable adaptation to change in the climate and associated impacts. Under conditions of uncertainty, policy piloting provides an opportunity to experiment and test the design features of alternatives to status quo policies to function in a changed policy context. The theoretical discussion is supplemented with examples of policy pilots launched as a form of policy experimentation to address climatic risks to agriculture in rainfed zones of India. Policy design features in four settings of change in policy context, ranging from small-scale incremental to highly flexible adaptive responses, are compared using the framework of proportionality.","[Nair, Sreeja] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Lee Kuan Yew Ctr Innovat Cities, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore University of Technology & Design,"Nair, S (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Lee Kuan Yew Ctr Innovat Cities, Singapore, Singapore.",sreeja.nair@u.nus.edu,,"Nair, Sreeja/0000-0003-3179-7238",,,,,82,3,3,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1387-6988,1572-5448,,J COMP POLICY ANAL,J.

Examining the Case of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) in Uganda,FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change adaptation; subjectivity; power relations; gender; Africa; climate-smart agriculture; worldviews,REDD PLUS; ADAPTATION; FRAMEWORK; DISCOURSES; AUTHORITY; POLICIES; SYSTEMS; POWER,"In this paper, we investigate the ways in which climate change-related interventions such as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) may open up-or close down-spaces for transformation. We explore the interface between worldviews, power relations and policy interventions, focusing in particular on the way that asymmetric gender and expert-farmer relations may be reinforced or contested through climate-smart agricultural interventions. It has been argued that fundamental changes required in the face of climate change can only take place through transformation across the personal, practical and political spheres. In particular, it is in the interaction between these spheres where spaces for transformation lie; for example, in the contesting of subjectivities casting farmers as passive recipients of expert advice, in the assumptions regarding what constitutes good development, and in how worldviews frame the way we see human-nature relations. Nevertheless, interventions like CSA are often focused mainly on changes to practices or technologies, rather than on how power relations or worldviews shape practices, food security and inequity. Through a case study of Hoima, Uganda, we examine the ways in which the implementation of climate-smart agriculture reinforces existing subjectivities and authority relations or opens up for new (and potentially more emancipatory) subjectivities. First, we describe food security and social inequality drawing on survey data from Hoima. Next, we examine how social actors such as farmers, project workers, local leaders, and government officials position particular farmers or practices as good/progressive or problematic/traditional. We then analyze how these subjectivities reflect authority relations, and the ways in which CSA reinforces or creates space for contesting these. We argue that a focus on commercial agriculture as good by many social actors also persists within CSA activities, and is intertwined with asymmetric gender and expert-farmer relations. Commercialization takes place within the need to increase agricultural production to feed growing urban populations. However, commercialization for the case of Uganda has also entailed state attempts to govern farmers through farmer associations, the institutional set-up through which CSA often works. A closer attention to these dynamics could potentially help create deeper transformational change through climate-smart agriculture and related climate change interventions.","[Eriksen, Siri Hallstrom] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, As, Norway; [Eriksen, Siri Hallstrom; Vetrhus, Ingvild] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, As, Norway; [Cramera, Laura Katherine; Thornton, Philip] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Nairobi, Kenya; [Cramera, Laura Katherine; Thornton, Philip] Int Livestock Res Inst, Sustainable Livestock Syst, Nairobi, Kenya",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; CGIAR; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Eriksen, SH (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, As, Norway.;Eriksen, SH (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, As, Norway.",ski.eriksen@nmbu.no,,"Thornton, Philip/0000-0002-1854-0182; Cramer, Laura/0000-0003-1559-3497",Department of International Environment and Development Studies; CGIAR Trust Fund,Department of International Environment and Development Studies; CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR),"This work was supported by the Department of International Environment and Development Studies through an MSc thesis travel grant.

At the same time, the economic contribution of coastal construction is being confounded by the fiscal peril facing Florida (Bird in Ann Geomorph 57:1-9, 1985, Pew Center on the States 2009, U. S BEA 2009). It is therefore an opportune time for an evaluation of coastal erosion policy response which specifically addresses coastal construction. Furthermore in Florida, an increasing coastal population requiring the provision of structural development necessitates an improved understanding of how legislative intent which avoids the cumulative impacts of development is translated through quantified policy response. This study characterizes how coastal development trends in Florida have responded to critical erosion designation. Using spatial and temporal analysis of coastal construction permitting data from 1987 to 2007, three coastal counties in northwest Florida were selected for this study. This selection was based on proximity to the designated ecologically sensitive Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve (ANERR). This study has indicated that clusters of development have not been reduced or redirected by critical erosion designation in certain areas of the study counties. Therefore this study has implications for the regulatory framework governing coastal development permitting in Florida, which is of timely relevance for sea-level rise adaptation.","[Marshall, Ariana; Robinson, Larry; Owens, Marcia Allen] Florida A&M Univ, Inst Environm Sci, NOAA, Environm Cooperat Sci Ctr, Tallahassee, FL USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University,"Marshall, A (corresponding author), Florida A&M Univ, Inst Environm Sci, NOAA, Environm Cooperat Sci Ctr, Tallahassee, FL USA.",Ariana1.marshall@famu.edu; larry.robinson@famu.edu; marcia.owens@famu.edu,,,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through the Environmental Cooperative Science Center; Doris Duke Conservation Foundation,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through the Environmental Cooperative Science Center; Doris Duke Conservation Foundation,"Funding for this project was provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Educational Partnership Program through a cooperative agreement with the Environmental Cooperative Science Center led by Florida A&M University.

Constructing Venice's flood disaster risk personality,SHIMA-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH INTO ISLAND CULTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change adaptation; disaster risk management; disaster risk reduction; floods; risk,DOCUMENTARY; OCTOBER,"Part of Venice's character and appeal is sometimes constructed and construed as being not just about water, but also about the role which flood management plays, especially avoiding floods. A 'disaster risk personality' is created regarding water-land interaction, based mainly on avoiding inundation. This paper explores the construction of this approach for Venice's flood disaster risk personality through a conceptual examination of Venice as an aquapelago to understand water-land links and separations. With this baseline, three decision-making lessons for Venice's flood disaster risk personality are detailed: (i) the dynamicity of the water-land interface and hence the aquapelago, (ii) the impact of structural approaches on disaster risk personality, and (iii) the implications of submergence. While non-structural approaches to flood risk management tend to have the best long-term successes in averting flood disasters, Venice has chosen the opposite approach of constructing a large barrier, substantively changing its disaster risk personality. This choice is not inherently positive or negative, with the desirability and usefulness being subjective and based on the (flood) disaster risk personality sought for the locale.","[Kelman, Ilan] UCL, London, England; [Kelman, Ilan] Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway",University of London; University College London; University of Agder,"Kelman, I (corresponding author), UCL, London, England.;Kelman, I (corresponding author), Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway.",ilan_kelman@hotmail.com,,"Kelman, Ilan/0000-0002-4191-6969",,,,,66,1,1,3,4,"MACQUARIE UNIV, DIV HUMANITIES",SYDNEY,"MACQUARIE UNIV, SYDNEY, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA",1834-6049,1834-6057,,SHIMA,Shima,,2021,15,1,,,,,80,93,,10.21463/shima.102,http://dx.doi.org/10.21463/shima.102,,,14,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,RN1ZH,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000640151600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, research on local climate perceptions to date has tended to focus on what changes are perceived, not on how those changes are interpreted in particular socio-cultural contexts and given meaning within local worldviews and systems of values and beliefs. Based on fieldwork in agro-pastoral communities in highland Cusco, Peru, this study examines climate perceptions in terms of how local community members understand and explain changing climatic conditions. Specifically, two local climate narratives are identified and found to relate to Andean re-interpretations of Catholic and Evangelical religious traditions. The Andean practice of ritual offering to the earth (pago a la tierra) is found to play a key role both in the shifting religious identifications encountered at the local level, and in giving meaning to changing climatic conditions. The article further explores how these perspectives are rooted in diverging ontological and epistemological foundations. While in the local Catholic view the earth is conceived of as a non-human sacred/social person (pachamama or Santa Tierra) with whom a relationship of reciprocity must be maintained, the local Evangelical perspective instead conceives of the earth as an object, not a subject, more closely mirroring modernist Nature/Culture dualism. More broadly, the study suggests that how people interpret changing climatic conditions cannot simply be extracted and purified from the contexts of meaning production, and proposes the concept of 'entangled narratives' as a way of accounting for the social and cultural embeddedness of climate perceptions. Fulfilling our obligation to address climate change in socially just ways will require deepening our understanding of its human dimensions, including taking seriously what these changes may mean to the impacted groups.

Greenspace has been argued to have significant potential to mitigate urban heat island effect in urban areas, and thus to reduce risks to human health and wellbeing intensified by global warming. Based on remote sensing data and subsequent spatial analysis carried out for Taipei Metropolis, this paper argues that greenspace features lowering temperature within greenspaces are not necessarily to have explicit cooling contribution on surrounding built environments. For mitigating urban heat at the area nearby greenspaces, greenspace size, shape and greenness may have limited effect, whereas increasing greenery at greenspace edges and enhancing greenspace cohesion are more effective means of extending cooling benefits. In turn, findings from Taipei Metropolis suggest urban planners ought to: consider relative locations in the city when designing a cooling intervention; work to preserve large greenspaces; extent greenery at greenspace surroundings and find means to connect existing cool islands.

However, increasing climate risk from flooding, overheating and water scarcity threatens this, creating the need for adaptation. An adaption pathway describes a structured sequence of adaptation decisions that are designed to manage climate risk in a wide range of possible future conditions. Analysis of sequential adaptation decision 'pathways' helps to demonstrate how climate risk can (or cannot) be managed, whilst retaining the flexibility to respond to future uncertainties. Whilst adaptive planning has gained increasing attention, the uptake of such methods has been relatively limited compared to the scale of the adaptation challenge due to institutional, financial and methodological barriers. This paper introduces a framework for adaptation planning in urban water supply systems that links existing risk-based decision-making with the development of long-term adaptation pathways. We present a quantified assessment of how the risk of water shortages in London is predicted to vary dynamically through to 2100 depending on the choice of adaptation pathways and under different long-term transient population and climate scenarios. This approach helps to reconcile multiple decision timescales and demonstrates the value of strategic long-term adaptation planning to stakeholders by outlining long-term futures that may influence medium-term decision-making. Adopting a flexible approach to adaptation will be critical to the management of risk under uncertainty. This adaptation pathways approach demonstrates an effective framework for informing such decision processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on a survey of 162 farmers in California, we test three hypotheses regarding climate policy risk: (1) that perceived climate change risks will have a direct impact on farmer's responses to climate policy risks, (2) that previous climate change experiences will influence farmer's climate change perceptions and climate policy risk responses, and (3) that past experiences with environmental policies will more strongly affect a farmer's climate change beliefs, risks, and climate policy risk responses. Using a structural equation model we find support for all three hypotheses and furthermore show that farmers' negative past policy experiences do not make them less likely to respond to climate policy risks through participation in a government incentive program. We discuss how future research and climate policies can be structured to garner greater agricultural participation. This work highlights that understanding climate policy risk responses and other social, economic and policy perspectives is a vital component of understanding climate change beliefs, risks and behaviors and should be more thoroughly considered in future work.

Despite its apparent advantages, suboptimal adoption rates persist. According to the existing literature, determinants of irrigation adoption are often highly dependent on cultural, contextual, and/or local institutional factors. Yet, studies from diverse geographies identify a consistent set of factors. Thus, to be able to make generalizable inferences from such studies, a global geographic representativeness assessment of irrigation adoption studies was conducted to determine whether identified factors influencing irrigation were the result of geographic, epistemological, or disciplinary biases. The results indicate that multiple geographic biases exist with respect to studying farmers' irrigation adoption decision-making. More research on this topic is being conducted in regions that have little to a high percentage of irrigation (>1%), are readily accessible, receive moderate amounts of average annual rainfall, and have moderate amounts of cropland cover. The results suggest the need to expand research efforts in areas with little to no irrigation to identify constraints and help accelerate economic growth, poverty reduction, and food and livelihood security for rural communities in these regions.","[Pathak, Ruchie; Magliocca, Nicholas R.] Univ Alabama, Dept Geog, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Pathak, R (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Geog, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401 USA.",rpathak@crimson.ua.edu,,"Magliocca, Nicholas/0000-0002-0971-0207",National Science Foundation [1856054],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The authors were supported by a National Science Foundation award INFEWS #1856054.,,124,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,DEC,2022,12,12,,,,,,,2105,10.3390/agriculture12122105,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12122105,,,31,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,7F7WA,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000902051800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Taiwan, an island state, is deeply threatened by the multiple threats posed by climate change. However, different urban and rural areas have numerous adaptation approaches due to their differences in vulnerability. In Taipei City (urban), its biophysical vulnerability is mainly affected by flooded areas and high flood depths caused by landslides and heavy rains. Its social vulnerability is affected by economic development, high household assets, and population concentration. In Yunlin County (rural), its biophysical vulnerability is also affected by flooded areas and high flood depths caused by heavy rains. Its social vulnerability is affected by the elderly living alone, low household assets, and low healthcare. In order to propose appropriate adaptation strategies of urban and rural areas under different vulnerabilities, this study uses an overlapping method to examine the relationship between the integrated vulnerability (biophysical and social) of Taipei and Yunlin along with the ecological footprint (EF), a measurement of human demands for resources and ecological services. This study reviews the literature and uses Taiwan's NCDR (National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction) data to analyze the biophysical vulnerability and the social vulnerability and further calculate the integrated vulnerability. In this study, questionnaire surveys were conducted. In Taipei, 446 valid questionnaires were collected, while 393 were collected in Yunlin. The results show that personal EF in Taipei is higher than that in Yunlin. In the end, this study elucidates the relationship between integrated vulnerability and personal EF of Taipei and Yunlin. Four types of risk areas in urban Taipei and rural Yunlin are sorted out (high vulnerability/high EF, high vulnerability/low EF, low vulnerability/high EF, and low vulnerability/low EF). The empirical results can be adopted by local governments, communities, and NGOs to establish appropriate strategies for mitigation and adaptation in the different risk areas.","[Lee, Yung-Jaan; Lin, Shih-Ying] Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, Taipei, Taiwan",,"Lee, YJ (corresponding author), Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, Taipei, Taiwan.",yungjaanlee@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,57,4,4,5,49,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

In this study, we investigate risk-reduction behavior at the household level in three European Union Member States with fundamentally different insurance and compensation schemes. We try to understand if and how insurance and public assistance influence private risk-reduction behavior. Data were collected using a telephone survey (n = 1,849) of household decisionmakers in flood-prone areas. We show that insurance overall is positively associated with private risk-reduction behavior. Warranties, premium discounts, and information provision with respect to risk reduction may be an explanation for this positive relationship in the case of structural measures. Public incentives for risk-reduction measures by means of financial and in-kind support, and particularly through the provision of information, are also associated with enhancing risk reduction. In this study, public compensation is not negatively associated with private risk-reduction behavior. This does not disprove such a relationship, but the negative effect may be mitigated by factors related to respondents' capacity to implement measures or social norms that were not included in the analysis. The data suggest that large-scale flood protection infrastructure creates a sense of security that is associated with a lower level of preparedness. Across the board there is ample room to improve both public and private policies to provide effective incentives for household-level risk reduction.","[Hanger, Susanne; Linnerooth-Bayer, Joanne; Lorant, Anna] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Risk & Resilience Program, Laxenburg, Austria; [Hanger, Susanne; Patt, Anthony] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Climate Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Surminski, Swenja] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Nenciu-Posner, Cristina; Ionescu, Radu] Univ Bucharest, Fac Geog, Bucharest, Romania",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Bucharest,"Hanger, S (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",hanger@iiasa.ac.at,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Hanger, Susanne/0000-0001-7223-9991; Bayer, Joanne/0000-0003-3084-2471",Austrian Climate Research Program [KR11AC0K00277]; FP7 project ENHANCE,Austrian Climate Research Program; FP7 project ENHANCE,"The research for this article was funded through the Austrian Climate Research Program (project number: KR11AC0K00277), and benefited from collaboration under the FP7 project ENHANCE.

We investigated whether the precautionary principle provides the basis for a coherent framework to prevent environmental harm, and does it work in practice? We suggest that, in principle, the precautionary principle makes good sense. In practice, however, it is imprecise in policy and law and fails to fulfil its promise because it is loosely defined and thus lacks substance and clarity. Consequently, it operates in a framework that is ambiguous, leaving it open to manipulation by discretionary powers. To counter such deficiencies, human-induced environmental harm should be formally observed as 'criminogenic' and environmental protection prioritised against which other competing priorities (e.g., 'year on year' economic growth) are measured. This would overcome the politico-legal obfuscation and contestations of climate change policy that currently impedes the precautionary principle's practical application.","[Dark, Stephen Michael; Burgin, Shelley] Bond Univ, Fac Soc & Design, Gold Coast City, Australia; [Burgin, Shelley] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Sci & Hlth, Penrith, NSW, Australia",Bond University; Western Sydney University,"Burgin, S (corresponding author), Bond Univ, Fac Soc & Design, Gold Coast City, Australia.;Burgin, S (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Sch Sci & Hlth, Penrith, NSW, Australia.",s.burgin@westernsydney.edu.au,,,,,,,43,2,2,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

A number of studies have analysed this strategy through the use of empirical, analytical methods, or numerical methods. These tend to focus on city or regional scale changes in land use with only a broad categorisation of greenspace type. This study tests seven greenspace scenarios that might be applied at a block or neighbourhood level and the resulting microclimate changes that can be achieved through such applications for a temperate city in northwest England. Using a suburban commercial site in Manchester, UK as the case study area, the research utilises the urban microclimate model ENVI-met to compare the changes in air and surface temperatures on a warm summer day in July 2010 (approximately 4 C above the rural reference July average maximum temperature). The modelling demonstrates that even in suburban areas in temperate cities a 5% increase in mature deciduous trees can reduce mean hourly surface temperatures by 1 C over the course of a summer's day. A marked increase in air temperature of 3.2 C at mid-day is modelled for the worst case scenario of replacing all current vegetation with asphalt. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Civil society organizations (CSOs) have an important role in health adaptation, but it is unknown what actions they are undertaking. Objectives: To identify and examine what adaptations are being developed by CSOs to adapt to the health effects of climate change based on a systematic review of the activities of 190 organizations and 1196 reported adaptation actions. Results: There were six key findings: (1) health adaptation actions are predominantly led by environmental CSOs; (2) most actions are occurring at national and regional levels; (3) food and/or water contamination and air quality are dominant climate change stimuli for action; (4) responses predominantly reflect awareness and research activities, with limited evidence of substantive intervention; (5) consideration of vulnerable groups is limited; and (6) climate change is usually considered alongside other factors, if at all. Conclusions: The results indicate a deficit in terms of what needs to be done for health adaptation and what is being done; part of a broader adaptation deficit in Canada. Coordinated adaptation planning at federal and provincial level is needed, involving collaboration between CSOs and public health bodies. (C) 2013 The Royal Society for Public Health.

For this purpose, the case study of a slope instability, that was triggered in 2021 was selected. The stability analysis was performed considering the theory of rainfall infiltration and using Geo-Studio's SEEP/W module for the surface infiltration model of the slope. A parametric stability analysis of the slope was conducted to determine the importance of climate change on slope stability. Conditions for changes in volumetric water content, water permeability, porewater pressure, and groundwater flow are important. When soil permeability is low, the factor of safety decreases during rainfall events and on the days following, while when permeability is higher, safety increases after rainfall events. The effect of lower cohesion is nearly linear, with the factor of safety decreasing by 0.1 for every 1 kPa less cohesion. The increase in net infiltration of water may be the most critical factor for slope instability. The results of the analysis indicate that timely reduction of water net infiltration through planting and proper surface water runoff from the upper road and slope would be a relatively simple and inexpensive measure compared to the cost of remediating the landslide, considering expected climate change. Therefore, it is advisable to analyze all slopes with respect to the expected climate change, taking into account the potential impacts of climate change.","[Bracko, Tamara; Zlender, Bojan; Jelusic, Primoz] Univ Maribor, Fac Civil Engn Traff Engn & Architecture, Smetanova 17, Maribor 2000, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Zlender, B (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Civil Engn Traff Engn & Architecture, Smetanova 17, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.",bojan.zlender@um.si,,"Jelusic, Primoz/0000-0002-0075-1096",Slovenian Research Agency [P2-0268]; GEOLAB project [101006512],Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); GEOLAB project,This research was funded by the Slovenian Research Agency (grant number P2-0268) and the GEOLAB project (grant number 101006512).,,29,1,1,4,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Despite the fact that structural measures such as flood walls and embankments play a vital role in disaster mitigation, it is observed that there is a gap in the development of effective, sustainable, and state of the art structural measures in Sri Lanka. This paper, in this context, aims to assess the nature of existing structural measures in the country in order to highlight what improvements are needed, and the costs and benefits of the necessary improvements. This is achieved through a comprehensive literature review followed by the analysis of twelve semi-structured interviews conducted with experts in the subject of structural measures for disaster mitigation. The findings reveal that Sri Lanka has sufficient types of structural measures in relation to floods, landslides, and coastline erosion compared to other developing countries. However, age and outdated technology are critical issues that hinder the expected performance of the measures. Moreover, it is observed that sufficient structural measures for mitigating the risk of drought related disasters are not in place in Sri Lanka compared to measures for other hydrometeorological hazards. The key benefits of improving structural measures in the country are identified as land development, economic growth, and increased stability of cities, and the main costs and challenges are high initial capital cost, high maintenance and repair cost, and the negligible residual value of structural measures. The findings of this study will lead to gaining a comprehensive understanding of gaps and weaknesses in structural measures in Sri Lanka and will influence policymakers and other respective practitioners in disaster mitigation to effectively enhance the existing portfolio of such measures.","[Ginige, Kanchana] Northumbria Univ, Fac Engn & Environm, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [Mendis, Kalindu; Thayaparan, Menaha] Univ Moratuwa, Fac Architecture, Dept Bldg Econ, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka",Northumbria University; University Moratuwa,"Ginige, K (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Fac Engn & Environm, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",kanchana.ginige@northumbria.ac.uk; mendisapkd.20@uom.lk; mthayaparan@uom.lk,"Thayaparan, Menaha/HKM-8252-2023","Mendis, A.P.K.D./0000-0002-4090-4923",,,,,103,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-0617,,,PROG DISASTER SCI,Prog.

Climate change will exacerbate several degradation processes. Investment in diverse restoration efforts, including sustainable agricultural and forest land management, as well as land set aside for conservation wherever possible, will generate co-benefits for climate change mitigation and adaptation and more broadly for human and societal well-being and the economy. This review highlights the magnitude of the degradation problem and some of the key challenges for ecological restoration. There are biophysical as well as societal limits to restoration. Better integrating policies to jointly address poverty, land degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions and removals is fundamental to reducing many existing barriers and contributing to climate-resilient sustainable development.","[Arneth, Almut; Rounsevell, Mark D.

Since 1982, France has had a natural disasters insurance system (CatNat') in place that covers flood damage. This insurance system has been combined with what are called Risk Prevention Plans' (PPRs) in order to stimulate the undertaking of flood risk mitigation measures by communities and households. However, these schemes do not provide optimal incentives for flood damage reduction. This is confirmed by the results from a survey about flood preparedness of 885 households who live in flood-prone areas in France, which are presented in this paper. Moreover, this study provides suggestions for improvement, which are assessed on their potential economic, social and political implications. Among these suggestions are increasing the effectiveness of PPRs and increasing the incentives to apply and implement PPRs; improving the monitoring of the implementation of damage mitigation measures; and the possibility to differentiate premiums and deductibles according to flood risk.","[Poussin, Jennifer K.; Botzen, W.

One key criticism directed towards CCS has been its inability to gain public support. This study compares public attitudes to the range of low carbon energy sources and technologies across Australia and China, and is the first study to compare primary data across these two countries on this topic. An online survey encompassing a broad set of questions was used to identify the factors that are associated with support for CCS compared to other energy technologies. Data were collected from a nationally representative Australian sample (n= 2383) and from Chinese urban residents across six regions (n= 1266). The survey confirmed low levels of knowledge and support for CCS in both countries. However, male respondents, those who perceived themselves to have higher knowledge of CCS, and those who valued economic outcomes over environmental protection were more likely to support CCS - as long as the risks were not perceived to outweigh the benefits. The results found that for Australians who believed in human-induced climate change they were likely to be unsupportive of CCS. This opposition appears to be linked to no tolerance for extending fossil fuels as in our factor analysis CCS was aligned to fossil fuels in Australia. In both countries, support for renewable energy technologies remains strong. Given the International Energy Agency's future energy demand projections, combined with slow progress towards meeting the Paris Climate Agreement, the lack of knowledge and support for CCS is concerning. While there have been some technological advances, without parallel improvements in public acceptance of CCS, it will be difficult to see any commercial projects going forward in the near future. Although, the Chinese government's success in educating on climate science, as evidenced in these results, suggests that they may be more effective at informing the public of the benefits of CCS and take the lead on its deployment for climate change mitigation. Based on the latest climate models, it is almost crunch time for governments to decide if CCS has a role to play as part of an energy transition to a low carbon future or perhaps it may be time to turn their focus to climate adaptation.","[Ashworth, Peta; Ferguson, Michele; Witt, Katherine] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Sun, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Key Lab Behav Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [She, Shengxiang] Guizhou Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, Peoples R China","University of Queensland; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Psychology, CAS; Guizhou University of Finance & Economics","Ashworth, P (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.;Sun, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Key Lab Behav Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",p.ashworth@uq.edu.au,"Ashworth, Peta/AAC-7378-2019","Ashworth, Peta/0000-0003-4648-7531; Witt, Katherine/0000-0002-5580-0246",Australian government under the Carbon Capture and Storage Research Development & Demonstration (CCS RDD) Fund; Australian Coal Association Low Emissions Technology Pty Ltd (ACALET); National Social Science Foundation of China [18BGL180]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9162017],Australian government under the Carbon Capture and Storage Research Development & Demonstration (CCS RDD) Fund; Australian Coal Association Low Emissions Technology Pty Ltd (ACALET); National Social Science Foundation of China; Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation),The UQ-SDAAP project is funded by the Australian government under the Carbon Capture and Storage Research Development & Demonstration (CCS RD&D) Fund (<SUP>~</SUP>AUDS.6 million).

Such knowledge, however, is rarely synthesized or summarized with any overall integrated analyses that could guide the development of proactive planning for the effects of climate change. Regional and local planning of climate adaptation strategies, for example, requires an examination of ecological sensitivities and vulnerabilities at relevant spatial resolutions. We developed an illustrative example of a habitat-based ecological vulnerability assessment for the whole of Canada's Pacific marine area using existing spatial information from this region and from the California Current ecosystem. Potential climate impacts were calculated as the product of estimated exposure (E) of habitats to multiple dimensions of changing climate variables and expert-derived sensitivity (S) ratings of those habitats to changes in those climate variables. Vulnerability was then derived as the product of the estimated potential climate impacts in a location and the estimated cumulative impacts (Cl) of non-climate stressors there, which we considered to be an inverse proxy of the adaptive capacity (AC) of the biota in those habitats. We found considerable spatial variability of potential climate impacts and vulnerability on the scales of the 12 Ecosections of Canada's Pacific, 25 habitat categories, and at finer scales. We produced maps of ecological vulnerability to climate change as an example output for use in spatially-oriented adaptation planning. Our initial assessment indicated that the Strait of Georgia in particular followed by Queen Charlotte Strait, Juan de Fuca Strait, Vancouver Island Shelf, and Johnstone Strait have relatively high vulnerabilities to climate change, in part due to concentrations of local stressors there. On a coast wide basis the habitats that were indicated as most vulnerable are shallow rocky reefs, seagrass habitats, kelp habitats, and deep rocky reefs. This approach for mapping vulnerability to climate change could be improved with finer scale climate data, additional climate variables, and stressor-habitat sensitivity estimates derived specifically for this system. We provide a stepwise manual for policy-makers, managers, or other practitioners to map ecological vulnerability to climate change in other marine settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on empirical evidence from Honduras, Ethiopia, Haiti, and Puerto Rico, and analysis of the global landscape of adaptation finance, this perspective identifies ways that designing policy under conditions of scarcity can inadvertently lead to adaptation policies that reinforce inequality and fail to address underlying social vulnerabilities. It reflects on two sources of scarcity that impact adaptation policy-lack of data and lack of finance-and acknowledges that despite the non-ideal conditions this scarcity creates, adaptation policy will be designed under these conditions. The perspective highlights issues to be aware of when designing adaptation policy and calls for greater attention to the social justice implications in the policy design process.","[Kuhl, Laura] Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Kuhl, L (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",l.kuhl@northeastern.edu,,,,,,,118,6,6,4,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-3330,2590-3322,,ONE EARTH,One Earth,FEB 19,2021,4,2,,,,,202,212,,10.1016/j.oneear.2021.01.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2021.01.008,,FEB 2021,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RW3WZ,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000646457900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods for reducing the UHI effects by landscape design are becoming increasingly critical in urban planning studies. Water bodies form urban cooling islands (UCI) to mitigate the UHI effects. This study investigated the UCI intensity and efficiency of 197 water bodies in Beijing, and their relationships with four descriptors of microclimatic landscape design, including the water body area (WA), geometry (landscape shape index, LSI), location (DIST) in reference to a defined city center, and surrounding built-up proportion (PB). Data of land cover and land surface temperature (LST) were extracted from ASTER images of August 8 of 2007. The UCI intensity was defined as the maximum LST gradient outside a water body area, while the UCI efficiency was used to represent the UCI intensity per unit area of a water body. The results indicated that: (1) the mean UCI intensity and efficiency was 0.54 degrees C/hm and 1.76 degrees C/hm/ha, respectively: (2) the UCI intensity was positively correlated with WA and PB, and negatively correlated with LSI and DIST; and (3) the UCI efficiency was positively correlated with PB, and negatively correlated with WA, LSI and DIST. Results of this study may help urban planners and designers in decision making to achieve optimal urban landscape designs for a more ecologically sound and pleasant living environment.

They are known to have a wide range of physical, economic, environmental and social impacts. Apart from damages to the physical environment, many climate risks (climate variability, extreme events and climate-related hazards) are associated with a variety of impacts on human well-being, health, and life-supporting systems. These vary from boosting the proliferation of vectors of diseases (e.g., mosquitos), to mental problems triggered by damage to properties and infrastructure. There is a great variety of literature about the strong links between climate change and health, while there is relatively less literature that specifically examines the health impacts of climate risks and extreme events. This paper is an attempt to address this knowledge gap, by compiling eight examples from a set of industrialised and developing countries, where such interactions are described. The policy implications of these phenomena and the lessons learned from the examples provided are summarised. Some suggestions as to how to avert the potential and real health impacts of climate risks are made, hence assisting efforts to adapt to a problem whose impacts affect millions of people around the world. All the examples studied show some degree of vulnerability to climate risks regardless of their socioeconomic status and need to increase resilience against extreme events.","[Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Chester St, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Al-Amin, Abul Quasem] Univ Tenaga Nasl UNITEN, Inst Energy Policy & Res IEPRe, Kajang 43000, Malaysia; [Al-Amin, Abul Quasem] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Nagy, Gustavo J.] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, IECA, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay; [Azeiteiro, Ulisses M.] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Azeiteiro, Ulisses M.] Univ Aveiro, CESAM Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Wiesbock, Laura] Univ Vienna, Dept Sociol, Rooseveltpl 2, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Ayal, Desalegn Y.] Addis Ababa Univ, CFSS, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa 150129, Ethiopia; [Morgan, Edward A.] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Mugabe, Paschal; Fudjumdjum, Hubert] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Fac Life Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr, Sustainabil & Climate Change Management, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Aparicio-Effen, Marilyn] UMSA, Unidad Cambio Climat Ambiente & Salud, IBBA, Fac Med, Claudio Sanjinez S-N, La Paz 999158, Bolivia; [Jabbour, Charbel Jose Chiappetta] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, F-34000 Montpellier, France","Manchester Metropolitan University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; University of Vienna; Addis Ababa University; Griffith University; Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; Universidad Mayor de San Andres; Montpellier Business School; Universite de Montpellier","Al-Amin, AQ (corresponding author), Univ Tenaga Nasl UNITEN, Inst Energy Policy & Res IEPRe, Kajang 43000, Malaysia.;Al-Amin, AQ (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",walter.leal2@haw-hamburg.de; Al.Amin@uniten.edu.my; gnagy@fcien.edu.uy; ulisses@ua.pt; laura.wiesboeck@univie.ac.at; desalula@gmail.com; ed.morgan@griffith.edu.au; paschalmugabe@hotmail.com; marilyneffen@gmail.com; fudjumh@yahoo.fr; cjcjabbour@gmail.com,"Azeiteiro, Ulisses Manuel de Miranda/C-5933-2008; Ayal, Desalegn Yayeh/AAG-3042-2021; Morgan, Edward/AAX-2372-2020; Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022; Al-Amin, Abul Quasem/AAH-4073-2019; Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; CHIAPPETTA JABBOUR, Charbel Jose/F-3505-2010; Hubert, Fudjumdjum/AAY-6345-2021","Azeiteiro, Ulisses Manuel de Miranda/0000-0002-5252-1700; Morgan, Edward/0000-0002-9239-4320; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Al-Amin, Abul Quasem/0000-0002-6097-1197; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; CHIAPPETTA JABBOUR, Charbel Jose/0000-0002-6143-4924; Hubert, Fudjumdjum/0000-0002-9354-6904; Ayal, Desalegn Y/0000-0001-8966-2673",,,,,87,14,14,6,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Desalinated seawater and wastewater are relatively reliable but expensive. Water from natural resources like reservoirs is generally cheaper but climate sensitive. We propose combining the operation of a reservoir and seawater and wastewater desalination plants for an overall system that is less vulnerable to scarcity and uncertainty, while constraining total cost. The joint system is modeled as a multiobjective optimization problem with the double objectives of minimizing risk and vulnerability, subject to a minimum limit on resilience. The joint model is applied to two cases, one based on the climate and demands of a location in India and the other of a location in California. The results for the Indian case indicate that it is possible for the joint system to reduce risk and vulnerability to zero given a budget increase of 20-120% under current climate conditions and 30-150% under projected future conditions. For the Californian case, this would require budget increases of 20-80% and 30-140% under current and future conditions, respectively. Further, our analysis shows a two-way interaction between the reservoir and desalination plants where the optimal operation of the former is just as much affected by the latter as the latter by the former. This highlights the importance of an integrated management approach. This study contributes to a greater quantitative understanding of desalination as a redundancy measure for adapting water supply infrastructures for a future of greater scarcity and uncertainty.","[Bhushan, Rashi; Ng, Tze Ling] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Ng, TL (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",tzeling@ust.hk,,"Ng, Tze Ling/0000-0002-3993-1625",General Research Fund (GRF) of the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong [617012],General Research Fund (GRF) of the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong,"This work is supported by project 617012 of the General Research Fund (GRF) of the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong.

It is incumbent on coastal governance regimes to address the vulnerability of coastal inhabitants to these hazards. This is especially so at the local level where development planning and control has a direct impact on the vulnerability of coastal communities. To reduce the vulnerability of coastal populations, risk mitigation and adaptation strategies need to be built into local spatial planning processes. Local government, however, operates within a complex hierarchal governance framework which may promote or limit particular actions. It is important, therefore, to understand how local coastal planning practices are shaped by national and supranational entities. Local governments also have to respond to the demands of local populations. Consequently, it is important to understand local populations' perceptions of coastal risk and its management. Adopting an in-depth study of coastal planning in County Mayo, Ireland, this paper evaluates: (a) how European and national policies and legislation shape coastal risk management at local level; (b) the incorporation of risk management strategies into local plans; and (c) local perception of coastal risks and risk management. Despite a strong steer from supranational and national legislation and policy, statutory local plans are found to be lacking in appropriate risk mitigation or adaptation strategies. Local residents appear to be lulled into a sense of complacency towards these risks because of the low level of attention afforded to them by the local planning authorities. To avoid potentially disastrous consequences for local residents and businesses, it is imperative that this situation is redressed urgently. Based on our analysis, we recommend: the development and implementation of a national ICZM strategy, supported by detailed local ICZM plans; and obliging local government to address known risks in their plans rather than defer them to project level decision making.

Current efforts to reduce dependency on EEA are not sufficient; they are based on limited past experiences with extreme events and are not based on the understanding of future risks.

Further, the article presents the concept of critical thresholds for extreme events as a metric to identify possible dependency on EEA. In addition, based on expert and policy consultations organized in the Philippines and Pakistan, we identify measures that can enhance the effectiveness of EEA including targeted EEA provision, better integration of lessons learned from the relief stage into the rest of the DRR operations, proper documentation of past assistance experiences and consideration of these lessons for the improvement of EEA in the future, as well as developing tools such as critical threshold concepts that can better guide the donor and recipient countries on more effective delivery of EEA.","[Prabhakar, Sivapuram Venkata Rama Krishna; Okano, Naoyuki] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Adaptat & Water Grp, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Tamura, Kentaro; Ikeda, Mariko] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Climate & Energy Grp, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan",,"Prabhakar, SVRK (corresponding author), Inst Global Environm Strategies, Adaptat & Water Grp, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan.",prabhakar@iges.or.jp; tamura@iges.or.jp; okano@iges.or.jp; marikoikeda1@gmail.com,,"Sivapuram Venkata Rama, Krishna Prabhakar/0000-0003-4502-1545; Okano, Naoyuki/0000-0001-8810-5680","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund [2-1801, 2-2102]; Strategic Research Fund (SRF) of the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies",Environment Research and Technology Development Fund; Strategic Research Fund (SRF) of the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies,"Authors are grateful for the financial support received from the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2-1801), Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2-2102), and Strategic Research Fund (SRF) of the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies.",,39,2,2,0,3,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-2463,,,POLITICS GOV,Politics Gov.,,2021,9,4,,,,,27,42,,10.17645/pag.v9i4.4457,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/pag.v9i4.4457,,,16,Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,WN8PF,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000712028400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This upwards trend is projected to continue, highlighting the need for adequate adaptation strategies. This raises the question of how to determine which adaptation strategies are preferred to cope with uncertain climate change impacts. This study shows how a multi-disciplinary cascade of hazard modelling, risk modelling, and a cost-benefit analysis can be applied to provide a first indicator of economically efficient adaptation strategies. We apply this approach to an analysis of flood risk and the desirability of flood protection in the state of Tabasco in Mexico, which faces severe flooding on an almost yearly basis. The results show that expected annual damage caused by coastal flooding is expected to increase from 0.53 billion USD today up to 4.12 billion USD in 2080 due to socio-economic development and climate change. For river floods, expected annual damages are estimated to increase from 1.79 billion USD up to 10.6 billion USD in 2080 if no adaptation measures are taken. Based on the estimated risk and cost-benefit analysis of installing flood protection infrastructure, we determined the economically optimal protection standards for both river and coastal floods as at least 100 years, if we take into account climate change. Our main conclusions are robust to key uncertainties about climate change impacts on flood risks, indirect damage caused by floods, the width of the protected floodplains, and the adopted social discount rate. We discuss how our multi-disciplinary approach can assist policy-makers in decisions about flood risk management, and how future research can extend our method to more refined local analyses which are needed to guide local adaptation planning.","[Haer, Toon; Botzen, W.

Increasing competition over shared water resources as well as climate water stress has attracted research efforts internationally addressing the benefits and costs of establishing water-sharing treaties. Despite this ongoing interest, few peer-reviewed works have investigated water development and use patterns that could produce economic gains for all parties from establishing transboundary water sharing agreements. This work develops an approach to address the gap by formulating and applying a basin-scale hydro-economic optimization model of West Africa's Volta River Basin. The work analyzes the effects of a prospective multilateral water allocation and hydropower trade agreement on the size, sign, and distribution of basin-wide economic benefits. The model includes two new large storage reservoirs, five water use purposes, and two climate water supply scenarios with and without a water sharing treaty. From that, it assesses the net economic benefit-maximizing patterns of water use with and without the treaty. Results show a Pareto Improving outcome is achievable for all riparian countries from new storage capacity in the basin for which at least one country is better and none is worse off. This improvement is achievable with a multilateral water sharing treaty implemented with power trading among the six basin countries. Results indicate that all basin countries have the potential to secure significant economic gains from additional hydropower production with the treaty. Under its implementation, upstream countries would reduce agricultural water use in exchange for higher valued hydropower benefits under the climate-stressed low flow scenario. Despite potential benefits that are shareable from negotiation, practical implementation of such a treaty will require considerable diplomatic skill, patience and effort.","[Baah-Kumi, Bernard] New Mexico State Univ, Water Sci & Management Program, Las Cruces, NM 88011 USA; [Ward, Frank A.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, Water Sci & Management Program, Las Cruces, NM 88011 USA",New Mexico State University; New Mexico State University,"Ward, FA (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, Water Sci & Management Program, Las Cruces, NM 88011 USA.",baahkumi@nmsu.edu; fward@nmsu.edu,"Baah-Kumi, Bernard/AAE-6125-2022","Baah-Kumi, Bernard/0000-0002-2763-0198",New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Station; U.S. Geological Survey,New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Station; U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey),The authors are grateful for support from the New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Station and the U.S. Geological Survey.,,159,0,0,12,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Cities are now considering interventions on specific urban characteristics known to contribute to the urban heat island (UHI) such as vegetation and imperviousness. Objectives: To explore how these urban characteristics influence the temperature-mortality relationship in the Paris region. Methods: We modeled the temperature-mortality relationship for the 1300 municipalities of the region from 1990 to 2015, while including an interaction with indicators that summarize the municipalities' main urban characteristics. Four indicators were tested: lack of green spaces, lack of trees, proportion of impervious surface, and overexposed population to a potential night UHI. Results: The shape of the temperature-mortality relationship was similar across all municipalities, but with a higher slope at the highest temperatures in municipalities with less green spaces, less trees, and more impervious soil. For instance, in Paris and its close suburbs, the relative risk associated with a temperature in the 99th percentile of the temperature distribution (compared to the 50th percentile) was 2.17 [IC95% 1.98:2.38] in municipalities with 40% of their surface covered by trees compared to 2.57 [IC 95% 2.47:2.68] in municipalities with only 3% of their surface covered by trees. Discussion: A lack of vegetation and a high degree of imperviousness were associated with a higher risk of heat related mortality in the Paris region. Therefore, we can assume that interventions targeting these characteristics could reduce the health impacts of extreme heat. Such interventions should be coupled with other initiatives such as protecting the most vulnerable and promoting appropriate behaviors.","[Pascal, Mathilde; Goria, Sarah; Wagner, Verene; Sabastia, Marine; Guillet, Agnes] Sante Publ France, 12 Rue Val Osne, F-94415 St Maurice, France; [Cordeau, Erwan; Mauclair, Cecile; Host, Sabine] Inst Paris Reg, Paris, France",Institute of Public Health Surveillance,"Pascal, M (corresponding author), Sante Publ France, 12 Rue Val Osne, F-94415 St Maurice, France.",Mathilde.Pascal@santepubliquefrance.fr,,,,,,,78,11,11,9,44,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0160-4120,1873-6750,,ENVIRON INT,Environ.

Forests of the Rogue River Basin in Oregon, USA, are both productive and fire-prone due to ample winter precipitation and summer drought; yet management in this region is strongly influenced by forest practices that depend on fire exclusion. Regionally, climate change is increasing fire frequency, elevating the importance of understanding historically frequent-fire regimes. We use cross-dated fire-scars to characterize historical fire return intervals, seasonality, and relationships with climate beginning in 1650 CE for 13 sites representative of southwestern Oregon dry forests. Using systematic literature review, we link our local fire histories to a regional dataset and evaluate our data relative to more intensively studied conifer/hardwood forest types in California. Fire-scars show that fires in the Rogue Basin were frequent and regular until disrupted in the 1850s through 1910s, corresponding with forced displacement of Native Americans and Euro-American settlement. Median historical fire return intervals were 8 years at the stand-scale (< 25 ha), with site medians ranging from five to 14 years and no significant differences between sampled vegetation types. Burn seasonality was broadly distributed with 47% of recorded fires in the latewood (midsummer), 30% at the ring boundary (late summer and fall), and 23% in the earlywood (spring and early summer). The number of sites recording fire each year was associated with Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and El Nino Southern Oscillation Index (ENSO). Fires were detected in the study area every other year, and synchrony among sites was associated with stronger annual drought. The ENSO synchronization of fire suggests an herbaceous fuel signal, with warm winters/wet summers two years prior to widespread fire-years, a pattern observed globally in fuel-limited systems. Stand-scale fire histories in the Klamath, southern Cascades, and northern Sierra Nevada ecoregions resemble Rogue River Basin stand-scale fire histories. Across dry mixed conifer, yellow pine, and mixed evergreen forests, fire return intervals converged on 8 years. Moist mixed conifer and red fir forests exhibited 13-year fire return intervals. Across ecoregions, fire periodicity was weakly correlated with climatic water deficit, but well-modeled by elevation, precipitation, and temperature. These data highlight the need for decadal fire and burning outside of the contemporary fire season for forest restoration and climate adaptation in the dry forests of the Rogue Basin.","[Metlen, Kerry L.; Olson, Derek R.; Borgias, Darren] Nature Conservancy, Southwest Oregon Field Off, 647 Washington St, Ashland, OR 97520 USA; [Skinner, Carl N.] Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, 3644 Avtech Pkwy, Redding, CA 96002 USA; [Nichols, Clint] Jackson Soil & Water Conservat Dist, 89 Alder St, Central Point, OR 97502 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Metlen, KL (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, Southwest Oregon Field Off, 647 Washington St, Ashland, OR 97520 USA.",kmetlen@tnc.org,,,Northwest Conservation Fund; Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board; USDI Bureau of Land Management,Northwest Conservation Fund; Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board; USDI Bureau of Land Management,"We thank Celeste Abbott for meticulously cross-dating the fire-scar samples and our many volunteers and enthusiastic field crews, particularly Celeste Abbott, Bob Carlson, Anna Vandervlugt, and Clement Stockard.

The region contains 25% of the Nation's beef cattle and approximately one-third of the confined beef cattle, as well as the largest remaining native prairie in the US-the Northern Mixedgrass Prairie. With rising atmospheric CO2, the NGP is projected to experience warmer and longer growing seasons, greater climatic variability, and more extreme events (e.g., increased occurrence of large precipitation events). These climatic changes may affect livestock production both directly via physiological impacts on animals and indirectly via modifications to forage, invasion of undesirable plants, and increased exposure to parasites. This raises concerns about the vulnerability of grazing livestock operations and confined livestock operations to projected changes in mid- (2050) and late- (2085) twenty-first century climate. Our objectives are to (1) describe the NGP's exposure to temperature and precipitation trends, inter-annual variability, and extreme events; (2) evaluate the sensitivity of beef cattle production to direct and indirect effects imposed by these projected climatic changes; and (3) provide a typology of adaptation strategies to minimize adverse consequences of projected changes and maximize beneficial consequences. Agricultural managers have developed considerable adaptive capacity to contend with environmental and economic variability. However, projected climatic changes, especially the increased frequency and magnitude of weather extremes, will require even greater adaptive capacity to maintain viable production systems. Consequently, regional vulnerability to projected climatic changes will be determined not only by ecological responses but also by the adaptive capacity of individual managers. Adaptive capacity in the NGP will differ from other regions, in part because projections suggest some opportunities for increased livestock production. Adaptations in both grazing and confined beef cattle systems will require enhanced decision-making skills capable of integrating biophysical, social, and economic considerations. Social learning networks that support integration of experimental and experiential knowledge-such as lessons learned from early adopters and involvement with science-based organizations-can help enhance decision-making and climate adaptation planning. Many adaptations have already been implemented by a subset of producers in this region, providing opportunities for assessment, further development, and greater adoption. Context-specific decision-making can also be enhanced through science-management partnerships, which aim to build adaptive capacity that recognizes multiple production and conservation/environmental goals.","[Derner, Justin] USDA ARS, 8408 Hildreth Rd, Cheyenne, WY 82009 USA; [Briske, David] Texas A&M Univ, Centeq Bldg,Rm 130C,MS2120 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Reeves, Matt] USDA FS, 800 E Beckwith, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Brown-Brandl, Tami] USDA ARS, State Spur 18D, Clay Ctr, NE 68933 USA; [Meehan, Miranda] North Dakota State Univ, 1300 Albrecht Blvd,Hultz Hall, Fargo, ND USA; [Blumenthal, Dana; Augustine, David; Wilmer, Hailey; Peck, Dannele] USDA ARS, 1701 Ctr Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Travis, William] Univ Colorado Boulder, Western Water Assoc, 216 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Scasta, Derek] Univ Wyoming, Agr Bldg 2004,1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Hendrickson, John] USDA ARS, POB 459, Mandan, ND 58554 USA; [Volesky, Jerry] Univ Nebraska Lincoln, WCREC, 402 W State Farm Rd, North Platte, NE 69101 USA; [Edwards, Laura] South Dakota State Univ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); North Dakota State University Fargo; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Wyoming; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; South Dakota State University,"Derner, J (corresponding author), USDA ARS, 8408 Hildreth Rd, Cheyenne, WY 82009 USA.",Justin.Derner@ars.usda.gov; dbriske@tamu.edu; mreeves@fs.fed.us; tami.brownbrandl@ars.usda.gov; Miranda.meehan@ndsu.edu; dana.blumenthal@ars.usda.gov; William.travis@colorado.edu; david.augustine@ars.usda.gov; hailey.wilmer@ars.usda.gov; jscasta@uwyo.edu; john.hendrickson@ars.usda.gov; jerry.volesky@unl.edu; laura.edwards@sdstate.edu; dannele.peck@ars.usda.gov,"Brown-Brandl, Tami/HJB-3273-2022; Brown-Brandl, Tami M/B-8187-2015; Brown-Brandl, Tami/AAI-2132-2019; Hendrickson, John/M-1999-2019","Brown-Brandl, Tami M/0000-0002-0874-8035; Brown-Brandl, Tami/0000-0002-0874-8035; Hendrickson, John/0000-0001-8600-9214; Augustine, David/0000-0003-3144-0466; Travis, William/0000-0002-9197-1317; Peck, Dannele/0000-0001-5464-8097; Derner, Justin/0000-0001-8076-0736; Meehan, Miranda/0000-0002-7290-467X",,,,,76,42,46,1,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In the present study, we integrated observational climate data, one regional climate model, land use maps, and agricultural statistics to analyze the relationship between heat resources and multi-cropping potential in Shanghai. The results of agro-climatic assessment showed that climate change over the past 50 years has significantly enhanced regional agroclimatic resources, rendering a shift from double cropping to triple cropping possible. However, a downward trend is evident in the actual multi-cropping index, caused principally by the increasing costs of farming and limitations in the supply of labor. We argue that improving the utilization rate of the enhanced agro-climatic resources is possible by introducing new combinations of cultivars, adopting more laborsaving technologies, and providing incentives to farmers.","[Liang, Zhuoran] Hangzhou Meteorol Serv, Hangzhou 310051, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Liang, Zhuoran; Tian, Zhan] Shanghai Meteorol Serv, Shanghai Climate Ctr, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Gu, Tingting] Zhejiang Meteorol Serv Ctr, Hangzhou 310017, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Honglin] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Liang, Yuqi] Nanjing Normal Univ, Dept Phys & Technol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Nanjing Normal University,"Tian, Z (corresponding author), Shanghai Meteorol Serv, Shanghai Climate Ctr, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",zhantzy@gmail.com,,,"China Climate Change Special Foundation of the China Meteorological Administration [CCSF201330, CCSF2011-10]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371110, 40921140410]; IIASA YSSP Program; China CDM Fund [1212117]; Shanghai Meteorological Service Fund [MS201418]",China Climate Change Special Foundation of the China Meteorological Administration; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); IIASA YSSP Program; China CDM Fund; Shanghai Meteorological Service Fund,"This research was jointly supported by China Climate Change Special Foundation of the China Meteorological Administration (No. CCSF201330 and CCSF2011-10), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41371110 and 40921140410), IIASA YSSP Program, China CDM Fund (No. 1212117) and Shanghai Meteorological Service Fund (MS201418).",,33,2,2,2,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2095-0195,2095-0209,,FRONT EARTH SCI-PRC,Front.

Government authorities, expected to lead adaptation, are in the difficult situation of changing a governance system from within. This demands a capacity for critical reflection among civil servants involved. Adopting a Social Practice Theory approach, we argue this capacity must be understood as emerging in practice, not simply held by individuals. Empirically, we focus on a central network of government authorities in Sweden's adaptation governance, and identify assumptions and routines guiding their meaning making process. We focus on how situations of contestation are dealt with to explore the practice's capacity to facilitate critical reflection. We show how a focus on efficient information transmission and an assumption of incremental adaptation as sufficient leads their practice to play down the consequences of the climate crisis. A practice approach suggests interventions to the group level in order to create joint critical reflection, necessary for enabling transformational adaptation.","[Kanarp, G. C.

Specifically, in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, increased exposure to droughts and floods are expected. Local traditional knowledge in agriculture (LTKA) is proposed in this article as valid knowledge to ensure food availability under climate change, given its long experience in dealing with climate variability. Focused on water strategies, we have conducted a literature review on LTKA practices in the Indo-Gangetic Plains complemented with a questionnaire of experts to identify LTKA-based practices that might be useful in climate-change driven water scenarios. The practices identified are categorized as a) water harvesting and recycling; b) local irrigation systems; and c) and maintenance, conservation, and water allocation. We found that a) despite acknowledging the potential of LTKA to face floods and droughts, very few studies explicitly make the link between LTKA and climate change; and b) LTKA in water management heavily relays on social norms and local institutions and, thus, any attempts to replicate it need to consider this. We conclude that agroecology can help to promote these practices since it emphasizes the collective management from below as the main approach for the design of sustainable agroecosystems and, thus, include local institutions as an essential strategy for adaptation.","[Rivera-Ferre, M.

Two areas were selected for their dissimilar climatic challenges: the //Khara Hais Municipality,(1) a semi-desert area in the Northern Cape Province plagued by droughts and severe weather events, and the George Municipality, an area in the Western Cape Province plagued by droughts, the rising sea level and flash floods. It was found that despite South African laws and regulations requiring local government to take action to reduce the risk of disasters, planning for climate change is still no more than sophisticated rhetoric in the two municipalities. This lack of urgency can be ascribed to local municipalities having other more pressing developmental priorities. It would, however, be short-sighted of municipalities not to plan for climate change, as major setbacks in hard-won economic and social development follow a disaster.","[Faling, Willemien] Council Sci & Ind Res CSIR Built Environm, Pretoria, South Africa; [Faling, Willemien] Univ Pretoria, Dept Town & Reg Planning, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Tempelhoff, Johann W.

However, with the improvement of urbanization level and the deepening of the energy revolution, China's natural gas heating users have increased rapidly. Therefore, assessing the impact of residential natural gas use on climate change in China is extre-mely important, whether in terms of migration or adaptation policies. Using bimonthly bill-level data from Hefei residents' gas consumption, this study investigates the impact of temperature change on gas consumption. Specifically, the different effects over the various ratios of wall-mounted boiler heating users are analyzed. On average, when the annual temperature increases by 1 degrees C, the gas consumption is reduced by 2.08 %, for wall-mounted boiler heating users, the impact is even -3.34 %. Considering the increasing of the penetration rate of the gas wall-mounted, the above reduction induced by climate change could be offset-if the penetration rate is higher than 57 %, it could be fully offset. As the critical role of natural gas in China's energy transition, our findings have significant implications for alleviating natural gas supply and energy substitution in China.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Compared to the western USA, agricultural producers in the upper Corn Belt have had less exposure to extreme drought and less irrigated agriculture. If climate change threatens to increase drought frequency or severity in the Corn Belt, a transition from rain-fed agriculture to irrigated agriculture in this region would require systemic changes and significant financial investments. Knowing what drives drought risk perceptions and irrigation behaviors will inform anticipatory planning and water supply management. We surveyed central Minnesota farmers about their drought risk perceptions in two groundwater management areas where climate models project heightened variability in water supply during the growing season. We examined the influence of farmers' drought exposure beliefs, farm sensitivity appraisals, and drought risk perceptions on future irrigation behaviors. We presented farmers with experiential scenarios of future drought derived from downscaled climate projections and asked about their likelihood of adopting or expanding irrigation systems under those conditions. Findings indicate that many farmers surveyed are concerned about drought, in part because they believe that future droughts are likely in the area and their farms are sensitive to drought. More than one quarter of farmers reported being likely to adopt or expand irrigation under several drought-experience scenarios.","[Davenport, Mae A.; Pradhananga, Amit] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, Ctr Changing Landscapes, St Paul, MN 55455 USA; [Kreiter, Amelia] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN USA; [Brauman, Kate A.] Univ Alabama, Global Water Secur Ctr, Tuscaloosa, AL USA; [Keeler, Bonnie; Noe, Ryan] Univ Minnesota, Hubert H Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Arbuckle, J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Sociol & Criminal Justice, Ames, IA USA; [Sharma, Vasudha] Univ Minnesota, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Iowa State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Davenport, MA (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, Ctr Changing Landscapes, St Paul, MN 55455 USA.",mdaven@umn.edu,,"Brauman, Kate/0000-0002-8099-285X","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (NIFA AFRI) [1012161]","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (NIFA AFRI)","Project funding was provided by a grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (NIFA AFRI), project 1012161.",,52,2,2,4,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

As such, historic periods of climatic and economic volatility can be used as a way of developing frameworks for analyzing today's predicament. Western Europe's middle ages (circa 11-14th century) may be one such case. By the 12th century, medieval Europe had shifted from the subsistence agrarian economy that emerged following the collapse of the Roman Empire to one where spatially dispersed trade in agricultural commodities helped support a complex society that devoted considerable resources to cultural works. This shift was facilitated by new institutional arrangements centred on monastic orders that provided access to both new agricultural and food processing technologies as well as trade routes. These institutional arrangements contributed to population growth and land clearing. All of these factors increased the wealth of society but also concentrated this wealth in a small number of communities that were dependent on an ever-increasing and exploited hinterland for resources. Ultimately, this created a tightly coupled continent-wide subsistence system that was vulnerable to the weather, economic and disease shocks of the 14th century when Europe's population declined by perhaps 50%. In exploring this history, the goal of this paper is to draw on a diverse theoretical body of literature (that includes resiliency theory, landscape ecology, political science and ecological economics) to develop a series of hypotheses about how large-scale complex civilizations can become vulnerable to climate change.

Whether and how societies adapt, adjust, change, or transform because of climate change and related risks, is a currently debated topic. This question demands revisiting and comprehensively addressing existing theoretical foundations of transformations in risk management strategies and in risk governance to find effective ways to deal with climate change effects and their social consequences. Hence, the paper discusses current developments in transformation research and exemplifies this discussion with four interdisciplinary cases, which the co-authors reported in previous publications. Findings from Austria include a governance change within flood risk management related to zonation. Relocation in Indonesia and Kiribati showcases its cultural, behavioural as well as economic implications. Water scarcity in South Africa underlines the importance of behavioural change to enable the structural storage of rainwater. This paper analyses aspects of adjustment or transformation in these four examples. This may inform risk managers, decision-makers, practitioners, and planners dealing with natural hazards related to climate change how to conceptualise their (re-)actions.","[Fekete, Alexander] TH Koln Univ Appl Sci, Inst Rescue Engn & Civil Protect, Betzdorferstr 2, D-50679 Cologne, Germany; [Fuchs, Sven] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Garschagen, Matthias; Wannewitz, Mia] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Hutter, Gerard] Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev IOER, Weberpl 1, D-01217 Dresden, Germany; [Klepp, Silja] Univ Kiel, Geograph Inst, Christian Albrechts Pl 4, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Luder, Catharina] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich LMU, Inst European Ethnol & Cultural Anal, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Neise, Thomas] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Geog, Neuer Graben 29, D-49074 Osnabruck, Germany; [Sett, Dominic] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [von Elverfeldt, Kirsten] Klagenfurt Univ, Dept Geog & Reg Studies, Univ Str 6567, A-9020 Klagenfurt Am Worthersee, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Munich; Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung; University of Kiel; University of Munich; University Osnabruck","Fekete, A (corresponding author), TH Koln Univ Appl Sci, Inst Rescue Engn & Civil Protect, Betzdorferstr 2, D-50679 Cologne, Germany.",sven.fuchs@boku.ac.at; M.Garschagen@geographie.uni-muenchen.de; g.hutter@ioer.de; klepp@geographie.uni-kiel.de; cat.lueder@lmu.de; thomas.neise@uni-osnabrueck.de; Sett@ehs.unu.edu; kirsten.vonelverfeldt@aau.at; mia.wannewitz@lmu.de,"Fuchs, Sven/F-4208-2012; Neise, Thomas/ABC-4065-2022","Fuchs, Sven/0000-0002-0644-2876; Neise, Thomas/0000-0001-6080-6725; Luder, Catharina/0000-0001-7727-6169",,,,,108,1,1,14,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,SEP,2022,120,,,,,,,,106230,10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106230,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106230,,JUN 2022,12,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4Y6AY,,Green Published,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000861609600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The selection of effective adaptation interventions to manage these risks requires a sufficiently accurate assessment of the coastal hazard at a given location. Yet challenges remain in terms of understanding local coastal risks given the coarseness of global wave models and the paucity of locally scaled data in most developing countries, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) like Vanuatu. This paper aims to examine the differences in hazard assessment and adaptation option selections arising from analyses using globally versus locally scaled data on coastal processes. As a case study, we focused on an eroding cliff face in Port Resolution on Tanna Island, Vanuatu, which is of concern to the local community and government authorities. The coastal process modeling revealed that the global wave data generated unrealistically high predictions of wave height within Port Resolution Bay. Expensive engineering adaptations designed to provide coastal protection were therefore likely to fail in preventing ongoing cliff erosion. In this case, the best adaptation solution involves changing land use to revegetate and help stabilize the cliff top. Our case study highlights the importance of accurate hazard assessment, especially in data-poor regions where the extrapolation of global datasets and models in the absence of local data can result in poor adaptation decision-making. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary approach applied here can be applied in other data-poor regions to strengthen analyses exploring the benefits of local adaptation interventions.","[Faivre, Gaelle; Tomlinson, Rodger; Ware, Daniel] Griffith Univ, Coastal & Marine Res Ctr, Gold Coast, Australia; [Faivre, Gaelle; Ware, Daniel; Hadwen, Wade; Buckwell, Andrew; Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast, Australia; [Shaeri, Saeed] Charles Sturt Univ, CSU Engn, Bathurst, NSW, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Charles Sturt University,"Faivre, G (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Coastal & Marine Res Ctr, Gold Coast, Australia.;Faivre, G (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast, Australia.",g.faivre@griffith.edu.au,"Shaeri, Saeed/GQH-4777-2022; Shaeri, Saeed/L-6688-2013","Shaeri, Saeed/0000-0001-8711-2467; Buckwell, Andrew/0000-0002-6441-9674; Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064",CAUL,CAUL,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

Here, we describe a framework for moving toward operationalizing climate change refugia conservation at an ecoregion scale with an analysis for the Sierra Nevada ecoregion (CA, USA). Structured within the Climate Change Refugia Conservation Cycle, we identify a preliminary suite of conservation priorities for the ecoregion, and demonstrate how existing mapping, data, and applications could be used for identifying, prioritizing, managing, and monitoring refugia. We focus on six stakeholder-identified conservation priorities, including two process-based refugial priorities (snow and fire), and four ecosystem-based refugial priorities (meadows, giant sequoia, old growth forests, and alpine communities). This pilot overview of concepts and resources provides a foundation for both near-term implementation and further discussion in moving from science to conservation practice. Such an approach may provide new practical insights for ecosystem management at ecoregion scales in the face of climate change.","[Balantic, Cathleen] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Northeast Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Adams, Andrea] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Gross, Shana] US Forest Serv, USDA, Ecol Program, Reg 5, South Lake Tahoe, CA USA; [Mazur, Rachel] Yosemite Natl Pk, Div Resources Management & Sci, El Portal, CA USA; [Sawyer, Sarah; Tucker, Jody] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Region, Vallejo, CA USA; [Vernon, Marian] Point Blue Conservat Sci, Petaluma, CA USA; [Mengelt, Claudia] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Sci Applicat, Sacramento, CA USA; [Morales, Jennifer] Calif Dept Water Resources, Climate Change Program, Fresno, CA USA; [Thorne, James H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Brown, Timothy M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Athearn, Nicole] Natl Pk Serv, Div Resources Management & Sci, El Portal, CA USA; [Morelli, Toni Lyn] Univ Massachusetts, US Geol Survey, Northeast Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Balantic, Cathleen] Natl Pk Serv, Nat Sounds & Night Skies Div, Ft Collins, CO USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; United States Department of the Interior; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of the Interior,"Balantic, C (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Northeast Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",cathleen_balantic@nps.gov,,"Gross, Shana/0000-0002-8765-3703; Adams, Andrea/0000-0001-5609-6150; Balantic, Cathleen/0000-0003-2043-0975",U.S. Geological Survey National Climate Adaptation Science Center; U.S. Geological Survey Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center; U.S. Geological Survey Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center,U.S. Geological Survey National Climate Adaptation Science Center; U.S. Geological Survey Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center; U.S. Geological Survey Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center,U.S. Geological Survey National Climate Adaptation Science Center; U.S. Geological Survey Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center; U.S. Geological Survey Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center,,196,4,4,8,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2578-4854,,CONSERV SCI PRACT,Conserv.

This article builds on a qualitative case study of homeowners in the flood-prone area of Lolland in Denmark and uses the theories of Tim Ingold and Bruno Latour to rethink the way we understand homeowners' perception of climate change and local flood risk. Ingold argues that those perceptions are shaped by people's experiences with and connections to their local landscape. People experience the local variability of the weather, and not global climate change as presented in statistical data and models. This influences the way they understand the future risks of climate change. Concurrently, with the theory of Latour, we can understand how those experiences with the local landscape are mediated by the existing water-managing technologies such as pumps and dikes. These technologies prevent the residents in Lolland from experiencing many of the changes that are already occurring and, at the same time, give them a feeling of being able to control the water to the extent that it is prevented from flooding their homes, both now and in the future. The combination of these two theoretical approaches gives new insights as to why people living in flood-prone areas are not very concerned about climate change.","[Baron, Nina; Petersen, Lars Kjerulf] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Baron, N (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",nba@dmu.dk; lkpe@dmu.dk,"Petersen, Lars Kjerulf/AAI-3371-2021",,Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme 'Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change' through the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR) [36780],Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme 'Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change' through the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR),"The research was funded by Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme 'Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change' through the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR), project no 36780.",,33,10,10,0,28,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

We study the effectiveness of Ultra-Low Volume (ULV) insecticide spraying in public spaces for preventing secondary dengue virus (DENV) cases in Porto Alegre, a non-endemic metropolitan area in Brazil. We developed a stochastic transmission model based on detailed entomological, epidemiological and population data, accounting for the geographical distribution of mosquitoes and humans in the study area and spatial transmission dynamics. The model was calibrated against the distribution of DENV cluster sizes previously estimated from the same geographical setting. We estimated a ULV-induced mortality of 40% for mosquitoes and found that the implemented control protocol avoided about 24% of symptomatic cases occurred in the area throughout the 2015-2016 epidemic season. Increasing the radius of treatment or the mortality of mosquitoes by treating gardens and/or indoor premises would greatly improve the result of control, but trade-offs with respect to increased efforts need to be carefully analyzed. We found a moderate effectiveness for ULV-spraying in public areas, mainly due to the limited ability of this strategy in effectively controlling the vector population. These results can be used to support the design of control strategies in low-incidence, non-endemic settings. Author summary Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection that causes millions of symptomatic infections and thousands of deaths per year. This pathogen is expanding its geographic range to areas that were previously free from autochthonous transmission thanks to the intensification of international travels, urbanization and to climatic adaptation of mosquitoes and viruses. Usually interventions against dengue transmission consist in insecticide spraying aimed at killing adult mosquitoes, but the impact of this practice has been rarely evaluated in real-life settings. In this work, we estimate the proportion of dengue cases avoided by Ultra-Low-Volume insecticide spraying in public areas in Porto Alegre (Brazil). This city is characterized by a subtropical climate, negligible pre-existing immunity and low dengue incidence. The low incidence makes this region unsuitable for deployment of the currently licensed vaccine, which is only recommended by the WHO for high-transmission areas. We found that insecticide spraying avoided approximately one fourth of all symptomatic cases. The performance of the intervention was negatively affected by the low treatment-induced mosquito mortality, as we estimated that only 40% of Ae. aegypti are killed by the insecticide. Control outcomes could be improved by increasing the targeted area and including private premises, but trade-offs against increased efforts need to be carefully analyzed.","[Marini, Giovanni; Rosa, Roberto] Fdn Edmund Mach, Ctr Ric & Innovaz, Dipartimento Biodiversita & Ecol Mol, San Michele All Adige, Trento, Italy; [Guzzetta, Giorgio; Rosa, Roberto; Merler, Stefano] Epilab JRU, FEM FBK Joint Res Unit, Trento, Province Of Tre, Italy; [Guzzetta, Giorgio; Merler, Stefano] Bruno Kessler Fdn, Ctr Informat Technol, Trento, Italy; [Marques Toledo, Cecilia A.; Teixeira, Mauro] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Bioquim & Imunol, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Rosa, Roberto] Univ Trento, Ctr Agr Food Environm, San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy",Fondazione Edmund Mach; Fondazione Bruno Kessler; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; University of Trento,"Rosa, R (corresponding author), Fdn Edmund Mach, Ctr Ric & Innovaz, Dipartimento Biodiversita & Ecol Mol, San Michele All Adige, Trento, Italy.;Rosa, R (corresponding author), Epilab JRU, FEM FBK Joint Res Unit, Trento, Province Of Tre, Italy.;Rosa, R (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Ctr Agr Food Environm, San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy.",roberto.rosa@fmach.it,"Rosà, Roberto/AAB-4479-2021; Rosa, Roberto/B-8562-2011; Teixeira, Mauro M/A-4587-2008; Marini, Giovanni/C-3808-2018; Guzzetta, Giorgio/HKW-7921-2023","Rosà, Roberto/0000-0002-8655-2230; Rosa, Roberto/0000-0002-8655-2230; Teixeira, Mauro M/0000-0002-6944-3008; Marini, Giovanni/0000-0001-9721-7211; Guzzetta, Giorgio/0000-0002-9296-9470",Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia (INCT) em Dengue [CNPq/FAPEMIG 573876/2008-08]; FAPEMIG; CNPq,Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia (INCT) em Dengue; FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"U This work was supported by the Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia (INCT) em Dengue (CNPq/FAPEMIG 573876/2008-08; http://labs.icb.ufmg.br/inctemdengue), FAPEMIG and CNPq.

Institutional and private sector actors often focus on issues relating to the technological innovation journey, such as 'pathways' to implementation or 'barriers' to market uptake, rather than whether adaptive technologies are the most appropriate resilience solution. These discourses frame urban resilience from the perspective of an innovation journey where technologies are perceived to succeed if there is high uptake. However, given the multi-perspective and multi-scale nature of urban resilience, the idea of 'success' inevitably has complex spatial, temporal and scalar dimensions. The paper uses the case of property level flood resilience (PFR) technologies in the United Kingdom to introduce the notion of 'contingent resilience' as a means to understand the trade-offs that are part of assessing and evaluating climate resilient technologies. We reveal that there are fundamental contradictions in what is deemed as a 'success' depending on who is framing the problem, when the judgement is made, or where the scale of analysis lies. Above all, the paper highlights the importance of illuminating the struggles that do not just define success, but that spatially and temporally redistribute climate resilience in a hidden manner.","[Connelly, Angela] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester Sch Architecture, Chatam 804,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [O'Hare, Paul] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, E415 John Dalton Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [White, Iain] Univ Waikato, Arts & Social Sci, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",Manchester Metropolitan University; Manchester Metropolitan University; University of Waikato,"Connelly, A (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester Sch Architecture, Chatam 804,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England.",angela.connelly@mmu.ac.uk; paul.a.ohare@mmu.ac.uk; iainw@waikato.ac.nz,,,European Union's seventh framework programme [244102]; University of Manchester Strategic Research Investment Fund; British Standards Institute,European Union's seventh framework programme(European Commission); University of Manchester Strategic Research Investment Fund; British Standards Institute,"This work was supported by the European Union's seventh framework programme [grant agreement no. 244102]; The University of Manchester Strategic Research Investment Fund, and the British Standards Institute.",,82,1,1,4,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,NOV,2020,106,,,,,,,,102842,10.1016/j.cities.2020.102842,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2020.102842,,,9,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,NY8LZ,,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000576635800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper contributes to the current understanding on the multiple stressors influencing individual's decisions to migrate from their rural origin, while examining the interplay between factors such as tipping points of migration (identified as drivers of migration), socio-demographic variables, and the contexts of slow-onset natural hazards. The analysis is based on empirical data relating to disadvantaged internal migrants or their household members living in drought-prone and riverine areas. A binary logistic regression model is used to analyse how various factors influence the temporality of migration. Key findings indicate that in the context of the natural hazards studied, financial stress at the household level and lack of economic resources are strongly associated with people's decisions to migrate for the-long or short-term. Based on such findings, the paper argues for diversified policy interventions for different groups of internal migrants in order to address difficulties associated with their mobility to and settlement at new locations.","[Kabir, Mohammad Ehsanul] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Room 0-36A,N13,170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Serrao-Neumann, Silvia] Univ Waikato, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sch Social Sci, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Kabir, Mohammad Ehsanul; Serrao-Neumann, Silvia] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, 170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Davey, Peter] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, 170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Hossain, Moazzem] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Int Business & Asian Studies, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Alam, Md.

It includes institutions of development, research, media, and science, as well as various state actors both nationally and internationally. The adaptation regime operates through three interrelated processes: imagination, experimentation, and dispossession. Each of these processes is produced and manifested both materially and epistemically. The adaptation regime is built on a vision of development in which urbanization and export-led growth are both desirable and inevitable. For the rural poor, this entails dispossession from agrarian livelihoods and outmigration. As this shift contributes to the expansion of production of export commodities such as garments and frozen shrimp, the threat of climate change and its associated migrations is reframed as an opportunity for development and growth.","[Paprocki, Kasia] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Paprocki, K (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.paprocki@lse.ac.uk,"Paprocki, Kasia/AFN-4975-2022","Paprocki, Kasia/0000-0001-5202-351X","Social Science Research Council International Dissertation Research Program; Fulbright-Hays Program; National Science Foundation [DGE-1144153, 1459009]",Social Science Research Council International Dissertation Research Program; Fulbright-Hays Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Funding for this research was provided by the Social Science Research Council International Dissertation Research Program, the Fulbright-Hays Program, and the National Science Foundation (under Grant Nos.

Climate change projections indicate that such disastrous hurricane seasons are becoming more normal. Working land management sectors need to prepare for this future. However, few studies evaluate hurricane resilience strategies, or challenges faced by land managers surrounding hurricane events. Boundary organizations are critical to hurricane preparedness and recovery, advising land managers before hurricanes, and often supporting recovery efforts. Here, we rely on public advisors' experiences to understand how land managers pursue hurricane resilience. Using focus groups and an online survey of three agencies in the Southeast U.S. and U.S. Caribbean (n = 607), we identify challenges faced by land managers before and after hurricanes, and the strategies they implement to minimize damage. We learn that land managers are faced with many diverse and unique challenges related to hurricanes, but that long-term planning for hurricane events is uncommon compared to shorter-term preparedness and recovery activities. Efforts towards hurricane resilience should incorporate local needs, align with other land management goals, and increase overall resilience to climate change and related stressors. The results of this research can guide state/territorial and national-level prioritizations regarding hurricane resilience, as well as identify research needs on hurricane resilience strategies.","[Wiener, Sarah S.] Forest Serv, USDA, Southeast Climate Hub, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Alvarez-Berrios, Nora L.] Forest Serv, USDA, Int Inst Trop Forestry, Rio Piedras, PR 00926 USA; [Lindsey, Angela B.] Univ Florida, IFAS Ctr Publ Issues Educ Agr & Nat Resources, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Wiener, SS (corresponding author), Forest Serv, USDA, Southeast Climate Hub, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",sarah.s.wiener@usda.gov; nora.l.alvarez-berrios@usda.gov; ablindsey@ufl.edu,,,,,,,56,6,7,3,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 2,2020,12,4,,,,,,,1364,10.3390/su12041364,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12041364,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KY3GT,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000522460200082,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study analyzes results from a household survey across eight coastal villages to investigate how local rural communities utilize these resources. The predominant direct use by households is the extraction of combustible fuel. Econometric results suggest that determinants of the household decision to collect fuelwood include respondent occupation and village. Farmers are less likely to extract mangrove fuels due to the availability of substitutes such as agricultural residues, and are also less likely obtain non-mangrove fuelwood via market purchase. Collection quantities are positively correlated with degree of impoverishment, with poorer households significantly less likely to access non-mangrove fuelwood markets. These results are robust to selection bias, spatial lag dependence, and spatial error dependence, and have important policy implications for beneficiary selection for future mangrove plantations.","[Chow, Jeffrey] Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Chow, Jeffrey] 8 Princess Margaret Rd 6-F, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Yale University,"Chow, J (corresponding author), Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.;Chow, J (corresponding author), 8 Princess Margaret Rd 6-F, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jchow.conservation@gmail.com,,"Chow, Jeffrey/0000-0002-3351-7730",United States Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results Graduate Fellowship [FP917398]; Yale Tropical Resources Institute; Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies,United States Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results Graduate Fellowship; Yale Tropical Resources Institute; Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies,"This research was funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results Graduate Fellowship (Grant Number: FP917398), the Yale Tropical Resources Institute, and the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies.

To cope with these changes, water managers are requesting practical tools that can facilitate adaptive planning. This study was carried out to investigate how recent developments in downscaling techniques can be used to assess the effects of adaptive measures. A combined spatial-temporal downscaling methodology using the Statistical DownScaling Model-Decision Centric (SDSM-DC) and the Generalized Extreme Value distribution was applied to project future precipitation in the city of Bergen, Norway. A raingarden was considered a potential adaptive measure, and its performance was assessed using the RECARGA simulation tool. The benefits and limitations of using the proposed method have been demonstrated and compared to current design practices in Norway. Large differences in the raingarden's performance with respect to percentage overflow and lag-time reduction were found for varying projections. This highlights the need for working with a range of possible futures. Further, it was found that K-sat was the determining factor for peak-flow reduction and that different values of K-sat had different benefits. Engineering flexible solutions by combining measures holding different characteristics will induce robust adaptation.","[Kristvik, Erle; Kleiven, Guro Heimstad; Lohne, Jardar; Muthanna, Tone Merete] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, SP Andersens Veg 5, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Kristvik, E (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, SP Andersens Veg 5, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",erle.kristvik@ntnu.no,"Lohne, Jardar/HGA-4028-2022; Muthanna, Tone Merete/S-2449-2019","Muthanna, Tone Merete/0000-0002-4438-2202; Lohne, Jardar/0000-0002-2135-3468",,,,,26,12,12,2,29,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0273-1223,1996-9732,,WATER SCI TECHNOL,Water Sci.

In this paper we investigate the potential co-benefits of adaptation in terms of the avoided emissions from land use change. A model of global agricultural trade and land use, called SIMPLE, is utilized to link adaptation investments, yield growth rates, land conversion rates, and land use emissions. A scenario of global adaptation to offset negative yield impacts of temperature and precipitation changes to 2050, which requires a cumulative 225 billion USD of additional investment, results in 61 Mha less conversion of cropland and 15 Gt carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) fewer emissions by 2050. Thus our estimates imply an annual mitigation co-benefit of 0 : 35 GtCO(2)e yr(-1) while spending $15 per tonne CO(2)e of avoided emissions. Uncertainty analysis is used to estimate a 5-95% confidence interval around these numbers of 0.25-0.43 Gt and $11-$22 per tonne CO(2)e. A scenario of adaptation focused only on Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, while less costly in aggregate, results in much smaller mitigation potentials and higher per tonne costs. These results indicate that although investing in the least developed areas may be most desirable for the main objectives of adaptation, it has little net effect on mitigation because production gains are offset by greater rates of land clearing in the benefited regions, which are relatively low yielding and land abundant. Adaptation investments in high yielding, land scarce regions such as Asia and North America are more effective for mitigation. To identify data needs, we conduct a sensitivity analysis using the Morris method (Morris 1991 Technometrics 33 161-74). The three most critical parameters for improving estimates of mitigation potential are (in descending order) the emissions factors for converting land to agriculture, the price elasticity of land supply with respect to land rents, and the elasticity of substitution between land and non-land inputs. For assessing the mitigation costs, the elasticity of productivity with respect to investments in research and development is also very important. Overall, this study finds that broad-based efforts to adapt agriculture to climate change have mitigation co-benefits that, even when forced to shoulder the entire expense of adaptation, are inexpensive relative to many activities whose main purpose is mitigation. These results therefore challenge the current approach of most climate financing portfolios, which support adaptation from funds completely separate from-and often much smaller than-mitigation ones.","[Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Baldos, Uris Lantz C.; Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Baldos, Uris Lantz C.; Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Lobell, DB (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dlobell@stanford.edu,,"Lobell, David/0000-0002-5969-3476","DOE, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Integrated Assessment Research Program [DE-SC005171]","DOE, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Integrated Assessment Research Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The authors thank Gerald Nelson for valuable input and two reviewers for helpful comments.

Yet, there are knowledge gaps on how best to achieve transformation. In this study, we present an approach for assessing governance performance in SES and identifying leverage points to ultimately enhance climate resilience. The approach combines three different methods including a capital approach framework, fuzzy cognitive mapping, and a leverage points analysis. Using a coastal case-study in Algoa Bay, South Africa, the performance of governance processes contributing to different forms of capital is assessed. Subsequently, leverage points - where a small shift may lead to transformative changes in the system as a whole - are identified based on measures of centrality and performance. Results suggest that a range of leverage points can improve governance performance and therefore climate resilience in the case-study. Leverage points include improving (a) support from the provincial government; (b) priority given to climate change in the integrated development plan; (c) frequency of collaborations; (d) participation in the implementation of climate action plans; (e) allocation of funding to climate change actions; (f) the overall level of preparedness in terms of staff with relevant expertise; (g) public awareness and understanding of climate change. The approach can also be used to analyze and model the relations and interactions between capitals. The study advances methodological and theoretical knowledge on the identification of leverage points for enabling transformations toward climate resilience and broader sustainability goals in SES.","[Roelfer, Lena; Costa, Maria Manez; Celliers, Louis] Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Hamburg, Germany; [Roelfer, Lena; Abson, David J.; Celliers, Louis] Leuphana Univ, Fac Sustainabil, Luneburg, Germany; [Rosendo, Sergio] Nova Univ Lisbon UNL, Fac Social Sci & Humanities FCSH, Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci CICS NOVA, Lisbon, Portugal; [Smith, Timothy F.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sch Law & Soc, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia; [Smith, Timothy F.] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON, Canada; [Smith, Timothy F.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Womens & Childrens Hlth, SWEDESD, Uppsala, Sweden",Leuphana University Luneburg; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University of the Sunshine Coast; Brock University; Uppsala University,"Rolfer, L (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Hamburg, Germany.;Rolfer, L (corresponding author), Leuphana Univ, Fac Sustainabil, Luneburg, Germany.",lena.roelfer@hereon.de,"; Manez Costa, Maria/P-1225-2017","Rolfer, Lena/0000-0002-4364-5349; Manez Costa, Maria/0000-0001-5415-0811; Rosendo, Sergio/0000-0002-3095-9824","I2B Program of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon, Germany; WIOMSA-MASMA Cities and Coast Program Grant [CitiesandCoasts/OP/2018/02]; Projekt DEAL","I2B Program of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon, Germany; WIOMSA-MASMA Cities and Coast Program Grant; Projekt DEAL","We would like to thank Eulalia Gomez Martin and Meredith Fernandes for their support in mapping the governance processes and relationships between them in a FCM.

A sound understanding of potential future risk trends is therefore critical to examine adaptation needs and chart adaptation options. Future risk is shaped and defined not only by future changes in climatic hazards but by future trends in exposure and vulnerability. The latter, however, has received less attention in science and policy, despite the fact that for the near-term future such changes in socio-economic exposure and vulnerability might contribute more to risk alterations than changes in climate hazards, particularly in dynamic transition economies. Against this background, we analyze the latest generation of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) for developing countries and comparable documents for other countries in order to examine whether and to what extent future trends in the different components of risk (hazard, exposure, vulnerability) have been considered and assessed in the process of adaptation planning. A total of 73 documents have been coded in detail. We find a grave mismatch which persists across different groups of countries, e.g. in terms of income levels, vulnerability and risk levels: While the vast majority of plans recognized the importance of future exposure and vulnerability trends on a conceptual level, only a small fraction of plans actually assesses them in a strategic manner. This leads to incomplete and imbalanced assumptions about future risk levels and adaptation needs. We examine the main challenges for more balanced assessments and discuss ways forward.","[Garschagen, M.; Doshi, D.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Moure, M.; James, H.; Shekhar, H.] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Moure, M.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Munich; University of Copenhagen,"Garschagen, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",m.garschagen@lmu.de,,"Shekhar, Himanshu/0000-0002-2793-5143; Doshi, Deepal/0000-0002-9606-2809; Moure, Mar/0000-0002-7334-8644",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the TRANSCEND project [01LN1710A1]; Munich Re Foundation within the World Risk and Adaptation Futures Academy,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the TRANSCEND project(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Munich Re Foundation within the World Risk and Adaptation Futures Academy,The authors acknowledge that this research was supported by funding received from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the TRANSCEND project (grant number 01LN1710A1) and the Munich Re Foundation within the World Risk and Adaptation Futures Academy.,,46,3,3,1,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Recent advances suggest that the frequency and intensity of destructive flood events on the Argentinian Pampas will increase under pressure from climate change. This paper provides bottom-up insight into the flood risk for soybean production systems under climate change and the suitability of adaptation strategies in two of the most flood-prone areas of the Pampas region. The flood risk perceptions of soybean producers were explored through interviews, translated into climatic indicators and then studied using a multi-model climate data analysis. Soybean producers perceived the present flood risk for rural accessibility to be of the highest concern, especially during the harvest and sowing seasons when heavy machinery needs to reach soybean lots. An analysis of climatic change projections found a rising trend in annual and harvest precipitation and a slight drying trend during the sowing season. This indicates that the flood risk for harvest accessibility may increase under climate change. Several adaptation strategies were identified that can systemically address flood risks, but these require collaborative action and cannot be undertaken by individual producers. The results suggest that if cooperative adaptation efforts are not made in the short term, the continued increase in flood risk may force soybean producers in the case study locations to shift away from soybean towards more robust land uses.","[Smolenaars, Wouter Julius; Paparrizos, Spyridon; Werners, Saskia; Ludwig, Fulco] Wageningen Univ, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Werners, Saskia] United Nations Univ, UNU EHS, Vulnerabil Assessment Risk Management & Adapt Pla, Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Wageningen University & Research,"Smolenaars, WJ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",wouter.smolenaars@wur.nl; spyros.paparrizos@wur.nl; saskia.werners@wur.nl; fulco.ludwig@wur.nl,"Ludwig, Fulco/N-7732-2013; Paparrizos, Spyridon/O-2129-2016","Smolenaars, Wouter/0000-0003-0511-7905; Paparrizos, Spyridon/0000-0002-4226-8043",,,,,51,0,0,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,JUN,2021,11,6,,,,,,,1187,10.3390/agronomy11061187,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11061187,,,21,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,SX8PG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000665459000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results highlight how planning's dominant mode of ordering tends to address disaster risk areas by focusing primarily upon the physical characteristics of space and hazard-mitigating infrastructures, selectively drawing in some human actors from its surrounding context while excluding those viewed as less knowledgeable for addressing climate-related risks. Within some networks, however, climate agency and notions of participation that recognize place-based knowledge from the most vulnerable communities are given a higher profile. Drawing upon this emergent mode of ordering, evidence of some amendments to planning processes are provided, so that approaches integrating the agency of both human and non-human actors can be brought effectively into planning frameworks.","[Dujardin, S.; Dendoncker, N.] Univ Namur, Dept Geog, Rue Bruxelles 61, B-5000 Namur, Belgium",University of Namur,"Dujardin, S (corresponding author), Univ Namur, Dept Geog, Rue Bruxelles 61, B-5000 Namur, Belgium.",sebastien.dujardin@unamur.be,,"Dendoncker, Nicolas/0000-0001-9129-9025; Dujardin, Sebastien/0000-0002-8451-8258",Fonds pour la Formation a la Recherche dans l'Industrie et dans l'Agriculture,Fonds pour la Formation a la Recherche dans l'Industrie et dans l'Agriculture(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),This work was supported by the Fonds pour la Formation a la Recherche dans l'Industrie et dans l'Agriculture.,,84,3,3,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1464-9357,1470-000X,,PLAN THEORY PRACT,Plan.

The land use types of study area are six, of which three are the main and the other three are the minor. The main three, forest, shrub or bush land and grassland, changed during the period, of which grass-lands reduced by 5864 ha (40%), forest by 3071 ha (24%) and shrub and bush land increased by 8912 ha (43%). The other three minor land use types were bare land which had reduced by 238 ha (45%), river bed vegetation increased by 209 ha (72%) and agriculture increased by 52 ha (600%) over the period decades. Differences in spatiotemporal variations of vegetation could be largely attributed to the effects of climate factors, anthropogenic activities and their interactions. Precipitation and temperature have been demonstrated to be the key climate factors for plant growth and vegetation development where rainfall decreased by 200 mm and temperatures increased by 1.5 degrees C over the period. Also, the opinion of the community on the change of land use and management was attributed to climate change and also adaptation strategies applied by the community over time. For example unlike the common understanding that forest resources utilisation increases with increasing human population, Mukogodo dry forested ecosystem case is different in that the majority of the respondents (78.9%) reported that the forest resource use was more in that period than now and also a similar majority (74.2%) had the same opinion that forest resource utilisation was low compared to last 30 years. In Yaaku community, change impacts were evidenced and thus mitigation measures suggested to address the impacts which included the following: controlled bush management and indigenous grass reseeding programme were advocated to restore original grasslands, and agricultural (crop farming) activities are carried out in designated areas outside the forest conservation areas (ecosystem zoning) all in consultation with government (political class), community and other stakeholders. Groups are organised (environmental management committee) to address conservation, political and vulnerability issues in the pastoral dry forested ecosystem which will sustain pastoralism in the ecosystem.","[M'mboroki, Kiambi Gilbert] Minist Agr Livestock Dev & Fisheries, State Dept Livestock, Nairobi, Kenya; [Wandiga, Shem; Oriaso, Silas Odongo] Univ Nairobi, Inst Climate Change & Adaptat, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi,"M'mboroki, KG (corresponding author), Minist Agr Livestock Dev & Fisheries, State Dept Livestock, Nairobi, Kenya.",mborokikiambi@yahoo.com; wandigas@uonbi.ac.ke; soriazzo@gmail.com,,,Regional Pastoral Livelihood Resilience Project-Kenya,Regional Pastoral Livelihood Resilience Project-Kenya,The funding on transport and logistics was from Regional Pastoral Livelihood Resilience Project-Kenya.,,22,11,11,2,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

Such vulnerability is expected to increase over time due to the impact of climate change on hurricanes and the decay of wood poles that support the distribution lines. This study investigates the effectiveness of using fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) sleeve to reinforce wood poles subjected to decay and hurricane hazard to restore their lost strength and extend their effective service life. The potential impact of climate change on the pole decay rate and the intensity and frequency of hurricanes is also considered. The optimal FRP repair time based on the structural reliability of the poles is also determined. Three locations with varying climates are chosen to evaluate and compare the results: Miami, Charleston, and New York City. The results show that in all three locations, the application of the FRP sleeve can more than double the service life of the pole depending on the time of the repair. The results also show that climate change significantly increases the vulnerability of the pole. The probability of failure of the pole at the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 emission scenario in Miami, Charleston, and New York City increase by about 30%, 70%, and 73%, respectively, compared to a no climate change scenario. If climate change is only assumed to affect the decay of the pole, i.e., no change in hurricane hazard intensity, the corresponding increases in failure probability are 5%, 22%, and 20% in Miami, Charleston, and New York City, respectively. This implies that most of the impact of climate change on pole failure risk is due to the increase in hurricane intensity. The impact of climate change on decay is found to be comparatively small. It increases with time as variation in temperature and precipitation becomes more prominent towards the end of the 21st century. The optimization results show that the optimal FRP repair time depends on how the FRP affects the pole's decay rate. If the FRP can significantly slow down the wood decay rate, the optimal time of repair is at the beginning of the pole's life cycle. If the FRP has no impact on the wood decay rate, it is better to repair the pole after significant decay has occurred.","[Merschman, Eric; Salman, Abdullahi M.] Univ Alabama, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA; [Bastidas-Arteaga, Emilio] Univ Nantes, GeM, Inst Res Civil & Mech Engn, CNRS,UMR 6183, Nantes, France; [Li, Yue] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); Nantes Universite; Case Western Reserve University,"Salman, AM (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA.",ams0098@uah.edu,"Salman, Abdullahi/O-9742-2017; Bastidas-Arteaga, Emilio/A-6090-2012","Salman, Abdullahi/0000-0001-6764-5979; Bastidas-Arteaga, Emilio/0000-0002-7370-5218","Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy","Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","We acknowledge the modeling groups, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) and the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modeling (WGCM) for their roles in making available the WCRP CMIP3 and CMIP5 multi-model dataset.

Within agricultural systems, farmers have the option of significantly transforming their practices, or migrating elsewhere in the search for a better lifestyle (and exiting the agricultural socio-ecological system). However, if governments, communities and industry leaders are to provide climate change impact support to agricultural regions, then it becomes critical to predict the conditions under which farmers, households and communities will choose to either transform their farming or migrate. We hypothesize that those conditions are likely to reflect environmental, economic and social conditions within a region, where some communities and/or some farmers may respond differently depending on their environmental, economic and social factors. Here, we examine how the perception of farmers to transformational change is influenced by social, environmental and economic factors in six villages within the Famenin County of western Iran, which have experienced a notable recent decrease in groundwater levels, an increase in temperature due to reduced rainfall and no support from government. Results show that environmental, economic and social factors were all important influences on the social transformations that were occurring within each village and across the region. In sum, environmental flexibility and local corporation eased the transformation process. Place attachment and social capital were critical to facilitate transformation during all parts of the transformation process. These results are discussed as two separate scenarios.","[Khanian, Mojtaba; Salimi, Marziyeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Hamedan Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Hamadan, Iran; [Marshall, Nadine] CSIRO, Land & Water, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Zakerhaghighi, Kianoosh] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Urban Planning, Hamedan Branch, Hamadan, Iran; [Naghdi, Asadollah] Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Social Sci, Hamadan, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Islamic Azad University; Bu Ali Sina University,"Khanian, M (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Hamedan Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Hamadan, Iran.",khanian.mojtaba@gmail.com,"Zakerhaghighi, Kianoosh/Z-2086-2019; Khanian, Mojtaba/AAA-1141-2022","Zakerhaghighi, Kianoosh/0000-0002-7963-0499; Khanian, Mojtaba/0000-0002-4867-9927; Naghdi, Asadollah/0000-0002-6403-6948",,,,,74,16,16,1,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0947,,,WEATHER CLIM EXTREME,Weather Clim.

Phosphorus concentration, considered the primary driver of eutrophication risk in English rivers, may increase through reduced dilution particularly if river flows are lower in summer. Detailed models can indicate change in catchment phosphorus concentrations but targeted support for mitigation measures requires a national scale evaluation of risk. In this study, a load apportionment model is used to describe the current relationship between flow and total reactive phosphorus (TRP) at 115 river sites across England. These relationships are used to estimate TRP concentrations for the 2050s under 11 climate change driven scenarios of future river flows and under scenarios of both current and higher levels of sewage treatment. National maps of change indicate a small but inconsistent increase in annual average TRP concentrations with a greater change in summer. Reducing the TRP concentration of final sewage effluent to 0.5mg/L P for all upstream sewage treatment works was inadequate to meet existing P standards required through the EU Water Framework Directive, indicating that more needs to be done, including efforts to reduce diffuse pollution.

In addition to the volatility from markets, forestry investments are directly exposed to future impacts from climate change. We examined how diversification of forest management regimes can mitigate the expected risks associated with forestry activities in New Zealand based on an application of Modern Portfolio Theory. Uncertainties in the responses of Pinus radiata (D. Don) productivity to climate change, from 2050 to 2090, were simulated with 3-PG, a process based forest growth model, based on future climate scenarios and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Future timber market scenarios were based on RCP-specific projections from the Global Timber Model and historical log grade prices. Outputs from 3-PG and the market scenarios were combined to compute annualized forestry returns for four P. radiata regimes for 2050?2090. This information was then used to construct optimal forestry portfolios that minimize investment risk for a given target return under different RCPs, forest productivity and market scenarios. While current P. radiata regimes in New Zealand are largely homogenous, our results suggest that regime diversification can mitigate future risks imposed by climate change and market uncertainty. Nevertheless, optimal portfolio compositions varied substantially across our range of scenarios and portfolio objectives. The application of this framework can help forest managers to better account for future risks in their management decisions.","[West, Thales A.

The options on providing access to irrigation water, strategic use of irrigation, and better crop husbandry practices were evaluated for their potential to impart climate resilience in farming systems. Irrigation trials revealed that, in the event of delayed rainfall, irrigation of 229-267 mm ensured timely transplanting and resulted in higher paddy yields (7.0 t ha(-1)). Supplemental irrigation during a mid-season dry spell increased paddy yield to from 0.64 to 6.1 t ha(-1). Better vegetable cultivation practices viz. drip irrigation, polythene mulch, nursery raising in seedling trays and raised bed cultivation exhibited great potential to build climate resilience in the farming systems of the region. The study highlights the need for investments in small water harvesting structures and the promotion of alternative ways of cultivating and irrigating paddy during different climatic situations. The study suggests effective ways of engaging communities coupled with appropriate technological interventions to understand climate change and adaptation needs of the rice-fallow ecosystems in eastern India.","[Singh, A.

One option is to strengthen existing sea walls to maintain current land uses; however, scientists, policy-makers and conservationists increasingly see the benefits of managed realignment, which is a nature-based coastal adaptation that involves the conversion of reclaimed farmland back to wetlands, allowing periodic local flooding in designated areas to reduce the risk of flooding downstream. We interviewed 16 local organisations, landowners and farmers and held workshops with 109 citizens living the Inner Forth estuary in eastern Scotland, to examine how managed realignment is supported by stakeholder attitudes and their engagement. Most of the farmers we interviewed prefer strengthened sea walls, to maintain their livelihoods and agricultural heritage. Citizens and local organisations were mainly supportive of managed realignment, because it provided wildlife and flood regulation benefits. However, we identified several barriers that could present obstacles to implementing managed realignment, for example, uncertainty whether it would support their principles of economic and rational decision-making. Our findings suggest that the local capacity to cope with rising sea levels is limited by lack of engagement with all relevant stakeholder groups, the limited scope of existing stakeholder partnerships and poor short-term funding prospects of landscape partnerships that would facilitate collaboration and discussion. We suggest that including citizens, landowners, farmers and industries would strengthen existing stakeholder deliberation and collaboration, and support the Inner Forth's transition towards a more sustainable future shoreline.","[Liski, Anja Helena; Metzger, Marc J.; Wilson, A.

Understanding whether and how CCD design processes reconcile different stakeholder preferences can reveal how the concept contends with patterns of sociocultural and political oppression that condition patterns of development. We, therefore, explore procedural justice and power within CCD design through a case study analysis of two donor-funded projects in Malawi. Findings show that donor agencies are driving design processes and involving other stakeholders selectively. While considerable overlap existed between stakeholders' revealed priorities for CCD, invisible power dynamics encourage the suppression of true preferences, reducing the likelihood that CCD will be contextually appropriate and have widespread stakeholder buy in. Visible, hidden, and invisible forms of power create barriers to procedural justice in CCD design. We present five recommendations to help policy makers and practitioners to overcome these barriers.","[Wood, Benjamin T.; Dougill, Andrew J.; Quinn, Claire H.; Stringer, Lindsay C.] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Wood, BT (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",ee12btw@leeds.ac.uk,"Quinn, Claire/AAU-8184-2020","Quinn, Claire/0000-0002-2085-0446; Stringer, Lindsay/0000-0003-0017-1654",Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy PhD studentship; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy PhD studentship; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded through a Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy PhD studentship awarded to Benjamin T.

We aimed to use machine learning methods to systematically synthesise an evidence base on climate change and human health. Methods We used supervised machine learning and other natural language processing methods (topic modelling and geoparsing) to systematically identify and map the scientific literature on climate change and health published between Jan 1, 2013, and April 9, 2020. Only literature indexed in English were included. We searched Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and PubMed using title, abstract, and keywords only. We searched for papers including both a health component and an explicit mention of either climate change, climate variability, or climate change-relevant weather phenomena. We classified relevant publications according to the fields of climate research, climate drivers, health impact, date, and geography. We used supervised and unsupervised machine learning to identify and classify relevant articles in the field of climate and health, with outputs including evidence heat maps, geographical maps, and narrative synthesis of trends in climate health-related publications. We included empirical literature of any study design that reported on health pathways associated with climate impacts, mitigation, or adaptation. Findings We predict that there are 15 963 studies in the field of climate and health published between 2013 and 2019. Climate health literature is dominated by impact studies, with mitigation and adaptation responses and their co benefits and co-risks remaining niche topics. Air quality and heat stress are the most frequently studied exposures, with all-cause mortality and infectious disease incidence being the most frequently studied health outcomes. Seasonality, extreme weather events, heat, and weather variability are the most frequently studied climate-related hazards. We found major gaps in evidence on climate health research for mental health, undernutrition, and maternal and child health. Geographically, the evidence base is dominated by studies from high-income countries and China, with scant evidence from low-income counties, which often suffer most from the health consequences of climate change. Interpretation Our findings show the importance and feasibility of using automated machine learning to comprehensively map the science on climate change and human health in the age of big literature. These can provide key inputs into global climate and health assessments. The scant evidence on climate change response options is concerning and could significantly hamper the design of evidence-based pathways to reduce the effects on health of climate change. In the post-2015 Paris Agreement era of climate solutions, we believe much more attention should be given to climate adaptation and mitigation options and their effects on human health.

Focusing on the case of severe storms in the US, I develop a macro heterogeneous-agent model to quantify the interactions between adaptation, federal disaster policy, and climate change. The model departs from the standard climate damage function and incorporates the damage from storms as the realization of idiosyncratic shocks. Using the calibrated model, I infer that adaptation capital comprises approximately 1% of the US capital stock. I find that while the moral hazard effects from disaster aid reduce adaptation in the US economy, federal subsidies for investment in adaptation more than correct for the moral hazard. I introduce climate change into the model as a permanent increase in either or both the severity or probability of storms. Adaptation reduces the damage from this climate change by approximately one-third. Finally, I show that modelling the idiosyncratic risk component of climate damage has quantitatively important implications for adaptation and for the welfare cost of climate change.","[Fried, Stephie] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Fried, Stephie] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Fried, S (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;Fried, S (corresponding author), Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",,,,,,,,79,1,1,11,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

One factor that has not been thoroughly addressed by previous attempts at measuring adaptive capacity is urbanization. This study looks to measure adaptive capacity in relation to urbanization, as many areas of the world are undergoing this rapid transition. An indicator system was created with land-use sensitive measures and applied to three different land use projection scenarios (A, BAU, and B - high, medium, and low growth, respectively) to 2030 and 2050 for two case study areas, Tamsui, Taiwan and West Palm Beach, USA. In Tamsui, the adaptive capacity decreased in all scenarios, but most dramatically for the high growth scenario. The low growth scenario decreased more slowly through each time slice. For West Palm Beach, the high growth scenario had the highest score in 2030, but declined in 2050. The medium growth Scenario BAU, also had a higher adaptive capacity score in 2030 than in 2050. The low growth Scenario B had a score that improved less dramatically but continued to rise through 2050. Scenario A would be ideal for short term gains, but its benefits would plateau in the long term. Scenario B, with conservation measures and more restricted growth would be the most ideal alternative. This study shows that urbanization has short term socioeconomic gains, but long term environmental consequences. The results also successfully incorporates the effect of land use change into an adaptive capacity indicator system, and can be applied in other localities expecting significant increases in urbanization.","[Chu, Andrea; Lin, Ying-Chen; Chiueh, Pei-Te] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Environm Engn, 71,Chou Shan Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chiueh, PT (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Environm Engn, 71,Chou Shan Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",ptchueh@ntu.edu.tw,,"Lin, Ying-Chen/0000-0002-0691-8520",,,,,71,9,9,0,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,NOV,2017,68,,,,,,28,38,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.07.019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.07.019,,,11,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FJ9UE,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000413126200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of the time, disaster recovery efforts produce net benefits to society. However, depending on their design and governance, some projects can germinate adverse social, political, and economic outcomes. Drawing from concepts in political economy, political ecology, justice theory, and critical development studies, this study first presents a conceptual typology revolving around four key processes: enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment. Enclosure refers to when disaster recovery transfers public assets into private hands or expands the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when disaster recovery limits access to resources or marginalizes particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when efforts intrude on biodiversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when disaster recovery aggravates the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsens concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. The study then documents the presence of these four inequitable attributes across four empirical case studies: Hurricane Katrina reconstruction in the United States, recovery efforts for the 2004 tsunami in Thailand, Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, and the Canterbury earthquakes in New Zealand. It next offers three policy recommendations for analysts, program managers, and researchers at large: spreading risks via insurance, adhering to principles of free prior informed consent, and preventing damage through punitive environmental bonds. The political economy of disaster must be taken into account so that projects can maximize their efficacy and avoid marginalizing those most vulnerable to those very disasters.

Our results show (1) how historical and ongoing multi-scalar, social ecological processes interact to shape smallholder adaptation decision-making, leading to synergies, tensions, and contradictions across risk management domains and social institutions; (2) whether an adaptation strategy persists over time is in part determined by the extent to which the strategy allows smallholder households to manage various forms of risk and uncertainty in both the present and future; and (3) how past and ongoing multi-scalar adaptation pathways determine not only smallholder exposure to current stressors but also possible choices for future adaptation. Specifically, we find some smallholder adaptive strategies, such as planting maize, stabilize over time because they enable smallholders to manage market risk, climatic risk, and water pollution challenges, allow them to take advantage of opportunities to diversify their livelihoods through local wage work and labor migration, and, at the same time, fit the local social institutions that guide their agricultural management decisions. We also find some adaptive strategies promoted by non-local actors, such as drip irrigation, are abandoned because they create tensions with the ways smallholders construct their livelihoods to manage various forms of uncertainty and risk, and contradict the local social relations and cultural values embedded in their day-to-day lives. Together, these results provide insight into why particular smallholder adaptation pathways become stabilized and reproduced over time, and the cross-scalar environmental, social, political, economic, and institutional processes that underpin them.

Based on a review of bionic technologies for building functions, structures, and materials, the present study analyzes applications and typical cases of bionic building energy efficiency and bionic green architecture. For example, utilizing the wisdom of nature in buildings, architectural innovations using bionic functions have been created based on the favorable natural ventilation system found in termite mounds. Moreover, passive construction technology using solar energy resources can not only improve the indoor thermal environment but also achieve low energy consumption for buildings. Drawing inspiration from mechanical properties, structural relationships, and the material performance of natural objects, and applying this to a building's structure or shape design, large span structures, such as suspension cable and thin shell structure, which imitate cobwebs and eggshell respectively, have been designed to improve the efficiency of building resources. Using polar bear fur, lotus leaves, and other natural animals and plants as bionic building materials, self-compensation, regulation, and maintenance mechanisms have been achieved on building surfaces, allowing the buildings to actively adapt to their environment, thus reflecting the symbiotic relationship between architecture and the environment, and achieving the green development of buildings with high efficiency and low energy consumption. In addition, based on ecological principles and climate-adaptive design rules, the present study proposes an overall design concept for bionic green architecture and further notes that, in future research, it will be necessary to implement the following: strengthen the integration and optimization of diverse green building technologies; manage the energy efficiency of bionic buildings throughout their life cycles; develop bionic technologies for building functions based on the principle of regional suitability; promote innovative bionic technologies for building structures based on the principle of green ecological coexistence; and strengthen the research, development, and application of bionic building materials that regulate, repair, clean, and protect themselves. In short, the development of bionic building energy efficiency and bionic green architecture should follow and respect natural laws. It is necessary to study the mechanisms used in biological systems, which, combined with modern building technologies, should be employed to support building innovation and to realize the rapid development of building energy efficiency and green buildings.","[Yuan, Yanping; Yu, Xiaoping; Yang, Xiaojiao; Xiang, Bo] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaoping] Chongqing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Yimin] Chongqing Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Three Gorges Reservoir Reg Ecoenvironm, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yi] Xian Univ Arch & Tech, Sch Environm & Municipal Engn, Xian 710055, Peoples R China",Southwest Jiaotong University; Chongqing University of Science & Technology; Chongqing University; Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology,"Yuan, YP (corresponding author), Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China.",ypyuan@home.swjtu.edu.cn,,"Yuan, Yanping/0000-0001-8254-6223; Yuan, Yanping/0000-0001-8613-391X",,,,,129,38,41,50,388,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

It has not only devastating effects on the environment but also on the social and economic aspects of societies, especially those seeking to achieve sustainable development. Coastal areas are classified as one of the areas that are particularly exposed to current and projected risks connected to climate change. Selection of suitable climate adaptation means requires an integrated evaluation of climate change impacts and detects the vulnerability degree of various areas exposed to climate change. Therefore, this paper uses Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to develop a GIS data model (Climate-Coastal Model) for evaluating the long-term impacts of climate changes and delineating the most vulnerable areas in coastal zones. In this regard, specific indicators are needed to detect the vulnerable areas. Four main effective parameters of climate change impacts were selected, which are meteorological parameter, topographical structures parameter (Earth Shape), engineering geology parameter, and shoreline parameter. The paper considered that all indicators in the four parameters have equal weights, where the results depended on changing the values of model indicators during the study period, which is 30 years. Al-Alamein New City in Egypt is presented as a case study to demonstrate the practical features of the proposed model. The results of a developed model according to 30 years study period reveal that the affected areas from climate change impacts are those located along the shoreline. Vulnerability along the shoreline has divided into three categories. The first one represents the least vulnerable areas, which located in Al-Alamein city and constitute about 0.00154 km(2) from the total area (227.65 km(2)). This is due to being affected by low values of meteorological indicators and minor erosion and accretion processes comparing to the other sections. The second one represents the moderate vulnerable areas, which scattered throughout all sections of the case study: Al-Alamein City, Tel Al-Eis, and Sidi Abd El-Rahman. It constitutes about 0.9941 km(2) from the total area. The last one represents the most vulnerable areas, which located also in all sections of the study area and forms about 0.72092 km(2) from the total area which have low elevations below the average mean of sea water level that means it is most vulnerable to any climate change scenarios. It is also affected by high values of coastal erosion, costal accretion, and wind speed as well as a high percentage of dew point. The proposed model is considered as a decision support tool, which helps the decision-makers to detect the vulnerability degree of any areas exposed to climate-change impacts based on multi-criteria and parameter to give the priority for such areas.

In light of the Paris Agreement, it is essential to identify the regional impacts of 0.5 degrees C of additional global warming to inform climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. Using the modified Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) and Advection-Aridity (AA) models with global warming values of 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C above preindustrial levels from Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2b) datasets, we conducted a new set of climate simulations to assess the effects of climate on WUE (the ratio of net primary productivity (NPP) to actual evapotranspiration (ETa)) in different sandy land types (mobile sandy land, MSL; semimobile/semifixed sandy land, SMSF; and fixed sandy land, FSL) during the period of baseline (1986-2005) and future (2006-2100). The spatiotemporal patterns of ETa, NPP, and WUE mostly showed increasing trends; the value of WUE decreased (6.40%) only in MSL with an additional 0.5 degrees C of warming. Meteorological and vegetation factors determined the variations in WUE. With warming, only the correlation between precipitation and WUE decreased in the three sandy land types, and the leaf area index (LAI) increased with an additional 0.5 degrees C of warming. The desertification degree comprehensively reflects the linkages among the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), LAI and WUE. Simulation results indicated the sandy area extent could potential increase by 20 x 10(4) km(2) per decade on average during 2016-2047 and that the increase could be gradual (2.60 x 10(4) km(2) per decade) after 2050 (2050-2100). These results highlight the benefits of limiting the global mean temperature change to 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels and can help identify the risk of desertification with an additional 0.5 degrees C of warming.

Social justice considers and reflects on the question of fairness in the allocation of resources, participation, and wealth across residents of a river basin. This critical review elucidates the role of social justice in flood risk management by considering the possible consequences of including social justice and by proposing how to integrate those consequences into the current socio-hydrology model.

This mixed methods investigation combines salinity testing with qualitative research methods to explore these impacts in one of the most salinity-affected regions in the world-the Ganges River Delta. Data collection in 2015 and 2016 undertaken in Bangladesh's southwest coastal region and Dhaka consisted of 83 in-depth household and stakeholder interviews, six community focus groups, and salinity testing of 27 soil and 45 surface and groundwater samples. Results show that household food production is a multifaceted cornerstone of rural livelihood in the southwest coastal region, and virtually every component of it-from rice plantation and homestead gardening to livestock cultivation and aquaculture-is being negatively affected by salinity. Although households have attempted multiple strategies for adapting food production, effective adaptation remains elusive. At the community level, improved irrigation and floodplain management, as well as restrictions on saltwater aquaculture to abate salinity, are viewed as promising interventions. However, the potential of such measures remains unrealized on a broad scale, as they require a level of external resources and regulation not yet provided by the NGO and government sectors. This study elucidates issues of accessibility, equity, and governance surrounding agricultural interventions for climate change-related salinity adaptation, and its findings can help inform the community of organizations that will increasingly need to grapple with salinity in order to guarantee food security in the context of environmental change.","[Lam, Yukyan; Winch, Peter J.; Surkan, Pamela J.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Nizame, Fosiul Alam; Harun, Md.

Maize is arguably the world's most productive grain crop, as measured by grain yield. However, maize yields vary dramatically due to many factors, including soils, climate, pests, disease, agronomic practices, and seed quality. The difference between observed yields and those achievable by optimized crop production methods is called the yield gap. In this work we quantified the current yield gap for 44 countries through the use of a large private-sector data set recently made available to the crop modelling community. The yield gap was quantified for three groups of countries, categorized by level of intensification. Observed yield gaps for high, medium, and low levels of intensification are 23%, 46%, and 68%, respectively. If all maize production countries were able to shrink their yield gap to 16.5% (as in the USA) an additional 335 million metric tons (MMT) of maize grain would be produced. This represents a 45% increase over the 741 MMT produced by these countries in 2010. These data demonstrate that a major untapped maize yield opportunity exists, especially in those countries where intensification has not kept pace with the rest of the world.","[Gustafson, David I.] Int Life Sci Inst Res Fdn, CIMSANS, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Jones, James W.; Porter, Cheryl H.] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Hyman, Glenn] CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Edgerton, Michael D.; Gocken, Tom; Shryock, Jereme; Doane, Michael] Monsanto Co, St Louis, MO 63167 USA; [Budreski, Katie; Stone, Chris; Healy, David] Stone Environm Inc, Montpelier, VT 05602 USA; [Ramsey, Nathan] Context Network, W Des Moines, IA 50266 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Monsanto,"Gustafson, DI (corresponding author), Int Life Sci Inst Res Fdn, CIMSANS, 1156 15th St NW,Suite 200, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",dgustafson@ilsi.org,"Jones, James/AAP-9048-2020; Porter, Cheryl H./AAM-4431-2020","Jones, James/0000-0002-3239-8960; Gustafson, David/0000-0001-6359-7017",,,,,63,14,14,1,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

We used 15 yr of data from an experimental rainfall exclusion (-27% of rainfall) combined with thinning (-30% stand basal area) to investigate differences in the drought-function relationships for each component of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and stand transpiration in a Mediterranean Quercus ilex stand. Rainfall exclusion reduced stand ANPP by 10%, mainly because of lowered leaf and acorn production, whereas wood production remained unaffected. These responses were consistent with the temporal sensitivity to drought among tree organs but revealed an increased allocation to wood. Thinning increased wood and acorn production and reduced the sensitivity of standing wood biomass change to drought. Rainfall exclusion and thinning lowered the intercept of the transpiration-drought relationship as a result of the structural constraints exerted by lower leaf and sapwood area. The results suggest that historical drought-function relationships can be used to infer future drought impacts on stand ANPP but not on water fluxes. Thinning can mitigate drought effects and reduce forest sensitivity to drought.","[Gavinet, Jordane; Ourcival, Jean-Marc; Limousin, Jean-Marc] CEFE CNRS, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France",Universite de Montpellier,"Limousin, JM (corresponding author), CEFE CNRS, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",jean-marc.limousin@cefe.cnrs.fr,,"Gavinet, Jordane/0000-0001-5512-2644",,,,,100,29,30,4,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0028-646X,1469-8137,,NEW PHYTOL,New Phytol.,AUG,2019,223,3,,,,,1267,1279,,10.1111/nph.15860,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.15860,,,13,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,IJ5BO,31006128,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000475918000021,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the understanding of recent coastal flood events in the Maldives is limited and is important to understanding future flood threats. This paper assesses (1) the sea level and wave climate of the Maldives, (2) the sea level and wave conditions during recent coastal flood events, and (3) the implications for flood management and future research. The analysis uses observed still water levels (1987-2015) and hindcast wave conditions (1979-2015). Two significant flood events on 10-13 April 1987 and 15-17 May 2007 are examined in detail. This shows that coastal flooding in the Maldives occurs due to multiple interacting sources. These include long-period (up to 20 s) energetic waves generated in the Southern Ocean combined with spring tides. Wave run-up (mainly wave set-up) appears an essential mechanism for a flood, but is currently poorly quantified. However, as sea levels continue to rise the conditions that produce a flood will occur more frequently, suggesting that flooding will become common in the Maldives. This analysis is a starting point for future research and highlights the need to continue research on flood sources, pathways and receptors, and plan adaptation measures. Priorities include monitoring of waves, sea levels and flood events, and a better understanding of set-up (and other shallow water processes over reefs).","[Wadey, Matthew; Brown, Sally; Nicholls, Robert J.] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 IBJ, Hants, England; [Wadey, Matthew] Havant Borough Council, Eastern Solent Coastal Partnership, 2 Penner Rd, Havant PO9 1QH, England; [Haigh, Ivan] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Haigh, Ivan] Univ Western Australia, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Haigh, Ivan] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Southampton; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Wadey, M (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 IBJ, Hants, England.;Wadey, M (corresponding author), Havant Borough Council, Eastern Solent Coastal Partnership, 2 Penner Rd, Havant PO9 1QH, England.",m.p.wadey@soton.ac.uk; sb20@soton.ac.uk; R.J.Nicholls@soton.ac.uk; I.D.Haigh@soton.ac.uk,"Nicholls, Robert James/G-3898-2010; Brown, Sally/AAD-6943-2020; Nicholls, Robert James/ABD-1481-2020; Brown, Sally/I-2662-2014","Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Brown, Sally/0000-0003-1185-1962",European Commission [FP7-ENV-2013-two-stage-603396]; European Union [282746],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); European Union(European Commission),"MPW, SB and RJN were funded by the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme's collaborative project RISES-AM (contract FP7-ENV-2013-two-stage-603396).

Mobilizing such action can be made more optimal with knowledge about how the public views climate change solutions and what they think needs to be done in the face of climate change. Yet most public opinion research to date uses either closed questions about agreement with various pre-determined statements (such as views on science, worry, and support for given policy options) or use open-ended questions eliciting generic associations with climate change. This article uses an open-ended survey question in a probability-based Internet survey panel in Norway, analyzing 4634 textual responses to the question of what should be done about climate change. Using structural topic modeling (STM), we induce seven topics: Transportation, energy transition, attribution of climate change, emission reduction, the international dimension, lifestyle/consumption and government measures. We find that Norwegians strongly emphasize mitigation over adaptation, as few responses mention the latter topic. Also, men seem to externalize the solutions to climate change, emphasizing energy policies, the international dimension, and discussions about the causes of climate change, while women to a larger extent understand climate action as an issue involving individual behavior, calling for better public transportation and lifestyle changes. Overall, our results suggest a willingness to accept stronger mitigation action, but also that central and local governments need to facilitate low-carbon choices, bridging policy and individual action to mitigate climate change.","[Tvinnereim, Endre] Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Flottum, Kjersti; Gjerstad, Oyvind] Univ Bergenb, Dept Foreign Languages, Bergen, Norway; [Johannesson, Mikael Poul; Nordo, Asta Dyrnes] Univ Bergen, Dept Comparat Polit, Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen,"Tvinnereim, E (corresponding author), Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, Bergen, Norway.",endre.tvinnereim@uni.no,"Tvinnereim, Endre/AFQ-8791-2022","Tvinnereim, Endre/0000-0001-8891-2503",Bergen Research Foundation [BFS2015DIG]; Research Council of Norway under the project Lingclim [220654]; Research Council of Norway under the project JPI European Perceptions of Climate Change [244904],Bergen Research Foundation; Research Council of Norway under the project Lingclim(Research Council of Norway); Research Council of Norway under the project JPI European Perceptions of Climate Change(Research Council of Norway),"The research was funded by grants from the Bergen Research Foundation (grant no.

While institutional and risk perception dimensions of AM are increasingly well studied, a key gap that remains is to understand how current institutional practices shape the types of knowledge that are considered in AM policy development, and how this in turn makes visible different risks and benefits. In this study, we use a politics of knowledge lens applied to the case of British Columbia, Canada, where AM policy is currently in place, to examine the types of knowledge informing AM thus far, and how that knowledge shapes perceived AM risks and ways of addressing them. Based on 27 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with key government employees and forest industry professionals involved with the development and implementation of AM, we find an overall optimistic view of AM. However, the type of knowledge deemed credible to inform AM decision-making is restricted to biophysical, model-based, scientific knowledge. This primarily biophysical framing of AM arises from the objectives and worldviews of actors working in the AM space and gives rise to relatively narrow ways of understanding potential AM risks and solutions to them. While policymakers and government scientists recognize the need to engage industry, Indigenous Peoples, and the general public, these groups are seen as knowledge receivers. We argue that these beliefs about what counts as credible expertise (and who can produce it) have served to exclude other knowledge forms from being considered in decision-making, and in so doing, have limited possibilities for generating transformative change.","[Pelai, Ricardo; Hagerman, Shannon M.; Kozak, Robert] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Pelai, R (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",ricardo.pelai@alumni.ubc.ca; Shannon.hagerman@ubc.ca; rob.kozak@ubc.ca,,"Pelai, Ricardo/0000-0002-1724-0655",CoAdapTree project; Genome Canada [241REF]; Genome BC,CoAdapTree project; Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Genome BC,"The authors acknowledge the participation of the 27 interviewees who generously provided valuable insights and their time.

Some reports have shown that root growth in grain crops is mostly stimulated in the topsoil rather than evenly throughout the soil profile by e[CO2], which is not optimal for crops grown in semi-arid environments with strong reliance on stored water. An experiment was conducted during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons with two lentil (Lens culinaris) genotypes grown under Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) in which root growth was observed non-destructively with mini-rhizotrons approximately every 2-3 weeks. Root growth was not always statistically increased by e[CO2] and not consistently between depths and genotypes. In 2014, root growth in the top 15 cm of the soil profile (topsoil) was indeed increased by e[CO2], but increases at lower depths (30-45 cm) later in the season were greater than in the topsoil. In 2015, e[CO2] only increased root length in the topsoil for one genotype, potentially reflecting the lack of plant available soil water between 30-60 cm until recharged by irrigation during grain filling. Our limited data to compare responses to e[CO2] showed that root length increases in the topsoil were correlated with a lower yield response to e[CO2].

However, many households depend on basic farming activities to meet household food needs. The objective of this study was to describe the current status and scope of kitchen gardening for improving the food security situation in the Morogoro and Dodoma regions of Tanzania. A cluster sampling method was used to select 383 households. The main respondents were mothers or caregivers responsible for food preparation. Techniques for data collection were observations, focus group discussions and face to face interviews. A small proportion (2.6%) of residents in the semi-arid Dodoma region had a kitchen garden as compared to the sub-humid Morogoro region (9.9%). Sweet potato leaves, cassava leaves, pumpkin leaves, cowpea leaves and African egg plant were the principal vegetables grown in the two areas. The market provided vegetables to 87% of the surveyed households. Vegetables sold at the market were mostly in the dried form, fresh vegetables in the market being those cultivated near ponds, especially during dry seasons. About 90% and 55% of the kitchen garden produce was used for home consumption in Dodoma and Morogoro, respectively. Women contributed 80% and 75%of the total labor for managing kitchen gardens in Dodoma and Morogoro, respectively. Socio-cultural factors (food habit and demand and supply of food materials), environmental factors (climatic factors, water availability), types of soils and farmers' local knowledge and understanding (traditional knowledge and practices, formal and non-formal education) were the key determinants of vegetables grown in the traditional kitchen garden.

This study assessed commercial livestock and game farmers' knowledge and perceptions of climate variability and change in the semiarid Great Fish River Valley, South Africa, and their coping responses to a severe regional drought in 2009/2010. Detailed questionnaires revealed that farmers' knowledge of global climate change was incomplete, suggesting that measures are needed to increase their understanding and awareness of likely impacts. Farmers were able to articulate a consistent story regarding how they believed local climate to have changed and most had implemented a variety of coping strategies in order to endure the drought. Some of these strategies were seen to have the potential to become longer-term adaptive practices. Farmers were, on the whole, open to considering new approaches and land uses such as carbon farming with Portulacaria afra (spekboom) to help them adapt to a more uncertain future.","[Clarke, C.

Given the specter of accelerating climate change, it is especially critical to understand how human harvesters may respond to environmental perturbation. In this study, we identify characteristics that promoted resilience of one the most valuable fisheries on the west coast of the United States to a record marine heatwave. Using movement telemetry linked to Dungeness crab fishery landings records from more than 500 fishing vessels, encompassing 2.2 million geolocations and more than USD two billion in revenue, we found that commercial fishing vessels employed two, non-mutually exclusive strategies to cope with the anomalous environmental and management conditions imposed by the heatwave: increasing spatial mobility and diversifying fishery participation. The combination of these strategies appeared to be the most adaptive, as it produced the greatest increase in Dungeness crab profits. In contrast, participants that specialized in a single fishery and concentrated fishing effort in small spatial areas did not perform as well. Our data-driven approach reveals behaviors that can be promoted to improve the adaptive capacity of human harvesters in an era of unprecedented environmental perturbation.","[Liu, Owen R.; Feist, Blake E.; Samhouri, Jameal F.] NOOA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Fisher, Mary] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Fisher, Mary] NOAA, NSF Grad Res Internship Program, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Abrahms, Briana] Univ Washington, Ctr Ecosyst Sentinels, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Richerson, Kate] NOAA, Fishery Resource Analyis & Monitoring Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Newport, OR 97365 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Liu, OR (corresponding author), NOOA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",owen.liu@noaa.gov,,,NSF?s Graduate Research Fellowship Program;  [DGE-612 1762114],NSF?s Graduate Research Fellowship Program; ,The authors thank D.

Finding ways to fund and finance the redesign, retrofit, and adaptation of the built environment, however, presents a major obstacle in an environment of municipal fiscal austerity. In this paper, we examine how municipalities are adopting different fee structures and financial tools to pay for stormwater abatement through green and gray infrastructure and improve their capacity to deal with the impacts of climate change. Drawing on a survey of 233 municipalities and interviews with municipal leaders, we show that transitioning towards green infrastructure in municipal stormwater and climate change planning is a broad goal among most respondents, but stormwater fee systems are typically not sufficient for meeting regulatory mandates as well as the operation and maintenance costs needed to replace or repair urban water infrastructure. This shortfall has led many municipalities to use a host of other financial tools, such as credit and mitigation banking and social impact and green bonds. We suggest this shift has important implications for achieving sustainability and ensuring just transitions.","[Cousins, Joshua J.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Studies, 106 Marshall Hall, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Hill, Dustin T.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Grad Program Environm Sci, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry,"Cousins, JJ (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Studies, 106 Marshall Hall, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",jcousins@esf.edu,"Hill, Dustin/HOF-9389-2023; Hill, Dustin/AFO-8242-2022","Hill, Dustin/0000-0002-4073-6093; Cousins, Joshua/0000-0003-1835-6024",,,,,88,7,7,7,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-908X,1522-7200,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

These changes have exacerbated the effects of extreme climatic events such as flooding because of constrained water infiltration and increased surface flow. Typical runoff control measures involve sophisticated gray infrastructure that guide excess surface flow into storage and disposal sites. In a dynamic climate system, these measures are not sustainable since they cannot be easily modified to accommodate large volumes of runoff. Green Infrastructure (GI) is an adaptable technique that can be used to minimize runoff, in addition to offering an array of additional benefits (urban heat regulation, aesthetics, improved air quality etc.). Strategic placement of GI is key to achieving maximum utility. While physical site characteristics play a major role in determining suitable GI placement sites, knowledge of future precipitation patterns is crucial to ensure successful flood mitigation. In this paper, suitable GI sites within the city of Knoxville, Tennessee, were determined based on potential impact of an extreme flood event as indicated by site characteristics. Then, the relative potential likelihood of a flood event was determined based on projected precipitation data and knowledge of existing flood zones. By combining potential impact with likelihood information, low, medium, and high priority GI implementation sites were established. Results indicate that high priority sites are in the central parts of the city with priority decreasing outward. The GI prioritization scheme presented here, offers valuable guidance to city planners and policy makers who wish to exploit the GI approach for flood mitigation.","[Omitaomu, Olufemi A.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Computat Sci & Engn Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA; [Kotikot, Susan M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Parish, Esther S.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Omitaomu, OA (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Computat Sci & Engn Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA.",omitaomuoa@ornl.gov,,,U.S. Government for Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) [7451]; US Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-000R22725]; DOE Public Access Plan,U.S. Government for Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD); US Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Public Access Plan,"The authors thank Linda Sylvester, Thomaz Calvahaes, Michele Thorton, Rui Mei and Parul Kaushal for their help with some of the data.

Seasonal workers, one of the most vulnerable groups in the agricultural sector, have received scant attention. Nonetheless, several governments are already planning action to ensure the adaptation of seasonal workers to a changed climate. This article focuses on two recent social and climate change policies adopted by the Turkish government targeting seasonal workers. Based on a discourse analysis of the two policies and fieldwork carried out on a site of intervention, the article argues that such policies, although employed in the name of adaptation, are in fact biopolitical interventions. Their main purpose is to secure the uninterrupted circulation of commodities and workers rather than reduce root causes of vulnerability. As a result the responsibility to adapt is individualized. We contribute to an incipient literature on biopolitics and climate change by showing how the spectre of climate change and the pretext of adaptation serve to expand the state's control of populations rather than reduce core vulnerabilities.

A survey of 1080 herder households was conducted in six rangeland regions of Inner Mongolia in northern China to investigate relationships between herder's perceptions and actual climate change. Across all six regions, more than 90% of herders perceived a decline in precipitation in the past 30 years, whereas actual data showed no significant change. Many herders also perceived an increase in temperature, which was in agreement with the temperature data, although the proportion of herders who perceived a change in temperature differed among regions. A further survey of 58 households was conducted to better understand the reasons for these differences, by simultaneously surveying their perceptions of the changes in both rainfall and rangeland condition. The results showed that the herders' perceptions of a decrease in rainfall could be influenced by their perceptions of the changes in the condition of their rangeland (reductions in production). An alternative explanation could relate to rainfall being interpreted in terms of the frequency and pattern rather than the absolute amounts. These findings have important implications for understanding how herders' perceptions can improve their adaptive behavioural responses to climate change.","[Li, Xiliang; Wang, Zhen; Hou, Xiangyang; Liu, Zhiying; Sarula; Yin, Yanting; Ding, Yong; Hu, Jing] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Grassland Res, Hohhot 010010, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Grassland Research, CAAS","Hou, XY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Grassland Res, Hohhot 010010, Peoples R China.",houxy16@126.com,,,National Key Basic Research Program of China [2014CB138802]; Natural Science Foundation of China [70933004],National Key Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their constructive reviews of the submitted manuscript; Dr Frank Yonghong Li for comments, suggestions and editing on this manuscript.

However, different land-use sectors compete for resources and incentives within and across geopolitical regions, resulting in divergent goals and inefficient prioritization of CO2 removal efforts. Thus, a unifying framework is needed to accelerate basic research and coordinated interventions to accelerate climate change mitigation. Scope We propose a generalizable framework for Enhanced Natural Climate Solutions (NCS +), which we define as activities that can be coordinated to increase carbon drawdown and permanence on land while improving livelihoods and the provision of natural resources in vulnerable communities and ecosystems. The framework builds on interdisciplinary scientific convergence, including critical socioecological interactions, to inform both top-down policy incentives and bottom-up adoption by industries and managers. To achieve this goal, we suggest a multi-tiered approach for the prioritization of projects at local to regional scales that would simultaneously accelerate scientific discovery and broad implementation of CO2 removal projects. Conclusions Our vision leverages input from hundreds of researchers and land managers, including social and environmental scientists as well as representatives from tribal governments, state, and federal agencies in the Pacific Northwest of the USA, as a model system. Five guiding principles orient the framework which would be applicable in any region. As evidence of feasibility, we provide a synthesis of interdisciplinary studies that illustrate how coordinated action, with explicit consideration of system-specific technical and socioecological limitations, can lead to scalable projects with multiple co-benefits. Using theory as a linchpin for innovation, we propose that NCS + could better align climate change mitigation, adaptation, and justice goals at multiple scales.","[Silva, Lucas C.

Consequently, the devastating impacts of urban flooding have increased recently, further augmented by the changing climatic patterns resulting in more frequent flooding. However, to effectively enhance resilience at the community level, it is essential first to understand its components and indicators. This study proposed and tested a methodology to assess community resilience against urban flooding - 57 indicators of resilience were identified, which were classified into six domains, namely social, economic, infrastructural, institutional, natural, and psychological. The data was collected through a questionnaire survey in three com-munities of Rawalpindi, Sialkot, and Muzaffargarh cities in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The data of resilience indicators were standardized, and an index-based approach was used to assess the community resil-ience in the six domains. The relative importance of each domain was evaluated through input from field experts translated into weights through the analytic hierarchy process method. Thereafter, overall community resilience was constructed, and statistical methods were employed to compare resilience and its domains. A significant difference in resilience was observed among the selected communities.

For this purpose, a variety of indices concerning thermal vulnerability assessment were reviewed, and finally, 15 indices were selected. In addition, adaptation policies for climate change applied to Korean cities were synthesized and examined to establish policies for improving thermal environments which correspond to 15 indices. Finally, a framework consisting of five areas (improvement of the atmospheric environment, expansion of eco-friendly buildings, management of the surface, cool spot creation and revitalization of communities), 15 indices and 25 policies was proposed. As a result, 15 vulnerability maps based on the standardized indices and a comprehensive map with four classes were established for Daegu Metropolitan City in South Korea. Based on the maps, Guji-myeon and Ansim-1-dong were found to be the most vulnerable areas. Hence, the causes of the thermal environment vulnerability and the policies for improving urban thermal environment were analyzed in these two areas using the proposed framework. Guji-myeon was necessary to more actively implement policies regarding the improvement of the atmospheric environment, management of the surface, and revitalization of communities. To improve the thermal environment of Ansim-1-dong, active policy implementation was required in all five areas. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the effective establishment of thermal environment policies by policy-makers.","[Eum, Jeong-Hee] Keimyung Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea; [Kim, Kwon] Keimyung Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Architecture, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea; [Jung, Eung-Ho; Rho, Paikho] Keimyung Univ, Dept Environm Planning, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea",Keimyung University; Keimyung University; Keimyung University,"Eum, JH (corresponding author), Keimyung Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea.",eumjh99@kmu.ac.kr; kimkwon258@gmail.com; turep21@kmu.ac.kr; wildlife@kmu.ac.kr,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Kim, Kwon/0000-0001-7491-3695",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) [2015R1C1A2A01052513]; Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) [18AUDP-B102560-04],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA)(Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA)),This study was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF; Grant No. 2015R1C1A2A01052513) and Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA; Grant No. 18AUDP-B102560-04).,,65,3,3,3,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2018,10,4,,,,,,,1179,10.3390/su10041179,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10041179,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ3IY,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000435188000283,View Full Record in Web of Science

The first is to illustrate the role that urban gardening can play in building city resilience to various negative impacts caused by changes in the economic and social spheres, as well as their connection to global warming. The second goal is to investigate whether Polish cities use urban gardening to strengthen the resilience of socio-economic systems to climate change. Based on literature studies, experiences and contemporary trends in urban gardening in different countries were presented as a key factor for improving the resilience of cities. Some initia-tives and projects were described based on dedicated websites. To formulate recommendations for Polish cities, the results of the Let's Feel the Climate project, under which 44 urban adaptation plans were developed, were subjected to critical analysis. Worldwide, the usage of urban gardening to strengthen cities' resilience to climate change is becoming more and more common.

Of these, the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) is cultivated on a widespread scale and is the most popular legume. No doubt for historic, sociological and agricultural reasons common beans grown in Haiti are extremely heterogeneous as regards growth habit, seed size and color, but have in common earliness and indifference to photoperiodicity. Haitian farmers grow mixtures of large beans (produced by dwarf plants), and medium-sized or small beans (produced by plants with indeterminate growth) for seed input saving, and to ensure yield regularity. From beans bought in the markets, or from superior plants chosen in the fields several hundred lines were extracted, 50 of which were preserved after severe elimination had been carried out in Guadeloupe (FWI) for powdery mildew susceptibility at the seedling stage or in southern France for summer heat or common mosaic susceptibility. The principal common bean categories grown in Haiti and the best lines found in each category are described: - large kidney-shaped beans (most of them mottled red) produced by dwarf plants (4 lines are described); - large ovoid beans (most of them mottled red) produced by dwarf plants (1 line described); - medium-sized black beans, produced by plants with indeterminate growth (4 lines described); - small-sized beans of various colors, produced by plants with indeterminate growth (4 lines described); - small-sized uniform red beans produced by plants which become climbing under good fertilization (one line described). Crosses were made in order to obtain still better lines for use in Haiti (and other countries), with tolerance to leaf diseases (such as powdery mildew, rust, and Isariopsis, Chaetoseptoria, Cercospora and Entyloma leaf spots), which in Haiti could result in a yield of 1 t/ha instead of 0. 5, with 0.30.30 fertilization, but without fungicide sprays. The general objective was to propose to the farmers a superior mixture' of the best lines. The programs were as follows: large mottled red-kidney-shaped beans; black beans; small pink or red-mottled beans (the best lines obtained, such as Salagnac 90 for the first program, have been described). A fourth program aimed at obtaining fresh shell-beans for the FWI: red beans, red or red-striated pods (dwarf or climbing lines following the use in various seasons). Most of these breeding programs involved breeding generations alternated between different climates: Haiti/southern France, Haiti/Guadeloupe, or Haiti/southern France/Guadeloupe. As a consequence of the earliness and day-neutral behaviour of the germplasm used and also possibly the alternated generations system utilized the lines resulting from these programs show a wide climatic adaptation. Good results were obtained in some parts of Africa (the highlands of Comoro and the Reunion islands; Burkina-Faso), and southern France where most of them are easily grown and have a satisfactory yield.",,,"MESSIAEN, CM (corresponding author), ECOLE NATL SUPER AGRON MONTPELLIER,INRA,UNITE FORMAT & RECH BIOL VEGETALE,2 PL VIALA,F-34060 MONTPELLIER 1,FRANCE.",,,,,,,,0,2,2,0,7,EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES ELSEVIER,PARIS CEDEX 15,"141 RUE JAVEL, 75747 PARIS CEDEX 15, FRANCE",0249-5627,,,AGRONOMIE,Agronomie,,1992,12,7,,,,,503,513,,10.1051/agro:19920702,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/agro:19920702,,,11,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,JR036,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2023-03-25,WOS:A1992JR03600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This requires national level planning, monitoring and reporting and methods for effective global-scale adaptation tracking. However, unlike mitigation, where clear targets and goals have been agreed, adaptation is a process with varied and changing goals and risk context. Assessing adaptation plans and strategies can provide valuable insights into ongoing adaptation policy, because the plans give good indications of priorities and institutional thinking. To assess how adaptation planning aligns to the Paris Agreement, this paper used Article 7 of the agreement to develop criteria and applied these to assess national adaptation plans and strategies available in English from 36 least developed, 8 developing and 10 developed countries. The results suggest that adaptation planning aligned to the Paris Agreement can help bring a different focus to development pathways that promotes synergies rather than trade-offs between environmental, social and economic goals. Importantly, tracking adaptation planning can help ensure the continued mobilisation of the parties, guide adaptation planning nationally and locally, and support global-scale consistency in planning and action.","[Morgan, Edward A.; Nalau, Johanna; Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast Campus,Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Morgan, Edward A.] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Nalau, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Griffith Inst Tourism, Gold Coast Campus,Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Morgan, EA (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast Campus,Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.;Morgan, EA (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",ed.morgan@griffith.edu.au,"Mackey, Brendan/ABE-3805-2020; Nalau, Johanna/V-5692-2018; Morgan, Edward/AAX-2372-2020","Nalau, Johanna/0000-0001-6581-3967; Morgan, Edward/0000-0002-9239-4320; Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064",,,,,55,22,22,6,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Climate change is exacerbating the threats to food security in such areas, emphasizing the need to increase food production in northern European countries such as the UK. However, the crops must be grown in such a way as to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with their production. As an example, it is estimated that production of UK winter oilseed rape is associated with GHG of 3300 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1) of crop and 834 kg CO2 eq. t(-1) of seed yield, with 79 per cent of the GHG associated with the use of nitrogen fertilizer. Furthermore, it is estimated that control of diseases by use of fungicides in this UK oilseed rape is associated with a decrease in GHG of 100 kg CO2 eq. t(-1) of seed. Winter oilseed rape cultivar disease resistance is associated with a decrease in GHG of 56 kg CO2 eq. t(-1), although this figure is an underestimate. These results demonstrate how disease control in arable crops can make a contribution to both climate change mitigation and sustainable arable crop production to ensure global food security.","[Mahmuti, M.; West, J.

This paper analyzes this issue in the case of Seville (Spain). We identify historical and recent institutional practices related to the development of gray infrastructure and the experience of citizens' movements that demand the implementation of green infrastructure and the naturalization of urban space. Based on the theoretical framework of the sustainability transition, the article contributes to the identification of the factors that hinder or trigger the processes of change, drawing from the results of a case with a long tradition in hydro-climatic disaster management. The research has included an in-depth review of risk planning in the city of Seville, semi-structured interviews with 24 social and institutional actors, and participant observation of both urban planning processes and the practices of citizen movements.

Knowledge on where, when and how much to invest to ensure functioning is of crucial importance for asset owners and operators. This requires asset management approaches that are adaptable, respond to feedback and function within various contexts. The FAIR (Flood defense infrastructure Asset management & Investment in Renovation, adaptation, optimisation and maintenance) project has developed a unique framework to ensure that asset management processes are adaptive, comprehensive and make effective connections across strategic, tactical and operational contexts. The framework has for the first time informed an assessment of maturity of five flood protection asset management organisations in the North Sea Region, using a seven-factor maturity assessment model. This paper describes the self-assessment process and the self-reported maturity changes during the project.

Cross-sectional data from the 2015 Households and the Environment Survey (HES) were used. Prevalence was calculated by province and each pro-environmental behavior. Observed/expected prevalence ratios were computed to assess clustering patterns and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the pairwise associations. Among 8816 Canadian households, prevalence of engaging in pro-environmental behaviors ranked as the following: engaging in green consumer behavior (88%), composting food/yard waste (84%), being active outdoors (82%), gardening (72%), and recycling electronics (45%). While only 14% engaged in <= 2 pro-environmental behaviors, 25.1% of Canadians engaged in all pro-environmental behaviors. By province, British Columbia was the greenest province (81%), followed by Ontario (77%) and Nova Scotia (76.9%) while the least green provinces were Newfoundland and Labrador (62.9%), Saskatchewan (69.2%), and New Brunswick (68%). The most apparent clustering of behaviors was found between recycling electronics and gardening (Observed/Expected: 3.65, 95% CI: 1.98-5.32). Pairwise associations between any two pro-environmental behaviors were statistically significant for all possible combinations (Odds ratios ranged 1.23-2.24). Prevalence of engaging in different sets of pro-environmental behaviors varied greatly by province. Sub-optimal clustering of pro-environmental behaviors and varying pairwise synergetic associations were observed in Canadian households. To promote more holistic, sustainable lifestyles and create sociocultural environments that are conducive to the environment in the era of climate change, future work should investigate barriers and opportunities in adopting more pro-environmental behaviors in Canadian households.","[Lee, Eun-Young] Queens Univ, Sch Kinesiol & Hlth Studies, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Lee, Eun-Young] Queens Univ, Dept Gender Studies, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Khan, Asaduzzaman] Univ Queensland, Sch Hlth & Rehabil Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada; University of Queensland,"Lee, EY (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Sch Kinesiol & Hlth Studies, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.;Lee, EY (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Gender Studies, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",eunyoung.lee@queensu.ca; a.khan2@uq.edu.au,"Khan, Asad/HNR-9080-2023; Khan, Asad/F-8739-2010","Khan, Asad/0000-0003-4188-2065; Lee, Eun-Young/0000-0001-9580-8974","Queen's University, Office of Vice-Principal Research, Queen's Research Opportunity Fund (QROF), Catalyst Fund [6028922]","Queen's University, Office of Vice-Principal Research, Queen's Research Opportunity Fund (QROF), Catalyst Fund","This research was funded by Queen's University, Office of Vice-Principal Research, Queen's Research Opportunity Fund (QROF), Catalyst Fund grant number 6028922.",,38,2,2,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2020,12,19,,,,,,,8218,10.3390/su12198218,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12198218,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ON4VQ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000586700900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The traditional approach of determining set-back lines is likely to be conservative, and thus pose unnecessary constraints on coastal zone development and fully utilising the potential of these high-return areas. In this study, we apply a newly developed risk-informed approach to determine the coastal set-back line at regional scale in a poor data environment. This approach aims to find the economic optimum by balancing the (potential) economic gain from investing in coastal zones and the risk of coastal retreat due to sea level rise and storm erosion. This application focusses on the east coast of Sri Lanka, which is experiencing rapid economic growth on one hand and severe beach erosion on the other hand. This area of Sri Lanka is a highly data-poor environment, and the data is mostly available from global databases and very limited measurement campaigns. Probabilistic estimates of coastline retreat are obtained from the application of Probabilistic Coastline Recession (PCR) framework. Economic data, such as the discount rate, rate of return of investment, cost of damage, etc., are collated from existing estimates/reports for the area. The main outcome of this study is a series of maps indicating the economically optimal set-back line (EOSL) for the similar to 200-km-long coastal region. The EOSL is established for the year 2025 to provide a stable basis for land-use planning decisions over the next two decades or so. The EOSLs thus determined range between 12 m and 175 m from the coastline. Sensitivity analyses show that strong variations in key economic parameters such as the discount rate have a disproportionately small impact on the EOSL.","[Dastgheib, Ali; Ranasinghe, Roshanka] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Water Sci & Engn, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands; [Jongejan, Ruben] Jongejan Risk Management Consulting, Schoolstr 4, NL-2611 HS Delft, Netherlands; [Wickramanayake, Mangala] Coast Conservat & Coastal Resource Management Dep, 4th Floor,New Secretariat Bldg, Maligawatte 01000, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka] Deltares, Harbour Coastal & Offshore Engn, POB 177, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka] Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Deltares; University of Twente,"Dastgheib, A (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Water Sci & Engn, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands.",a.dastgheib@un-ihe.org; ruben.jongejan@jongejanrmc.com; mangalawk@gmail.com; r.ranasinghe@un-ihe.org,"Ranasinghe, Roshanka/C-6711-2009; Dastgheib, Ali/M-8982-2013","Ranasinghe, Roshanka/0000-0001-6234-2063; Dastgheib, Ali/0000-0002-5914-7213; Jongejan, Ruben/0000-0003-3578-2666",ADB-IHE Delft knowledge partnership; AXA Research Fund; Deltares Strategic Research Programme 'Coastal and Offshore Engineering'; research budget of the CCCRM RD section; CCCRM RD section,ADB-IHE Delft knowledge partnership; AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Deltares Strategic Research Programme 'Coastal and Offshore Engineering'; research budget of the CCCRM RD section; CCCRM RD section,"This study is mainly funded by ADB-IHE Delft knowledge partnership.

However, restricting urban outdoor water use to support watershed-scale drought resilience may generate unanticipated cross-scale interactions, for example, by altering drought response and recovery in urban vegetation or urban streamflow. Despite this, urban water conservation is rarely conceptualized or modeled as endogenous to the water cycle. Here we investigate cross-scale interactions among urban water conservation and water availability, water use, and sociohydrological response in Austin, TX (USA) during a recent anthropogenic (human-influenced) drought. Multiscalar statistical analyses demonstrated that outdoor water conservation for reservoir management at the municipal scale produced responses that can cascade both upward from the city to the watershed (e.g., decoupling streamflow patterns upstream and downstream of Austin at the watershed scale) and downward to exert heterogeneous effects within the city (e.g., redistributing water along a socioeconomic gradient at submunicipal scales, with effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems). We suggest that adapting to anthropogenic drought through irrigation curtailment requires sustained engagement between hydrology and social sciences to integrate socioeconomic status and political feedbacks within and among irrigator groups into the water cycle. Findings from this cross-disciplinary study highlight the importance of a multiscalar and spatially explicit perspectives in urban sociohydrology research to uncover how water conservation as adaptation to anthropogenic drought links hydrological processes with issues of socioeconomic inequality and spatiotemporal scale in the Anthropocene.","[Breyer, Betsy] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Nat Hist Bldg, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Zipper, Samuel C.] McGill Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Zipper, Samuel C.] Univ Victoria, Dept Civil Engn, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Qiu, Jiangxiao] Univ Florida, Ft Lauderdale Res & Educ Ctr, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; McGill University; University of Victoria; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Breyer, B (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Nat Hist Bldg, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",breyer3@illinois.edu,"Zipper, Sam/B-8667-2013; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Zipper, Sam/0000-0002-8735-5757; Breyer, Betsy/0000-0001-6355-1203",National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC); Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1052875] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This work was supported by a Graduate Student Research Pursuit from the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC); we particularly acknowledge support from Jon Kramer at SESYNC.

The record of adaptation in the field of freshwater governance is poor to date, as it is apparently constrained by operational frameworks. Analyses based on the Contemporary Theory of Metaphor can reveal underlying, often institutionally reified, operational frameworks. We present a desktop metaphor mapping study of one UK and one Australian water management planning document. This mapping demonstrates the potential of metaphor analysis, with further methodological and praxis development, to support the new ways of thinking and acting that are needed to challenge deeply held social and cultural norms of linear, rather than systemic, causality. We suggest that metaphor has the potential to help practitioners expose and examine reified operational frameworks and practices, and to change those that hinder adaptive and systemic praxis.","[Ison, Ray; Collins, Kevin] Open Univ, Fac Math Comp & Technol, Engn & Innovat Dept, Appl Syst Thinking Practice ASTiP Grp, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Allan, Catherine] Charles Sturt Univ, Environm Sociol & Planning, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia",Open University - UK; Charles Sturt University,"Ison, R (corresponding author), Open Univ, Fac Math Comp & Technol, Engn & Innovat Dept, Appl Syst Thinking Practice ASTiP Grp, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",callan@csu.edu.au,"Allan, Catherine/F-7137-2014","Allan, Catherine/0000-0003-2098-4759; Collins, Kevin/0000-0002-5716-7536",,,,,94,11,11,2,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-774X,1472-3425,,ENVIRON PLANN C,Environ.

Lack of thermal comfort hampers outdoor activities. It is imperative to combat these phenomena to bring life back to the streets and make spaces frequently used in the past more appealing to local citizens.

For that, microclimate control based on natural cooling techniques is proposed to recover the habitability of these spaces of the cities. These techniques are characterised via experiments. Demostrando como es posible conseguir and integrated using simulation tools. Following this methodology, it is possible to design, size and define operation strategies for the ideal climate control system according to the type of need. This paper addresses a degraded and unused real space as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of the methodology used. A system has been designed that stores water cooled at night by using the sky and night air and uses it during the day to produce cold air and cool cover. The experimental results test the efficiency of each solution that has been integrated into the complete system. The system operates every technology to keep the temperature radiant and the air of the occupants cool. For it, falling-film technology cools every night a volume of water below 18 degrees C and dissipation in a water pond by water sprinkler maintains a pond 10-15 degrees C below the outside air temperature. Also, results test how it is possible to guarantee thermal comfort conditions (operative temperature below of 28 degrees C) even when the environment surrounding the conditioned volume is at temperatures above 40 degrees C, and how the seismic allows maintaining these conditions during the worst summer hours. In conclusion, microclimate control allows for mitigating the severity of the outdoor climate to reach a degree of thermal comfort equivalent to that in enclosed venues.","[Castro Medina, Daniel; Guerrero Delgado, MCarmen; Palomo Amores, Teresa Rocio; Sanchez Ramos, Jose; Alvarez Dominguez, Servando] Univ Seville, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Grp Termotecnia, Camino Los Descubrimientos S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Toulou, Aurore] Inst Natl Sci Appl INSA, Dept Civil Engn & Urban, F-69100 Lyon, France",University of Sevilla,"Ramos, JS (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Grp Termotecnia, Camino Los Descubrimientos S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",jsr@us.es,"; Sanchez Ramos, Jose/G-1941-2010","Palomo Amores, Teresa Rocio/0000-0003-4513-9826; Sanchez Ramos, Jose/0000-0001-8958-7247; Alvarez Dominguez, Servando/0000-0003-0712-8755; Toulou, Aurore/0000-0003-4658-2715; Castro Medina, Daniel/0000-0003-0045-7935","Projects LIFEWATERCOOL-Water Efficient Systemic Concept for the Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas by European Commission [LIFE18 CCA/ES/001122]; Project Recovery open spaces in Andalusia by the integration of natural sinks in innovative nature-based solutions by Andalusian Government (Consejeria de Fomento, Infraestructuras y Ordenacion del Territorio) [US.20-15]; European Regional Development Funds (ERDF)","Projects LIFEWATERCOOL-Water Efficient Systemic Concept for the Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas by European Commission; Project Recovery open spaces in Andalusia by the integration of natural sinks in innovative nature-based solutions by Andalusian Government (Consejeria de Fomento, Infraestructuras y Ordenacion del Territorio); European Regional Development Funds (ERDF)(European Commission)","This study has been funded by the projects LIFEWATERCOOL-Water Efficient Systemic Concept for the Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas by European Commission (Grant Agreement LIFE18 CCA/ES/001122) and the project Recovery open spaces in Andalusia by the integration of natural sinks in innovative nature-based solutions by Andalusian Government (Grant Agreement US.20-15, Consejeria de Fomento, Infraestructuras y Ordenacion del Territorio).

The review identified relevant peer-reviewed publications using ScienceDirect and Scopus databases for original research articles published in English from 2000 to 2022. After applying the eligibility criteria, 25 articles were included in the final review. The themes emerging from the articles were extracted, and a summary was provided to illustrate each theme. The review revealed that weather information studies focus more on the agriculture sector than energy production and water resource management. Users of weather information mainly accessed information related to rainfall and temperature, and the information was accessed mainly through radio, mobile phones, and television. Most of the information provided focused on generic meteorological forecasts instead of tailored impact-based forecasts. Only very few users can access, or benefit from the information produced due to poor communication and technical understanding of weather information. In addition, a lack of downscaled information, logistics, and trust hinders the uptake and use of climate information. Consequently, mainstreaming capacity-building of key stakeholders is required to promote effective adoption and strengthening of climate information services across East and West Africa.","[Agyekum, Thomas Peprah; Antwi-Agyei, Philip] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Agyekum, Thomas Peprah] Univ Ghana, Coll Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biol Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci, Accra, Ghana; [Dougill, Andrew J.] Univ York, Dept Environm & Geog, York, North Yorkshire, England",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Ghana; University of York - UK,"Antwi-Agyei, P (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana.",philiantwi@yahoo.com,,"AGYEKUM, THOMAS PEPRAH/0000-0001-5498-5958","United Kingdom Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, African SWIFT Programme [NE/P021077/1]","United Kingdom Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, African SWIFT Programme","This study was funded by United Kingdom Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, African SWIFT Programme.

Here, we assess the reliability of global within-season and pre-season predictions of yield variability obtained by applying statistical yield models to seasonal temperature and precipitation hindcast data derived from a multi-model ensemble (MME). This analysis is performed for five individual atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation models (GCMs) and the two MME datasets generated using the average method and the mosaic method. Four major crops, maize, rice, wheat and soybean are studied. The mosaic method reliably predicts the yield variability over a large portion (25-38%) of the global harvested area three months before harvesting. The areas where the mosaic method displays good prediction skill are two to three times larger than those achieved using the average method (9-15%). Using the mosaic method, reliable within-season predictions of national yield variability can be produced in 36%, 24%, 25% and 30% of the maize-, soybean, rice- and wheatproducing countries, respectively. The pre-season predictions are found to be reliable in 23-32% of the crop-producing countries. As yield variability at the national level is of interest to commodity and food security specialists, the mosaic method provides a basis for developing an operational global yield forecasting service.","[Iizumi, Toshichika; Kim, Wonsik] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, 3-1-3 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Shin, Yonghee; Kim, Moosup; Choi, Jaewon] APEC Climate Ctr, 12,Centum 7 Ro, Busan 48058, South Korea",National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan,"Iizumi, T (corresponding author), Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, 3-1-3 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan.",iizumit@affrc.go.jp,,"Kim, Moosup/0000-0001-6854-0466; Iizumi, Toshichika/0000-0002-0611-4637","APCC; National Agriculture and Food Research Organization; Korea Meteorological Administration [APCC12-01] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)",APCC; National Agriculture and Food Research Organization; Korea Meteorological Administration(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)),"We acknowledge Kwang-Hyung Kim, Shuhei Maeda, Yasushi Takatsuki, Tosiyuki Nakaegawa and Yuhei Takaya for discussions.

There is considerable interest in the potential of microrefugia to provide climate change resilience to landscapes and to biodiversity conservation. Although attractive conceptually, there is yet little guidance on how to identify climate change microrefugia in order to study and protect them, and the data required to do so are often lacking. This study demonstrates how time series remote sensing, using all available Landsat images of a study area, can be used to directly detect microrefugia maintained by water subsidies in a semi-arid landscape in southwest Western Australia. Microrefugia were identified as pixels with abundant vegetation and consistent vegetation dynamics between wet and dry years. At every pixel, a harmonic model was fit to the intra-annual time series of vegetation index values compiled from the wettest years in the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) archive. This model was then used to predict the phenological cycle of the driest years at that pixel. Candidate microrefugia were defined to be those pixels with (1) high vegetation activity in dry years and (2) highly predictable phenologies that are consistent regardless of the weather conditions experienced in a given year. Spatial relationships between candidate microrefugia and landscape features associated with elevated moisture availability (thought to drive climate microrefugia in these semi-arid landscapes) were assessed. The candidate microrefugia show great promise. Evaluations against high-resolution imagery reveal that candidate microrefugia most likely buffer against drought, although refugia from other disturbances, especially fire, were also detected. In contrast, spatial proxies of the physical features expected to maintain microrefugia failed to adequately represent the distribution of microrefugia across the landscape, likely due to data quality and the heterogeneity of microrefugia. Direct detection of microrefugia with Earth observation data is a promising solution in data limited regions. Landsat time series analyses are well suited to this application as they can characterize both the habitat quality and stability aspects of microrefugia.","[Andrew, Margaret E.; Warrener, Haylea] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Environm & Conservat Sci, Murdoch, WA, Australia",Murdoch University,"Andrew, ME (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",m.andrew@murdoch.edu.au,,"Andrew, Margaret/0000-0003-3285-3684",Gunduwa Regional Conservation Association,Gunduwa Regional Conservation Association,"This research was funded by a Gunduwa Regional Conservation Association grant to Conservation Council of Western Australia Citizen Science Program and MEA, 'Do climate refugia exist on the conservation stations?'

Such extreme events are expected to be exacerbated in the near future by climate change. A potentially simple and cost-effective mitigation measure against drought periods is sand dams. This little-known technology aims to promote subsoil rainwater storage to support dryland agro-ecosystems. To date, there is little long-term empirical analysis that tests the effectiveness of this approach during droughts. This study addresses this shortcoming by utilising multi-year satellite imagery to monitor the effect of droughts at sand dam locations. A time series of satellite images was analysed to compare vegetation at sand dam sites and control sites over selected periods of drought, using the normalised difference vegetation index. The results show that vegetation biomass was consistently and significantly higher at sand dam sites during periods of extended droughts. It is also shown that vegetation at sand dam sites recovers more quickly from drought. The observed findings corroborate modelling-based research which identified related impacts on ground water, land cover, and socio-economic indicators. Using past periods of drought as an analogue to future climate change conditions, this study indicates that sand dams have potential to increase adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change in drylands. It therefore can be concluded that sand dams enhance the resilience of marginal environments and increase the adaptive capacity of drylands. Sand dams can therefore be a promising adaptation response to the impacts of future climate change on drylands.","[Ryan, Catherine; Elsner, Paul] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Geog Environm & Dev Studies, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Ryan, Catherine] 21 Belvedere Court, London N1 5SL, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Ryan, C (corresponding author), Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Geog Environm & Dev Studies, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.;Ryan, C (corresponding author), 21 Belvedere Court, London N1 5SL, England.",cate_is@yahoo.com,"Ryan, Cate/GZG-8547-2022","Elsner, Paul/0000-0003-4330-7371",,,,,58,32,34,0,28,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Crop production models can provide helpful information on agricultural yields under a range of climate change scenarios and on the impact of adaptation strategies. Here, we report a systematic review of the impact of climate change on the yield of major staple crops in West Africa. Unlike earlier reviews we pay particular attention to the potential of common agricultural adaptation strategies (such as optimised planting dates, use of fertilisers and climate-resilient crop varieties) to mitigate the effects of climate change on crop yields. We systematically searched two databases for literature published between 2005 and 2020 and identified 35 relevant studies. We analysed yield changes of major staple crops (maize, sorghum, rice, millet, yam, cassava and groundnuts) caused by different climate change and field management scenarios. Yields declined by a median of 6% (-8% to +2% depending on the crop) due to climate change in all scenarios analysed. We show that the common adaptation strategies could increase crop yields affected by climate change by 13% (-4% to +19% depending on the strategy) as compared to business-as-usual field management practices, and that optimised planting dates and cultivars with longer crop cycle duration could in fact offset the negative effects of climate change on crop yields. Increased fertiliser use has not mitigated the impact of climate change on crops but could substantially increase yields now and in the future. Our results suggest that a combination of increased fertiliser use and adopting cropping practices that take advantage of favourable climate conditions have great potential to protect and enhance future crop production in West Africa.","[Carr, Tony W.; Mkuhlani, Siyabusa; Dangour, Alan D.; Green, Rosemary; Scheelbeek, Pauline] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Populat Hlth, London, England; [Mkuhlani, Siyabusa; Dangour, Alan D.; Green, Rosemary; Scheelbeek, Pauline] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Climate Change & Planetary Hlth, London, England; [Mkuhlani, Siyabusa] Int Inst Trop Agr, ICIPE, POB 30772-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Segnon, Alcade C.; Zougmore, Robert] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Bamako, Mali; [Segnon, Alcade C.] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Cotonou, Benin; [Ali, Zakari] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, MRC Unit Gambia, Nutr Theme, Banjul, Gambia",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE); CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); University of Abomey Calavi; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Carr, TW (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Populat Hlth, London, England.",tony.carr@lshtm.ac.uk,"Ali, Zakari/ABB-6962-2020; Segnon, Alcade/L-3908-2016","Ali, Zakari/0000-0002-8129-2230; Segnon, Alcade/0000-0001-9751-120X; Zougmore, Robert/0000-0002-6215-4852; Scheelbeek, Pauline/0000-0002-6209-2284",Wellcome Trust [216021/Z/19/Z],Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust),"This study was developed as part of the Food system Adaptation in Changing Environments in Africa (FACE-Africa) project, a Wellcome Trust funded project (Grant No. 216021/Z/19/Z) under the Wellcome Climate Change and Health Award Scheme.

As a result, climate-sensitive coastal policy instruments are critical for providing adequate adaptation options, including an option to allow coastal features to migrate inland. But the migration of coastal features is under threat due to extensive private armoring. This essay highlights specific regulatory instruments at the federal and state level dealing with hard armoring using Massachusetts as an example. It argues specific federal and state regulations legitimize and incentivize hard armoring over other coastal land use planning methods. The current level of armoring in Massachusetts is highlighted and implications under current federal and state policy frameworks are explained. Suggestions for coastal states planning for sea level rise are discussed, including the need for state planning to take the lead. Recommendations for changes at the federal level are also highlighted.","[McGuire, Chad J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Publ Policy, N Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University Massachusetts Dartmouth,"McGuire, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Publ Policy, N Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA.",cmcguire@umassd.edu,,"McGuire, Chad/0000-0003-2480-4751",,,,,18,2,2,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0892-0753,1521-0421,,COAST MANAGE,Coast.

In addition, perennials reuse significant amounts of biomass each year providing a unique resilience. But they also have a unique sensitivity to seasonal temperatures, requiring a period of dormancy for successful growing season production. This paper takes a global view of five temperate tree fruit crops-apples, cherries, almonds, olives, and grapes-and assesses the effects of future temperature changes on thermal suitability. It uses climate data from five earth system models for two CMIP6 climate scenarios and temperature-related indices of stress to indicate potential future areas where crops cannot be grown and highlight potential new suitable regions. The loss of currently suitable areas and new additions in new locations varies by scenario. In the southern hemisphere (SH), end-century (2081-2100) suitable areas under the SSP 5-8.5 scenario decline by more than 40% compared to a recent historical period (1991-2010). In the northern hemisphere (NH) suitability increases by 20% to almost 60%. With SSP1-2.6, however, the changes are much smaller with SH area declining by about 25% and NH increasing by about 10%. The results suggest substantial restructuring of global production for these crops. Essentially, climate change shifts temperature-suitable locations toward higher latitudes. In the SH, most of the historically suitable areas were already at the southern end of the landmass limiting opportunities for adaptation. If breeding efforts can bring chilling requirements for the major cultivars closer to that currently seen in some cultivars, suitable areas at the end of the century are greater, but higher summer temperatures offset the extent. The high value of fruit crops provides adaptation opportunities such as cultivar selection, canopy cooling using sprinklers, shade netting, and precision irrigation.","[Meza, Francisco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Interdisciplinario Cambio Global, Santiago, Chile; [Darbyshire, Rebecca] CSIRO Agr & Food, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Farrell, Aidan] Dept Life Sci, St Augustine, Trinidad and To; [Lakso, Alan] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Geneva, NY USA; [Lawson, James] Cent Coast Primary Ind Ctr, New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Ourimbah, NSW, Australia; [Meinke, Holger] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Nelson, Gerald] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL USA; [Stockle, Claudio] Washington State Univ, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Pullman, WA USA",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Cornell University; NSW Department of Primary Industries; University of Tasmania; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Washington State University,"Meza, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Interdisciplinario Cambio Global, Santiago, Chile.",fmeza@uc.cl,,"Nelson, Gerald/0000-0003-3626-1221; Darbyshire, Rebecca/0000-0003-4712-8514",FONDECYT [1210526],FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),This work has been carried out with partial support from FONDECYT Grant 1210526 to Francisco Meza.,,86,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

This is important to ensure that CSA strategies are tailored to farmer-specific gender equality goals. Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory-sequential mixed methods research design which is qualitatively biased was applied. Key informant interviews and farmer focus group discussions in two study sites formed initial qualitative phase whose findings were explored in a quantitative cross-sectional household survey. Findings - Findings shared in this paper indicate the predominant application of traditional gender mainstreaming approaches in CSA focusing on parochial gender dichotomy. Qualitative findings highlight perceptions that western gender approaches are not fully applicable to local contexts and realities, with gender mainstreaming in CSA seemingly to fulfil donor requirements, and ignorant of the heterogeneous nature of social groups. Quantitative findings establish that married men are majority adopters and non-adopters of CSA, while dis-adopters are predominantly de jure female household heads. The latter are more likely to adopt CSA than married women whose main role in CSA is implementers of spouse's decisions. Access to education, intra-household power relations, productive asset and land ownership are socio-cultural dynamics shaping farmer profiles. Originality/value - By incorporating African feminisms and intersectionality in CSA, value of this study lies in recommending gender policy reforms incorporating local gender contexts within the African socio-cultural milieu. This paper accentuates potential benefits of innovative blend of both contemporary and classic gender mainstreaming approaches in CSA research, practice and technology development in disaster-prone regions.","[Khoza, Sizwile; Van Niekerk, Dewald; Nemakonde, Livhuwani David] North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Khoza, S (corresponding author), North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",sizwilenk@gmail.com,"Nemakonde, Livhuwani/AAE-6439-2020; van Niekerk, Dewald/H-6134-2012; Nemakonde, Livhuwani/AAK-2946-2021","Nemakonde, Livhuwani/0000-0002-3458-5575; van Niekerk, Dewald/0000-0002-4571-4205; , Sizwile/0000-0002-7895-7107",Department of Science and Technology-National Research Foundation (DST-NRF) Centre for Excellence in Food Security,Department of Science and Technology-National Research Foundation (DST-NRF) Centre for Excellence in Food Security,"This paper forms part of her PhD research on gendered approaches to disaster risk reduction, with focus on climate-smart agriculture adoption by small-holder farmers in disaster-prone regions.

A crucial role in defining adaptation actions is played by the use of resources, in particular of non-renewable resources such as soil. This paper, based on a sample of recent Italian and European adaptation plans, seeks to investigate the presence of actions aimed at guaranteeing a sustainable use of natural and non-natural soil, in order to minimize the consumption of non-anthropized soil andalso contribute to containing the effects of climate change. The paper is divided into three sections: the first one describes the methodology employed; the second one focuses on the most up-to-date plans regarding the effects of climate change in some urban systems; the third one proposes hints for further reflections and useful recommendations to local decision-makers in the development of tailor-made adaptation actions aimed at guaranteeing an efficient use of both natural and anthropized soil. The reading of the plans has exposed that soil consumption is not among the factors that need direct action to reduce the vulnerability of urban systems to current climate change, but rather it is a phenomenon that can be contained by increasing green areas and/or infrastructures and encouraging agricultural and environmental regeneration. The attention seems to be drawn to not yet sealed soil, thus leaving out the already anthropized one that, as such, would require, instead, greater adaptation efforts.","[Zucaro, Floriana; Morosini, Rosa] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn DICEA, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Zucaro, F (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn DICEA, Naples, Italy.",floriana.zucaro@unina.it; rosa.morosini@unina.it,"Zucaro, Floriana/AAB-8650-2019","Zucaro, Floriana/0000-0003-4171-3659",,,,,58,23,23,2,14,"UNIV STUDI NAPOLI FEDERICO II, DIPT PIANIFICAZIONE & SCIENZA TERRITORIO",NAPLES,"PIAZZALE TECCHIO 80, NAPLES, 80125, ITALY",1970-9889,1970-9870,,TEMA,TeMA,APR,2018,11,1,,,,,7,26,,10.6092/1970-9870/5343,http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/1970-9870/5343,,,20,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,GL8PQ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000437486200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present paper analyzes the value of climate services which are aimed at improving agricultural productivity through a reduction in weather-associated risks. The first part provides a theoretical foundation for estimating the value of climate services based on a stochastic life-cycle model of a rural household which faces uncertainty with respect to the timing and the size of an adverse weather shock. We subsequently calibrate the model to match the environment of coffee producers in the Cusco region of Peru and provide a range of estimates for the value of climate services for a single average household, the region, and the country as a whole. In the second part of the paper we use empirical data to corroborate the numerical estimates. We assess the value of climate services in the agricultural sector in Cusco based on a choice experiment approach. Data are analyzed using a standard as well as a random parameter logit model allowing for preference heterogeneity. Farmers show a significant willingness-to-pay for enhanced climate services which is particularly related to the service accuracy and geographic resolution. On average, the yearly value of a climate service in the coffee sector is found to be $21 per ha and $8.2 million for Peru as a whole. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Many municipalities within the Republic of Korea (ROK) have experienced damage from these events, necessitating countermeasures. Vulnerability assessment has been suggested in the implementation of a national plan for reducing damage resulting from climate change. Thus, in this study, we assess the vulnerability of the ROK and identify key vulnerable municipalities in support of the national adaptation plan. We create a framework for assessing the vulnerability of all 232 municipalities of the ROK with respect to 32 items in 7 fields. The framework regards decision makers' comprehension and availability of data as important factors. We assess the vulnerability index of each municipality by using variables of climate exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation capacity. The weights of variables are determined by the Delphi method. We used the representative concentration pathways 8.5 climate scenario to reflect future climate exposure for the vulnerability assessment. From the analysis, vulnerability maps are prepared for the 32 items of 7 fields, and key vulnerable municipalities are identified by aggregating the maps. The distribution of vulnerable municipalities changes with the future climate conditions. These maps provide a scientific and objective basis for the ROK government to establish adaptation plans and allocate resources. The ROK government can utilize the results to identify the characteristics of highly vulnerable areas, and municipalities can use the results as a basis for requesting support from the national government.","[Kim, Ho Gul; Lee, Dong Kun; Park, Jin Han] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Agr Life Sci, Interdisciplinary Program Landscape Architecture, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Dong Kun; Tanaka, Riwako; Choi, Jinyong] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Dong Kun] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Jung, Huicheul] Korea Environm Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Kil, Sung-Ho] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, College Stn, TX USA; [Park, Chan] Korea Res Inst Human Settlements, Anyang, South Korea; [Seo, Changwan] Natl Inst Ecol, Seocheon Gun, South Korea; [Kim, Ho] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Seoul, South Korea; [Kong, Wooseok] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Geog, Seoul, South Korea; [Oh, Kyusik] Hanyang Univ, Dept Urban Engn, Seoul 133791, South Korea; [Oh, Young-Ju] Korea Biodivers Res Ctr Co Ltd, Pochon, South Korea; [Hwang, Gangseok] Natl Fisheries Res & Dev Inst, Busan, South Korea; [Song, Chang-Keun] Natl Inst Environm Res, Air Qual Forecasting Ctr, Inchon, South Korea","Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Korea Environment Institute (KEI); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; National Institute of Ecology; Seoul National University (SNU); Kyung Hee University; Hanyang University; National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER), Republic of Korea","Lee, DK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Agr Life Sci, Interdisciplinary Program Landscape Architecture, Seoul, South Korea.;Lee, DK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Seoul, South Korea.;Lee, DK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul, South Korea.",dklee7@snu.ac.kr,"박, 진한/V-6913-2019; Kim, Ho/AAS-2402-2021","Kim, Ho/0000-0001-7472-3752","Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment of Local Government for Establishment of Adaptation Plan project (Korea Environment Institute, National Institute Environmental Research); Seoul National University Interdisciplinary Program in Landscape Architecture, a global leadership program toward innovative green infrastructure [2015 BK 21]; Development of Economic Assessment Technique for Climate Change Impact and Adaptation Considering Uncertainties (Korea Ministry of Environment) [2014001310010]; Development of Climate Change Adaptation, Management Techniques, and Supportive System (Korea Ministry of Environment) [416-111-014]; Development of Climate Change Policy Supporting Model for Impact Assessment and Adaptation Planning (Korea Ministry of Environment) [2014001310005]","Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment of Local Government for Establishment of Adaptation Plan project (Korea Environment Institute, National Institute Environmental Research); Seoul National University Interdisciplinary Program in Landscape Architecture, a global leadership program toward innovative green infrastructure; Development of Economic Assessment Technique for Climate Change Impact and Adaptation Considering Uncertainties (Korea Ministry of Environment); Development of Climate Change Adaptation, Management Techniques, and Supportive System (Korea Ministry of Environment); Development of Climate Change Policy Supporting Model for Impact Assessment and Adaptation Planning (Korea Ministry of Environment)","This work was supported by the Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment of Local Government for Establishment of Adaptation Plan project (Korea Environment Institute, National Institute Environmental Research), the 2015 BK 21 Plus Project (Seoul National University Interdisciplinary Program in Landscape Architecture, a global leadership program toward innovative green infrastructure), the Development of Economic Assessment Technique for Climate Change Impact and Adaptation Considering Uncertainties (Korea Ministry of Environment, Project No. 2014001310010), the Development of Climate Change Adaptation, Management Techniques, and Supportive System (Korea Ministry of Environment, Project No. 416-111-014), the Development of Climate Change Policy Supporting Model for Impact Assessment and Adaptation Planning (Korea Ministry of Environment, Project No. 2014001310005).",,37,6,7,5,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

However, their effectiveness has rarely been assessed among their target audience. Given recent calls to increase the usability of climate information through the tailoring of climate projections, it is imperative to assess the effectiveness of different visualizations. This paper explores the complexities of tailoring through an online survey conducted with 162 local adaptation practitioners in Germany and the UK. The survey examined respondents' assessed and perceived comprehension (PC) of visual representations of climate projections as well as preferences for using different visualizations in communicating and planning for a changing climate. Comprehension and use are tested using four different graph formats, which are split into two pairs. Within each pair the information content is the same but is visualized differently. We show that even within a fairly homogeneous user group, such as local adaptation practitioners, there are clear differences in respondents' comprehension of and preference for visualizations. We do not find a consistent association between assessed comprehension and PC or use within the two pairs of visualizations that we analysed. There is, however, a clear link between PC and use of graph format. This suggests that respondents use what they think they understand the best, rather than what they actually understand the best. These findings highlight that audience-specific targeted communication may be more complex and challenging than previously recognized.","[Lorenz, Susanne] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Leeds, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Leeds,"Lorenz, S (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.lorenz@leeds.ac.uk,"Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009; Paavola, Jouni/A-5413-2010; Forster, Piers/F-9829-2010; Lorenz, Susanne/AAH-3755-2020","Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364; Paavola, Jouni/0000-0001-5720-466X; Forster, Piers/0000-0002-6078-0171; Lorenz, Susanne/0000-0002-9124-9690","UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NERCNE/J50001X/1]; European Research Council under European Union's Seventh Framework Programme/ERC grant [284369, 308291]; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) for the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP); EPSRC [EP/I014721/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/I014721/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [1047156] Funding Source: researchfish",UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Research Council under European Union's Seventh Framework Programme/ERC grant; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) for the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),S.L. is funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) (grant number NERCNE/J50001X/1).

Analyzing vulnerability at the household level can help in identifying the threats that households face and potential coping and adaptation approaches, especially in view of the increasing vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. We developed a household-based model for assessing rural household vulnerability in Shigatze Prefecture in Tibet Autonomous Region of China using time series survey data. The assessment took four main aspects of vulnerability into account: the subsistence condition (food supply), development condition (education and income), accessibility of water resources (variability in rainfall), and threat of water disaster (area affected by drought and floods). Rural household vulnerability decreased overall between 1986 and 2012 but with considerable fluctuation over time. Up to 2000, the main drivers of vulnerability were knowledge (basic education), access to sufficient food, and reliable access to water, in that order. After the early 2000s, knowledge (basic education) is also the most important driver, followed by cash income, and again reliable access to water. The increase in importance of education and income is linked to the transformation of focus of rural households from subsistence to sustainable development. The impact of variability in water resources appears to be becoming more important as a result of climate change. The most effective strategies for reducing rural household vulnerability and improving adaptive capacity to climate change are likely to be accelerating the development of education in rural areas, promoting an incremental increase in the income of farmers and herdsmen, constructing rural irrigation infrastructure, and establishing agricultural disaster prevention and mitigation systems.

The Lake Macquarie area is highly vulnerable to sea level rise with local adaptation planning already underway. An in-depth case study is presented that draws upon 19 interviews with key informants and householders and a structured document and media analysis from 12 newspapers. This qualitative data was analysed to identify: the range of understandings of what is just in planning for sea level rise; and key factors that influence perceptions of justice in planned retreat scenarios. The study concludes that there is a need for guiding principles in decision-making that explicitly address social justice in order to realise more equitable outcomes.","[Frost, Lana; Miller, Fiona] Macquarie Univ, Discipline Geog & Planning, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University,"Miller, F (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Sch Social Sci, Fac Arts, Level 4,Bldg B,25 Wallys Walk, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",fiona.miller@mq.edu.au,,"Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4427-6466",Macquarie University Master of Research Scholarship,Macquarie University Master of Research Scholarship,Lana would like to gratefully acknowledge the funding provided by the Macquarie University Master of Research Scholarship.

These adaptive strategies include decisions to plant different seed varieties, changes to the array of cultivated crops, and shifts in planting dates. Smallholder access to irrigation water is crucial to the adoption of such strategies, and uncertainty of water availability may prove to be a stimulating force in a smallholder's decision to adjust their on-farm practices. Within smallholder irrigation systems, attributes at multiple levels influence water availability and collective action, and in the process play a role in adaptation: community-level governance institutions may influence trust in others and the ability to overcome appropriation and provisioning dilemmas, and, at the household-level, the availability of irrigation water and socioeconomic and demographic factors may influence farmer willingness to take on the risk of altering their on-farm practices. In this study we investigate smallholder adaptation in Kenya from multiple levels. Specifically, we identify the role of household- and community-level characteristics in shaping smallholder experimentation with different seed varieties. Standard ordinary least squares and logistic regressions are constructed to assess the influence of these interactions on smallholder adaptation. We further discuss the ability of smallholders to respond to poor water provisioning. Among the study's findings is evidence that smallholders are more willing to employ adaptive measures if they have a limited capacity to irrigate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Coastal ecosystems have largely declined, threatening the principal source of protein, building materials, tourism-based revenue, and the first line of defense against storm swells and sea level rise (SLR) for small tropical islands. Climate change has also impacted public health (i.e., altered distribution and increased prevalence of allergies, water-borne, and vector-borne diseases). Rapid human population growth has exacerbated pressure over coupled social-ecological systems, with concomitant non-sustainable impacts on natural resources, water availability, food security and sovereignty, public health, and quality of life, which should increase vulnerability and erode adaptation and mitigation capacity. This paper examines cumulative and synergistic impacts of climate change in the challenging context of highly vulnerable small tropical islands. Multiple adaptive strategies of coupled social-ecological ecosystems are discussed. Multi-level, multi-sectorial responses are necessary for adaptation to be successful. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A long-term field experiment was conducted on sandy soils in Western Michigan from 2010-17 to evaluate the effects of three levels of irrigation (none, overhead or sub-surface drip) and two asparagus cultivars (Guelph Millennium [GM] and Jersey Supreme [JS]) for reducing these risks. Overhead irrigation during the fern growth period resulted in cumulative yield improvements of 10% for GM during the 2012-17 growing seasons, with the largest yield benefits (21%) occurring in 2012, following hot, dry conditions the previous summer. In contrast, cumulative yields of JS were unaffected by irrigation, and yield reductions of 13% due to irrigation were observed in 2017, following wet conditions the previous late summer and fall. Estimates of cultivar water-use by depth suggest that JS was better able to tolerate drought due to a deeper root system compared to GM. However, our results suggest that JS may also be more sensitive than GM to excessive soil moisture during fall senescence.

As such, climate change mitigation and adaptation are incidental to a larger enterprise that employs a systems approach to managing landscapes and communities. The transformative potential of regenerative agriculture has seen growing attention in the popular press, but few empirical studies have explored the processes by which farmers enter into, navigate, and, importantly, sustain the required paradigm shift in their approach to managing their properties, farm businesses, and personal lives. We draw on theories and insights associated with relational thinking to analyze the experiences of farmers in Australia who have undertaken and sustained transitions from conventional to regenerative agriculture. We present a conceptual framework of zones of friction and traction occurring in personal, practical, and political spheres of transformation that both challenge and facilitate the transition process. Our findings illustrate the ways in which deeply held values and emotions influence and interact with mental models, worldviews, and cultural norms as a result of regular monitoring; and how behavioral change is sustained through the establishment of self-amplifying positive feedbacks involving biophilic emotions, a sense of well-being, and an ever-expanding worldview. We conclude that transitioning to regenerative agriculture involves more than a suite of 'climate-smart' mitigation and adaptation practices supported by technical innovation, policy, education, and outreach. Rather, it involves subjective, nonmaterial factors associated with culture, values, ethics, identity, and emotion that operate at individual, household, and community scales and interact with regional, national and global processes. Findings have implications for strategies aimed at facilitating a large-scale transition to climate-smart regenerative agriculture.","[Gosnell, Hannah] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 104 CEOAS Adm Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Gill, Nicholas] Univ Wollongong, Australian Ctr Culture Environm Soc & Space, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Voyer, Michelle] Univ Wollongong, Fac Law Humanities & Arts, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",Oregon State University; University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong,"Gosnell, H (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 104 CEOAS Adm Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",gosnellh@geo.oregonstate.edu; ngill@uow.edu.au; mvoyer@uow.edu.au,,"Voyer, Michelle/0000-0001-6170-9994","USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Portland, Oregon, USA; Australian Centre for Culture, Environment, Society and Space, University of Wollongong, Australia","USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Portland, Oregon, USA; Australian Centre for Culture, Environment, Society and Space, University of Wollongong, Australia","This work was supported by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Portland, Oregon, USA; and the Australian Centre for Culture, Environment, Society and Space, University of Wollongong, Australia.",,112,82,83,29,243,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

However, adaptation planning and implementation may be delayed where people perceive a lack of urgency and put forward competing priorities such as economic development. Here, we assess perceptions of climate change and adaptation in Saint-Pierre-and Miquelon, a subarctic archipelago located south of Newfoundland, Canada. We performed and analysed a social survey reaching 289 individuals out of a population of 6260, through a questionnaire conducted both faceto-face and online. We show that inhabitants of Saint-Pierre-and-Miquelon generally have a clear understanding of climate change and perceive adaptation as urgent for a number of vulnerable coastal sites. Despite some disagreements on adaptation options and the timing for implementation, it is noteworthy that even relocation action is mentioned and sometimes requested. We show that perceptions of climate change and of adaptation within Saint-Pierre-and-Miquelon are heavily influenced by place attachment, personal experience of coastal hazards and environmental awareness. From a methodological point of view, our results highlight the relevance of using online surveys in well-connected but geographically isolated communities. From an adaptation perspective, our results suggest that people's perceptions and beliefs are not only a barrier, but rather offer in some cases opportunities for adaptation planning and implementation. Such favourable attitudes toward adaptation do not exist across all small islands, so our results may be useful in determining the conditions under which people's perceptions are conducive to adaptation.","[Philippenko, Xenia; Le Cozannet, Goneri] French Geol Survey BRGM, 3 Ave Claude Guillemin, F-45060 Orleans 2, France; [Philippenko, Xenia; Goeldner-Gianella, Lydie] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Inst Geog, 191 Rue St Jacques, F-75005 Paris, France; [Philippenko, Xenia; Goeldner-Gianella, Lydie; Grancher, Delphine] Lab Phys Geog UMR 8591, 1 Pl Aristide Briand, F-92195 Meudon, France; [De la Torre, Ywenn] Reg Direct Guadeloupe, French Geol Survey BRGM, Parc Activites Colin La Lezarde, F-97170 Petit Bourg, Guadeloupe, France",Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM),"Philippenko, X (corresponding author), French Geol Survey BRGM, 3 Ave Claude Guillemin, F-45060 Orleans 2, France.",x.philippenko-crnokrak@brgm.fr; lydie.goeldner-gianella@univ-paris1.fr; g.lecozannet@brgm.fr; delphine.grancher@lgp.cnrs.fr; y.delatorre@brgm.fr,"De la Torre, Ywenn/HKN-8260-2023; Philippenko, Xenia/GVS-6745-2022","De la Torre, Ywenn/0000-0003-0078-8902; PHILIPPENKO, XENIA/0000-0001-7126-9574",French National Geological Survey (BRGM); French Government,French National Geological Survey (BRGM); French Government,This work was supported by grants from the French National Geological Survey (BRGM) and the French Government.,,84,5,5,3,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,DEC 1,2021,215,,,,,,,,105924,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105924,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105924,,NOV 2021,16,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,WW8OK,,Green Published,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000718168500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These developments generally lead to an increase in the risk of coastal flooding. This article focuses on systems to protect against this hazard, and presents a bibliographical analysis on methods and operational tools to strengthen their resilience. This analysis is carried out by considering that a system of protection is a component of the territory to which it provides protection and that it is therefore necessary to study in depth the relations between this system and the various components of the territory (the natural environment, the built environment and the social and institutional environment). Based on this hypothesis, the concepts of risk and resilience applied to floods are specified and the protection and adaptation strategies commonly used in recent decades are described. This retrospective on concepts and strategies leads us to structure the state-of-the-art analysis on methods and operational tools in relation to two issues: 1) understanding risks; 2) adapting and transforming protection systems. In each case, the use of the concept of resilience implies a clear distinction between systemic and analytical approaches. Finally, this bibliographical analysis reveals the need to revise the protection system concept in order to promote the integration of these systems in the territories. Accordingly, new methodological developments could be considered using ecosystem and socio-economic approaches.","[Igigabel, Marc] Cerema, Technopole Brest Iroise, Plouzane, France; [Diab, Youssef] Univ Gustave Eiffel, Lab Urba, Champs Sur Marne, France; [Yates, Marissa] St Venant Hydraul Lab, Chatou, France; [Yates, Marissa] Cerema, Chatou, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Igigabel, M (corresponding author), Cerema, Technopole Brest Iroise, Plouzane, France.",marc.igigabel@cerema.fr,,,,,,,205,0,0,5,12,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

This may have serious implications for structure and functions of Wadden Sea tidal basins. If the rate of SLR becomes higher than sediment accumulation rates on the inter-tidal flats, they start to submerge. Drowning of these flats has negative consequences from a nature conservation viewpoint as well as for coastal flood risk management. Hence, anticipation measures may become expedient. Knowledge about the drowning processes and pathways supports the development, timing and localization of sustainable adaptation measures in the Wadden Sea. Based upon a description of hydro-morphological steady states in Wadden Sea tidal basins and a discussion of possible drowning processes and pathways, some general hypotheses and conclusions are formulated. Drowning of inter-tidal flats may generally start from the sea and continue in a landward direction. Smaller sub-basins in the inner parts of the basin may have a higher adaptive capacity to SLR than the more central and seaward parts of the tidal basin. Larger mean tidal range (MTR) as well as increasing tidal range may improve the capacity of tidal basins to balance SLR. In consequence, the process of drowning will probably start earlier and proceed faster in basins with lower MTR as in basins with higher MTR. As a (final) consequence of drowning of the inter-tidal flats, sub-tidal channels may, with the exception of the tidal inlet channels, progressively silt up. Although SLR-rates in the early Holocene were (at least) as high as those predicted for the end of this century, the early Holocene development in the former Wadden Sea area cannot be used for morphological projections. In an outlook, sand replenishment, dike-relocation (under specific conditions) and brushwood groin fields are mentioned as possible sustainable measures to increase the resilience of the Wadden Sea to SLR.","Minist Energiewende, Umwelt & Landl Riume Landes Schleswig Holstein, D-24106 Kiel, Germany",,"Hofstede, JLA (corresponding author), Minist Energiewende, Umwelt & Landl Riume Landes Schleswig Holstein, Mercatorstr 3, D-24106 Kiel, Germany.",Jacobus.hofstede@melur.landsh.de,,,,,,,21,6,6,1,14,GEBRUDER BORNTRAEGER,STUTTGART,"JOHANNESSTR 3A, D-70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0372-8854,,,Z GEOMORPHOL,Z.

Results: The results show that the CO2 emissions in the states have the same behavior as the timeline of the change in land use. Conclusions: The public policies and actions by society and the private sector were fundamental to the reduction verified from the year of 2004 that followed until 2010, both in CO2 emissions and in the change in land use and forests. As of this year, there has been a trend towards stability in CO2 emissions.

Impacts of heat stress on health have primarily been quantified for urban environments, particularly in developed countries. Far less is known in other settings, including the effects of ongoing tropical deforestation on local temperature and its consequences for people living in these rapidly changing landscapes. Here, we explore links between deforestation and self-reported human health and well-being in the tropical landscapes of Borneo. We use extensive social surveys from nearly 500 villages throughout Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) that asked whether forests were important for health, and why. The most frequent answer viewed forests as important for maintaining cool local temperatures (volunteered by 28% of 4634 respondents). Using boosted regression tree analysis incorporating spatial metrics of deforestation and temperature, we found that villagers were more likely to report this cooling effect if they were from villages with higher or more variable temperatures, and in recently deforested or fragmented landscapes. Our results highlight the role of forests in regulating the local climate. This ecosystem service is highly threatened, and yet increasingly vital for avoiding heat illness and enabling adaptation to global climate change.","[Wolff, Nicholas H.] Nature Conservancy, Global Sci, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Masuda, Yuta J.] Nature Conservancy, Global Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Meijaard, Erik; Wells, Jessie A.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Meijaard, Erik; Wells, Jessie A.] Borneo Futures, Country Woods 306,JL WRSupratman, Jakarta 15412, Indonesia; [Game, Edward T.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Game, Edward T.] Nature Conservancy, Global Sci, South Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Nature Conservancy; Nature Conservancy; University of Queensland; University of Queensland; Nature Conservancy,"Wolff, NH (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, Global Sci, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",Nicholas.wolff@tnc.org,"Wells, Jessie A/F-7318-2010; Meijaard, Erik/A-2687-2016","Wells, Jessie A/0000-0002-3555-5108; Meijaard, Erik/0000-0001-8685-3685; Wolff, Nicholas/0000-0003-1162-3556; Game, Edward/0000-0003-4707-9281",Directorate of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry; Adopt-an-Acre program,Directorate of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry; Adopt-an-Acre program,"We thank the Directorate of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry for supporting our study, and the Association of Indonesian Primatologists (FORINA) for coordinating the interview studies.

We compared several common approaches to conservation planning focused on climate resilience over a broad range of ecological settings across North America and evaluated how commonalities in the priority areas identified by different methods varied with regional context and spatial scale. Our results indicate that priority areas based on different environmental diversity metrics differed substantially from each other and from priorities based on spatiotemporal metrics such as climatic velocity. Refugia identified by diversity or velocity metrics were not strongly associated with the current protected area system, suggesting the need for additional conservation measures including protection of refugia. Despite the inherent uncertainties in predicting future climate, we found that variation among climatic velocities derived from different general circulation models and emissions pathways was less than the variation among the suite of environmental diversity metrics. To address uncertainty created by this variation, planners can combine priorities identified by alternative metrics at a single resolution and downweight areas of high variation between metrics. Alternately, coarse-resolution velocity metrics can be combined with fine-resolution diversity metrics in order to leverage the respective strengths of the two groups of metrics as tools for identification of potential macro- and microrefugia that in combination maximize both transient and long-term resilience to climate change. Planners should compare and integrate approaches that span a range of model complexity and spatial scale to match the range of ecological and physical processes influencing persistence of biodiversity and identify a conservation network resilient to threats operating at multiple scales.","[Carroll, Carlos] Klamath Ctr Conservat Res, Orleans, CA 95556 USA; [Roberts, David R.] Univ Freiburg, Dept Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, Freiburg, Germany; [Michalak, Julia L.; Lawler, Joshua J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Nielsen, Scott E.; Stralberg, Diana; Hamann, Andreas] Univ Alberta, Renewable Resources Dept, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Mcrae, Brad H.] Nature Conservancy, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Wang, Tongli] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Freiburg; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Alberta; Nature Conservancy; University of British Columbia,"Carroll, C (corresponding author), Klamath Ctr Conservat Res, Orleans, CA 95556 USA.",carlos@klamathconservation.org,"Wang, Tongli/AAC-8644-2020; Nielsen, Scott/O-7482-2019; Nielsen, Scott/C-2842-2013; Wang, Tongli/AAW-4427-2020; Stralberg, Diana/W-9267-2019","Nielsen, Scott/0000-0002-9754-0630; Nielsen, Scott/0000-0002-9754-0630; Wang, Tongli/0000-0002-9967-6769; Stralberg, Diana/0000-0003-4900-024X; Michalak, Julia/0000-0002-2524-8390; Roberts, David/0000-0002-3437-2422",Wilburforce Foundation,Wilburforce Foundation,Wilburforce Foundation,,60,67,68,12,73,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Yet, we identify instances whereby strategic planning frameworks, informal networks and bespoke development frameworks were effective means to build trust between actors and foster co-operation, better enabling development which meets climate change mitigation/adaptation objectives.

It focused on the seasonal or monthly changes in crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and net irrigation requirements (NIR) of a number of permanent and annual crops over two consecutive overlapping periods (1976-2000 and 1990-2014). While the differences in the seasonal ETc and NIR estimates were not statistically significant between the studied periods, differences were identified via a month-by-month comparison. In March, the water demands of crops appeared to be significantly greater during the recent past in relation to 1976-2000, while for NIR, March showed statistically significant increases and September showed significant decreases. Consequently, the adjustment of irrigation schedules to climate change by farmers should not rely on annual trends as an eventual mismatch of monthly crop water needs with irrigation water supply might affect the critical growth stages of crops with a disproportionately greater negative impact on yields and quality. The clear increase in irrigation needs in March coincides with the most sensitive growth stage of irrigated potato crops in Cyprus. Therefore, the results may serve as a useful tool for current and future adaptation measures.","[Dalias, Panagiotis; Christou, Anastasis; Neocleous, Damianos] Minist Agr Rural Dev & Environm, Agr Res Inst, POB 22016, CY-1516 Nicosia, Cyprus",,"Dalias, P (corresponding author), Minist Agr Rural Dev & Environm, Agr Res Inst, POB 22016, CY-1516 Nicosia, Cyprus.",dalias@ari.gov.cy; Anastasis.Christou@ari.gov.cy; d.neocleous@ari.gov.cy,"Neocleous, Damianos/AAR-2131-2020","Neocleous, Damianos/0000-0002-8332-0346; Dalias, Panagiotis/0000-0002-5697-0239",Agricultural Research Institute of Cyprus,Agricultural Research Institute of Cyprus,"This work was supported by the Agricultural Research Institute of Cyprus (ARI) and authors did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

This paper presents an alternative methodology to the conventional engineering practice in the UK for identifying long-term adaptation planning strategies in the context of resilience. More specifically, a resilience-based multi-objective optimization method is proposed that identifies Pareto optimal future adaptation strategies by maximizing a water supply system's resilience (calculated as the maximum recorded duration of a water deficit period over a given planning horizon) and minimizing total associated costs, subject to meeting target system robustness to uncertain projections (scenarios) of future supply and demand. The method is applied to a real-world case study for Bristol Water's water resource zone and the results are compared with those derived using a more conventional engineering practice in the UK, utilizing a least-cost optimization analysis constrained to a target reliability level. The results obtained reveal that the strategy solution derived using the current practice methodology produce a less resilient system than the similar costing solutions identified using the proposed resilience driven methodology. At the same time, resilience driven strategies are only slightly less reliable suggesting that trade-off exists between the two. Further examination of intervention strategies selected shows that the conventional methodology encourages implementation of more lower cost intervention options early in the planning horizon (to achieve higher system reliability) whereas the resilience-based methodology encourages more uniform intervention options sequenced over the planning horizon (to achieve higher system resilience).","[Roach, Tom; Kapelan, Zoran] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Harrison Bldg,North Pk Rd, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Roach, Tom; Ledbetter, Ralph] HR Wallingford, Howbery Business Pk, Wallingford OX10 8BA, Oxon, England",University of Exeter; HR Wallingford Limited,"Roach, T (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Harrison Bldg,North Pk Rd, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England.;Roach, T (corresponding author), HR Wallingford, Howbery Business Pk, Wallingford OX10 8BA, Oxon, England.",tpr202@ex.ac.uk,"Parween, Shama/AFQ-4232-2022","Kapelan, Zoran/0000-0002-0934-4470; Roach, Tom/0000-0001-6333-5244; Ledbetter, Ralph/0000-0003-0764-8187",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; HR Wallingford; University of Exeter through the STREAM Industrial Doctorate Centre [EP/G037094/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1199770] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); HR Wallingford; University of Exeter through the STREAM Industrial Doctorate Centre; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was financially supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, HR Wallingford and The University of Exeter through the STREAM Industrial Doctorate Centre (Grant EP/G037094/1).

Among the new challenges is the need to evaluate some of the instruments necessary to comply with the Water Framework Directive requirements that emphasize the management of water demand to achieve the environmental targets. Here we analyze the implications of changing water rights as a policy response to these challenges. We analyze two important aspects of the decision: (i) the effects on the crop productivity and efficiency and (ii) the effects on the rural income distribution. We provide the empirical estimations for the marginal effects on the two considered aspects. First, we calculate a stochastic frontier production function for five representative crops using historical data to estimate technical efficiency. Second, we use a decomposition of the Gini coefficient to estimate the impact of irrigation rights changes on yield disparity. In our estimates, we consider both bio-physical and socio-economic aspects to conclude that there are long term implications on both efficiency and social disparities.

This study was an empirical investigation addressing the extent to which, and the ways in which, sociocultural, family-based, demographic and economic circumstances in a poor rural African environment influence levels of active malaria infection risk awareness. Face-to-face interviews were conducted and the questions included both open-ended questions allowing for unprompted replies and closed fixed-answer alternative (prompted) items. The adult female responsible for the day-to-day care of the children in 156 homesteads (60 in each of two malaria villages and 36 in a reference village) was interviewed. The families received financial assistance but little physical support from the fathers. Unemployment, poverty, crime and clean water were perceived as the main, unprompted threats, and everyday awareness appeared to exclude the potentially serious disease threats of malaria. Only when malaria was prompted did the concerns rise to 52% and 38% in the sprayed villages. The apparent discrepancy between actual daily and potential future threats significantly increases the difficulty of mobilising communities for preventive action regarding potential threats. The lack of community involvement in an existing community-passive malaria control system may become a problem when promoting new/additional measures to reduce exposure to indoor residual spraying chemicals.

In Paris, the frequency of heat-waves could rise from an average of one day per year to 14-26 days per year, with temperatures reaching up to 50 degrees C. Since 2012, pavement-watering is viewed as a potential tool for emergency cooling by the city while scientific work on the technique has found its application to be best suited to densely built urban areas, compared for example to urban greening whose impact may be hindered by lack of available planting space. This paper proposes an interdisciplinary approach combining urban physics with social sciences to develop such a GIS model for pavement-watering as an emergency response to heat-waves in Paris. It is built on performance criteria derived from previous work are input into a Geographic Information System to identify urban areas where pavement-watering would be most effective. In addition, a heat-related health risk assessment is conducted, using microclimatic, urban and socio-economic layers, to single out areas where heat-wave risk is highest in public spaces, combining high temperatures, pedestrian traffic and local population vulnerability. The microclimatic hazard dataset includes a physical model of park and water body cool islands assuming they are driven by thermal diffusion. The resulting tool has significant flexibility in defining the thresholds of the different indicators. The mapping scheme identified a total of 50 to 200 km of high priority areas for pavement-watering, requiring between 1400 and 5800 m(3)/day of non-potable water, equivalent to 0.6 to 2.6 L/day per capita. Limitations due to data quality or resolution are discussed as well as paths for further improvement.","[Hendel, Martin; Bobee, Cecilia; Karam, Ghid; Parison, Sophie; Berthe, Alexandre; Bordin, Patricia] Univ Paris, CNRS, LIED, UMR 8236, F-75006 Paris, France; [Hendel, Martin; Karam, Ghid] Univ Gustave Eiffel, Dept SEN, ESIEE Paris, F-93162 Noisy Le Grand, France; [Parison, Sophie] Paris City Hall, Paris, France; [Berthe, Alexandre] Univ Rennes, LiRIS, EA 7481, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Bordin, Patricia] Univ Paris Est, Inst Rech Constructibilite, ESTP, F-94234 Cachan, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; ESIEE Paris; Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon; Universite de Rennes,"Hendel, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris, CNRS, LIED, UMR 8236, F-75013 Paris, France.",martin.hendel@univ-paris-diderot.fr,,,Water and Sanitation Department of Paris City Hall,Water and Sanitation Department of Paris City Hall,Funding for this research was provided by the Water and Sanitation Department of Paris City Hall.

What silent but corollary rural dispossessions accompany them? I investigate these questions through the experience of migrants from rural coastal Bangladesh to peri-urban Kolkata. The threats posed to their villages by a variety of ecological disruptions (both loosely and intimately linked with climate change) drive their migration in search of new livelihoods. Their experiences suggest that the demise of rural futures is entangled with the celebration of urban climate futures. However, social movements in this region resisting agrarian dispossession point to alternative political imaginaries that resist teleologies of urbanization at the expense of agrarian livelihoods. Current work in both agrarian studies and urban studies theorizes these linked dynamics of rural-urban transition, seeking to understand them in relation to broader political economies. I bring these debates into conversation with one another to highlight the importance of attention to counter-hegemonic agrarian political imaginaries, particularly in the face of predictions of the death of the peasantry in a climate-changed world.

The issue is not only to select efficient, robust, and flexible adaptation portfolios but also to find equitable strategies of cost allocation among the stakeholders. Our work addresses such cost allocation problems by applying two different theoretical approaches: social justice and cooperative game theory in a real case study. First of all, a cost-effective portfolio of adaptation measures at the basin scale is selected using a least-cost optimization model. Cost allocation solutions are then defined based on economic rationality concepts from cooperative game theory (the Core). Second, interviews are conducted to characterize stakeholders' perceptions of social justice principles associated with the definition of alternatives cost allocation rules. The comparison of the cost allocation scenarios leads to contrasted insights in order to inform the decision-making process at the river basin scale and potentially reap the efficiency gains from cooperation in the design of river basin adaptation portfolios.","[Girard, Corentin; Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel] Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Valencia, Spain; [Rinaudo, Jean-Daniel] French Geol Survey, BRGM, Montpellier, France",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM),"Girard, C (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Valencia, Spain.",cogimar@upv.es,"Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel/N-1619-2014; Rinaudo, Jean-Daniel/AAI-1193-2021","Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel/0000-0001-7009-6130; RINAUDO, Jean-Daniel/0000-0001-8539-574X","IMPADAPT project from the Spanish ministry MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad) [CGL2013-48424-C2-1-R]; European FEDER funds; University Lecturer Training Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports of Spain [FPU12/03803]; BRGM's research program (environmental and risk economics) [30]","IMPADAPT project from the Spanish ministry MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad); European FEDER funds(European Commission); University Lecturer Training Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports of Spain; BRGM's research program (environmental and risk economics)","The study has been partially supported by the IMPADAPT project (CGL2013-48424-C2-1-R) from the Spanish ministry MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad) with European FEDER funds.

Climate change is no longer simply about reducing emissions, but also about enabling countries to deal with its impacts. Yet, most studies of the climate regime have focused on the evolution of mitigation governance and overlooked the increasing number of adaptation-related decisions and initiatives. In this article, we identify the body of rules and commitments on adaptation and suggest that there are more attempts to govern adaptation than many mitigation-focused accounts of the international climate regime would suggest. We then ask: to what degree are adaptation rules and commitments legalized in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change? We examine the degree of precision and obligation of relevant decisions through an extensive analysis of primary United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change documents, secondary literature on adaptation initiatives and institutions, interviews with climate change experts and negotiators, and participant observation at climate negotiations. Our analysis finds that adaptation governance is low in precision and obligation. We suggest that this is partly because adaptation is a contested global public good and because package deals' are made with mitigation commitments. This article makes a vital contribution to the global environmental politics literature given that adaptation governance is under-studied and poorly understood. It also contributes to the legalization literature by highlighting how contested global public goods may be governed globally, but with low obligation and precision.","[Hall, Nina] Johns Hopkins Sch Adv Int Studies Europe, Int Relat, Bologna, Italy; [Persson, Asa] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm Environment Institute,"Hall, N (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Bologna Ctr, Via Belmeloro 11, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",nhall@jhu.edu,"Hall, Nina/AAQ-2987-2020; Persson, Åsa/ABD-8096-2021","Hall, Nina/0000-0002-6318-9029; Persson, Asa/0000-0002-8886-5046",Swedish Research Council Formas [211-2012-1842],Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"Asa Persson was funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas, grant no. 211-2012-1842 'Climate adaptation in a globalised world'.",,85,31,31,5,73,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-0661,1460-3713,,EUR J INT RELAT,Eur.

Rising sea-levels and increased storminess threaten to accelerate coastal erosion, while growing demand for coastal real estate encourages more spending to hold back the sea in spite of the shrinking federal budget for beach nourishment. As climatic drivers and federal policies for beach nourishment change, the evolution of coastline mitigation and property values is uncertain. We develop an empirically grounded, stochastic dynamic model coupling coastal property markets and shoreline evolution, including beach nourishment, and show that a large share of coastal property value reflects capitalized erosion control. The model is parameterized for coastal properties and physical forcing in North Carolina, U.S.A. and we conduct sensitivity analyses using property values spanning a wide range of sandy coastlines along the U.S. East Coast. The model shows that a sudden removal of federal nourishment subsidies, as has been proposed, could trigger a dramatic downward adjustment in coastal real estate, analogous to the bursting of a bubble. We find that the policy-induced inflation of property value grows with increased erosion from sea level rise or increased storminess, but the effect of background erosion is larger due to human behavioral feedbacks. Our results suggest that if nourishment is not a long-run strategy to manage eroding coastlines, a gradual removal is more likely to smooth the transition to more climate-resilient coastal communities.","Univ N Carolina, Ctr Marine Sci, Dept Phys & Phys Oceanog, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA; [Gopalakrishnan, Sathya] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Smith, Martin D.; Murray, A.

Coastal wetland ecosystems are expected to migrate landwards in response to rising seas. However, due to differences in topography and coastal urbanization, estuaries vary in their ability to accommodate migration. Low-lying urban areas can constrain migration and lead to wetland loss (i.e. coastal squeeze), especially where existing wetlands cannot keep pace with rising seas via vertical adjustments. In many estuaries, there is a pressing need to identify landward migration corridors and better quantify the potential for landward migration and coastal squeeze. 2. We quantified and compared the area available for landward migration of tidal saline wetlands and the area where urban development is expected to prevent migration for 39 estuaries along the wetland-rich USA Gulf of Mexico coast. We did so under three sea level rise scenarios (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 m by 2100). 3. Within the region, the potential for wetland migration is highest within certain estuaries in Louisiana and southern Florida (e.g. Atchafalaya/Vermilion Bays, Mermentau River, Barataria Bay, and the North and South Ten Thousand Islands estuaries). 4. The potential for coastal squeeze is highest in estuaries containing major metropolitan areas that extend into low-lying lands. The Charlotte Harbor, Tampa Bay, and Crystal-Pithlachascotee estuaries (Florida) have the highest amounts of urban land expected to constrain wetland migration. Urban barriers to migration are also high in the Galveston Bay (Texas) and Atchafalaya/Vermilion Bays (Louisiana) estuaries. 5. Synthesis and applications. Coastal wetlands provide many ecosystem services that benefit human health and well-being, including shoreline protection and fish and wildlife habitat. As the rate of sea level rise accelerates in response to climate change, coastal wetland resources could be lost in areas that lack space for landward migration. Migration corridors are particularly important in highly urbanized estuaries where, due to low-lying coastal development, there is not space for wetlands to move and adapt to sea level rise. Future-focused landscape conservation plans that incorporate the protection of wetland migration corridors can increase the adaptive capacity of these valuable ecosystems and simultaneously decrease the vulnerability of coastal human communities to the harmful effects of rising seas.","[Borchert, Sinead M.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Borchert Consulting, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA; [Osland, Michael J.; Enwright, Nicholas M.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Lafayette, LA USA; [Griffith, Kereen T.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Griffith Consulting, Lafayette, LA USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Borchert, SM (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Borchert Consulting, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA.",sborchert@usgs.gov,"Osland, Michael/D-1814-2014; Enwright, Nicholas/R-3640-2019","Osland, Michael/0000-0001-9902-8692; Enwright, Nicholas/0000-0002-7887-3261; Borchert, Sinead/0000-0002-6665-7115",U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems and Land Change Science Mission Areas; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Department of Interior South Central Climate Science Center; Department of Interior Southeast Climate Science Center,U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems and Land Change Science Mission Areas; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); Department of Interior South Central Climate Science Center; Department of Interior Southeast Climate Science Center,"We thank the U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems and Land Change Science Mission Areas, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Department of Interior South Central Climate Science Center, and the Department of Interior Southeast Climate Science Center for their support of this project.

These futures are imagined with reference to pasts and presents, remembered and lived. This paper presents the stories relating possible futures to pasts and presents of residents in tiny, low-lying coastal communities in Gippsland East, Australia, as they make sense of the uncertain futures they may face. It identifies four time stories, about generational continuity, the temporariness of inundation, endurance and acceptance in older age, and the impermanence of infrastructure. It sets these alongside the time-based practices inherent in existing adaptation policies, which do not satisfy the demands for adaptation arising from residents' time stories. We suggest that understanding local residents' time stories can contribute to a better synchronisation in the timing of local adaptation policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These impacts are limiting the community's ability to access the land to support their food system, which depends on harvesting traditional foods. This article details a participatory action research approach, driven by the community, that used on-the-land activities, workshops, community meetings and interviews to develop a community food security action plan to deal with the uncertainties of a changing climate on the food system. Data was analyzed using the Community Capitals Framework (CCF) to describe the complex nature of the community's food system in terms of available or depleting capitals, as well as how the impacts of climate change affect these capitals, and the needs identified by the community to aid in adaptation. For Deli?ne, the theme of self-sufficiency emerged out of concerns that climate change is negatively impacting supplies from the south and that building and maintaining both social and cultural capital are key to achieving food security in an uncertain future. Learning from the past and sharing Traditional Knowledge(1)was a key element of food security planning. However, other types of knowledge, such as research and monitoring of the health of the land, and building capacity of the community through training, were important aspects of adaptation planning in the community. This knowledge, in its many forms, may assist the community in determining its own direction for achieving food security, and offers a glimpse into food sovereignty in Northern regions.","[Spring, Andrew; Blay-Palmer, Alison] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Neyelle, Michael; Bezha, Walter; Simmons, Deborah] Sahtu Renewable Resources Board, Tulita, NT, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Spring, A (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",aspring@wlu.ca,,,Government of Canada's Climate Change and Health Adaptation Program; Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) [895-2015-1016]; Northern Scientific Training Program,Government of Canada's Climate Change and Health Adaptation Program; Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Northern Scientific Training Program,"This work was made possible by the contributions from the Government of Canada's Climate Change and Health Adaptation Program, Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) (granted: #895-2015-1016), and the Northern Scientific Training Program.",,74,0,0,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

These countries are comprised entirely of low-lying land approximately 2 m above sea level. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has recognized that atoll countries are highly vulnerable to rising sea levels due to climate change. This study aimed to clarify the relative advantages and disadvantages of possible alternatives compared to the present livelihoods of the Marshallese in their home country. We also attempted to identify the best plausible option, using few sets of possible value judgements over the evaluation criteria. The following four alternatives were examined in this study: (i) migration to the developed world, (ii) migration to other island states, (iii) land reclamation and raising, and (iv) development of floating platforms. To evaluate the performance of the four alternatives, we selected 16 criteria representing the societal conditions that would result from each alternative. The performance of each alternative per criterion was rated from 1 to 5 by a literature survey, interviews with researchers who worked on the livelihood of Marshallese immigrants in the U.S. states of Arkansas, Hawaii, and Oregon, and interviews with people knowledgeable about the behavior of the Marshallese both in their home country and in the United States as immigrants. The migration to the developed world alternative proved the best choice, followed by developing floating platforms, land reclamation and raising, and migration to other island states. We also found that migration to the developed world offered the most change to immigrants, while the alternative of land reclamation and raising resulted in the smallest change. The magnitude of anticipated change should be considered. We employed the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to experimentally evaluate four alternatives in an integrated manner and about three cases were all the criteria are equally important, social environment is more important, and personal environment is more important. With AHP, the migration to the developed world alternative yielded the highest point for all three cases examined. Notably, climate migrants do not suddenly emerge, because climate change is a slow-onset process. The Marshallese should make wise use of the available lead time to prepare for migration in the future.","[Nakayama, Mikiyasu; Murakawa, Tomoya; Sakai, Erika; Iwama, Hiroaki] Global Infrastruct Fund Res Fdn Japan, Minato Ku, Roppongi T Cube 14F,3-1-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1060032, Japan; [Fujikura, Ryo] Hosei Univ, Fac Sustainabil Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Okuda, Rie] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Int Cooperat Studies, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Fujii, Mai] Sasakawa Peace Fdn, Ocean Policy Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Takashima, Ryuta] Tokyo Univ Sci, Dept Ind Adm, Chiba, Japan",Hosei University; Kobe University; Tokyo University of Science,"Nakayama, M (corresponding author), Global Infrastruct Fund Res Fdn Japan, Minato Ku, Roppongi T Cube 14F,3-1-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1060032, Japan.",m.nakayama@gif.or.jp,"Fujikura, Ryo/M-9718-2013","Fujikura, Ryo/0000-0002-0742-0767","Global Infrastructure Fund Research Foundation Japan (GIF Japan); Ocean Policy Research Institute of The Sasakawa Peace Foundation (OPRI-SPF); JSPS KAKENHI [19KK0025, 21H03711]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21H03711, 19KK0025] Funding Source: KAKEN","Global Infrastructure Fund Research Foundation Japan (GIF Japan); Ocean Policy Research Institute of The Sasakawa Peace Foundation (OPRI-SPF); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to the Global Infrastructure Fund Research Foundation Japan (GIF Japan) and the Ocean Policy Research Institute of The Sasakawa Peace Foundation (OPRI-SPF) for their support of this study.

J,"Silva, N; Mena, C",,,,"Silva, Natalia; Mena, Cristobal",,,Identifying the underlying risk factors of local communities in Chile,DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Local governance; Risk assessment; Climate change adaptation; Risk governance; Vulnerability assessment,,"Purpose - The purpose of the instrument is to favour and strengthen, in a timely and relevant manner, the processes of design, planning, investment, execution and evaluation of various public and private initiatives in the territory, thereby strengthening the preventive, responsive and adaptive capacities of the communities, institutions and territory. The instrument allows the generation of a single single-community diagnosis, a definition of a baseline which leads to progress assessment at different levels and provides specific risk management recommendations to municipalities. Design/methodology/approach - The definition of the purpose and design of this tool was the result of the work in a year by a group of national experts from the public, private, organised civil society and academia members of the National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction. This initial stage has sought to capture the different sectoral visions with a multidimensional approach that considers the territorial differences cautioning that local governments are key actors to achieve risk reduction, and they are also the first respondents and responsible for managing their territory and community. In order to help local governments, to understand their situation, the experts' group established that the assessment should consist of a guided self-diagnosis using a survey. The dimensions considered are as follows: governance, territorial planning, socio-economic and demographic conditions and climate change and natural resources. The four dimensions encompass in total 41 variables that are considered relevant for the disaster risk management discipline. Findings - The rural to semiurban municipalities classified as medium or low development, according to the national standard, present a high-risk level in the dimension of territorial ordering. The municipalities that show a moderate to low dependence on the common municipal fund have a low risk in all the evaluated dimensions, related to greater financial autonomy and own or self-management of resources. The municipalities with low percentage of poverty by income are better evaluated in all the dimensions showing a low level of the Communal Underlying Risk Factors Index (CURFI). A high percentage of communes with a low level of the CURFI have low-urban growth in the last 15 years. Research limitations/implications One of the main difficulties was raising awareness amongst the mayors that the reduction of the underlying factors does not necessarily imply monetary investment, understanding the scarcity of local government resources. The important thing was to sensitise them that the diagnosisper sewas already a result to manage risk in their community. Practical implications - To be able to count for the first time in Chile with a methodology that allows diagnosing risk-based conditions and to target structural and non-structural measures aimed at reducing these factors in local governments. Additionally, it will be possible to monitor the reduction of the underlying risk factors (URF), for accompanying the work of the municipalities in terms of knowing if they have been able to implement the individualised recommendations that are provided. Originality/value - The methodology was formulated by reviewing and considering the methodologies applied in different regions of the world, which generally coincide in the dimensions that group the main underlying factors of disaster risk. However, the numerical treatment of the variables obeys to novel statistical processing (multicriteria method), which provides robustness to the model and, therefore, to the results obtained.","[Silva, Natalia] ONEMI, Dept Management Civil Protect Syst, Santiago, Chile; [Mena, Cristobal] ONEMI, Santiago, Chile",,"Silva, N (corresponding author), ONEMI, Dept Management Civil Protect Syst, Santiago, Chile.",natsilvab@gmail.com; cristobal.menaa@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,4,4,3,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0965-3562,1758-6100,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

The field of historical ecology has generated a substantial body of recommendations for ecosystem management, yet these insights have never been synthesized. We reviewed >200 historical ecology studies and analyzed recommendations for ecosystem management emerging from the field. The majority of studies (similar to 90%) derived from North American and Europe, with forests being the focus of nearly half (48%) of all papers. Papers emphasized the need to protect and restore both habitat remnants and modified ecosystems in management, the value of ecosystems as cultural landscapes, and the importance of adopting a landscape-scale perspective for ecosystem management. Nearly one-quarter contained a recommendation that challenged status quo management, underscoring the value of a historical perspective in setting management goals, strategies, and targets. Fewer than 12% of papers contained recommendations that explicitly addressed ongoing or projected climate change, suggesting opportunities to integrate findings from historical ecology with other perspectives to create forward-looking management strategies that are rooted in place and past.

Here, we synthesise the push and pull approaches reported in the literature and employed in practice to achieve sustainable and resilient cities. First, we present a literature review which identified the major research fields on transition theories, frameworks and methods that underpin this concept. We analyse the conditions for change, identify enablers or triggers for change at governance level for transitioning a city towards sustainability and resilience. We discuss the theories, frameworks and methods which can be used to address the urban climate change challenge at city level. Second, we present an empirical approach based on stakeholder participation that we conducted to detect the conditions for change. We report on the design and implementation of stakeholder exercises that helped us detecting the conditions for changes. Third, we combine the information obtained from these stakeholder exercises with that extracted from the literature in order to provide a fuller picture on how stimulate the transition and transformation to achieve sustainable and resilient cities. Based on our literature review and empirical approach, we formulate an integrated conceptual model for transition that enables the design of adaptation (and mitigation) strategies that consider the triggers of change. Uniquely we identified 8 triggers of change, including authority and political leadership, learning from disasters, co-responsibility, increased public-private interface, social participation and the living lab approach to innovation. The proposed model can be applied to the whole city or to a certain sector of the city (e.g. energy). We demonstrate that triggers of change help to overcome planning and implementation barriers and move the socio-ecological and socio-technical systems of any city towards those of a resilient city.","[Mendizabal, Maddalen; Feliu, Efren; Garcia-Blanco, Gemma] Tecnalia Res & Innovat, Tecnalia Energy & Environm Div, Edificio 700,Parque Tecnol Bizkaia, E-48160 Derio, Spain; [Heidrich, Oliver] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Heidrich, Oliver] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Heidrich, Oliver] Newcastle Univ, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Mendizabal, Alaitz] Univ Basque Country, Financial Econ Dept 2, Plaza Onati 1, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Mendizabal, Maddalen] Edificio 700,Parque Tecnol Bizkaia, E-48160 Derio, Spain",Newcastle University - UK; Newcastle University - UK; Newcastle University - UK; University of Basque Country,"Mendizabal, M (corresponding author), Edificio 700,Parque Tecnol Bizkaia, E-48160 Derio, Spain.",maddalen.mendizabal@tecnalia.com,,"Heidrich, Oliver/0000-0002-6581-5572; Feliu Torres, Efren/0000-0003-1205-4885; Garcia Blanco, Gemma/0000-0002-7835-4373","European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (Project RAMSES Reconciling Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development for Cities) [308497]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (RESIN-Climate Resilient Cities and Infrastructures project) [653522]","European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (Project RAMSES Reconciling Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development for Cities); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (RESIN-Climate Resilient Cities and Infrastructures project)","We thank the participants in the stakeholders' dialogue, who have played a crucial role in this research.

While the flood adaptation behavior of private households has already been widely researched, comparatively less attention has been paid to the adaptation strategies of businesses. However, their ability to cope with flood risk plays an important role in the social and economic development of a flood-prone region. Therefore, using quantitative survey data, this study aims to identify different strategies and adaptation drivers of 557 businesses damaged by a riverine flood in 2013 and 104 businesses damaged by pluvial or flash floods between 2014 and 2017. Our results indicate that a low perceived self-efficacy may be an important factor that can reduce the motivation of businesses to adapt to flood risk. Furthermore, property-owners tended to act more proactively than tenants. In addition, high experience with previous flood events and low perceived response costs could strengthen proactive adaptation behavior.

Therefore, improving maize yield under heat stress will promote food security in the region. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of heat stress on the grain yield of drought-tolerant maize varieties under varied growth conditions. The experimental design used was a 2 x 3 x 3 x 2 factorial fitted into a completely randomized design with four replications. The factors were heat stress, maize variety, soil amendment, and soil type. The results showed a better yield from sandy clay loam over loamy sand soil. Varieties WE5323 and ZM1523 amended with poultry manure gave the best yield under the non-heat and heat-stressed environments, respectively. Heat stress reduced the cob weight, grain weight, grain number, and stover dry weight by 64, 73, 69, and 23%, respectively. Grain number, grain weight, and cob weight were the most informative yield attributes in this study and should be considered in a maize selection program. The ranking for the maize varieties was WE5323 > ZM1523 > WE3128. Drought-tolerant maize varieties can be useful in heat stress mitigation. This information is useful for the simulation of maize yields for heat stress-prone areas in Sub-Saharan Africa.","[Chukwudi, Uchechukwu Paschal; Mavengahama, Sydney] North West Univ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Agr Sci, Food Secur & Safety Niche Area, ZA-2745 Mmabatho, South Africa; [Chukwudi, Uchechukwu Paschal] Univ Nigeria, Fac Agr, Dept Crop Sci, Nsukka 410002, Nigeria; [Kutu, Funso Raphael] Univ Mpumalanga, Sch Agr Sci, ZA-1200 Mbombela, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; University of Nigeria,"Chukwudi, UP (corresponding author), North West Univ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Agr Sci, Food Secur & Safety Niche Area, ZA-2745 Mmabatho, South Africa.;Chukwudi, UP (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Fac Agr, Dept Crop Sci, Nsukka 410002, Nigeria.",uchechukwu.chukwudi@unn.edu.ng; funso.kutu@ump.ac.za; sydney.mavengahama@nwu.ac.za,,"Kutu, Funso Raphael/0000-0002-8162-0329; Chukwudi, Uchechukwu Paschal/0000-0003-3197-736X",North-West University,North-West University,The authors fully acknowledge the financial support of the North-West University bursaries to U.P.C.,,56,8,8,6,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2223-7747,,PLANTS-BASEL,Plants-Basel,AUG,2021,10,8,,,,,,,1532,10.3390/plants10081532,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants10081532,,,15,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,UH7PU,34451577,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000690118600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adaptation strategies frequently propose ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) as a model for transformative change. However, several studies point to difficulties implementing EBA across the world. The aim of this paper is to assess to what extent social-ecological systems approaches and common pool resource (CPR) governance theories could inform EBA. Data obtained from interviews and surveys with policy makers and residents in South Africa's Garden Route District were interpreted using the robustness framework (RF) and the design principles (DPs), two common tools for analyzing CPR governance. We found that the Garden Route coast is threatened by negative interactions between hard public and private infrastructures and ecological infrastructures (the cornerstone of EBA) which are driven by weak local government bodies and asymmetrical power relations. By coding the data for elements/interactions within the RF and then identifying and mapping the DPs onto the RF, we also revealed ways to leverage transformative EBA in the Garden Route. Our analyses suggest that the interactions between human-made and ecological infrastructures, as well as power relation, should be at the core of any development debate. Trade-offs should aim for maximum congruence between sustainability and equity in ecosystem services provisioning. This paper provides some considerations for researchers and decision makers to leverage transformative EBA that could potentially apply to areas experiencing similar challenges.","[Guerbois, Chloe; de Swardt, Abigail G.; Fabricius, Christo] Nelson Mandela Univ, Sustainabil Res Unit, George Campus,POB 6531, ZA-6530 George, South Africa; [Brady, Ute] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Ctr Behav Inst & Environm, Tempe, AZ USA; [Fabricius, Christo] World Wildlife Fund, 1250 24th St,NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA",Nelson Mandela University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; World Wildlife Fund,"Guerbois, C (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela Univ, Sustainabil Res Unit, George Campus,POB 6531, ZA-6530 George, South Africa.",chloe.guerbois@mandela.ac.za; ubrady@asu.edu; abigail.deswardt@hotmail.com; christo.fabricius@mandela.ac.za,"BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/AAC-9538-2021","BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/0000-0002-3614-9910; Fabricius, Christo/0000-0003-2223-5671; Guerbois, Chloe/0000-0003-3746-0548",National Research Foundation of South Africa under the Belmont Forum agreement [UID 86974],National Research Foundation of South Africa under the Belmont Forum agreement,This work is based on the research supported in part by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (grant number: UID 86974) under the Belmont Forum agreement.,,50,7,7,0,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Livelihoods in the province are intimately tied to increasingly scarce and contested ecosystem goods and services. The population's climate vulnerability is further exacerbated by social, economic, and cultural drivers of vulnerability, such as rapid population growth, pervasive corruption, and inadequate community participation in planning processes. Scholars and practitioners have begun conceptualizing and implementing adaptive comanagement (ACM) approaches in NTB. ACM is an environmental governance approach for complex, multi-scale social-ecological systems facing uncertainty and rapid system changes. ACM aims to forge vertical and horizontal links for shared learning between the various actors of multi-level resource management systems. The province's markedly heterogeneous physical and social geographies present a unique opportunity to glean lessons applicable to a range of contexts including rural communities, island geographies, the Indonesian archipelago, the tropical Asia-Pacific region, and the developing world more broadly. This paper provides a systematic review of efforts to conceptualize, implement, and evaluate adaptive comanagement approaches in Nusa Tenggara Barat. In doing so, it characterizes the literature, discerns salient thematic components, and identifies areas for further research and action on the conceptualization and implementation of adaptive comanagement.

Despite the recession in malaria cases, previously malaria free areas are increasingly confronted with epidemics as a result of changing environmental and socioeconomic conditions. Next to modeling transmission intensities and probabilities, integrated spatial methods targeting the complex interplay of factors that contribute to social vulnerability are required to effectively reduce malaria burden. We propose an integrative method for mapping relative levels of social vulnerability in a spatially explicit manner to support the identification of intervention measures. Methods: Based on a literature review, a holistic risk and vulnerability framework has been developed to guide the assessment of social vulnerability to water-related vector-borne diseases (VBDs) in the context of changing environmental and societal conditions. Building on the framework, this paper applies spatially explicit modeling for delineating homogeneous regions of social vulnerability to malaria in eastern Africa, while taking into account expert knowledge for weighting the single vulnerability indicators. To assess the influence of the selected indicators on the final index a local sensitivity analysis is carried out. Results: Results indicate that high levels of malaria vulnerability are concentrated in the highlands, where immunity within the population is currently low. Additionally, regions with a lack of access to education and health services aggravate vulnerability. Lower values can be found in regions with relatively low poverty, low population pressure, low conflict density and reduced contributions from the biological susceptibility domain. Overall, the factors characterizing vulnerability vary spatially in the region. The vulnerability index reveals a high level of robustness in regard to the final choice of input datasets, with the exception of the immunity indicator which has a marked impact on the composite vulnerability index. Conclusions: We introduce a conceptual framework for modeling risk and vulnerability to VBDs. Drawing on the framework we modeled social vulnerability to malaria in the context of global change using a spatially explicit approach. The results provide decision makers with place-specific options for targeting interventions that aim at reducing the burden of the disease amongst the different vulnerable population groups.","[Kienberger, Stefan; Hagenlocher, Michael] Salzburg Univ, Interfac Dept Geoinformat Z GIS, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria",Salzburg University,"Kienberger, S (corresponding author), Salzburg Univ, Interfac Dept Geoinformat Z GIS, Schillerstr 30, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",stefan.kienberger@sbg.ac.at; michael.hagenlocher@sbg.ac.at,,"Hagenlocher, Michael/0000-0002-5254-6713; Kienberger, Stefan/0000-0002-4800-4516",,,,,88,59,61,0,50,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1476-072X,,,INT J HEALTH GEOGR,Int.

An initial step in such a development towards tailored climate information would be to understand the currently available climate indices, their definitions and contexts. This study systematically reviews the scientific literature on climate indices and factors related to specific climate impacts, and in this way identifies currently available climate indices for Swedish forestry and agriculture. The identified indices are analysed relative to climate change impact categories from the vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans set out by the Swedish Forest Agency and the Swedish Board of Agriculture, to indicate development potentials and research gaps in climate indices. The review identifies 79 definitions of climate indices for forestry and 63 indices for agriculture in Sweden. The reviewed literature has employed or developed climate indices for only 11 of the 25 types of climate impact emphasised as important by the two sectoral authorities. Most of the climate indices identified have been adopted for use in modelling forest growth or crop growth and productivity. The results of the review found indices lacking for a substantial number of impacts that are relevant for Swedish forestry and agriculture. The study shows that scientific literature on climate indices to a very limited degree addresses the specific tailoring of climate indices. Potential reasons for the lack of climate indices are discussed, and the study suggests that there is a need to continue climate model development such that the models better represent relevant processes, to advance research on the co-design of indices together with sectoral stakeholders, and to enhance collaboration between adaptation, impact modelling and climatology research. The results of this study may be used in future research to analyse if and how the identified climate indices can be actionable for different stakeholders, and as a foundation to examine the demands and feasibilities of developing new tailored climate indices.","[Wirehn, L.] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Wirehn, L (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",lotten.wirehn@liu.se,,"Wirehn, Lotten/0000-0003-4014-1441",Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2019-01560],Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),This study was funded by the Swedish Research Council FORMAS (under Grant No. 2019-01560).,,117,2,2,5,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

The existing literature mainly considers strengthening adaptive capacity as a steady and linear process. This article explores possibilities to fast track positive adaptive capacity trajectories of small-scale farmers in the Northern Region of Ghana. Leverage points were identified by triangulating data from semi-structured interviews with farmers (n=72), key informant interviews (n=7) and focus group discussions (FG1 n=17; FG2 n=20). The results present two ways to approach adaptation planning: 1) using four generic leverage points (gender equality, social learning, information and knowledge, and access to finance) or 2) combining the adaptive capacity and leverage point frameworks, thereby creating 15 associations. The generic points provide a set of topics as a starting point for policy and intervention planning activities, while the 15 associations support the identification of place-specific leverage points. Four benefits of using leverage points for adaptive capacity in adaptation planning were identified: guidance on where to intervene in a system, ability to deal with complex systems, inclusion of both causal and teleological decision-making, and a possibility to target deep, transformative change.","[Rosengren, Linda M.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, Fac Agr & Forestry, Helsinki, Finland; [Rosengren, Linda M.; Sell, Mila; Vihinen, Hilkka] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Unit Bioecon & Environm, Helsinki, Finland; [Raymond, Christopher M.] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, Helsinki, Finland; [Raymond, Christopher M.] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Ecosyst & Environm Res Program, Helsinki, Finland; [Raymond, Christopher M.] Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry Sci, Dept Econ & Management, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Rosengren, LM (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, Fac Agr & Forestry, Helsinki, Finland.;Rosengren, LM (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Unit Bioecon & Environm, Helsinki, Finland.",linda.rosengren@luke.fi,"Raymond, Christopher/G-2712-2010","Raymond, Christopher/0000-0002-7165-885X; Rosengren, Linda/0000-0002-8365-8726; Vihinen, Hilkka/0000-0002-8300-0721",European Union LEAP-Agri ERA-Net; Academy of Finland,European Union LEAP-Agri ERA-Net; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),This research was supported by the European Union LEAP-Agri ERA-Net and the Academy of Finland through the project Participatory Pathways to Sustainable Intensification.

Poor socioeconomic development, rough and highly unstable geography, inadequate institutional capacity to deal with research, development and policy and mostly underdeveloped infrastructures, all have contributed to increasing vulnerability of communities and ecosystems, and have limited their adaptive capacity. Over the past decade, Nepal has made significant progress, particularly in developing and implementing policies and frameworks and establishing institutional mechanisms with the support of donor countries, UN and multilateral agencies. As the global climate politics is getting more complicated, international financing patterns-both climate and development finance-are shifting their ways, forcing the countries like Nepal to diversify the funding base for climate change actions and integrate them within national development plans and strategies. Using the data and information currently available, we analyze the existing financing situations, discuss the future scenarios and suggest policy recommendations to develop a set of long-term adaptation and impact mitigation strategies in specific and environmental change at large. When short-term adaptation strategies funded from existing financial arrangements and other related bilateral and multilateral sources particularly European countries, seem to be encouraging, we stress the need of public-private partnership-driven full-fledged green economy focusing on renewable energy and transport, agriculture and forestry, water and water-induced disasters, as well as tourism and hospitality.","[Mahat, Tek Jung; Blaha, Ludek; Bittner, Michal] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Res Ctr Tox Cpds Environm RECETOX, Kamenice 5, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Mahat, Tek Jung] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Environm Sci, Ctr Climate Res & Advocacy, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Uprety, Batu] Minist Environm, Kathmandu, Nepal",Masaryk University Brno; Tribhuvan University,"Bittner, M (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Res Ctr Tox Cpds Environm RECETOX, Kamenice 5, Brno 62500, Czech Republic.",tmahat@gmail.com; michal.bittner@recetox.muni.cz,"Mahat, Tek Jung/V-1153-2019; Blaha, Ludek/N-6343-2013","Mahat, Tek Jung/0000-0002-7128-4616; Blaha, Ludek/0000-0002-7314-7455; Bittner, Michal/0000-0003-1841-3391","Erasmus Mundus Action 2 (Experts4Asia); RECETOX Research Infrastructure [LM2015051, CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_013/0001761]",Erasmus Mundus Action 2 (Experts4Asia); RECETOX Research Infrastructure,This research was co-financed by the Erasmus Mundus Action 2 (Experts4Asia) and RECETOX Research Infrastructure (LM2015051 and CZ. 02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_013/0001761).,,71,19,19,9,50,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2190-4707,2190-4715,,ENVIRON SCI EUR,Environ.

Using Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), we investigate how hot temperatures, manifested as heat stress, is affecting the intentions of moving among the urban population in three Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines). We conducted an online survey with 2219 respondents. Almost all respondents (98%) had experienced heat stress, albeit at different levels. When asked whether respondents would be likely to move away from their current locations because of heat, nearly a quarter (23%) reported that they were very likely to do so, and 50% that they probably would. Stronger moving intentions because of heat were associated with women and older people. Concerns about increases from damage from heat (threat appraisal) were more strongly associated with moving intentions than an understanding of the costs and benefits (coping appraisal). Among the threat appraisal, heat stress levels and risk perception were the strongest predictors of moving intentions because of heat. The results contrast with the findings of migration studies in response to sudden onset hazards and underpin the differences in adaptation behaviour in response to different climate change impacts. Moving away to cooler places as an adaptation strategy to heat may be challenging to foresee in terms of timing, capabilities, destination and potential costs because it may not happen soon. We strongly recommend further research on climate change migration of the urban population, including within urban and urban-to-urban movements. While many people move back after sudden onset disasters, heat potentially leads to permanent movements given it is likely to be better planned, and as the habitability of some places is increasingly compromised. Overall the effects of slow onset environmental hazards such as pollution and heat on migration warrant more research attention given the rapidity of urban population growth, particularly in the global south.","[Zander, Kerstin K.] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Zander, Kerstin K.; Richerzhagen, Carmen] German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany; [Garnett, Stephen T.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT, Australia",Charles Darwin University; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Charles Darwin University,"Zander, KK (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT, Australia.",kerstin.zander@cdu.edu.au,"Zander, Kerstin/M-2888-2013","Zander, Kerstin/0000-0002-2237-1801","Faculty of Law, Education, Business and Arts (LEBA) at Charles Darwin University - Alexander von Humboldt Foundation","Faculty of Law, Education, Business and Arts (LEBA) at Charles Darwin University - Alexander von Humboldt Foundation","We are grateful for the financial support from the Faculty of Law, Education, Business and Arts (LEBA) at Charles Darwin University who sponsored this research through its small grant scheme.

This paper presents findings of a study conducted through a mixed methods design in a flood risk city in Malawi, Sub-Saharan Africa. The study assesses the city's vulnerability to floods and actions being taken to reduce the risks. It then investigates how resettlement is being promoted as one such risk reduction measure. The study finds multiple vulnerability factors, including unsafe construction practices, poor drainage systems, unregulated solid waste disposal, institutional incapacity, inadequacy of land, settlements in high risk areas, deforestation, siltation of rivers and national disaster risk reduction policies that neglect urban areas. However, efforts to tackle underlying causes of vulnerability are wanting. One positive programme is a slum upgrading pilot project implemented by non-state actors that also lacks government support. In the case of resettlement, its planning and execution is fraught with multiple challenges emanating from haphazard planning and lack of community participation. The paper argues that the emphasis on resettlement is obscuring the key drivers of vulnerability, while simultaneously exposing both resettled and those left behind to further risks. It, therefore, calls for caution when planning and implementing disaster risk reduction policies that have the potential to create new forms of vulnerability to hazards or exacerbate them.","[Kita, Stern Mwakalimi] Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Sch Global Studies, Geog, Arts Bldg C, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England; [Kita, Stern Mwakalimi] Dept Disaster Management Affairs, Lilongwe, Malawi",University of Sussex,"Kita, SM (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Sch Global Studies, Geog, Arts Bldg C, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",stenkita@gmail.com,,"Kita, Stern Mwakalimi/0000-0002-8339-1697",University of Sussex's Chancellor's International Research Scholarship,University of Sussex's Chancellor's International Research Scholarship,This research was funded as part of a broader PhD study supported by the University of Sussex's Chancellor's International Research Scholarship.,,60,35,38,3,65,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

In Mediterranean areas, viticulture is closely influenced by vine water status. In this context, the practice of irrigation may alleviate water-stress-related reductions in plant development to guarantee grape quality, especially in semi-arid areas. The application of on-farm compost in a vineyard may affect grape quality without negative effects, thereby enhancing environmental sustainability. The aim of this work was to investigate the combined effect of irrigation and compost application on the Montepulciano variety in the volcanic environment of Latium region, thereby improving the polyphenol concentrations in the berries. The trial was conducted during three growing seasons (2011-2013). Irrigation was performed according to the protocol proposed by Ojeda and Saurin (2014). The pre-dawn leaf water potential (Psi pd) from July to September was measured weekly for maintaining vine water status in the range between -0.4 and -0.6 Mpa. Irrigation (I) and irrigation plus compost application (IC) were compared to a non-irrigated control (C). Berry weight was not influenced by moderate irrigation, whereas titratable acidity and total soluble solids were negatively correlated to the increment of water dropped. The primary finding was a positive influence on polyphenol contents of the grapes at harvest. Best performance was highlighted in 2012 with 263 liter vine(-1) of water supplied. Overall, the sustainable use of water and on-farm compost improved Montepulciano grape quality in this volcanic area, thereby enhancing the adaptation of Mediterranean viticulture to climate change conditions.","[Cirigliano, Pasquale; Labagnara, Tilde] CREA VE Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr Viticol, Viale Santa Margherita 80, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy; [Chiriaco, Maria Vincenza] CMCC Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climati, Div Impacts Agr Forests & Ecosyst Serv, Viterbo, Italy; [Chiriaco, Maria Vincenza] Univ Tuscia, DIBAF Dipartimento Innovaz Sistemi Biol Agroalime, Via San Camillo de Lellis,Snc 0110, I-0110 Viterbo, Italy; [Nunez, Abelardo] Univ Autonoma Chihuahua, Fac Ciencias Agrotecnol, Cd Univ, Chihuahua 31310, Mexico; [Dal Monte, Giovanni] CREA CMC Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr, Unita Ric Climatol & Meteorol Applicate Agr, Via Navicella 2-4, I-00184 Rome, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Tuscia University; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Labagnara, T (corresponding author), CREA VE Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr Viticol, Viale Santa Margherita 80, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy.",tilde.labagnara@crea.gov.it,,"CHIRIACO', Maria Vincenza/0000-0002-9662-914X; Tilde, Labagnara/0000-0001-5993-7787","Italian Ministry of Agriculture (MIPAAF - Ministero delle Politiche Agricole, Alimentari e Forestali); OIGA project VINI3S (Sostenibilita ambientale nella produzione di vini Salubri e di qualita Superiore)","Italian Ministry of Agriculture (MIPAAF - Ministero delle Politiche Agricole, Alimentari e Forestali); OIGA project VINI3S (Sostenibilita ambientale nella produzione di vini Salubri e di qualita Superiore)",";We gratefully acknowledge for this project the co-financial support of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture (MIPAAF - Ministero delle Politiche Agricole, Alimentari e Forestali) within the framework of the OIGA project VINI3S (Sostenibilita ambientale nella produzione di vini Salubri e di qualita Superiore) and COMEF (Riutilizzo di biomasse di seconda generazione per la produzione multifunzionale di COmpost, MEtano e Funghi eduli a minimo impatto ambientale).

Households play an important role in responding to the impact of a changing climate by creating a functional link between individual and community responses to change. However, household perspectives on their capacity needs are rarely sought in programs seeking to provide incentives for household action-despite the influence of normative values and perceptions on household action. Rather, interventions are often informed by quantitative measures of adaptive capacity, such as access to financial or social capital. An alternative approach involves analysis of social narratives of capability that reflect normative perceptions of climate risk and capacity needs. Implementation of this approach reveals that a significant number of households in vulnerable locations consider existing capacities sufficient to manage familiar climate hazards, regardless of socio-economic circumstance. Our comparative study of two Australian coastal communities also suggests that a dominant narrative of capability to manage climate hazards reduces the likelihood of household investments in adaptive actions. While socio-political influences on narratives are often deeply embedded and difficult to change in the short term, identifying perceived risk and response capacity is pivotal in determining the likely utility of adaptive capacity stocks as measured through quantitative means.","[Elrick-Barr, Carmen E.; Thomsen, Dana C.; Smith, Timothy F.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia; [Preston, Benjamin L.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN USA",University of the Sunshine Coast; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Elrick-Barr, CE (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia.",celrick@usc.edu.au; dthomsen@usc.edu.au; prestonbl@ornl.gov; Tsmith5@usc.edu.au,"Elrick-Barr, Carmen/Q-9861-2019; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Preston, Benjamin L/B-9001-2012","Elrick-Barr, Carmen/0000-0001-6868-1373; Preston, Benjamin L/0000-0002-7966-2386; Smith, Timothy/0000-0002-3991-5211",,,,,45,20,21,2,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Future development in extremes under climate change is, however, uncertain. In this paper, we explore impacts of uncertainty and learning about increasing water levels on dike investment. We extend previous work in which a constant rate of structural water level increase is assumed. We introduce a probability distribution for this rate and study the impact of learning about this rate. We model learning as a single stochastic event where full information becomes available. Numerical solutions are obtained with dynamic programming. We find that the expected value of information can be substantial. Before information arrives, investment size is reduced as compared with the benchmark without learning, but investment frequency may be increased. The impact of learning on the initial investment strategy, however, is small as compared with the impact of uncertainty about increasing water levels by itself.","[van der Pol, T. D.; van Ierland, E.

This raises a critical epistemological challenge for CSD: how can we know who is vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change, and why are they vulnerable to particular impacts? In this paper, we consider both the epistemological tension arising over the construction of vulnerability that emerges at the intersection of the physical and social science communities within CSD and a second, less-discussed epistemological stress surrounding how user identities are understood within the social science community engaged in CSD-related research and implementation. We illustrate these tensions through the example of a climate services programme that delivers agrometeorological advice to farmers in Mali, demonstrating the ramifications of these epistemological issues for the design and delivery of services that further development and adaptation goals.","[Carr, Edward R.; Owusu-Daaku, Kwame N.] Univ S Carolina, Dept Geog, Humanitarian Response & Dev Lab, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Carr, ER (corresponding author), Univ S Carolina, Dept Geog, Humanitarian Response & Dev Lab, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",carr@sc.edu,"Carr, Edward R/A-7206-2009","Carr, Edward/0000-0001-7784-471X","Office of Global Climate Change, Bureau for Economic Growth, Education and Environment, U.S. Agency for International Development [5010-FP1-USC]","Office of Global Climate Change, Bureau for Economic Growth, Education and Environment, U.S. Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID))","The authors would like to thank Jeff Popke and two anonymous reviewers for their guidance in the framing of this article, and our colleagues in the Humanitarian Response and Development Lab (HURDL) in the Department of Geography at the University of South Carolina for their support on the larger project to which this article belongs.

During the last two decades, access to multi-system integration of climate models has given rise to the concept of using model ensembles to issue probabilistic climatological projections. These probabilistic projections have not yet been exploited to the full extent in decision support, and are still used to mainly quantify uncertainty bands only for selected climate variables and indicators. One of the reasons of this limited use is the fact that the multi-system ensemble dispersion is sub-optimal and does not provide an accurate and reliable representation of the predictive probability density, which is essential for rational decision support under uncertain conditions. The aims of this paper are twofold. First, it seeks to highlight the potential benefits of using climate projections in conjunction with Bayesian paradigms towards educated decision-making. Second, it discusses how to appropriately formulate probabilistic forecasts by coherently integrating information contained in climate projection ensembles with observations to improve the estimation of the probability density function of future climate states. The results show that the proposed Bayesian approach yields unbiased and sharper predictive distributions for temperature with respect to using the unprocessed ensemble distribution.

The authors analyze the main opportunities and risks of implementing the Strategy for the Socioeconomic Development of the Russian Federation with Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions until 2050. The key role of the global climate agenda, determined by the leading countries of the world, primarily the European Union, in shaping the institutional environment that influences decision making in the field of national economic policy, is emphasized. It is argued that there is no automatic positive relationship between the race for so-called carbon neutrality of the economy by 2050, prescribed by the global climate agenda, and the achievement of the sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. Principles and approaches to reduce the risks of decarbonization of the economy are formulated. These provide for the integration of a set of measures to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions with those to adapt communities and economic systems to climate change, and harmonize the measures above with the national goals of long-term sustainable development. Estimates of the economic effects of implementation of various scenarios of the decarbonization of the national economy and the associated risks of the global energy transition for Russia are introduced.","[Porfiriev, B.

The present paper analyzes the value of climate services which are aimed at improving agricultural productivity through a reduction in weather-associated risks. The first part provides a theoretical foundation for estimating the value of climate services based on a stochastic life-cycle model of a rural household which faces uncertainty with respect to the timing and the size of an adverse weather shock. We subsequently calibrate the model to match the environment of coffee producers in the Cusco region of Peru and provide a range of estimates for the value of climate services for a single average household, the region, and the country as a whole. In the second part of the paper we use empirical data to corroborate the numerical estimates. We assess the value of climate services in the agricultural sector in Cusco based on a choice experiment approach. Data are analyzed using a standard as well as a random parameter logit model allowing for preference heterogeneity. Farmers show a significant willingness-to-pay for enhanced climate services which is particularly related to the service accuracy and geographic resolution. On average, the yearly value of a climate service in the coffee sector is found to be $21 per ha and $8.2 million for Peru as a whole. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to evaluate emergence, yield and financial benefits of maize, finger millet and sorghum, planted at different dates and managed with variable soil nutrient inputs in order to develop adaptation options for stabilizing food production and income for smallholder households in the face of climate change and variability. Field experiments with maize, finger millet and sorghum were conducted in farmers' fields in Makoni and Hwedza districts in eastern Zimbabwe for three seasons: 2009/10,2010/11 and 2011/12. Three fertilization rates: high (90 kg N ha(-1), 26 kg Pha(-1), 7 t ha(-1) manure), low (35 kg N ha(-1), 14 kg P ha(-1), 3 t ha(-1) manure) and a control (zero fertilization); and three planting dates: early, normal and late, were compared. Crop emergence for the unfertilized finger millet and sorghum was <15% compared with >70% for the fertilized treatments. In contrast, the emergence for maize (a medium-maturity hybrid cultivar, SC635), was >80% regardless of the amount of fertilizer applied. Maize yield was greater than that of finger millet and sorghum, also in the season (2010/11) which had poor rainfall distribution. Maize yielded 5.4 t ha(-1) compared with 3.1 t ha(-1) for finger millet and 3.3 t ha(-1) for sorghum for the early plantings in the 2009/10 rainfall season in Makoni, a site with relatively fertile soils. In the poorer 2010/11 season, early planted maize yielded 2.4 t ha(-1), against 1.6 t ha(-1) for finger millet and 0.4 t ha(-1) for sorghum in Makoni. Similar yield trends were observed on the nutrient-depleted soils in Hwedza, although yields were less than those observed in Makoni. All crops yielded significantly more with increasing rates of fertilization when planting was done early or in what farmers considered the 'normal window'. Crops planted early or during the normal planting window gave comparable yields that were greater than yields of late-planted crops. Water productivity for each crop planted early or during the normal window increased with increase in the amount of fertilizer applied, but differed between crop type. Maize had the highest water productivity (8.0 kg dry matter mm(-1) ha(-1)) followed by sorghum (4.9 kg mm(-1) ha(-1)) and then finger millet (4.6 kg mm(-1) ha(-1)) when a high fertilizer rate was applied to the early-planted crop. Marginal rates of return for maize production were greater for the high fertilization rate (>50%) than for thelow rate (<50%). However, the financial returns for finger millet were more attractive for the low fertilization rate (>100%) than for the high rate (<100%). Although maize yield was greater compared with finger millet, the latter had a higher content of calcium and can be stored for up to five years. The superiority of maize, in terms of yields, over finger millet and sorghum, suggests that the recommendation to substitute maize with small grains may not be a robust option for adaptation to increased temperatures and more frequent droughts likely to be experienced in Zimbabwe and other parts of southern Africa.

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method for a systematic review, it assessed the strength of the evidence supporting the potential for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED (R)) credit requirements to reduce the adverse effects of extreme heat events and/or enhance a building's passive survivability (i.e., the ability to continue to function during utility outages) during those events. The PRISMA Flow Diagram resulted in the selection of 12 LEED for New Construction (LEED NC) credits for inclusion in the review. Following a preliminary scan of evidence supporting public health co-benefits of the LEED for Neighborhood Development rating system, queries were submitted in PubMed using National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings Terms. Queries identified links between LEED credit requirements and risk of exposure to extreme heat, environmental determinants of health, co-benefits to public health outcomes, and co-benefits to built environment outcomes. Public health co-benefits included reducing the risk of vulnerability to heat stress and reducing heat-related morbidity and mortality. The results lay the groundwork for collaboration across the public health, civil society, climate change, and green building sectors.","[Houghton, Adele] Biositu LLC, Houston, TX 77006 USA; [Castillo-Salgado, Carlos] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Houghton, A (corresponding author), Biositu LLC, Houston, TX 77006 USA.",adeleh@biositu.com; ccastil3@jhu.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Houghton, Adele/0000-0002-6861-1591","Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Office of Public Health Practice and Training [Lipitz Public Health Policy grant]","Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Office of Public Health Practice and Training [Lipitz Public Health Policy grant]","This work was supported by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Office of Public Health Practice and Training [Lipitz Public Health Policy grant].",,119,3,3,8,41,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

This paper reviews the key drivers of change facing the built environment and analyses the major challenges facing the built environment industry, broadly constituted, in adapting to these drivers.","[Pinnegar, Simon; Marceau, Jane; Randolph, Bill] Univ NSW, Fac Built Environm, City Futures Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Randolph, Bill] Univ NSW, Fac Built Environm, AHURI Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Pinnegar, S (corresponding author), Univ NSW, Fac Built Environm, City Futures Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",,"Randolph, Bill/GQQ-7387-2022","Randolph, Bill/0000-0001-6815-0935",,,,,26,13,14,3,11,ECONTENT MANAGEMENT,MALENY,"PO BOX 1027, MALENY, QUEENSLAND 4552, AUSTRALIA",1447-9338,,,INNOV-MANAG POLICY P,Innov.-Manag.

We explore discourses of contestation over a major environmental policy, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, intended to reallocate irrigation water to restore the environment in south-eastern Australia. We examine three areas of scientific knowledge and decision-making at the science-policy interface: (1) water accounting and availability; (2) perspectives on ecological change and (3) issues of trust and the management of environmental water. Engagement and communication between scientists, bureaucrats and the public forms the basis for understanding contestation: over different sets of values, expectations of what scientists can deliver, perceptions of risk and uncertainty, interpretation of conflicting messages and economic development versus conservation. The Basin Plan was shaped by institutional processes not designed to account for such differences and has inadvertently promoted contestation through exclusion of world views that do not fit those of the decision makers. We consider how the Basin Plan can be re-framed by changing the values, rules and knowledge that set the decision context. These changes enable the Basin Plan to be re-conceptualised from a problem to be solved to an idea that can mobilise imaginative engagement by agents with diverse perspectives.","[Colloff, Matthew J.; Pittock, Jamie] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Colloff, MJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Matthew.Colloff@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,74,26,26,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",1324-1583,2204-227X,,AUSTRALAS J WAT RESO,Australas.

Flood protection and drainage are needed to make this low-lying country habitable and suitable for agriculture and other land uses: more than 65% of the Netherlands is protected by dykes against flooding. The likely impacts of climate change in combination with socio-economic developments call for proactive and innovative plans. The new policies and standards are based on an innovative approach: instead of focusing only on prevention, the new standards take into account both the probability of flooding as well as the potential impacts and risks of flooding, for example the individual risk of being hit by a flood. Based on these new standards, conservation, adaptation and mitigation actions are used to create a multi-layer safety approach that focuses on the water management system as well as spatial planning. Examples are presented of changes in perspectives and how flood protection, water management and spatial planning are being combined.

While existing global assessments of irrigation expansion mainly illustrate the biophysical potential for irrigation, socioeconomic factors such as weak governance or low income, that demonstrably impede the successful implementation of sustainable irrigation, remain largely underexplored. Here we provide five scenarios of sustainable irrigation deployment in the 21st century integrated into the framework of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, which account for biophysical irrigation limits and socioeconomic constraints. We find that the potential for sustainable irrigation expansion implied by biophysical limits alone is considerably reduced when socioeconomic factors are considered. Even under an optimistic scenario of socio-economic development, we find that additional calories produced via sustainable irrigation by 2100 might reach only half of the maximum biophysical potential. Regions with currently modest socioeconomic development such as Sub-Saharan Africa are found to have the highest potential for improvements. In a scenario of sustainable development, Sub-Saharan Africa would be able to almost double irrigated food production and feed an additional 70 million people compared to 2020, whereas in a scenario where regional rivalry prevails, this potential would be halved. Increasing sustainable irrigation will be key for countries to meet the projected food demands, tackle malnutrition and rural poverty in the context of increasing impacts of anthropogenic climate change on food systems. Our results suggest that improving governance levels for example through enhancing the effectiveness of institutions will constitute an important leverage to increase adaptive capacity in the agricultural sector.","[van Maanen, Nicole; Andrijevic, Marina; Lejeune, Quentin; Lissner, Tabea; Schleussner, Carl-Friedrich] Climate Analyt, Berlin, Germany; [van Maanen, Nicole; Andrijevic, Marina; Schleussner, Carl-Friedrich] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany; [van Maanen, Nicole; Andrijevic, Marina; Schleussner, Carl-Friedrich] Humboldt Univ, IRI THESys, Berlin, Germany; [Rosa, Lorenzo] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA USA",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Carnegie Institution for Science,"van Maanen, N (corresponding author), Climate Analyt, Berlin, Germany.;van Maanen, N (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany.;van Maanen, N (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, IRI THESys, Berlin, Germany.",nicole.vanmaanen@climateanalytics.org,,"Lejeune, Quentin/0000-0001-9152-3197; Lissner, Tabea/0000-0001-6637-6084; Andrijevic, Marina/0000-0003-0199-1988; Rosa, Lorenzo/0000-0002-1280-9945",EU [821124]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LN1711A],EU(European Commission); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),The authors N V M and T L acknowledge support from the EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program NAVIGATE under Grant Agreement No. 821124.

The foundations are to identify plausible social-ecological trajectories, to apply upstream and deliberate engagement and decision-making with stakeholders, to formulate management pathways to desired futures, and to consider a portfolio approach to manage risk and account for multiple preferences across space and time.

While T-surf drives many biophysical processes, air temperature (T-a) is an equally important target for climate mitigation and adaptation. Whether reductions in T-surf translate to reductions in T-a remains complex, fraught by several nonlinear and intertwined processes. In particular, forest canopy structure strongly affects near-surface temperature gradients, complicating cross-site comparison. Here the influence of reforestation on T-a is assessed by targeting temperature metrics that are less sensitive to local canopy effects. Specifically, we consider the aerodynamic temperature (T-aero), estimated using a novel procedure that does not rely on the assumptions of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, as well as the extrapolated temperature into the surface layer (T-extrap). The approach is tested with flux tower data from a grass field, pine plantation, and mature hardwood stand co-located in the Duke Forest (North Carolina, USA). During growing season daytime periods, T-surf is 4-6 degrees C cooler, and T-aero and near-surface T-extrap are 2-3 degrees C cooler, in the forests relative to the grassland. During the dormant season, daytime differences are smaller but still substantial. At night, differences in T-aero are small, and near-surface T-extrap is warmer over forests than grasslands during the growing season (by 0.5 to 1 degrees C). Finally, the influence of land cover on T-extrap at the interface between the surface and mixed layer is small. Overall, reforestation appears to provide a meaningful opportunity for adaption to warmer daytime T-a in the southeastern United States, especially during the growing season. Plain Language Summary Reforestation-the process of reestablishing trees where they once dominated-has long been viewed as a strategy to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Recently, attention has focused on understanding if reforestation also offers a direct temperature cooling benefit. By using more water (a cooling process) and increasing the transfer of heat energy away from the surface, forests may offer a meaningful opportunity for local climate mitigation and adaptation. Evidence is mounting that indeed, in the temperature and tropical zones, the surface of forests is cooler than grasslands and croplands. However, due to confounding effects of forest canopies on wind and temperature profiles near the surface, it has previously been hard to assess if forests also cool the air. Here we present a new approach that accounts for canopy effects, allowing for a more direct assessment of the potential for reforestation to cool near-surface air temperature. Using a case study from the North Carolina Piedmont, we find that while the air cooling effect of forests is not a large as the surface cooling effect, it is still on the order of 2-3 degrees C during summer daytime periods-times when the need for climate adaptation strategies are","[Novick, Kimberly A.] Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Katul, Gabriel G.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Duke University,"Novick, KA (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",knovick@indiana.edu,"Katul, Gabriel G/A-7210-2008","Katul, Gabriel G/0000-0001-9768-3693",National Science Foundation (NSF) through NSF-DEB [1552747]; NSF-AGS [1644382]; NSF-IOS [1754893]; NASA-ROSES Carboy Cycle Science grant [NNX17AE69G],National Science Foundation (NSF) through NSF-DEB(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF-AGS; NSF-IOS(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA-ROSES Carboy Cycle Science grant,"The authors are grateful to C.-I.

This kind of interventions ultimately leads to a microclimatic change in a city. Prediction of microclimate data for a whole day in a large area due to changes in outdoor spaces is time and cost demanding. A model for prediction of hourly microclimatic data in a region for a whole day by employing Fourier analysis of past (measured) and future (simulated from a CFD analysis) microclimate data of a limited period (sunlight hours) was also developed. The whole building energy simulation software TAS-EDSL was applied for a quite large built space (similar to 500 m x 500 m), for simultaneous simulations in all buildings in the area, and took into account detailed building construction data, mutual shading between buildings and local climatic conditions. In this context, strategies and practices that a building complex should follow in the future in relation to climate change could be investigated. Simulation estimations of cooling loads of building spaces were related to buildings' age, orientation and height. Main outcome of the study was the ability to assess building energy performance due to exterior micro- climate improvement, simultaneously, for about 200 buildings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To help face these challenges farm advisers have become a sounding board and source of ideas and support. Whilst the role of farm advisers in providing this support has been described in the scholarly community, limited attention has been given to the nature of the farm-adviser relationship and how it is built and maintained. This is important, given the greater role farm advisers are expected to play in providing privatised extension services. This paper describes and analyses the building and maintenance of the farmer-advisor relationship from the perspective of farmers in the south-eastern Australian grains industry. Drawing on qualitative analysis of 30 in-depth interviews of farmers with an existing relationship with an agronomist, the processes of advisory relationship building, maintenance, and the nature of commitment to an adviser were explored. The farmers' commitment was influenced by levels of satisfaction with the service, previous investment in building the relationship, and whether there were advisory alternatives. This knowledge is useful for farmers in establishing and maintaining effective working relationships with their advisors, for advisors in understanding client expectations, and for agricultural policymakers and education providers in increasing demand for advisory services from farmers and in targeting farm advisor training. This paper makes a theoretical contribution by presenting a novel description of the social processes contributing to a committed farmer-adviser relationship.","[Kuehne, Geoff; Llewellyn, Rick] CSIRO, Locked Bag 2, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia; [Kuehne, Geoff; Nettle, Ruth] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Melbourne,"Kuehne, G (corresponding author), CSIRO, Locked Bag 2, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia.;Kuehne, G (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",geoffkuehne@gmail.com,"Nettle, Ruth/AAI-2967-2021; Llewellyn, Rick S/F-8068-2010","Llewellyn, Rick S/0000-0002-4152-7699",Grains Research and Development Corporation,Grains Research and Development Corporation(Grains R&D Corp),This research has been supported by the Grains Research and Development Corporation.

This qualitative study aims to understand how six U.S. cities are considering health adaptation when responding to climate change; 65 semi-structured interviews were conducted with salient stakeholders across six U.S. cities (Boston, Massachusetts; Los Angeles, California; Portland, Oregon; Raleigh, North Carolina; Tampa, Florida; and Tucson, Arizona), and transcripts were analyzed to identify common themes. Each city's (or county's) most recent climate action plan was also analyzed. This study found that interviewees' ability to understand the connection between climate and health was a major determinant for health adaptation implementation. In addition, institutional fragmentation in governance made it difficult to incorporate health concerns into broader climate planning. However, cross-sectoral collaborations and considerations of health cobenefits were shown to help overcome these barriers. These findings offer valuable insight regarding how policy makers and practitioners can safeguard public health from the effects of climate change.","[Shimamoto, Mark M.] ICF, Washington, DC USA; [McCormick, Sabrina] George Washington Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Milken Inst, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"McCormick, S (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Milken Inst, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",sabmc@gwu.edu,,"Shimamoto, Mark/0000-0002-4690-8562",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [IP-C-09-009],U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA Contract IP-C-09-009, Work Assignment 2-63) for this research.

In particular, they fail to address the need for a fundamental cultural transformation, which involves a collective shift in mindsets (values, beliefs, worldviews and associated inner human capacities). Whilst scholars and practitioners are increasingly calling for more integrative approaches, knowledge on how the link between our mind and the climate crisis can be best addressed in policy responses is still scarce. Our study addresses this gap. Based on a survey and in-depth interviews with high-level policymakers worldwide, we explore how they perceive the intersection of mind and climate change, how it is reflected in current policymaking and how it could be better considered to support transformation. Our findings show, on the one hand, that the mind is perceived as a victim of increasing climate impacts. On the other hand, it is considered a key driver of the crisis, and a barrier to action, to the detriment of both personal and planetary wellbeing. The resultant vicious cycle of mind and climate change is, however, not reflected in mainstream policymaking, which fails to generate more sustainable pathways. At the same time, there are important lessons from other fields (e.g. education, health, the workplace, policy mainstreaming) that provide insights into how to integrate aspects of mind into climate policies. Our results show that systematic integration into policymaking is a key for improving both climate resilience and climate responsiveness across individual, collective, organisational and system levels and indicate the inner human potential and capacities that support related change. We conclude with some policy recommendations and further research that is needed to move from a vicious to a virtuous cycle of mind and climate change that supports personal and planetary wellbeing.","[Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Bristow, Jamie] Mindfulness Initiat, London, England",Lund University,"Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden.",christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se; jamie@mindfulnessmitiative.org.uk,,,"Lund University; Emergence Foundation; Swedish Research Council Formas [2019-00390, 2019-01969]",Lund University; Emergence Foundation; Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"Open access funding provided by Lund University.

Despite growing research on urban climates, research at a scale that can support urban planning with scientificallyinformed strategies is still not as well documented for warm climate cities as for temperate cities. In response, this paper uses land surface temperature and geoinformation to assess the subtropical city of Taipei, Taiwan. Results show cooler environments are not only associated with natural surfaces, but also their inter-relation with different spatial arrangement of buildings. An open layout tends to have lower temperature at low- to mid-rise buildings, whereas a compact layout is the coolest form for high-rise buildings. Cooling benefit from open layouts is, however, related to an increase in greenery. Clustering distribution of greenspaces produces more notable cooling. Accordingly, this paper proposes four heat mitigation strategies for Taipei: 1) increasing the amount of water bodies and vegetation, with greater coverage and coherence; 2) taking building height and shadow into account during regeneration/development; 3) increasing spacing and greenery between low- to midrise buildings; and 4) avoiding construction of compact low-rise buildings with corrugated iron steel.","[Shih, Wan-Yu] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Disaster Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Ahmad, Sohail] Univ Glasgow, GCRF Ctr Sustainable Hlth & Learning Cities & Nei, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Urban Studies, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Chen, Yu-Chen] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Taiwan Bldg Technol Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Tzu-Ping] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Architecture, Tainan, Taiwan; [Mabon, Leslie] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban, Argyll, Scotland",Ming Chuan University; University of Glasgow; National Taiwan University of Science & Technology; National Cheng Kung University; UHI Millennium Institute,"Shih, WY (corresponding author), Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Disaster Management, Taipei, Taiwan.",shih@mail.mcu.edu.tw,,"Mabon, Leslie/0000-0003-2646-6119; Ahmad, Sohail/0000-0002-2816-8484; CHEN, YU CHENG/0000-0002-4315-2608; Shih, Wan-Yu/0000-0003-4427-492X",Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Humanities and Social Sciences [205764-Z-16-Z]; UK Research and Innovation as part of the UK Government's Global Challenges Research Fund,Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Humanities and Social Sciences; UK Research and Innovation as part of the UK Government's Global Challenges Research Fund,This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Humanities and Social Sciences [205764-Z-16-Z].

Jiangsu Province on China's east coast is a major contributor to grain production and therefore the region's climate has particular relevance to research on the nation's food security. This study explores the link between spatiotemporal climate patterns and grain production, which include rice output, summer grain output, and average grain output of those two seasons, using temperature and rainfall data from a study area in southern Jiangsu Province. Meteorological data covering about 40 years (1976-2013) were collected from 13 meteorological stations around the study region. Grain output was acquired from the same year's statistical report from the local government. Based on the thin plate spline method, meteorological data and grain output were interpolated to the same geographic grid. Several statistical methods-regression analysis, moving average, Mann-Kendall, moving t-test, and wavelet analysisdwere used to estimate the changing trends of metrological factors and grain output. The result showed that annual mean temperature, mean maximum temperature, and mean minimum temperature fluctuated and increased, and those changes were more abrupt in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with obvious periodic variation in three time scales: 25-32 years, 15-25 years, and 10-15 years. For abnormal annual rainfall, rainfall showed significant interannual difference in the region from 1976 to 2013. The results indicated that abrupt changes occurred from 1979 to 1980 and again from 2006 to 2007. Annual and seasonal rainfall also showed obvious periodic variation at the three time scales. The growth variation of average grain output increased with some fluctuation and was different in different periods. It gradually decreased from southeast to northwest, and had a very different spatial pattern. The annual mean temperature played an important role in agricultural production, but the annual rainfall had little effect on agriculture for annual and seasonal fluctuation from 1976 to 2013. Temperature indexes in spring, summer, and autumn had a significant effect on average rice output. For autumn grain output, temperature indexes also played an important role in summer and autumn. Moreover, correlation coefficients and p-values for temperature indexes and grain output were weak in summer, but also passed a significance test at the 95% confidence interval. The study helps understand the effect of climate change on grain production, and also provides a scientific foundation and theoretical support for formulating policy and measures on climatic adaptability for agricultural production in eastern China.

This study investigates the variability and predictability of the South Korean climate during this extended season, based on observations from 60 station locations and multi-model ensemble (MME) hindcast experiments (1983/1984-2005/2006) archived at the APEC Climate Center (APCC). Multivariate empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis results based on observations show that the first two leading modes of winter-to-spring precipitation and temperature variability, which together account for similar to 80 % of the total variance, are characterized by regional-scale anomalies covering the whole South Korean territory. These modes were also closely related to some of the recurrent large-scale circulation changes in the northern hemisphere during the same season. Consistent with the above, examination of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) indicates that drought conditions in South Korea tend to be accompanied by regional-to-continental-scale circulation anomalies over East Asia to the western north Pacific. Motivated by the aforementioned findings on the spatial-temporal coherence among station-scale precipitation and temperature anomalies, a new bivariate and pattern-based downscaling method was developed. The novelty of this method is that precipitation and temperature data were first filtered using multivariate EOFs to enhance their spatial-temporal coherence, before being linked to large-scale circulation variables using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). To test its applicability and to investigate its related potential predictability, a perfect empirical model was first constructed with observed datasets as predictors. Next, a model output statistics (MOS)-type hybrid dynamical-statistical model was developed, using products from nine one-tier climate models as inputs. It was found that, with model sea-level pressure (SLP) and 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500) as predictors, statistically downscaled MME (DMME) precipitation and temperature predictions were substantially improved compared to those based on raw MME outputs. Limitations and possible causes of error of such a dynamical-statistical model, in the current framework of dynamical seasonal climate predictions, were also discussed. Finally, the method was used to construct a dynamical-statistical system for 6 month-lead drought predictions for 60 stations in South Korea. DMME was found to give reasonably skillful long-lead forecasts of SPEI for winter to spring. Moreover, DMME-based products clearly outperform the raw MME predictions, especially during extreme wet years. Our results could lead to more reliable climatic extreme predictions for policymakers and stakeholders in the water management sector, and for better mitigation and climate adaptations.","[Sohn, Soo-Jin] APEC Climate Ctr, Climate Predict Team, Climate Res Dept, 12 Centum 7 Ro, Busan 612020, South Korea; [Tam, Chi-Yung] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Earth Syst Sci Programme, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Sohn, SJ (corresponding author), APEC Climate Ctr, Climate Predict Team, Climate Res Dept, 12 Centum 7 Ro, Busan 612020, South Korea.",jeenie7@apcc21.org,"Tam, Francis Chi Yung/AAI-2990-2021; Sohn, Soo-Jin/ABF-7392-2020; Tam, Francis C Y/T-7218-2018","Tam, Francis Chi Yung/0000-0002-5462-6880; Sohn, Soo-Jin/0000-0002-5513-7069; Tam, Francis C Y/0000-0002-5462-6880",APEC Climate Center,APEC Climate Center,The authors appreciate those institutes participating in the APCC multi-model ensemble prediction system for providing the 1-Tier hindcast experiment data.

As a result, there is a generalized lack of knowledge and practice regarding the definition and use of adaptation indicators and metrics from which to effectively learn. This paper focuses on understanding the emergent state of practice regarding adaptation indicators and metrics at the local level: what indicators and metrics are used? What aspects of the adaptation process are they measuring? How will they be monitored, evaluated, and reported? Out of a sample of the largest 136 coastal cities worldwide, only 59 cities have adaptation-related plans and only 11 (Athens, Auckland, Barcelona, Glasgow, Lima, Montreal, Nagoya, New York City, Portland, Tokyo, and Vancouver) list indicators and metrics. Sourced from these documents, we compile and code a total of 1971 indicators, of which 1841 focus fully or partially on adaptation-related aspects. We study the level of detail (objective, indicator, metric), type (target, input, output, outcome, or impact), scale, dimension, units of measurement, target, and proposed monitoring timeframe, among other aspects. Data shows that current adaptation measurement frameworks are tied to the degree to which each city integrates and addresses adaptation in its policies. A majority of adaptation indicators and metrics measure outputs, i.e. implementation aspects. Outcome indicators are generally connected to users or beneficiaries of adaptation measures and impact indicators are mostly related to health (e.g. hospitalizations). Targets and monitoring timeframes, as well as data sources, are rarely defined. We connect this to a lack of definition of local adaptation goals and a poor understanding of how specific adaptation actions lead to vulnerability reductions and resilience increases. Based on the identified gaps, we propose a metric development guiding framework to stimulate discussion around effective and feasible ap-proaches to measure adaptation progress based on improved adaptation decision-making. We argue, that our results should fuel a critical revision of current adaptation planning practices that might ultimately facilitate processes of learning, experimentation and innovation in this embryonic field.","[Goonesekera, Sascha M.] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Olazabal, Marta] Basque Ctr Climate Change, BC3, Leioa, Spain; [Olazabal, Marta] IKERBASQUE, Basque Fdn Sci, Bilbao, Spain; [Olazabal, Marta] Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change, BC3, Sci Campus,Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor, Leioa 48940, Spain",University of Groningen; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Basque Foundation for Science; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of Basque Country,"Olazabal, M (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change, BC3, Sci Campus,Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor, Leioa 48940, Spain.",marta.olazabal@bc3research.org,,,AXA Research Fund; Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation 2018-2022; Basque Government through the BERC 2022-2025 program;  [4771];  [MDM-2017-0714];  [MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033/],AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation 2018-2022; Basque Government through the BERC 2022-2025 program(Basque Government); ; ; ,"This study was funded by AXA Research Fund under Grant Agreement No. 4771.

Microclimates could explain some of this variation, but climate change biologists often overlook microclimates because they are difficult to map. Here, we map microclimates in a freshwater rock pool ecosystem and evaluate how accounting for microclimates alters predictions of climate change impacts on aquatic invertebrates. We demonstrate that average maximum temperature during the growing season can differ by 9.9-11.6 degrees C among microclimates less than a meter apart and this microclimate variation might increase by 21% in the future if deeper pools warm less than shallower pools. Accounting for this microclimate variation significantly alters predictions of climate change impacts on aquatic invertebrates. Predictions that exclude microclimates predict low future occupancy (0.08-0.32) and persistence probabilities (2%-73%) for cold-adapted taxa, and therefore predict decreases in gamma richness and a substantial shift toward warm-adapted taxa in local communities (i.e., thermophilization). However, predictions incorporating microclimates suggest cool locations will remain suitable for cold-adapted taxa in the future, no change in gamma richness, and 825% less thermophilization. Our models also suggest that cool locations will become suitable for warm-adapted taxa and will therefore accumulate biodiversity in the future, which makes cool locations essential for biodiversity conservation. Simulated protection of the 10 coolest microclimates (9% of locations on the landscape) results in a 100% chance of conserving all focal taxa in the future. In contrast, protecting the 10 currently most biodiverse locations, a commonly employed conservation strategy, results in a 3% chance of conserving all focal taxa in the future. Our study suggests that we must account for microclimates if we hope to understand the future impacts of climate change and design effective conservation strategies to limit biodiversity loss.","[Nadeau, Christopher P.; Giacomazzo, Anjelica; Urban, Mark C.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 75 North Eagleville Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Urban, Mark C.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Biol Risk, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut,"Nadeau, CP (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 75 North Eagleville Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",c.nadeau@northeastern.edu,,,University of Connecticut; National Aeronautics and Space Administration [80NSSC18K1533]; Second Century Stewardship Program; National Science Foundation [1247393],University of Connecticut; National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Second Century Stewardship Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"University of Connecticut; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Grant/Award Number: 80NSSC18K1533; Second Century Stewardship Program; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1247393",,80,2,2,10,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The Crop System Modeling-Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (CSM-DSSAT) models of maize, peanut, and cotton are, respectively, driven by the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) Phase II regional climate models to estimate current (1971-2000) and future (2041-2070) crop yield amounts. In particular, the future weather/climate data are based on the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 emissions scenario. The NARCCAP realizations show on average that there will be large temperature increases (similar to 2.7 degrees C) and minor rainfall decreases (similar to-0.10 mm/day) with pattern shifts in the southeast United States. With these future climate projections, the overall future crop yield amounts appear to be reduced under rainfed conditions. A better estimate of future crop yield amounts might be achievable by utilizing the so-called weighted ensemble method. It is proposed that the reduced crop yield amounts in the future could be mitigated by altering the currently adopted local planting dates without any irrigation support.","[Shin, D.

However, upscaling of recycled water schemes is challenging, and little is known about the governance conditions which are required for this. This paper addresses this knowledge gap. Based on a review of governance literature we suggest that five governance conditions are necessary for a successful upscaling of recycled water schemes: (1) policy leadership, (2) policy coordination, (3) availability of financial resources, (4) awareness of a problem, and (5) the presence of a public forum. We applied these concepts in a case study on the upscaling of a recycled water scheme in Sabadell, Spain. We reviewed policy documents, conducted a set of 21 semi-structured interviews, and attended two policy meetings about the subject. Our results suggest that Sabadell meets the required conditions for upscaling reused water to a certain extent. However, a public forum is not well-developed. We discuss the implications of this and conclude with some suggestions for future research and some lessons for other cities that plan to upscale their recycled water schemes.","[Alberich, Josep Pinyol; Dieperink, Carel; Driessen, Peter] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Dompl 29, NL-3512 JE Utrecht, Netherlands; [Mukhtarov, Farhad] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands; [Broekman, Annelies] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Recerca Ecol & Aplicac Forestals, Pl Civ, Bellaterra 08193, Spain",Utrecht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF),"Alberich, JP (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Dompl 29, NL-3512 JE Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.pinyolalberich@uu.nl; mukhtarov@iss.nl; c.dieperink@uu.nl; p.driessen@uu.nl; a.broekman@creaf.uab.cat,"Mukhtarov, Farhad/ABA-8686-2021; Mukhtarov, Farhad/AAY-7664-2021; Driessen, Peter/M-6751-2013","Mukhtarov, Farhad/0000-0002-0827-6293; Driessen, Peter/0000-0002-0724-6666; Pinyol Alberich, Josep/0000-0003-3961-0431; Broekman, Annelies/0000-0002-8961-0467",POWER project; European Commission [687809],POWER project; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),This research was funded by the POWER project and the European Commission is acknowledged for funding POWER in H2020-Water under Grant Agreement No. 687809.,,62,3,3,0,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2019,11,1,,,,,,,11,10.3390/w11010011,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11010011,,,13,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HM8MJ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000459735100011,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the health challenge of heat has been largely absent from Ireland's public health sector. This is epitomised by the lack of a comprehensive public health-focused heat-health action plan or country-specific codes of practice for heat-health when working outdoors. Our objective is to highlight the anticipated heat-health challenges in Ireland, and other temperate regions, through analysing vulnerable groups and systems, reinforcing the need to respond. Methods A scoping literature review was conducted to determine how heat affects health of the vulnerable in temperate climatic regions, with a focus on Ireland. Additionally, national Google Trends data was coarsely analysed to determine whether heat is a growing societal concern. Results and discussion The heat-vulnerable include: older people; chronically ill; infants, pregnant women, children; outdoor workers; socio-economically disadvantaged; urban dwellers; food systems and the health sector. Google Trends data suggest an increase in heat-related health searches over time, demonstrating rising levels of concern to temperature increases, reinforcing a gap in national policy associated with communication of, and response to, the heat-health challenge. Specific, actionable recommendations for adaptation and mitigation strategies are proposed. Conclusion Heat poses a public and occupational health challenge, receiving limited attention in Ireland. Lack of a co-ordinated effort, places vulnerable populations at risk. Our recommendations, with reference to vulnerable groups and acknowledging the multi-sectoral nature of heat-health and climate change, advocate for the adoption of a health and climate change in all policies approach and the development of a public health-focused heat-health action plan.","[Paterson, Shona K.] Brunel Univ London, Coll Business Arts & Social Sci, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Godsmark, Christie Nicole] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Publ Hlth, Western Gateway Bldg,Western Rd, Cork T12 XF62, Ireland; [Godsmark, Christie Nicole] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland",Brunel University; University College Cork; University College Cork,"Godsmark, CN (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Sch Publ Hlth, Western Gateway Bldg,Western Rd, Cork T12 XF62, Ireland.;Godsmark, CN (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland.",christie.godsmark@ucc.ie,"Godsmark, Christie/AAN-1283-2020","Godsmark, Christie/0000-0003-1636-2842; Paterson, Shona/0000-0003-3107-585X",,,,,107,8,9,15,29,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1744-8603,,GLOBALIZATION HEALTH,Global.

An adaptation pathway is a sequence of policy actions to reach specified objectives. To develop adaptation pathways, interactions between environment and policy response need to be analysed over time for an ensemble of plausible futures. A fast, integrated model can facilitate this. Here, we describe the development and evaluation of such a model, an Integrated Assessment Metamodel (IAMM), to explore adaptation pathways in the Rhine delta for a decision problem currently faced by the Dutch Government. The theory-motivated metamodel is a simplified physically based model. Closed questions reflecting the required accuracy were used to evaluate the model's fitness. The results show that such a model fits the purpose of screening and ranking of policy options and pathways to support the strategic decision making. A complex model can subsequently be used to obtain more detailed information. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In-depth interviews were undertaken with key informants from the research, government, and civil society sectors to gain insight into perceived opportunities and constraints to the development, uptake and market dissemination of such technology in Blantyre, Harare and Gaborone. The majority of the identified opportunities and constraints aligned well with the global IPCC categories, while certain IPCC categories were found not to be relevant to the three city contexts of the study. Two new categories of adaptation opportunities and constraints were discovered (i.e. they did not fit within an IPCC category); they were an opportunity: 'climate change windows of opportunity', and a constraint: 'ethics and intellectual property'. Our results indicated that the nuances of the Global South context are often not well-considered in the design of climate-resilient water management technology, and that a number of constraints detract from the development, uptake and dissemination thereof. There are however, opportunities inherent to sub-Saharan African cities which could be used to stimulate the development, uptake and dissemination of locally designed or modified water technology.

The direct benefits of elevated [CO2] (e[CO2]) to plant growth appear to be greater under low rainfall conditions, but there are few field (Free Air CO2 Enrichment or FACE) experimental set-ups that directly address semi-arid conditions. The objectives of this study were to investigate the following research questions: 1) What are the effects of e[CO2] on the growth and grain yield of lentil (Lens culinaris) grown under semi-arid conditions under FACE? 2) Does e [CO2] decrease grain nitrogen in lentil? and 3) Is there genotypic variability in the response to e[CO2] in lentil cultivars? Elevated [CO2] increased yields by approximately 0.5 t ha(-1) (relative increase ranging from 18 to 138%) by increasing both biomass accumulation (by 32%) and the harvest index (by up to 60%). However, the relative response of grain yield to e[CO2] was not consistently greater under dry conditions and might depend on water availability post-flowering. Grain nitrogen concentration was significantly reduced by e[CO2] under the conditions of this experiment. No differences were found between the cultivars selected in the response to elevated [CO2] for grain yield or any other parameters observed despite well expressed genotypic variability in many traits of interest.

It guarantees resource efficiency in the deployment of nature-based initiatives to mitigate climate change. Organic farming is the most cost-efficient strategy for fighting climate change. Primarily the intensive generation of waste due to strong urbanization effects, the expression of consumer response is particularly powerful while purchasing organic items. This analysis's major purpose is to examine which various aspects may be applied to consumers' perspectives towards circular agriculture when buying organic foods. In this research, a well-constructed questionnaire was produced. Of the 1030 participants who participated in the survey, 1001 samples were examined. The major study question was, Would the customer purchase organic food product that is good environment? The second issue is, how do eco-label foods, knowledge about climate change, consumer education, and specific socio-demographic features impact the value of organic food consumption? According to the study's findings, in the case of the studied customers, people's concerns about climate change, trust, and eco-labels demonstrate a stronger preference for purchasing organic food. It is also a surprise that customer trust has a big effect on consumer buying intention. The new scientific result of the research is that, in the case of emerging countries, due to the significantly lower price level difference between organic products and traditional foods, the healthy properties of foods with an eco-label, as well as the communication of knowledge about climate change, have a significant effect on the level of consumption of organic foods.","[Akter, Shahnaj; Ali, Shahjahan] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Doctoral Sch Econ & Reg Sci, Pater Karoly St-1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Ali, Shahjahan; Fekete-Farkas, Maria; Fogarassy, Csaba; Lakner, Zoltan] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Pater Karoly St-1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Ali, S (corresponding author), Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Doctoral Sch Econ & Reg Sci, Pater Karoly St-1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.;Ali, S (corresponding author), Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Pater Karoly St-1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.",ali.shahjahan@phd.uni-mate.hu,,"Fekete-Farkas, Maria/0000-0002-6058-009X; Akter, Shahnaj/0009-0001-3015-4241; Ali, Shahjahan/0000-0001-7268-1771","Hungarian National Research, Development, and Innovation Office-NKFIH [OTKA 131925]","Hungarian National Research, Development, and Innovation Office-NKFIH(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary)","Special thanks to the Hungarian National Research, Development, and Innovation Office-NKFIH (Program ID: OTKA 131925).",,148,2,2,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9276,,RESOURCES-BASEL,Resources-Basel,JAN,2023,12,1,,,,,,,5,10.3390/resources12010005,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources12010005,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,8R1QY,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000927674400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used the ethnographic approach to describe the case studies and carried out thematic analysis to disentangle the factors that explain such responses. The first case was that of a rural community from Ranogha Island in the Western Province that was hit by the Tsunami of April 2007; the second was of a community settled in an informal development on a flood-prone area in peri-urban Honiara that was hit by a flash flood in April 2014. Drawing from the villagers' experiences, we found that aid and support from family and community, referred to by the respondents as the wantok system, was key to recovering from the disasters. Many respondents identified climate change as one leading factor that explained such catastrophic events. The social cooperation system, the government's role in responding to catastrophes and household net worth were identified among the main components of household responses. These constitute an effective engine to build palliative and preventive responses against catastrophic events and climate change risks. In spite of the extreme poverty observed, and the lack of government assistance, we conclude that amenities obtained from the community (through the wantok system) and household net worth (including the availability of common pool resources) enabled them to cope with the catastrophes. These factors are critical for long-term adaptation to EEEs and climate change risks. The community responses analysed with thematic analysis showed to be consistent with the conceptualization led by a farm-household model, and the household net worth as a source of income appears to be the correct measure of wealth instead the level of income in these less monetarised communities. Learning from how these communities and households responded to such EEEs provides evidence on how other communities could successfully adapt to increasing climate change risks.

The strategic implementation of urban green infrastructure (UGI) e.g. street trees, parks, green roofs and facades can help achieve temperature reductions in urban areas while delivering diverse additional benefits such as pollution reduction and biodiversity habitat. Although the greatest thermal benefits of UGI are achieved in climates with hot, dry summers, there is comparatively little information available for land managers to determine an appropriate strategy for UGI implementation under these climatic conditions. We present a framework for prioritisation and selection of UGI for cooling. The framework is supported by a review of the scientific literature examining the relationships between urban geometry, UGI and temperature mitigation which we used to develop guidelines for UGI implementation that maximises urban surface temperature cooling. We focus particularly on quantifying the cooling benefits of four types of UGI: green open spaces (primarily public parks), shade trees, green roofs, and vertical greening systems (green walls and facades) and demonstrate how the framework can be applied using a case study from Melbourne, Australia.

Closely linked to human well-being in most regions of the globe, fires and their consequences should no longer be regarded as repeated surprise events. Instead, we should regard fires as common and enduring components of most terrestrial systems, including their social context. At the global scale, too much fire and the wrong kinds of fire are trumping not enough fire as the most influential fire problems we must address. Intensified fire suppression and government prohibition of burning is not a long-term solution at the global scale. Acknowledging the importance of programs to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, I propose that fire ecologists come together to elevate attention on four less-discussed priorities: ecological systems in which people depend on fire for survival and well-being; systems in which governments unwisely insist on command and control approaches to fire; places where peatlands are burning; and, places where climate-driven changes in fire will cause type conversion. Finally, I propose holding a worldwide fire summit to debate these priorities and to create fire management goals at the global scale. Taken all together, these proposed steps could enable fire ecologists to mount a worldwide offensive to shape the future of fire in the era of climate change.","Nature Conservancy, Boulder, CO 80302 USA",Nature Conservancy,"Huffman, MR (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, 2424 Spruce St, Boulder, CO 80302 USA.",mhuffman@tnc.org,,,,,,,43,5,5,0,22,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1933-9747,,,FIRE ECOL,Fire Ecol.,,2014,10,3,,,,,90,101,,10.4996/fireecology.1003090,http://dx.doi.org/10.4996/fireecology.1003090,,,12,Ecology; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,AX1FG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000346692800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

In total, 363 papers were retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases, and 292 were considered eligible and used for the bibliometric analysis. In the systematic review, the study aimed for specific community adaptation strategies from the 292 papers, and 118 papers were eligible following developed criteria. Results indicate that countries are committed to helping their coastal communities to adapt to sea level rise impacts and the USA has been significant in that regard. Coastal communities adapt to sea level rise impacts by increasing their structural/physical or social options; however, policy/institutional assistance to intensify these options is limited. Also, specific community adaptation strategies to sea level rise impacts have been more of the engineered and built environment (67%) strategies and few on ecosystem-based strategies (7%). More ecosystem-based strategies are, thus, needed considering their socio-ecological benefits.

We calculate these using previously collected information about the damages and losses associated with past floods and droughts, and estimates of the fraction of attributable risk that characterizes each event. The estimates we obtain are not comprehensive, and almost certainly represent an underestimate of the full economic costs of climate change, notably chronic costs associated with long-term trends. However, the paper shows the potential for developing a new stream of information that is relevant to a range of stakeholders and research communities, especially those with an interest in the aggregation of the costs of climate change or the identification of specific costs associated with potential liability.","[Frame, David J.; Harrington, Luke J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Rosier, Suzanne M.; Carey-Smith, Trevor; Stone, Daithi A.; Dean, Samuel M.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington 6021, New Zealand; [Noy, Ilan] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Harrington, Luke J.; Sparrow, Sarah N.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, ECI, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Sparrow, Sarah N.] Oxford eRes Ctr, 7 Keble Rd, Oxford OX1 3QG, England",Victoria University Wellington; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; Victoria University Wellington; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Frame, DJ (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.",david.frame@vuw.ac.nz,"Sparrow, Sarah N/D-7905-2016; Frame, Dave/R-6169-2016; Dean, Samuel/F-7711-2011","Sparrow, Sarah N/0000-0002-1802-6909; Frame, Dave/0000-0002-0949-3994; Noy, Ilan/0000-0003-3214-6568; Dean, Samuel/0000-0001-6338-4601","New Zealand Treasury; Victoria University of Wellington; MBIE Endeavour Fund Whakahura programme; Deep South National Science Challenge, NIWA; HPCF at NIWA; NeSI (New Zealand e-Science Infrastructure)","New Zealand Treasury; Victoria University of Wellington; MBIE Endeavour Fund Whakahura programme(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)); Deep South National Science Challenge, NIWA; HPCF at NIWA; NeSI (New Zealand e-Science Infrastructure)","This work was supported by the New Zealand Treasury and Victoria University of Wellington, with additional support from the MBIE Endeavour Fund Whakahura programme, the Deep South National Science Challenge, NIWA, the HPCF at NIWA and NeSI (New Zealand e-Science Infrastructure).",,51,42,42,8,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The developed Rice Economy Climate Change (RECC) model covers rice markets in 24 countries and regions. The purpose of this study is to conduct simulations on how agricultural investment for agricultural machinery and equipment can impact the food loss rate of rice and the world rice market. The result of this study concluded that an increase in agricultural machinery and equipment investment in the eight ASEAN countries, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal would contribute to increasing not only the rice yield but also to reducing the food loss rate of rice, as rice consuming continues to grow and its production becomes increasingly affected by climate change. This study suggests that reducing the food loss rate of rice can contribute to coping with growing global rice consumption without increasing rice production. Consequently, policy makers should promote constant agricultural machinery and equipment investment not only to increase agricultural productivity, but also to reduce the food loss of rice.","[Koizumi, Tatsuji] Minist Agr Forestry & Fisheries, Policy Res Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1000013, Japan",Ministry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan,"Koizumi, T (corresponding author), Minist Agr Forestry & Fisheries, Policy Res Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1000013, Japan.",tatsuji_koizumi410@maff.go.jp,,,,,,,17,3,3,3,12,JAPAN INT RESEARCH CENTER AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,IBARAKI,"TSUKUBA, IBARAKI, 305-8686, JAPAN",0021-3551,,,JARQ-JPN AGR RES Q,Jarq - Jpn.

Studying the central adaptation policies and understanding the interactions and complexities of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders is essential in guiding policymakers at different levels of government to formulate policies and make investment decisions. With strategic and economic significance on the national level, Coastal Virginia has one of the highest rates of sea-level rise in the United States, instigating intensified and more frequent climate hazards such as flooding and storms. This paper strives to characterize the status of adaptation policymaking in this region through a novel keyword analysis method and a thematic analysis of interviews with the main adaptation decision-makers and stakeholders. We identify the central adaptation policies and programmes at the local, regional, state, and federal level, as well as the major relevant players. This provides a comprehensible narrative of adaptation policymaking, which could be exploited to further analyze governance gaps and adaptation challenges. The approach and methodologies of this research could be implemented in similar studies for other areas of the U.S. that are at high climate risk, possibly facilitating an informed national adaptation policy, long overdue by the federal government. The research is also relevant for other jurisdictions at risk of sea-level rise.Key policy insightsCoastal adaptation policymaking in Virginia has been a bottom-up and fragmented process initiated by most affected localities, exhibiting the importance of local initiatives in higher-level adaptation policies.The long-lasting impacts of 100 Resilient cities and Dutch Dialogues in the City of Norfolk highlight the value of fostering cross-geographic coordination and capacity-building programmes, confirming the importance of informal policy networks in learning and innovation for adaptation.There is a vast difference among localities in adaptation planning and implementation, creating the need for coordinating state leadership.Adaptation policymaking in Virginia has been influenced by political cycles with priorities drastically altered by each administration change, introducing significant uncertainty for continuation of policies.National policies and programmes, such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, can significantly affect local-level policies and decision-making.","[Eghdami, Sadegh; Michel, Valerie; Shafiee-Jood, Majid; Louis, Garrick] Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Eghdami, Sadegh] Boston Consulting Grp BCG, Boston, MA 02210 USA",University of Virginia; Boston Consulting Group (BCG),"Eghdami, S (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.;Eghdami, S (corresponding author), Boston Consulting Grp BCG, Boston, MA 02210 USA.",me2ts@virginia.edu,,"Shafiee-Jood, Majid/0000-0002-5808-3393",U.S. National Science Foundation;  [1735587],U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ,"AcknowledgmentThe authors sincerely thank those who participated in the interviews and generously provided their knowledge and insights.

Recently, device-free sensing (DFS), as an emerging technique, has gained great popularity because it requires no dedicated equipment other than wireless transceivers. Although some DFS-based approaches have been successfully applied in foliage environments, they are vulnerable to climate dynamics and heavily rely on relabeling large amounts of new data when the weather is altered. To address this issue, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based weather adaptive target recognition network (WATRNet) is proposed in this article. Specifically, a lightweight weather conditional normalization (WCN) module is embedded atop each convolutional block to encode inputs under different weather conditions into a shared latent feature space. Under an end-to-end learning manner, the proposed WATRNet first learns knowledge from sufficient labeled data under a certain weather condition to achieve a precise classifier. When applying this model under another weather condition, only the WCN module needs to be retrained using limited new labeled samples to learn weather-invariant features, while the rest convolutional parameters in WATRNet are frozen. Consequently, the domain discrepancy caused by climate variations can be adaptively mitigated with as few relabeled data as possible. Comprehensive evaluations are carried out on a real FOPEN dataset collected under four different weather conditions. Experimental results verify that the presented method can achieve over 90% accuracy, even when it implements from a normal weather condition to another severe weather condition with only small amounts of training samples.","[Zhong, Yi; Bi, Tianqi; Wang, Ju; Wu, Siliang] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Informat & Elect, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Jie] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Cyberspace Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci CASIA, Inst Automat, Ctr Res Intelligent Percept & Comp CRIPAC, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit NLPR, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Ting] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Huang, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci CASIA, Inst Automat, Ctr Res Intelligent Percept & Comp CRIPAC, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit NLPR, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",yan.huang@cripac.ia.ac.cn,,"zhong, yi/0000-0002-9309-3407","National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [62201061, 62071061]; Fellowship of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2022T150698]; International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program (Talent-Introduction Program) of China [YJ20210324]; Special Research Assistant Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [E2S9180301]",National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fellowship of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program (Talent-Introduction Program) of China; Special Research Assistant Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 62201061 and Grant 62071061, in part by the Fellowship of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant 2022T150698, in part by the International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program (Talent-Introduction Program) of China under Grant YJ20210324, and in part by the Special Research Assistant Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant E2S9180301.",,51,0,0,4,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

This has driven water users to employ a diverse range of adaptation strategies and necessitates new governance structures, such as adaptive water governance (AWG), which have the capacity to manage resources in the midst of uncertainty and complexity. As such, AWG has the potential to support household adaptation strategies; however, little empirical work has been done to identify the factors that facilitate the emergence of AWG. To address this gap, we conducted a household survey of 448 households in northwestern Pakistan, a post-conflict, waterscarce area where adaptive governance is needed to support rural livelihoods in the midst of numerous socioeconomic and environmental transformations. Indeed, we found that households in our study area perceived a range of changes to the water system, including but not limited to declines of fish populations, decreased quality and amount of river water, and an increase of local tourism. Respondents reported a range of adaptation strategies including increasing agricultural inputs, planting new crop varieties, and changing their domestic water supply system. In some cases, households employed these adaptation strategies despite economic barriers, and although many were willing to go against friends' and community leaders' opinions to adapt, and they were less likely to counter the opinions of family members. This reveals that households negotiate multiple factors in their decisions to adapt to social-ecological change; as such, there is a great need for flexible and collaborative governance systems such as AWG to support this complexity in household adaptation decision making. Further, we argue that the varying roles of social influence should be considered to align governance structures with household decision-making processes. Thus, we suggest that AWG will be more likely to emerge when decision makers involved in water management draw on existing informal institutions and cross-sectoral collaboration to reflect the complex ways water users adapt to social-ecological change.","[Nixon, Rebecca] Univ Delaware, Dept Geog & Spatial Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Ma, Zhao] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Khan, Bushra] Univ Peshawar, Dept Environm Sci, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Birkenholtz, Trevor] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lee, Linda] Purdue Univ, Dept Agron, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Lee, Linda] Purdue Univ, Environm & Ecol Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Mian, Ishaq] Univ Agr Peshawar, Dept Soil & Environm Sci, Peshawar, Pakistan",University of Delaware; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Peshawar; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Nixon, R (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Geog & Spatial Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",,,"Imran, Dr. Imran/0000-0002-9459-0130",United States Government; American people through the United States Department of State; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Pakistan - U.S. Science & Technology Cooperation Program,United States Government; American people through the United States Department of State; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Pakistan - U.S. Science & Technology Cooperation Program(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This work was funded by a grant from the United States Government and the generous support of the American people through the United States Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Pakistan - U.S. Science & Technology Cooperation Program.

This model understands scientific knowledge transfer as the connection between research (R), integration (I), and utilization (U)-the RIU model. Within this RIU-model, scientific knowledge is produced in the science system (research), and science-based problem solutions are utilized within practice by political actors (utilization). Between the two spheres there is no automatic connection that leads to a linear application of science in policy making. Rather, the RIU-model highlights the important sphere of integration, a step that lies between science and utilization. A case study on a German decision support system for sustainable forest management within climate change is presented. It is shown that this informational instrument failed since no application in practice could be observed. An analysis by using the RIU model demonstrates (1) what are the reasons for the failure in this case and (2) which recommendations can be drawn by the RIU model for scientific advice that matters in forest policy-making.","[Boecher, Michael; Krott, Max] Univ Gottingen, Chairgrp Forest & Nat Conservat Policy, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Bocher, M (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Chairgrp Forest & Nat Conservat Policy, Gottingen, Germany.",mboeche@gwdg.de,,"Krott, Max/0000-0002-7315-1390",,,,,51,32,32,2,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,1572-9710,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

A number of widely cited products have been developed and published over the recent years, argued to contribute critical knowledge for prioritizing action and funding. However, it remains unclear how their results compare, and how consistent their findings are on country-level risk, exposure, vulnerability and lack of coping, as well as adaptive capacity. This paper analyses and compares the design, data, and results of four of the leading global climate and disaster risk indices: The World Risk Index, the INFORM Risk Index, ND-GAIN Index, and the Climate Risk Index. Our analysis clearly shows that there is considerable degree of cross-index variation regarding countries' risk levels and comparative ranks. At the same time, there is above-average agreement for high-risk countries. In terms of risk sub-components, there is surprisingly little agreement in the results on hazard exposure, while strong inter-index correlations can be observed when ranking countries according to their socio-economic vulnerability and lack of coping as well as adaptive capacity. Vulnerability and capacity hotspots can hence be identified more robustly than risk and exposure hotspots. Our findings speak both to the potential as well as limitations of index-based approaches. They show that a solid understanding of index-based assessment tools, and their conceptual and methodological underpinnings, is necessary to navigate them properly and interpret as well as use their results in triangulation.","[Garschagen, Matthias; Doshi, Deepal] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Reith, Jonathan; Hagenlocher, Michael] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Munich,"Garschagen, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",m.garschagen@lmu.de,,"Doshi, Deepal/0000-0002-9606-2809; Reith, Jonathan/0000-0003-3094-9228; Hagenlocher, Michael/0000-0002-5254-6713",Projekt DEAL; LAKARI project; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [D/396/67223147],Projekt DEAL; LAKARI project; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

In this study, we take the megacity of Beijing as an example and conduct a mixed-methods research using both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore linkage between resilience and development. First, based on expert consultation, we develop an analytical framework and propose reference indicators for measuring urban resilience. Second, we conduct an exploratory factor analysis to justify this analytical framework and rank the urban resilience index for 16 districts in Beijing. Results indicate that urban resilience at the district level is distinguished by the characteristics of the district's functional zones. This implies that the development focus of each district influences the driving factors of urban resilience. This article provides evidence that development and adaptation can be complementary. We showcase in Beijing that urban generic resilience is highly dependent on socio-economic development and urbanization, whereas specific resilience to climatic extremes can be attributed to natural endowment and environmental investment.

While techniques to manage such impacts are emerging, no planning tools exist for bottom-up, community-based management of the issue. This paper forms part of an overarching research project that aims to fill this gap by developing a bottom-up planning guide (the Guide). The paper tests the first of the proposed Guide's five phases: the scoping phase. It presents the results of workshops conducted with two Australian Indigenous rangers groups. While existing studies document Indigenous peoples' perceptions of climate change in general, none have focussed on their perceptions of impacts on cultural heritage sites. Here, Indigenous rangers related strong perceptions of particular climate change impacts on specific cultural sites in particular bio-regions. While the rangers were actively engaged with sites, they felt site management should be extended in the face of additional threats from climate change.

Various barriers to adaptation planning and resource limitations were identified but these were not regarded as insurmountable in terms of the current project.

Climate assessments are frequently undertaken to evaluate climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity. Assessments are complex endeavors with numerous challenges. Five aspects of a climate assessment that can be particularly challenging are highlighted: choice of assessment strategy, incorporation of spatial linkages and interactions, the constraints of climate observations, interpretation of a climate projection ensemble, uncertainty associated with weather/climate dependency models, and consideration of landscape-climate influences. In addition, a climate assessment strategy that incorporates both traditional top-down and bottom-up methods is proposed for assessments of adaptation options at the local/regional scale. Uncertainties associated with climate observations and projections and with weather/climate dependency (i.e., response) models are incorporated into the assessment through the top-down component, and stakeholder knowledge and experience are included through the bottom-up component. Considerable further research is required to improve assessment strategies and the usefulness and usability of assessment findings. In particular, new methods are needed which better incorporate spatial linkages and interactions, yet maintain the fine grain detail needed for decision making at the local and regional scales. Also, new methods are needed which go beyond sensitivity analyses of the relative contribution of land use and land cover changes on local/regional climate to more explicitly consider landscape-climate interactions in the context of uncertain future climates. Assessment teams must clearly communicate the choices made when designing an assessment and recognize the implications of these choices on the interpretation and application of the assessment findings.","[Perdinan; Winkler, Julie A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Perdinan] Bogor Agr Univ, Dept Geophys & Meteorol, Gedung FMIPA, Bogor 16680, Jawa Barat, Indonesia",Michigan State University; Bogor Agricultural University,"Perdinan (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, 118 Geog Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",perdinan@msu.edu,,,"NSF [CNH 0909378, SES 0622954]; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [R83081401-0]; NOAA Climate Program Office [NA10OAR4310213]; Fulbright Presidential Fellowship; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0909378] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); NOAA Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Fulbright Presidential Fellowship; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This review was informed by research funded by NSF Award CNH 0909378, NSF Award SES 0622954, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Project Number R83081401-0, NOAA Climate Program Office Grant NA10OAR4310213 and a Fulbright Presidential Fellowship.

Moreover, the process of management intensification in agriculture has increased and may exacerbate vulnerability to climate extremes. Although many solutions have been presented, the role of simple agroecological and agroforestry management has been largely ignored. Some recent literature has shown how sustainable management may improve agroecological resistance to extreme climate events. We comment specifically on a prevalent form of agriculture throughout Latin America, the coffee agroforestry system. Results from the coffee literature have shown that shade management in coffee systems may mitigate the effects of extreme temperature and precipitation, thereby reducing the ecological and economic vulnerability of many rural farmers. We conclude that more traditional forms of agriculture can offer greater potential for adapting to changing conditions than do current intensive systems.","[Lin, Brenda B.; Perfecto, Ivette; Vandermeer, John] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Vandermeer, John] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Lin, BB (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",bbclin@gmail.com,"Lin, Brenda B/A-8834-2011; Lin, Brenda/O-3578-2019","Lin, Brenda B/0000-0002-6011-9172; Lin, Brenda/0000-0002-6011-9172",National Security Education Program's David L.

This study examined the differences in both shape and size of the frontal sinuses of over 300 individuals from various ancestral backgrounds and assigned sexes to see if climate adaptations or sexual dimorphism might be driving factors. Results showed that shape was not dependent on where a person descended from nor their assigned sex at birth; however, dimensionally, these variables in combination do cause some significant variation. The results also speak to the idiosyncratic nature of the frontal sinus and bolster confidence in using morphological variations as a means of personal identification. While it is still unknown what causes the significant shape variation between individuals within the U.S., it appears that the frontal sinus is affected more by sexual dimorphism than by the ancestry of the individual. Frontal sinus variation has been used in forensic anthropology to aid in positive identification since the 1920s. As imaging technology has evolved, so has the quality and quantity of data that practitioners can collect. This study examined frontal sinus morphological and dimensional variation on computed tomography (CT) scans in 325 individuals for assigned sex females and males from African-, Asian-, European-, and Latin American-derived groups. Full coronal sinus outlines from medically derived CT images were transferred into SHAPE v1.3 for elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA). The dimensional data were measured directly from the images using the MicroDicom viewer. Statistical analyses-Pearson's chi-square, ANOVA, and Tukey post hoc tests-were run in R Studio. Results indicated that 3.7% lacked a frontal sinus and 12.0% had a unilateral sinus, usually on the left (74.3%). Additionally, no statistically significant morphological clustering using EFA was found based on assigned sex and/or population affinity. However, there were statistically significant differences dimensionally (height and depth) when tested against assigned sex and population affinity, indicating that the interactive effects of sexual dimorphism and adaptive population histories influence the dimensions but not the shape of the frontal sinus.","[Shamlou, Austin A.; Tallman, Sean D.] Boston Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Sch Med, 72 E Concord St L1004, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Tallman, Sean D.] Boston Univ, Dept Anthropol, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University; Boston University,"Tallman, SD (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Sch Med, 72 E Concord St L1004, Boston, MA 02118 USA.;Tallman, SD (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Anthropol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",ashamlou@bu.edu; tallman@bu.edu,,"Tallman, Sean/0000-0002-0940-279X",,,,,96,1,1,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-7737,,BIOLOGY-BASEL,Biology-Basel,AUG,2022,11,8,,,,,,,1145,10.3390/biology11081145,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology11081145,,,23,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,4C3AP,36009772,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000846331200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, recent and anticipated changes in climate along with rapid social and economic development suggest that the region's values may not be sustained. We strived to identify the main regional climate change hot-spots and evaluate the distribution of climatically exposed land-use types and ecosystems. The analysis was based on 10 climate models driven by the emission scenario A1B. To identify the hot-spots, we adopted a methodology based on change trajectories in a multidimensional climate space. Three hot-spots were in the Western Carpathians (Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary), two were in Ukraine, and three were in the Romanian and Serbian Carpathians. Regions with the highest aggregate climate exposure (i.e. above 70 % of the regional range) were mostly covered by broadleaved forests (39 %), agricultural land (30 %), and pastures and woodlands (15 %). These regions also contained 15 % of protected areas and 36 % of the total human population in the Carpathians. While growing season length was the main factor affecting hot-spot magnitude in the north-west, precipitation-related variables were the main factors in the east and south. Analysis of inter-climate model variability indicated that the level of confidence in hot-spot position and magnitude differed among hot-spots. In addition to identifying a large-scale regional pattern of climate change, we showed that there are sub-regions with remarkably high climate exposure. The hot-spot distribution in lower elevations suggests that Carpathian ecosystems in water-limited environment may be particularly exposed to climate change.","[Hlasny, Tomas; Barka, Ivan] Forest Res Inst Zvolen, Natl Forest Ctr, Dept Forest & Landscape Ecol, TG Masaryka 22, Zvolen 96092, Slovakia; [Hlasny, Tomas; Trombik, Jiri; Barka, Ivan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forest Protect & Entomol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Dobor, Laura; Barcza, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Meteorol, Pazmany Ps 1-A, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",National Forest Center - Slovakia; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Eotvos Lorand University,"Hlasny, T (corresponding author), Forest Res Inst Zvolen, Natl Forest Ctr, Dept Forest & Landscape Ecol, TG Masaryka 22, Zvolen 96092, Slovakia.;Hlasny, T (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forest Protect & Entomol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",hlasny@nlcsk.org; jiri.trombik@gmail.com; doborl@nimbus.elte.hu; zoltan.barcza@ttk.elte.hu; ivan.barka@gmail.com,"Barcza, Zoltán/G-3880-2014; Hlásny, Tomáš/AAE-5476-2019; Barka, Ivan/AAC-7799-2019","Barcza, Zoltán/0000-0002-1278-0636; Hlasny, Tomas/0000-0001-9771-7435; Barka, Ivan/0000-0002-2364-8542","Operational Programme Research and Development - European Regional Development Fund [ITMS 26220120069, ITMS 26220220066]; Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-0111-10, APVV-0243-11]; National Agency for Agriculture Research of the Czech Republic [QJ1220316]; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund [OTKA K104816]",Operational Programme Research and Development - European Regional Development Fund; Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency); National Agency for Agriculture Research of the Czech Republic; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),This research was supported by the projects ITMS 26220120069 (30 %) and ITMS 26220220066 (30 %) supported by the Operational Programme Research and Development funded by the European Regional Development Fund; projects of the Slovak Research and Development Agency under contracts APVV-0111-10 (15 %) and APVV-0243-11 (15 %); and project of the National Agency for Agriculture Research of the Czech Republic No. QJ1220316 (5 %).

It uses a multiple scale approach in linking local priorities for adaptation and national priorities listed as NAPA interventions to examine the outcome of the NAPA process in Burkina Faso. The study also examines how the NAPA process considers ecosystem services and reflects the views of different social groups. The results show that participatory processes were not effectively integrated at the local level, but that broader and active participation of local communities, although important, is not always necessary. The proposed priority projects were limited to the institutional and specialized fields of the experts who conducted the NAPA process. However, these priority projects do generally reflect the priorities of the study area communities. These priorities include water resources, agricultural and livestock productivity, and forestry, and all depend directly or indirectly on ecosystem services. Factors determining the success of a NAPA are the level of funding, effectiveness of the coordination and implementation of the NAPA, and the importance decision makers give to adaptation. It is also important to focus on vulnerable groups, conduct regular reviews and improvements, and strengthen institutional collaboration. The study offers recommendations and concludes that ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation can be used to enhance the resilience of communities and ecosystems.","[Kalame, Fobissie Blese] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Viikki Trop Resources Inst VITRI, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kudejira, Denboy] Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Nkem, Johnson] United Nations Off Nairobi Gigiri, United Nations Dev Programme, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Helsinki; Brandeis University,"Kalame, FB (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Viikki Trop Resources Inst VITRI, POB 27,Latokartanonkaari 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",fobissie.kalame@helsinki.fi; d_kudejira@hotmail.com; johnson.nkem@undp.org,,,European Union,European Union(European Commission),Research for this article was supported by the Tropical Forest and Climate Change Adaptation project (TroFCCA) of the Center for International Forest Research (CIFOR) funded by the European Union.

Agent-based modelling (ABM) or multi-agent systems (MAS) have been suggested as a complementary tool for assessing farmer responses to climate change in agriculture and how these are affected by policies. MAS applied to agricultural systems draw on techniques used for Recursive Farm Programming, but include models of all individual farms, their spatial interactions and the natural environment. In this article, we discuss the specific insights MAS provide for developing robust policies and land-use strategies in response to climate change. We show that MAS are well-suited for uncertainty analysis and can thereby complement existing simulation approaches to advance the understanding and implementation of effective climate-related policies in agriculture.","[Berger, Thomas; Troost, Christian] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Berger, T (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop, Stuttgart, Germany.",i490d@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Troost, Christian/0000-0003-4626-7117; Berger, Thomas/0000-0003-3316-9614",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [FOR-1695],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Thanks are due to David Harvey and two anonymous referees for their most helpful comments.

Child undernutrition and flooding are highly prevalent public health issues in many developing countries, yet we have little understanding of preventive strategies for effective coping in these circumstances. Education has been recently highlighted as key to reduce the societal impacts of extreme weather events under climate change, but there is a lack of studies assessing to what extent parental education may prevent post-flood child undernutrition. Methods and Materials. One year after large floods in 2008, we conducted a two stage cluster population-based survey of 6-59 months children inhabiting flooded and non-flooded communities of Jagatsinghpur district, Odisha (India), and collected anthropometric measurements on children along with child, parental and household level variables through face-to-face interviews. Using multivariate logistic regression models, we examined separately the effect of maternal and paternal education and other risk factors (mainly income, socio-demographic, and child and mother variables) on stunting and wasting in children from households inhabiting recurrently flooded communities (2006 and 2008; n = 299). As a comparison, separate analyses Ion children in non-flooded communities were carried out (n = 385). All analyses were adjusted by income as additional robustness check. Results. Overall, fathers with at least completed middle education (up to 114 years of age and compulsory in India) had an advantage in protecting their children from child wasting and stunting. For child stunting, the clearest result was a 100-200% lower prevalence associated with at least paternal secondary schooling (compared to no schooling) in flooded-areas. Again, only in flooded communities, an increase in per capita annual household income of 1,000 rupees was associated to a 4.7-4.9% lower prevalence of child stunting. For child wasting in flooded areas, delayed motherhood was associated to better nutritional outcomes (3.4% lower prevalence per year). In flooded communities, households dedicated to activities other than agriculture, a 50-51% lower prevalence of child wasting was estimated, suggesting farmers and fishermen as the most vulnerable livelihoods under flooding. In flooded areas, lower rank castes were at higher odds of both child wasting and stunting. Conclusions. In the short-term, protracted nutritional response in the aftermath of floods should be urgently implemented and target agricultural livelihoods and low rank castes. Education promotion and schooling up to 14 years should have positive impacts on improving children nutritional health in the long run, especially under flooding. Policies effectively helping sustainable livelihood economic development and delayed motherhood are also recommended.","[Rodriguez-Llanes, Jose Manuel; Guha-Sapir, Debarati] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Hlth & Soc, Ctr Res Epidemiol Disasters, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Ranjan-Dash, Shishir] Siksha O Anusandhan Univ, Dept Management, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India; [Ranjan-Dash, Shishir] Tata Trusts, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Mukhopadhyay, Alok] Voluntary Hlth Assoc India, New Delhi, India",Universite Catholique Louvain; Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University,"Rodriguez-Llanes, JM (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Hlth & Soc, Ctr Res Epidemiol Disasters, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.",jmr.llanes@gmail.com,"Rodriguez-Llanes, Jose Manuel/L-4537-2019","Rodriguez-Llanes, Jose Manuel/0000-0003-3736-736X","European FP6 6th Framework Programme under The MICRODIS Project-Integrated Health, Social and Economic Impacts of Extreme Events: Evidence, Methods and Tools [GOCE-CT-2007-036877]","European FP6 6th Framework Programme under The MICRODIS Project-Integrated Health, Social and Economic Impacts of Extreme Events: Evidence, Methods and Tools","The present research was funded by the European FP6 6th Framework Programme under The MICRODIS Project-Integrated Health, Social and Economic Impacts of Extreme Events: Evidence, Methods and Tools (contract number GOCE-CT-2007-036877).

Yet recent reforms to Australian water law and governance have typically focused on water scarcity, not floods. In the summer of 2010/2011, devastating floods in a major urban centre and in regional areas were powerful reminders of the need for more systemic and adaptive responses for water resources management. Using Queensland and Victoria as case studies, the article demonstrates how the water law frameworks in both states assume 'stationarity' through the adoption of standards such as the 1: 100 year flood event probability-an assumption that climate change has rendered unreliable. The article then examines the consequences of reliance on these past modes, particularly in respect of land use planning measures for flood risk adaptation. Finally, this article considers systemic responses for improved flood management focussing on strategic government planning, driven in part by potential litigation in the courts, as well as more local 'autonomous' adaptation in community-based initiatives.","[Godden, Lee; Kung, Anthony] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, CREEL, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Kung, A (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, CREEL, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",l.godden@unimelb.edu.au; kung@unimelb.edu.au,,"Godden, Lee/0000-0001-9534-5148",Australian Research Council [DP0987850]; Australian Research Council [DP0987850] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their helpful and incisive comments, the journal and its editorial management; and to acknowledge the support provided by the Australian Research Council grant DP0987850 Responding to Climate Change: Australia's Environmental Law and Regulatory Framework.",,50,22,23,0,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Socio-economic repercussions in Spanish southeast and uncertainty regarding climate change,REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS REGIONALES,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,Tagus-Segura Aqueduct; Water; Climate change; Drought,WATER; ALTERNATIVES; DESALINATION; IMPACTS; POLICY; BASIN,"Introduction Given the strong global socio-economic growth that have experienced developed countries during the second half of the last century, there have been numerous hydraulic actions aimed at increasing water supply to ensure the strong expansion of urban, agricultural and hydroelectric production (Tortajada, 2016). The availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality has acquired a first-rate interest in meeting urban, tourist and rural demands in territories with a natural shortage of water resources (Rico et al., 2013). In this sense, the hydraulic planning of developed countries was based initially on the so-called old hydraulic policy based on the construction of canals, transfers and reservoirs and, since the last decades of the 20th century, with the so-called nonconventional sources or alternatives such as the use of purified and desalinated water (Fragkou and McEvoy, 2016). In Spain, investments in hydraulic infrastructure (public and private) in the last hundred years have resulted in the construction of more than 1,200 large reservoirs, more than 20 large desalination plants and various transfers of different capacity ( Hernandez-Mora et al., 2014). For example, the main water transfers in Spain (around forty) add up to a capacity of about 1,300 hm(3)/year, which represents less than 3% of the guaranteed resources, which amount to 46,000 hm(3). Objectives and Methodology This research poses two main objectives. The first one is to analyze the socio-economic repercussions derived from the implementation of the Tagus-Segura Aqueduct (ATS) (1979) in the southeast of Spain. The second one, to analyze the future changes in the normal functioning of this hydraulic infrastructure in the future scenarios of climate change and the corrective measures and strategies carried out to mitigate their effects (proposals and alternatives). It has also been consulted on the different regulations that have a direct influence on the functioning of the ATS: Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC); Law 10/2001, of July 5, of the National Hydrological Plan (NHP); Royal Decree-Law 2/2004, of June 18, amending the Law 10/2001, of July 5, of the National Hydrological Plan; A.G.U.A. Program (2004) (Actions for the Management and Use of Water Royal Decree Law 2/2004); Law 21/2013 of December 9, on Environmental Assessment; Royal Decree 773/2014 of 12 September (Memorandum); Law 21/2015, of July 20, of Montes; And the Tagus Hydrological Plan (Royal Decree 1/2016, of 8 January). Likewise, the estimated rainfall effects in the area of study in the different reports on climate change have been analyzed (AEMET, 2017, CEDEX, 2017, IPCC, 2014). Results The participation of the ATS in the systems of supply of drinking water in high of the basin of the Segura is decisive. This work is carried out by the Commonwealth of Canals del Taibilla (MCI), which has become a key public agency for the management of water resources for urban uses in the southeast of Spain (Rico, 2016). At present, MCT has an approximate area of 12 thousand square kilometers and supplies potable water in primary network up to 79 municipalities, belonging to the provinces of Murcia, Alicante and Albacete, with a population estimated at 2.5 million inhabitants that can grow in another million more during the summer if the tourist contingent is considered. This population has had regular supply of drinking water in their homes, even during periods of intense drought, thanks to the existence of the ATS, the diversification of sources of supply, with the increasing participation of non-conventional resources and the temporary assignment of rights of water use; and to the good management carried out by the MCT and the companies in charge of the down management, have significantly increased the performance of the network. The process of the global warming that is evident in the last decades could have three direct effects on the water resources existing in the peninsular territory and, therefore, in the areas of hydrological planning analyzed, Tagus and Segura: Reduction of precipitation and, therefore, of available water resources, accompanied by an increase in temperatures and potential evapotranspiration Changes in the seasonality of rainfall Increase in the irregularity of the rains, which would lead to an increase in extreme events (droughts and heavy rainfall events) Besides, in relation to the new operating rules (limit of 400 hm(3)) (before were in 240 hm(3)), it can be seen that, if they had been in force since 1979, the ATS had not operated on numerous occasions (1983-84, 1992-93, 1995-96, 2005-07, 2008-09 and 2015-16). This is obviously due to the fact that the new rules of exploitation are more conservative and conform to new needs and realities that are more objective and fair than the previous ones. On the other hand, if the hypothetical reduction of 7% is taken into account (reduction of the rainfall due to climate change), it can be seen how practically, this reduction would not mean a substantial change in the normal operation of the ATS, since to handle that threshold of reduction, the transfer would be closed taking into account both the currently and the hypothetical reduction volumes of 7%. In addition, during these four decades of ATS operation, there have been several cyclical episodes of drought (1980-85, 1992-95, 2004-09 and 2014-16), that is to say, conjunctural dry periods which have affected the headwater of the Tagus river every ten years. Therefore, what can be deduced from this analysis is that the operation of the ATS will be conditioned, rather than by the effects of the reduction of precipitation, by the succession of dry episodes and, evidently, by the new rules of regulation, more conservative and in favor of the donor basin. Conclusions From what can be learned from the analyzed case is that the ATS is a hydraulic infrastructure that has allowed the socio-economic development of the southeast of Spain, although it is an infrastructure questioned since its implementation in 1979 by the tensions between the donor and receiving basins. In the southeast of Spain, the commitment to desalination (National Hydrological Plan, 2001 and AGUA Program, 2004) has become a solution to increase the supply of water resources in the southeast of Spain, although they try to make this resource the solution to the long-standing controversy surrounding the ATS. It will be expected if the forecasts of climate change and reduction of contributions that have been realized on the headwater of the Tagus, where the so-called effect 80 has become evident, and how the new operating rules can influence the operation of this infrastructure. Alongside this, a greater involvement of the State, the Autonomous Communities and the different political forces could be achieved in order to achieve a National Water Pact, with measures to adapt to climate change. Within these consensus measures, the maintenance and/ or revision of existing transfers should not be ruled out, or the possibility of carrying out others of a moderate size that could function from the normative development of articles 67 to 72 of TRLA.","[Morote Seguido, Alvaro Francisco] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Olcina Cantos, Jorge; Rico Amoros, Antonio Manuel] Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain",University of Valencia; Universitat d'Alacant,"Seguido, AFM (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain.",,"Morote, Álvaro-Francisco/AAK-3666-2020","Morote, Álvaro-Francisco/0000-0003-2438-4961",,,,,65,0,0,0,10,ASOC UNIV PUBLICAS ANDALUCIA-AUPA,CADIZ,"C ANCHA 16, UNIV CADIZ, CADIZ, 11001, SPAIN",0213-7585,,,REV ESTUD REG,Rev.

This risk is aggravated by climate change. Blantyre and Lilongwe cities are not spared by this scenario. The study used household survey, key informant interviews, observation, and experience to gather primary data, and desk study to solicit secondary data. Random and purposive sampling was employed to identify survey respondents and informants, respectively. Content analysis was used to establish themes and relationships. A good number of regulatory frameworks (policies) and programmes for abating urban climate change mitigation and adaptation have been in place, but implementation is a challenge. Political interference tends to shift priorities on policies to be implemented at one particular point in time of a political regime, and this has culminated into a sour relationship between politics and land use planning, with the former jeopardizing the practice by the latter. Funding insufficiency, uncontrolled development, political interference, corruption and lack of transparency, insufficient stakeholder engagement, and poor planning contribute to poor and insufficient disaster risk management, and to increased disaster risks in Blantyre and Lilongwe cities. Citizen involvement in appropriate and effective land use planning process, regular communication on the availability of safety information, and robust emergency notification system can make communities in Lilongwe and Blantyre cities resilient from climate-related risks.

We introduce a real options framework to determine the optimal adaptation to catastrophic risk that takes into account climate change uncertainty. The framework can be used to select the optimal adaptation project from a number of alternative projects or to determine the optimal investment sequence of the considered projects. In applying the model to the management of bushfire risk at a local government area, we find that the framework can significantly increase the value of adaptation investment, above the current net present value, and also improve upon deterministic dynamic models. We also find that it is important to consider sequential investment to preserve investment flexibility under the uncertainty of climate change. When decision makers can afford multiple investment projects, the loss associated with the use of a simple net present value rule can be substantial, and it is important to use a deterministic dynamic model or a real options model.

Here, climate scenarios from four global circulation models (GCMs) for the baseline (2006-2015), 1.5, and 2.0 degrees C warming scenarios (2106-2115) were used to drive the validated Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model to investigate the impacts of global warming on runoff and terrestrial ecosystem water retention (TEWR) across China at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees. This study applied ensemble projections from multiple GCMs to provide more comprehensive and robust results. The trends in annual mean temperature, precipitation, runoff, and TEWR were analyzed at the grid and basin scale. Results showed that median change in runoff ranged from 3.61 to 13.86 %, 4.20 to 17.89 %, and median change in TEWR ranged from -0.45 to 6.71 and -3.48 to 4.40 % in the 10 main basins in China under 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C warming scenarios, respectively, across all four GCMs. The interannual variability of runoff increased notably in areas where it was projected to increase, and the interannual variability increased notably from the 1.5 to the 2.0 degrees C warming scenario. In contrast, TEWR would remain relatively stable, the median change in standard deviation (SD) of TEWR ranged from -10 to 10 % in about 90 % grids under 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C warming scenarios, across all four GCMs. Both low and high runoff would increase under the two warming scenarios in most areas across China, with high runoff increasing more. The risks of low and high runoff events would be higher under the 2.0 than under the 1.5 degrees C warming scenario in terms of both extent and intensity. Runoff was significantly positively correlated to precipitation, while increase in maximum temperature would generally cause runoff to decrease through increasing evapotranspiration. Likewise, precipitation also played a dominant role in affecting TEWR. Our results were supported by previous studies. However, there existed large uncertainties in climate scenarios from different GCMs, which led to large uncertainties in impact assessment. The differences among the four GCMs were larger than differences between the two warming scenarios. Our findings on the spatiotemporal patterns of climate impacts and their shifts from the 1.5 to the 2.0 degrees C warming scenario are useful for water resource management under different warming scenarios.","[Zhai, Ran; Tao, Fulu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhai, Ran; Tao, Fulu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Tao, Fulu] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Xu, Zhihui] Informat Ctr Yellow River Conservancy Commiss, Zhengzhou 450004, Henan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)","Tao, FL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Tao, FL (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Tao, FL (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Helsinki 00790, Finland.",taofl@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Zhai, Ran/AAD-6190-2022","Tao, F/0000-0001-8574-0080","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604703]; National Science Foundation of China [41571088, 41571493, 31561143003]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2017YFA0604703) and the National Science Foundation of China (nos. 41571088, 41571493, and 31561143003).

In the past decade, numerous empirical studies have employed the protection motivation theory (PMT) to explain flood mitigation behavior at the household level. However, much of this research has produced mixed results and could not consistently confirm the strength and direction of the relationships between the PMT components. Based on a survey of 2,007 households in flood-prone areas, this study revisits the model structure of the PMT by means of structural equation modeling. Compared to the methods used in previous studies, this modeling technique allows us to capture the PMT components in greater detail and to comprehensively test their hypothesized interrelations. Our results point to two separate routes leading to two different response types: A protective route from coping appraisal to protective behavior, and a non-protective route from threat appraisal to non-protective responses. Risk perception is not found to be part of the protective route, neither are non-protective responses confirmed to undermine protection motivation. The two separate routes are observed consistently across all combinations of the six protective and four non-protective responses assessed in this study. In the light of encouraging private flood adaptation, risk communication measures should specifically target the protective route and avoid (accidentally) providing incentives that fall within the non-protective route. This cross-sectional study, however, cannot establish how the two routes interrelate over time. More experimental and longitudinal research is required to address potential feedback effects and the role of decision stages.","[Babcicky, Philipp] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Brandhofgasse 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Seebauer, Sebastian] Joanneum Res Forschungsgesell mbH, LIFE Ctr Climate Energy & Soc, Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Babcicky, P (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Brandhofgasse 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",philipp@babcicky.com,,"Babcicky, Philipp/0000-0002-5616-4958; Seebauer, Sebastian/0000-0003-4592-9529",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [W1256-G15]; Austrian Climate Research Program [B368603],Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Climate Research Program,"This research was funded by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund and was carried out within the Austrian Climate Research Program (project number B368603).

Ample evidence exists that improved on-farm water management can close water-related yield gaps to a considerable degree, but its global significance remains unclear. In this modeling study we investigate systematically to what extent integrated crop water management might contribute to closing the global food gap, constrained by the assumption that pressure on water resources and land does not increase. Using a process-based bio-/agrosphere model, we simulate the yield-increasing potential of elevated irrigation water productivity (including irrigation expansion with thus saved water) and optimized use of in situ precipitation water (alleviated soil evaporation, enhanced infiltration, water harvesting for supplemental irrigation) under current and projected future climate (from 20 climate models, with and without beneficial CO2 effects). Results show that irrigation efficiency improvements can save substantial amounts of water in many river basins (globally 48% of non-productive water consumption in an 'ambitious' scenario), and if rerouted to irrigate neighboring rainfed systems, can boost kcal production significantly (26% global increase). Low-tech solutions for small-scale farmers on water-limited croplands show the potential to increase rainfed yields to a similar extent. In combination, the ambitious yet achievable integrated water management strategies explored in this study could increase global production by 41% and close the water-related yield gap by 62%. Unabated climate change will have adverse effects on crop yields in many regions, but improvements in water management as analyzed here can buffer such effects to a significant degree.","[Jaegermeyr, J.; Gerten, D.; Schaphoff, S.; Heinke, J.; Lucht, W.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Res Domain Earth Syst Anal, Telegraphenberg A62, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Jaegermeyr, J.; Gerten, D.; Lucht, W.] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Heinke, J.] Int Livestock Res Inst, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Heinke, J.] CSIRO, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Rockstrom, J.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Stockholm University,"Jagermeyr, J (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Res Domain Earth Syst Anal, Telegraphenberg A62, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.;Jagermeyr, J (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",jonas.jaegermeyr@pik-potsdam.de,"Lucht, Wolfgang/G-2180-2011; Gerten, Dieter/B-2975-2013","Lucht, Wolfgang/0000-0002-3398-8575; Gerten, Dieter/0000-0002-6214-6991; Rockstrom, Johan/0000-0001-8988-2983; Jagermeyr, Jonas/0000-0002-8368-0018",FACCE MACSUR project [031A103B]; Leibniz Competition [SAW-2013-PIK-5],FACCE MACSUR project; Leibniz Competition,"This study was partly funded by the FACCE MACSUR project (031A103B) and within the framework of the Leibniz Competition (SAW-2013-PIK-5).

However, there are limited studies to concern the ways to link public health and urban planning to distribute cooling refugees targeting the elderly population. Therefore, this study suggests a socio-spatial analysis that evaluates the distribution of urban cooling shelters in neighborhood units by considering older people and land surface temperature. The walkable distance in a minimum of 10 min was considered when evaluating adequacy in the provision of urban cooling shelters that consisted of an urban park, community cooling center, and urban forest. Residential zones were assessed regarding social factors, which were the density of the elderly population and their relative land price features in housing. Two-way ANOVA test and random forest modeling were applied to identify zones with high vulnerability and low provision of cooling shelters. This study's results showed that resources were lacking in places, where the elderly population was high. How the socio-demographic features affected the inappropriate allocation of cooling resources was considered. This study offers insights to measure and design the adequate provision of urban cooling shelters to secure public health.","[Kim, Yoon Jung] Korea Environm Inst, Korea Adaptat Ctr Climate Change, Sejong, South Korea; [Park, Chan] Univ Seoul, Dept Landscape Architecture, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Dong Kun] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, CALS, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, San 56-1, Seoul 151921, South Korea; [Park, Tae Yoon] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Korea Environment Institute (KEI); University of Seoul; Seoul National University (SNU); Yonsei University,"Lee, DK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, CALS, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, San 56-1, Seoul 151921, South Korea.",kimyj@kei.re.kr; chaneparkmomo7@uos.ac.kr; dklee7@snu.ac.kr; ecopark@yonsei.ac.kr,,,Korea Environment Institute (KEI) upon the request of the Korea Ministry of Environment [2020-002-06],"Korea Environment Institute (KEI) upon the request of the Korea Ministry of Environment(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","AcknowledgementsThis paper is based on the research work Enhancing climate resilience and adaptation ability of vulnerable people considering climate change (2020-002-06), conducted by the Korea Environment Institute (KEI) upon the request of the Korea Ministry of Environment.",,60,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1860-1871,1860-188X,,LANDSC ECOL ENG,Landsc.

These agroforestry systems are gradually being replaced by unshaded cacao monocultures that might be more vulnerable to changes in climate; however, the impacts of climate change have not been evaluated yet. We assessed the impact of climate change on the climatic suitability of cacao plantations in southern Bahia and evaluated to what extent the cabrucas reduce the vulnerability of cacao as compared to unshaded plantations. We measured the maximum temperature in a gradient of canopy cover during the warmest month of the year and projected ecological niche models (MaxEnt) on climate projections for 2050 simulating the microclimate of three production systems: cabrucas, intermediate shading, and unshaded plantations. We found that canopy cover drastically reduces daily maximum temperature, so that understory temperature in cabrucas can be up to 6.0 degrees C lower than in unshaded plantations. We show for the first time that all projected environmental changes negatively affect cacao in southern Bahia, diminishing its climatic suitability and reducing overall suitable areas across the region. More importantly, this study is the first one to show that cabrucas can reduce the negative impacts of climate change for cacao, especially where temperature extremes approach or exceed crop tolerance limits. We conclude that maximizing short-term profits by implementing unshaded monocultures will likely lead to production losses in the long term. Cabrucas have a central role in reducing the vulnerability of cacao to climate change and since these traditional agroforestry systems cannot be quickly restored, their conservation should be an important goal of agricultural policies in the region.","[Heming, Neander Marcel; Talora, Daniela C.; Faria, Deborah] Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao Biodiversidad, Appl Conservat Ecol Lab, Rodovia Ilheus Itabuna,Km16, BR-45662000 Ilheus, BA, Brazil; [Schroth, Goetz] CP 513, BR-68109000 Santarem, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz,"Heming, NM (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao Biodiversidad, Appl Conservat Ecol Lab, Rodovia Ilheus Itabuna,Km16, BR-45662000 Ilheus, BA, Brazil.",neanderh@yahoo.com.br,"Heming, Neander/GVS-3683-2022; Heming, Neander/J-7338-2013","Heming, Neander/0000-0003-2461-5045; Talora, Daniela/0000-0001-9647-120X",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88882.314922/2019-01],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),Neander M.

Such assessments are particularly important for nations with significant small-scale farming and high spatial variability in climate, such as Sri Lanka. By comparing historical patterns of irrigation water requirements (IWRs) to rice planting records, we estimate that shifting rice planting dates to earlier in the season could yield water savings of up to 6%. Our findings demonstrate the potential of low-cost adaptation strategies to help meet crop production demands in water-scarce environments. This local-scale assessment of IWRs in Sri Lanka highlights the value of using historical data to inform agricultural management of water resources when high-skilled forecasts are not available. Given national policies prioritizing in-country production and farmers' sensitivities to water stress, decision-makers should consider local degrees of climate variability in institutional design of irrigation management structures.","[Rivera, Ashley; Gunda, Thushara; Hornberger, George M.] Vanderbilt Inst Energy & Environm, PMB 407702,2301 Vanderbilt Pl, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Rivera, Ashley; Gunda, Thushara; Hornberger, George M.] Dept Civil & Environm Engn, PMB 407702,2301 Vanderbilt Pl, Nashville, TN 37240 USA",,"Gunda, T (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Inst Energy & Environm, PMB 407702,2301 Vanderbilt Pl, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;Gunda, T (corresponding author), Dept Civil & Environm Engn, PMB 407702,2301 Vanderbilt Pl, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.",ashley.c.rivera@vanderbilt.edu; tgunda@gmail.com; george.m.hornberger@vanderbilt.edu,"Gunda, Thushara/AAZ-1868-2020","Gunda, Thushara/0000-0003-1945-4064","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE-0909667]; Water, Sustainability, and Climate program [NSF-EAR 1204685]","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Water, Sustainability, and Climate program","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [Grant No. DGE-0909667] and by the Water, Sustainability, and Climate program [Grant No. NSF-EAR 1204685].

Global sea level rise projections indicate devastating implications for populations, ecosystem services and biodiversity. The implications of the sea-level rise (SLR) on low-lying islands and coastal regions and communities are substantial and require deep-rooted coping measures. In the absence of adequate responses for coping, Mozambique is expected to record huge losses, with an impact on the economy and development in many sectors of its coastal regions mainly in northern Mozambique. This research aimed to perform projections on SLR in Mozambique, and to understand its role and implications on the north coast of the country. SLR was estimated through the analysis of model outputs that support the global estimates of the fifth IPCC report near the Mozambican coast, for each of the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios. Regional coastline retreat and coastal erosion were estimated through the results of global sandy coastlines projections developed by Vousdoukas. Mean sea-level rise projections indicate that regional estimates for the Mozambican coast are relative higher than global estimates (similar to 0.05 m) for all representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Yet, we highlight significant differences in sea-level rises of 0.5 m, 0.7 m or 1.0 m by 2100 compared to the global mean. It is expected that with the increase in the mean sea level in the northern part of the Mozambican coast, erosive effects will increase, as well as the retreat of the coastline until 2100. With this, the tourism sector, settlements, ecosystem services and local populations are expected to be significantly affected by 2050, with increased threats in 2100 (RCP4.5, RCP8.5). Local responses for coping are proposed and properly discussed for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios through 2100.","[Rui Mucova, Serafino Afonso] Lurio Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Pemba 958, Mozambique; [Rui Mucova, Serafino Afonso; Azeiteiro, Ulisses Miranda; Pereira, Mario Jorge] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Rui Mucova, Serafino Afonso; Azeiteiro, Ulisses Miranda; Pereira, Mario Jorge] Univ Aveiro, CESAM Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Leal Filho, Walter] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Fac Life Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainabil & Climate Change M, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [Lopes, Carina Lurdes; Dias, Joao Miguel] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, Dept Phys, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Lopes, Carina Lurdes; Dias, Joao Miguel] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Lopes, Carina Lurdes] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Lopes, Carina Lurdes] Univ Lisbon, MARE, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; Manchester Metropolitan University; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Mucova, SAR (corresponding author), Lurio Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Pemba 958, Mozambique.;Mucova, SAR (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.;Mucova, SAR (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, CESAM Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",serafino.mucova@unilurio.ac.mz; ulisses@ua.pt; walter.leal2@haw-hamburg.de; carinalopes@ua.pt; joao.dias@ua.pt; mverde@ua.pt,"Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; Lopes, Carina Lurdes/D-8789-2015; Azeiteiro, Ulisses Manuel de Miranda/C-5933-2008; Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022","Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Lopes, Carina Lurdes/0000-0002-0872-1289; Azeiteiro, Ulisses Manuel de Miranda/0000-0002-5252-1700; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Mucova, Ph.D., Serafino A.R./0000-0001-7637-0671",CESAM [UID/AMB/50017/2019]; FCT/MCTES through national funds; FEDER within the PT2020 Partnership Agreement and Compete 2020,CESAM; FCT/MCTES through national funds(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER within the PT2020 Partnership Agreement and Compete 2020,"This research was founded by WWF Russell E.

Much of this increase has been achieved by replacing fossil fuels with different forms of bioenergy in district heating. Increased use of bioenergy is generally seen as key to reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy security. However, replacing fossil fuels with solid biomass fuels in stationary heat and power generation entails significantly more complicated fuel supply logistics, with geographically scattered material associated with storage difficulties and low energy density. Given these risks and challenges and the key role of biomass-based district heating in the Swedish energy system, disturbances in fuel supply to district heating could potentially be an energy security issue. Through literature studies and interviews with employees at 18 district heating plants, we mapped present and future risks and risk management strategies in district heating supply in the Malardalen region, south-east Sweden. We found that although small disturbances to fuel supply are not uncommon, the likelihood of heat supply failures due to fuel supply problems is low. Risk awareness is generally high among fuel supply managers, with widespread use of multilevel redundancies and diversification as key risk management strategies. However, fuel supply to plants is highly dependent on functioning truck transport and, consequently, availability of diesel fuel for trucks. Risk management can be strengthened further by implementation of forward-looking risk assessments that are less reliant on past experiences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, understanding the evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and the role of land-atmosphere feedbacks is necessary for earlier warnings, better climate projection and timely societal adaptation. However, this understanding is hampered by the difficulties of attributing cause-effect relationships from complex coupled models and the irregular space-time distribution of in situ observations of the land-atmosphere system. As such, there is a need for simple deterministic appraisals that systematically discriminate land-atmosphere interactions from observed weather phenomena over large domains and climatological time spans. Here, we present a new interactive data platform to study the behavior of the ABL and land-atmosphere interactions based on worldwide weather balloon soundings and an ABL model. This software tool - referred to as CLASS4GL (http://class4gl.eu, last access: 27 May 2018) - is developed with the objectives of (a) mining appropriate global observational data from similar to 15 million weather balloon soundings since 1981 and combining them with satellite and reanalysis data and (b) constraining and initializing a numerical model of the daytime evolution of the ABL that serves as a tool to interpret these observations mechanistically and deterministically. As a result, it fully automizes extensive global model experiments to assess the effects of land and atmospheric conditions on the ABL evolution as observed in different climate regions around the world. The suitability of the set of observations, model formulations and global parameters employed by CLASS4GL is extensively validated. In most cases, the framework is able to realistically reproduce the observed daytime response of the mixed-layer height, potential temperature and specific humidity from the balloon soundings. In this extensive global validation exercise, a bias of 10.1 mh(-1), -0.036 Kh(-1) and 0.06 g kg(-1) h(-1) is found for the morning-to-afternoon evolution of the mixed-layer height, potential temperature and specific humidity. The virtual tool is in continuous development and aims to foster a better process understanding of the drivers of the ABL evolution and their global distribution, particularly during the onset and amplification of weather extremes. Finally, it can also be used to scrutinize the representation of land-atmosphere feedbacks and ABL dynamics in Earth system models, numerical weather prediction models, atmospheric reanalysis and satellite retrievals, with the ultimate goal of improving local climate projections, providing earlier warning of extreme weather and fostering a more effective development of climate adaptation strategies.

By critically exploring the frames around climate services, the wider objective is to encourage more reflexive and responsible research in the field, particularly given the huge challenge that climate change represents. By using a framing analysis based on an extensive literature review, five dominant frames were identified. Climate services are mainly framed (1) as a technological innovation, (2) as a market, (3) as an interface between users and producers, (4) as a risk management tool, and (5) from an ethical angle. The predominant frames influence how we think about climate services, shared assumptions, and the way in which policies and projects are designed. To prevent negative effects of climate services on the ground, such as inequalities, the main recommendations include establishing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary dialogues between different communities of practice and players, increasing empirical and social science research to improve our understanding of this new field, and finally, re-thinking climate services in terms of adaptation rather than as the mere production of new information products.","[Lugen, Marine] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ctr Etud Dev Durable, ULB C130-03 Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Lugen, M (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ctr Etud Dev Durable, ULB C130-03 Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",marine.lugen@ulb.be,,"Lugen, Marine/0000-0003-4742-6351",Belgian Fund for Scientific Research-FNRS (F.R.S.-FNRS),Belgian Fund for Scientific Research-FNRS (F.R.S.-FNRS),"This research was funded by the Belgian Fund for Scientific Research-FNRS (F.R.S.-FNRS), through a Research Fellow (ASP-Aspirant) fellowship.",,142,4,4,2,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,OCT,2020,11,10,,,,,,,1047,10.3390/atmos11101047,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11101047,,,27,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,OJ8OA,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000584212100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Large cardamom is a high-value, agro-climatically suitable, and non-perishable spice crop grown in the Himalayan region. Originating in Sikkim, the crop is important to the local economy and is sold in both domestic and international markets; however, its production in India has been declining significantly in recent years. Using VCA and participatory methods of data collection the study helped elicit value chain actors' perspectives on various reasons for the decline as well as potential strategies to improve the cardamom value chain. The results present the multiple environmental and climatic (e.g. water stress), social (e.g. women participation) and institutional (e.g. lack of trust between actors) challenges and corresponding upgrading strategies. Through participatory multi-criteria analysis (MCA), the strategies were prioritized based on the overall preferences of multiple stakeholders. The analysis considered eight criteria and 25 options, or strategies, and found that that marketability and profitability were the most important criteria, and increasing cardamom production, the most important option trait. Stakeholder discussions along with sensitivity analysis also showed how these options could be implemented and revealed how criteria preferences can change with expert inputs. This combination of VCA and MCA, because it supports participatory decision-making and balances multiple dimensions of sustainable development, can be effectively deployed in planning for agricultural development in the mountains.","[Sen, Sudeshna Maya; Kansal, Arun] TERI Sch Adv Studies, Coca Cola Dept Reg Water Studies, 10 Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India",TERI University,"Kansal, A (corresponding author), TERI Sch Adv Studies, Coca Cola Dept Reg Water Studies, 10 Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India.",sudeshnamayasen@gmail.com; akansal37@gmail.com,"Kansal, Arun/AAS-8269-2020","Kansal, Arun/0000-0002-2985-2480; Sen, Sudeshna Maya/0000-0002-2292-033X","Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) Research Consortium","Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) Research Consortium","We thank all the respondents, experts and Mr. Kalsang Nyima for their support and inputs during our field research.

Farmers and agricultural employers implement changes in their work (e.g., mechanization, changing crops, managing workspaces) in ways that may directly impact worker health. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with farmers and farm labor contractors in three agriculturally productive regions of California. We investigated (1) how farmers view changing climate in terms of worker safety and health; (2) how they are currently adapting to long-term weather patterns; (3) how their choices of management practices might impact their workers; (4) how they view their responsibility for their workers; and (5) what their overall observations are concerning environmental changes. Many employers made a clear distinction between weather and climate but not all agreed on whether they were experiencing climate change. Heat was notably the biggest climate hazard farmers identified. Most of the employers interviewed were proud of their longevity and ability to adapt to changing conditions in the field; however, they did not have established emergency procedures. Despite regulations that put the onus on employers, most participants believed that workers needed to take individual responsibility to keep themselves safe in the workplace.

The proposed configuration consisted of a solar driven organic Rankine cycle, and double-effect absorption refrigeration cycle integrated with a Kalina cycle. To analyze environmental implications, life cycle assessments are performed, while further evaluations are conducted utilizing algebraic thermo-mathematical programming. Hazard study and thermal reliability analysis are also performed to analyze the safety and failure rate of the system. Additionally, four critical scenarios are defined: safe urban deployment, economic viability, reliable operation, and sustainable development. In accordance with the four specified scenarios the integrated system is globally optimized using a weighted multi-objective optimization. Following that, a suitable optimum system and fluid allocation is conducted based on hybrid deterministic decision-making technique under smart management. The optimization results showed that the total exergorisk, system reliability, and environmental impact can be simultaneously improved in the range of 4.08-28.3%, 4.14-13.9%, and 1.65-24.6%, in all scenarios employing various working fluids, respectively. Additionally, the system achieves lowest overall cost rate (4.17USD.s(-1)) with R113, while the highest energetic efficiency (46.3%) and system reliability of (91.2%) was associated with R365mfc. Finally, a comparative analysis indicates a CO2 saving potential of 6646, 4883, and 2878 tons/year in comparison to coal, fuel oil, and natural gas based integrated energy systems.","[Tariq, Shahzeb; Safder, Usman; Yoo, ChangKyoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Appl Environm Sci, Integrated Engn, 1732 Deogyeong Daero,Giheung Gu, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Yoo, C (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Appl Environm Sci, Integrated Engn, 1732 Deogyeong Daero,Giheung Gu, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",ckyoo@khu.ac.kr,"Safder, Usman/AAC-6881-2021","Safder, Usman/0000-0002-2380-8112; Tariq, Shahzeb/0000-0002-0598-4243; Yoo, ChangKyoo/0000-0002-9406-7649",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2021R1A2C2007838]; Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE),"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE)(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)",Acknowledgments This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2021R1A2C2007838) and the Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as a Graduate School specialized in Climate Change.,,114,5,5,6,11,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Besides this, climate change may significantly enhance the soil erosion. Policymaking needs reliable estimation of the soil erosion to suggest suitable conservation measures. Hence, keeping this in view, the study was carried out to simulate climate change impacts on soil erosion for a small watershed of Lesser Himalayan region employing calibrated SWAT model. The model was calibrated and validated using the observed surface runoff and sediment yield data obtained from the watershed gauging station. The SWAT model performed well in estimating surface runoff (r(2) =0.85) and sediment yield (r(2) =0.86) with high model Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) for surface runoff (NSE= 0.81) and sediment yield (NSE= 0.70). The highest average soil loss was estimated from the scrubland (42.8 tons ha(-1) year(-1)) and the least from the moderately dense forest (20.1 tons ha(-1) year(-1)) during the current period. Subsequently, the calibrated SWAT model simulated to predict soil erosion in future. MarkSim DSSAT weather generator is a web-based tool used to obtain future climate scenarios. The downscaled General Circulation Model (GCM) projections were obtained from the MarkSim DSSAT weather generator tool. These projections Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 indicated an increase in rainfall depth of 12.3-14.2%. The predicted soil erosion revealed an increase in annual soil erosion rate from 18.1 to 20.9% under various emission scenarios during the twenty-first century. The outcomes exposed that climate change may increase the variability and rates of soil erosion by increasing rainfall intensities and depths. The comprehensive information generated from the study will help the government and policymakers to suggest suitable conservation measures in preparing sustainable land use plan in the Himalayan region.","[Sooryamol, K.

However, there is a paucity of international studies that analyse the status of climate change policies. This paper reports on research undertaken in a sample of 13 highly diverse countries, in regards to their geography, socioeconomic development, vulnerability elements, adaptation, and climate-risks. The results draw attention to the global spread and standardisation of climate change policies, namely through the adoption of comprehensive National Adaptation Plans/Strategies (NAPs/NASs) that include mitigation measures and evaluation mechanisms. Although NAPs tend to take into account different non-governmental stakeholders, they are still mainly state-centred (i.e. their steering and implementation are the responsibility of each country's Ministry of the Environment) in most of the 13 countries in which this study was carried out. The results show that NAPs' objectives mainly reflect more a global agenda and pay less attention to national/regional vulnerabilities and contexts. In fact, despite different socioeconomic levels of development, diverse climate-risks, and dissimilar vulnerability and readiness status among countries, the examined NAPs tend to focus on the same critical sectors and objectives. Notwithstanding their similarities, our results highlight two different logics of adaptation reflected on the NAPs: one focused on economic risks and opportunities, characteristic of developed countries; and others focused on natural resources and conservation, characteristic of developing countries.","[Alves, Fatima] Univ Aberta, Lisbon, Portugal; [Alves, Fatima; Casaleiro, Paula] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Funct Ecol Sci People & Planet, Coimbra, Portugal; [Filho, Walter Leal] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, European Sch Sustainabil Sci & Res, Hamburg, Germany; [Filho, Walter Leal] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Nagy, Gustavo J.] Univ Republ FC UdelaR, Fac Ciencias, IECA, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Diaz, Harry] Univ Regina, Dept Sociol & Social Studies, Regina, SK, Canada; [Al-Amin, Abul Quasem] UTM, IBS, Menara Razak Jalan Semarak, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia; [Osorio de Andrade Guerra, Jose Baltazar Salgueirinho] Univ Southern Santa Catarina Unisul, Res Ctr Energy Efficiency & Sustainabil Greens, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Hurlbert, Margot] Univ Regina, Dept Justice Studies, Regina, SK, Canada; [Hurlbert, Margot] Univ Regina, Dept Social Studies, Regina, SK, Canada; [Farooq, Harith] Lurio Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Pemba, Mozambique; [Klavins, Maris] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Saroar, Mustafa] Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Khulna 9203, Bangladesh; [Lorencova, Eliska Krkoska] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla, Czech Republic; [Suresh, Jain] TERI Univ, Dept Nat Resources, New Delhi 110070, India; [Soares, Amadeu; Morgado, Fernando; Azeiteiro, Ulisses M.] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Aveiro, Portugal; [Soares, Amadeu; Morgado, Fernando; Azeiteiro, Ulisses M.] Univ Aveiro, Biol Dept, Aveiro, Portugal; [O'Hare, Paul] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Wolf, Franziska] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chan, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Al-Amin, Abul Quasem] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","Universidade Aberta; Universidade de Coimbra; Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; Manchester Metropolitan University; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; University of Regina; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina; University of Regina; University of Regina; University of Latvia; Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET); Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; TERI University; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Manchester Metropolitan University; Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; University of Waterloo","Filho, WL (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, European Sch Sustainabil Sci & Res, Hamburg, Germany.;Filho, WL (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester, Lancs, England.",fatimaa@uab.pt; walter.leal2@haw-hamburg.de; pcasaleiro@ces.uc.pt; gnagy@fcien.edu.uy; Harry.Diaz@uregina.ca; amin.cantt@gmail.com; Baltazar.Guerra@unisul.br; Margot.Hurlbert@uregina.ca; harithmorgadinho@gmail.com; maris.klavins@lu.lv; saroar.mustafa@yahoo.com; lorencova.e@czechglobe.cz; sureshj@teriuniversity.ac.in; asoares@ua.pt; fmorgado@ua.pt; Paul.A.OHare@mmu.ac.uk; franziska.wolf@haw-hamburg.de; ulisses@ua.pt,"Saroar, Mustafa/AAI-7257-2021; Alves, Fatima/P-2895-2019; Soares, Amadeu/A-8304-2008; Farooq, Harith Morgadinho/B-6609-2017; Wolf, Franziska/GWZ-9701-2022; Al-Amin, Abul Quasem/AAH-4073-2019; Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022; Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; Azeiteiro, Ulisses Manuel de Miranda/C-5933-2008; Guerra, José Baltazar S.

In order to formulate appropriate adaptation counter-measures it is important to understand the actual vulnerability of the communities that depend on these ecosystems. The present research proposes a tool for assessing the vulnerability of coastal communities to climate change by combining survey results with secondary and observed data available from national and local governments. The study focused on fisheries, given that they constitute the source of livelihood for many communities in developing countries such as Vietnam. The results showed that two coastal wards in Binh Thuan province, Vietnam, are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, mainly because of their dependence on fisheries and the topography of the area. The seasonality of their source of livelihood affects the adaptive capacity of residents, making it less likely that they will be able to successfully adapt to changes in fishery resources that could be brought about by climate change. The results also showed that the communities are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, given that they are both located in the immediate vicinity of the sea and are particularly low in elevation.","[Avelino, John Erick; Crichton, Richard Nathan; Valenzuela, Ven Paolo; Odara, Merenchi Galappaththige Nipuni; Padilla, Michael Adrian Triguero; Onuki, Motoharu] Univ Tokyo, GPSS GLI, Chiba 2778563, Japan; [Nguyen Kiet; Dang Hoang Anh; Ho Dac Bao; Mai Thi Yen Linh; Pham Thi Phuoc Hoai; Nguyen Danh Thao] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Dept Port & Coastal Engn, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City 70000, Vietnam; [Pham Cam Van; Nguyen Hoang Phuong Thao] Vietnam Japan Univ, Fac Environm Engn, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam; [Esteban, Miguel] Waseda Univ, Res Inst Sustainable Future Soc, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Tokyo 1638001, Japan",University of Tokyo; Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMCUT); Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Vietnam National University Hanoi; Waseda University,"Avelino, JE (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, GPSS GLI, Chiba 2778563, Japan.",avelinojohnerick@gmail.com; richard.crichton@s.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; valenzuela.venpaolo@gmail.com; nipuniodara@ymail.com; michael.padilla@s.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; kietnguyen2608@gmail.com; 81300052@hcmut.edu.vn; vanvan141@gmail.com; hodacbao1994@gmail.com; hoangthao0418@gmail.com; maithiyenlinh1601@gmail.com; phuochoai166@gmail.com; ndthao@hcmut.edu.vn; onuki@edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; esteban.fagan@gmail.com,,"Nguyen Danh, Thao/0000-0001-9097-2863; Valenzuela, Ven Paolo/0000-0001-5106-7182; ONUKI, Motoharu/0000-0002-8089-8265; Merenchi Galappaththige, Nipuni Odara/0000-0001-5695-6309","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Technology (Mombukagakusho); Japanese International Development Agency (JICA); Waseda University","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Technology (Mombukagakusho); Japanese International Development Agency (JICA); Waseda University","The present research was funded by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Technology (Mombukagakusho), through its scheme on Program for Leading Graduate Schools, and the Japanese International Development Agency (JICA), through its funding of the Vietnam Japan University.

In the African context, the village level proves to be central for land-use related decision-making given the traditional role of village communities. The paper analyses two different regions, namely the Mkomazi Water Basin in Tanzania and the Keiskamma River Catchment in South Africa. Due to the differing roles of agriculture, income sources and village structures, we developed and applied specific vulnerability indicators in the different regions. In both regions, we harness the Socio-Ecological Systems Framework to study explanatory factors for the variation in vulnerability between villages. In doing so, vulnerability has been found to be determined by an aggregate of ecological factors including water availability and soil depletion and social determinants including conflicts, strength of institutions and leadership as well as knowledge. Climate-change related factors play a role with regard to rainfall frequency and quantities, but need to be analysed together with other drivers of change, including population dynamics and migration. Our comparative conclusions focus on the need for explicit and clear institutional structures, legitimized leadership and good knowledge about land use options and their consequences.","[Grothmann, Torsten; Siebenhuener, Bernd] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ecol Econ Grp, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Petzold, Maximilian; Kleyer, Michael] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Landscape Ecol Grp, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Ndaki, Patrick; Yanda, Pius] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Ctr Climate Change Studies, Dar Es Salaam 16103, Tanzania; [Kakembo, Vincent; Ndou, Naledzani] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Geosci, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; University of Dar es Salaam; Nelson Mandela University,"Grothmann, T; Siebenhuener, B (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ecol Econ Grp, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",torsten.grothmann@uni-oldenburg.de; petzold@pgg.de; patrick_ndaki@yahoo.co.uk; Vincent.Kakembo@nmmu.ac.za; bernd.siebenhuener@uni-oldenburg.de; michael.kleyer@uni-oldenburg.de; pyanda@gmail.com; Naledzani.Ndou@nwu.ac.za,"Yanda, Pius/ABD-9508-2020; Ndaki, Patrick/ABC-2239-2020; Yanda, Pius/ABD-9492-2020","Ndaki, Patrick/0000-0001-7859-7941; Yanda, Pius/0000-0002-0574-6309; Ndou, Naledzani/0000-0001-6456-4487; Kleyer, Michael/0000-0002-0824-2974; Kakembo, Vincent/0000-0003-3388-1716","German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) [ID 50750590]; University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania; Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in South Africa; University of Oldenburg, Germany","German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania; Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in South Africa; University of Oldenburg, Germany","This research was conducted within the project The North-South Network on Climate Proofing of Vulnerable Regions (Clim-A-Net, see http://www.climanet.uni-oldenburg.de/) funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD, project ID 50750590) and housed at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in South Africa and the University of Oldenburg, Germany.

Being located in hot regions and showing high rates of urban population growth, African cities appear particularly likely to face significantly increased exposure to dangerous heat in the coming decades. We combined projections of urban population under five socioeconomic scenarios-shared socioeconomic pathways-with projections of apparent temperature under three representative concentration pathways in order to explore future exposure to dangerous heat across 173 large African cities. Employing multiple shared socioeconomic pathway and representative concentration pathway combinations, we demonstrated that the aggregate exposure in African cities will increase by a multiple of 20-52, reaching 86-217 billion person-days per year by the 2090s, depending on the scenario. The most exposed cities are located in Western and Central Africa, although several Eastern African cities showed an increase of more than 2,000 times the current level by the 2090s, due to the emergence of dangerous heat conditions combined with steady urban population growth. In most cases, we found future exposure to be predominantly driven by changes in population alone or by concurrent changes in climate and population, with the influence of changes in climate alone being minimal. We also demonstrated that shifting from a high to a low urban population growth pathway leads to a slightly greater reduction in aggregate exposure than shifting from a high to a low emissions pathway (51% vs. 48%). This emphasizes the critical role that socioeconomic development plays in shaping heat-related health challenges in African cities. Plain Language Summary Very hot and humid weather often leads to numerous health issues, ranging from heat cramps to death. Due to changing climatic conditions and to demographic growth, the number of people exposed to very hot and humid days is increasing worldwide. This is particularly the case across the African continent, where population growth is rapidly increasing and very hot and humid days are becoming more and more frequent, particularly in tropical areas. In this study, we consider more than 150 large African cities across 43 countries and project the number of people that will be exposed to dangerous heat conditions. Our projections suggest that this number will be 20 to 52 times higher at the end of the 21st century than currently. Large cities in Western and Central Africa appear to be particularly at risk, whereas cities in Southern Africa will remain relatively unscathed. We also show that a restrained urban demographic growth could lead to a 50% reduction in the number of people exposed to dangerous heat conditions. Population and urbanization policies should be part of the wide range of urban climate adaptation options in order to minimize future exposure to extreme heat.","[Rohat, Guillaume; Dao, Hy] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Rohat, Guillaume; Flacke, Johannes; van Maarseveen, Martin] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands; [Rohat, Guillaume] NCAR, Boulder, CO USA; [Dosio, Alessandro] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy; [Dao, Hy] United Nations Environm Programme DEWA GRID, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Geneva; University of Twente; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Rohat, G (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Geneva, Switzerland.;Rohat, G (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands.;Rohat, G (corresponding author), NCAR, Boulder, CO USA.",guillaume.rohat@unige.ch,"Dosio, Alessandro/U-9093-2017; Dao, Hy/AAM-3366-2021; Flacke, Johannes/C-9941-2013","Dosio, Alessandro/0000-0002-6365-9473; Flacke, Johannes/0000-0001-8906-7719; Dao, Hy/0000-0002-0779-8110; Rohat, Guillaume/0000-0001-6156-2195","State Secretariat for Education, Research, and Innovation (SERI, Switzerland); Swiss National Science Foundation's Doc.

NbS have been proposed as cost-effective means to offer long-term coastal protection and at the same time strengthen coastal resilience and biodiversity. However, projects utilizing NbS for coastal protection have often focused on a single solution and the evidence of improved biodiversity remain equivocal. In this paper, we review solutions traditionally used for disparate purposes - namely beach nourishment and the establishment of vascular plants such as seagrass and dune grass. The main incentives behind large-scale beach nourishment projects are often the cost-effectiveness, multifunctionality and dynamic shoreline protection whereas the focus of vegetation restoration has typically been on recreating important habitats and not specifically as a coastal protection measure. Based on previous studies and an on-going large-scale coastal adaptation project in southern Sweden, we investigate the feasibility of combining these seemingly dichotomous management strategies to yield a viable physical defense and at the same time strengthen coastal biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality. Given the urgency in combatting biodiversity loss and adapting to a changing climate, management interventions for coastal protection should explicitly incorporate ecological values into every coastal protection measure and seek innovative, integrated approaches that consider both geomorphological and ecological values and the possible complementarity between the two.","[Kindeberg, Theodor; Olsson, Pal Axel] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers Unit, Lund, Sweden; [Almstrom, Bjorn] Lund Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, Lund, Sweden; [Skoog, Mona] Ystad Municipal, City Planning Off, Ystad, Sweden; [Skoog, Mona] Ctr Eros Damage, Ystad, Sweden; [Hollander, Johan] World Maritime Univ, Sasakawa Global Ocean Inst, Malmo, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Kindeberg, T (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers Unit, Lund, Sweden.",theodor.kindeberg@biol.lu.se,"Kindeberg, Theodor/E-5017-2019","Kindeberg, Theodor/0000-0001-8151-8423",LIFE project LifeCoastAdapt [LIFE17 CCA/SE/000048]; FORMAS [2018-00640]; Nippon Foundation of Japan,LIFE project LifeCoastAdapt; FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas); Nippon Foundation of Japan,"We acknowledge funding from the LIFE project LifeCoastAdapt (project no.

The perceptions of those affected by floods are critical to the successful implementation of adaptation responses; risk perceptions are affected by how information is communicated and, in turn, perceptions influence expectations on flood risk managers to respond. The links between flood experience, risk perception, and responses by individual households were examined in the Hutt Valley, New Zealand, through a household survey, a workshop and interviews with local government practitioners. Two propositions were tested: (1) that flood experience can influence flood risk perceptions; and (2) that flood experience can stimulate increased risk reduction and adaptation actions where changing climate risk is likely. Perceptions of responsibility for flood management were also examined. The study found that previous flood experience contributes to heightened perception of risk, increased preparedness of households, greater willingness to make household-level changes, greater communication with councils, and more advocacy for spatial planning to complement existing structural protection. Flood-affected households had a stronger preference for central government and communities having flood risk responsibilities, in addition to local government. Those who lacked experience were more likely to be normalised to their prior benign experiences and thus optimistic about flood consequences. These results suggest that harnessing positive aspects of experience and communication of changing risk through engagement strategies could help shift the focus from citizens' expectation that governments will always provide protection, to a citizen-local government-central government dialogue about the changing character of flood risk and its implications, and build a 'risk conscious' society in which 'sharing and bearing' is considered desirable.","[Lawrence, Judy; Quade, Dorothee] Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Becker, Julia] GNS Sci, Lower Hutt, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; GNS Science - New Zealand,"Lawrence, J (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",judy.lawrence@paradise.net.nz,"Lawrence, Judy/W-9823-2019","Lawrence, Judy/0000-0001-6798-3636; Becker, Julia/0000-0001-9989-4232",Ministry of Science and Innovation (MSI) [VICX805],"Ministry of Science and Innovation (MSI)(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government)","The research for this paper was funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation (MSI) under the Community Vulnerability, Resilience, and Adaptation to Climate Change programme led by the New Zealand Climate Change Research Institute at Victoria University of Wellington (VICX805).

Ignoring the effects of plant diseases in crop models may lead to large overestimations of current and future crop production levels. Simulation modelling must be seen as a necessary instrument to understand systems and predict their behaviours. This instrument is therefore necessary when profound changes in system structures are envisioned in view of, e.g., ecological intensification or climate adaptation, which necessarily will change injury profiles by plant pathogens and pests. Here, damage mechanisms associated with four major diseases of wheat (brown and yellow rust, septoria tritici blotch and powdery mildew) are considered. These diseases and their damage mechanisms are featured in WHEATPEST, a process-based model for wheat growth under disease. The same damage mechanisms were thus incorporated into four wheat growth models (HERMES, WOFOST_GT, SSM_WHEAT, DSSAT-Nwheat), which did not account for yield losses to diseases before. A benchmark experimental data set from the Netherlands was used to perform two calibration steps to simulate disease-free attainable wheat yields (Ya), first by using the experimentally measured crop development and yields as reference, and second by further using the observed leaf area dynamics. A simulation experiment was then conducted with the five models, with three independent factors: (i) each of the four wheat diseases (individually or combined), (ii) the shape of disease progress curves, and (iii) the maximum disease severity. We analysed the simulated crop growth, actual crop yield (Y), and absolute (YL = Ya - Y) and relative (RYL = YL/Ya) yield loss, at different levels of these three factors. In a last stage of analysis, we simulated the effects of Ya on YL and RYL. Maximum severity of disease had the strongest effect on simulated Y and on YL, while there were also significant differences among models in the simulated YL. Powdery mildew and brown rust were generally associated with higher and lower YL, respectively. Simulated RYL increased as the Ya was decreased. Increase of RYL at lower Ya was attributed to a larger reduction of intercepted radiation at low green leaf area index. This work outlines the rationale for implementing damage mechanisms associated with plant diseases into crop models, and provides the necessary first step towards scenario analyses where the consequences of technology shifts, climate change, and changes in disease patterns may influence the magnitude of yield losses to plant diseases.","[Bregaglio, Simone] CREA Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Agr & Environm, Via Corticella 133, Bologna, Italy; [Willocquet, Laetitia; Savary, Serge] Univ Toulouse, INPT, INP EI Purpan, AGIR,INRAE, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Kersebaum, Kurt Christian; Stella, Tommaso] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Muncheberg, Germany; [Ferrise, Roberto] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry, Florence, Italy; [Ferreira, Thiago Berton; Pavan, Willingthon] Univ Passo Fundo, Grad Program Appl Comp, Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil; [Asseng, Senthold] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Life Sci Engn, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Kersebaum, Kurt Christian] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Brno, Czech Republic; [Pavan, Willingthon] Int Fertilizer Dev Ctr, Muscle Shoals, AL USA; [Asseng, Senthold] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); INRAE; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); University of Florence; Universidade de Passo Fundo; Technical University of Munich; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Bregaglio, S (corresponding author), CREA Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Agr & Environm, Via Corticella 133, Bologna, Italy.",simoneugomaria.bregaglio@crea.gov.it,"Kersebaum, Kurt/A-7558-2010; Asseng, Senthold/Y-6014-2019","Kersebaum, Kurt/0000-0002-3679-8427; BREGAGLIO, SIMONE/0000-0001-8381-2626; Pavan, Willingthon/0000-0001-7906-6624; Asseng, Senthold/0000-0002-7583-3811","AgriDigit-Agromodelli project - Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies and Tourism [36502]; Educ.Net Project - INRAE Meta-programme on Climate Change, ACCAF (Adaptation of Agriculture and Forest to Climate Change); German Ministry of Education and Research through MACSUR [031B0039C]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000797]","AgriDigit-Agromodelli project - Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies and Tourism; Educ.Net Project - INRAE Meta-programme on Climate Change, ACCAF (Adaptation of Agriculture and Forest to Climate Change); German Ministry of Education and Research through MACSUR; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","This work was developed within PeDiMIP, the Pest and Disease Modeling Intercomparison Project of the Agricultural Modelling, Intercomparison and improvement Project (AgMIP), and within MACSUR.

While there is a growing body of research examining specific climate change impacts, there is only limited work that combines this literature with overall climate risk. This paper seeks to address this gap in the literature by investigating and synthesising findings from studies relating to historical airport sensitivity to climate hazards and offering insights on the overall climate risk for the global airport system. With airports increasingly needing to become more climate-resilient due to projected changes in global climate, airport planners and decision-makers face challenges in terms of identifying key priority areas for resilience planning and investment. The findings of the paper provide insights into these challenges by examining best-applied practices and current levels of vulnerability. The paper supports the wider inclusion of climate risks as a key factor in airports' planning and operational processes. This will require transforming current management cultures to enhance an airport's operational ability to respond to climate events efficiently and recover quickly in the event of a disruption.","[Voskaki, Asimina; Budd, Thomas; Mason, Keith] Cranfield Univ, Ctr Air Transport Management, Cranfield, England",Cranfield University,"Voskaki, A (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Ctr Air Transport Management, Cranfield, England.",asimina.voskaki@cranfield.ac.uk,,"Voskaki, Asimina/0000-0002-0235-7746; Budd, Thomas/0000-0001-5066-3425",,,,,96,0,0,5,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-1647,1464-5327,,TRANSPORT REV,Transp.

However, as with any other developmental approach, the WELF nexus needs to mainstream gender, which often lies at the heart of poverty, unemployment, and inequality in sub-Saharan Africa. Access to water, energy, land and food is gendered, and so are livelihood strategies and climate change responses. Inequitable access to these resources, gender inequalities, socio-economic vulnerability and cultural norms contribute to women's susceptibility to the impacts of climate change and limit their ability to harness opportunities arising from it. Reducing women's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change in SSA and improving equity in natural resource access and resource use efficiencies will require transformation of gender relations and the active participation of both men and women in decision-making processes. Moreover, policies and interventions that cater to the WELF nexus need be updated to be more gender-aware and sensitive, as this will also contribute to addressing Sustainable Development Goal 5, in addition to Goals 1, 2, 6, 7, and 15.","[Hlahla, Sithabile] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Coll Agr Engn & Sci, Ctr Transformat Agr & Food Syst, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Hlahla, Sithabile] Univ Cape Town, Future Water Res Inst, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Cape Town,"Hlahla, S (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Coll Agr Engn & Sci, Ctr Transformat Agr & Food Syst, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.;Hlahla, S (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Future Water Res Inst, Cape Town, South Africa.",HLHSIT002@myuct.ac.za,,,Wellcome Trust;  [205200/Z/16/Z],Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); ,This research was funded in part by the Wellcome Trust (Grant Number: 205200/Z/16/Z).,,70,0,0,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

Another aim is to determine the most common mitigation and adaptation measures/actions in general, and in urban areas in particular, that have been studied using ML and DL methods. For this purpose, word frequency analysis and topic modeling, specifically the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as a ML algorithm, are used in this study. The results indicate that the most popular ML technique in both climate change mitigation and adaptation is the Artificial Neural Network.

Meeting the Climate Change Challenge (MC3) is the first longitudinal study exploring climate innovation in Canadian municipalities. A tri-university research collaborative, it focuses on British Columbia (BC), whose voluntary efforts to set and meet climate change goals were far more ambitious than those offered by the federal government (and almost any other province in North America at the time). These efforts included introducing a carbon tax and the Climate Action Charter voluntary agreement in 2007. Since then, 187 of the 190 local governments in BC have signed the Charter to take action on climate change. Research in the first phase of MC(3)explored the dynamics of innovative local responses to the coordinated suite of government legislation, complimentary policy instruments, financial incentives and partnerships with quasi-institutional partners. In the second phase, the 11 original case studies were revisited to explore the nature of transformative change in development paths and indicators of change. Methods include sentiment analysis, decomposition analysis of regional/local emissions, and modelling relationships between climate action co-benefits and trade-offs. This paper provides a synthesis of research outcomes and their implications for environmental governance at multiple scales and the potential of policy innovations to accelerate transformation towards carbon neutral economies. Key policy insights Local governments are on the front line of identifying indicators of change in current development paths and policy innovations to effect the necessary changes for transformation to carbon neutral economies. Barriers to transformational change include lack of coordination or concerted action across multiple scales of governance, electoral cycles and large swings in leadership, and lack of policy coherence across governance levels. Drivers of climate innovation include leadership at multiple levels of governance. Understanding the co-benefits (and trade-offs) of climate actions is important for integrated strategies that achieve broader sustainability goals, as well as accelerating more innovations on climate change.","[Dale, Ann; King, Leslie; Newell, Rob; Jost, Francois] Royal Roads Univ, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Robinson, John] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Robinson, John] Univ Toronto, Sch Environm, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Burch, Sarah] Waterloo Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Shaw, Alison] Flipside Consulting, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Waterloo,"Dale, A (corresponding author), Royal Roads Univ, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Victoria, BC, Canada.",ann.dale@royalroads.ca,,"Dale, Ann/0000-0002-3978-3458; Jost, Francois/0000-0003-4786-4044; Newell, Robert/0000-0003-4108-1727",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,60,26,26,5,76,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

An external shock, like climate change, which may substantially reduce the productivity of workers is therefore a macroeconomic concern. The biophysical impact of higher temperatures on human performance is well documented. Less well understood are the wider effects of higher temperatures on the aggregate productivity of modern, diversified economies, where economic output is produced in contexts ranging from outdoor agriculture to work in air-conditioned buildings. Working conditions are at least to some extent the result of societal choices, which means that the labour productivity effects of heat can be alleviated through careful adaptation. A range of technical, regulatory/infrastructural and behavioural options are available to individuals, businesses and governments. The importance of local contexts prevents a general ranking of the available measures, but many appear cost-effective. Promising options include the optimization of working hours and passive cooling mechanisms. Climate-smart urban planning and adjustments to building design are most suitable to respond to high base temperature, while air conditioning can respond flexibly to short temperature peaks if there is sufficient cheap, reliable and clean electricity. Key policy insights The effect of heat stress on labour productivity is a key economic impact of climate change, which could affect national output and workers' income. Effective adaptation options exist, such as shifting working hours and cool roofs, but they require policy intervention and forward planning. Strategic interventions, such as climate-smart municipal design, are as important as reactive or project-level adaptations. Adaptation solutions to heat stress are highly context specific and need to be assessed accordingly. For example, shifting working hours could be an effective way of reducing the effect of peak temperatures, but only if there is sufficient flexibility in working patterns.","[Day, Ed; Fankhauser, Sam; Kingsmill, Nick] Vivid Econ, London, England; [Fankhauser, Sam] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Fankhauser, Sam] London Sch Econ, CCCEP, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Costa, Helia] Toulouse Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Toulouse, France; [Mavrogianni, Anna] UCL, Bartlett Fac Built Environm, Inst Environm Design & Engn, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of London; University College London,"Fankhauser, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Fankhauser, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, CCCEP, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.fankhauser@lse.ac.uk,,"Mavrogianni, Anna/0000-0002-5104-1238; Fankhauser, Samuel/0000-0003-2100-7888",UK Department for International Development under its Research for Development (R4D) programme; European Community's 7th Framework Program [308497]; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy [ES/K006576/1]; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Department for International Development under its Research for Development (R4D) programme; European Community's 7th Framework Program(European Commission); Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was supported by the UK Department for International Development under its Research for Development (R4D) programme.

In contrast to conventional glazing or static ETFE facades, switchable ETFE moderates incident daylight and controls internal light distribution by actively responding to weather conditions and solar light intensity. To better understand the light control function of ETFE and the impact of parameters such as climate, latitude and window-to-wall ratios (WWR), a validated optical model was used to evaluate different DSF designs. ETFE facades were modelled with a Bidirectional-scattering distribution-function (BSDF) and spectral data, obtained from experimental measurements, to accurately represent specular and diffuse light transmittance. Based on the five-phase method, a parametric climate data-driven simulation of an office room with different facade designs was conducted for three climate scenarios (Oceanic, Mediterranean, Sub-Tropical). When employing switchable ETFE in facades with different WWRs (30-90%), an annual increase of useful daylight illuminance (UDI) from 11 to 69% in the range of 500-2000lx was recorded. The calculated glare probability (DGPs) declined 59% in the best-case scenarios, providing working conditions with imperceptible glare for 94% of the scheduled time. Simultaneously, the daylight uniformity ratio (UR) increased up to 19% compared to a room with a conventional double-glazed facade. Significant improvements of daylight quality were achieved for facades with large windows in climates with abundant solar light available all year long. Overall, this study contributes to expanding the knowledge on adaptive membrane facades, demonstrating their capacity to enhance the daylighting performance of indoor spaces in different climates.","[Flor, Jan-Frederik; Liu, Xiao; Sun, Yanyi; Beccarelli, Paolo; Chilton, John; Wu, Yupeng] Univ Nottingham, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Fac Engn, Innovation Pk, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England",University of Nottingham,"Flor, JF (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Fac Engn, Innovation Pk, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England.",janflor@gmx.de,,"Beccarelli, Paolo/0000-0002-7670-9142; Flor, Jan-Frederik/0000-0001-8740-5227; LIU, XIAO/0000-0001-5161-3307","Faculty of Engineering at University of Nottingham through PhD studentship; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK [EP/S030786/1];  [122]","Faculty of Engineering at University of Nottingham through PhD studentship; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ","This article is partially based on a large-scope PhD research project aimed at furthering the understanding of the environmental performance of ETFE building envelopes [122] .

Although well-designed NbS can deliver multiple benefits for people and nature, much of the recent limelight has been on tree planting for carbon sequestration. There are serious concerns that this is distracting from the need to rapidly phase out use of fossil fuels and protect existing intact ecosystems. There are also concerns that the expansion of forestry framed as a climate change mitigation solution is coming at the cost of carbon rich and biodiverse native ecosystems and local resource rights. Here, we discuss the promise and pitfalls of the NbS framing and its current political traction, and we present recommendations on how to get the message right. We urge policymakers, practitioners and researchers to consider the synergies and trade-offs associated with NbS and to follow four guiding principles to enable NbS to provide sustainable benefits to society: (1) NbS are not a substitute for the rapid phase out of fossil fuels; (2) NbS involve a wide range of ecosystems on land and in the sea, not just forests; (3) NbS are implemented with the full engagement and consent of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in a way that respects their cultural and ecological rights; and (4) NbS should be explicitly designed to provide measurable benefits for biodiversity. Only by following these guidelines will we design robust and resilient NbS that address the urgent challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss, sustaining nature and people together, now and into the future.","[Seddon, Nathalie; Smith, Alison; Key, Isabel; Chausson, Alexandre; Girardin, Cecile; Turner, Beth] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Nat Based Solut Initiat, Oxford, England; [Smith, Alison; Girardin, Cecile] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Smith, Pete] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [House, Jo] Univ Bristol, Cabot Inst Environm, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Srivastava, Shilpi] Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Turner, Beth] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Aberdeen; University of Bristol; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Seddon, N (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Nat Based Solut Initiat, Oxford, England.",nathalie.seddon@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"House, Joanna/B-6477-2016; Smith, Pete/G-1041-2010","House, Joanna/0000-0003-4576-3960; Smith, Pete/0000-0002-3784-1124; Key, Isabel/0000-0002-3200-2399; Chausson, Alexandre/0000-0001-9337-3970; Srivastava, Shilpi/0000-0002-9046-2756; Turner, Beth/0000-0002-4316-1926; Smith, Alison/0000-0003-2649-2202","Natural Environment Research Council [NE/R002649/1]; University of Oxford; Belmont Forum; NORFACE Joint Research Programme on Transformations to Sustainability [730211]; ESRC [ES/S008292/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/R002649/1, NE/M021327/1, NE/P019455/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); University of Oxford; Belmont Forum; NORFACE Joint Research Programme on Transformations to Sustainability; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/R002649/1; University of Oxford; Belmont Forum; NORFACE Joint Research Programme on Transformations to Sustainability, Grant/Award Number: 730211",,292,129,131,85,320,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Starting at 39% in 1980, the urbanisation level rose to 52% in 2011. Ongoing rapid urbanisation has led to increase in urban greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Urban climate change risks have also increased with increase in climate-induced extreme weather events and more low-income urban dwellers living in climate sensitive locations. Despite increased emissions, including GHGs and heightened climate change vulnerability, climate mitigation and adaptation actions are rare in the cities of developing countries. Cities are overwhelmed with worsening congestion, air pollution, crime, waste management, and unemployment problems. Lack of resources and capacity constraints are other factors that discourage cities from embarking on climate change mitigation and adaptation pathways. Given the multitude of problems faced, there is simply no appetite for stand-alone urban climate change mitigation and adaptation policies and programmes. Urban mitigation and adaptation goals will have to be achieved as co-benefits of interventions targeted at solving pressing urban problems and challenges. The paper identifies administratively simple urban interventions that can help cities solve some of their pressing service delivery and urban environmental problems, while simultaneously mitigating rising urban GHG emissions and vulnerability to climate change.","[Dulal, Hari Bansha] ABT Associates Inc, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA",ABT Associates,"Dulal, HB (corresponding author), ABT Associates Inc, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",hbdulal@gmail.com,,,,,,,95,25,25,8,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2017,22,1,,,,,106,125,,10.1080/13549839.2016.1168790,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2016.1168790,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,EO3TN,,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000396617300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

As such, other than a few fertilizers and plant protection measures, there have been scanty resources available to farmers for continuing organic farming. Some farmers in India have evolved traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) based location specific practices to sustain their agroecosystems and continue organic farming. In this paper, an attempt has been made to explore TEK-led adaptations in bio-mulching to grow ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) as a crop and to test empirically the best practices including identifying the best leaves and local bio-mulching materials applied by farmers. The role of TEK-led adaptive practices for controlling moisture loss, temperature regulation, reduced disease incidence, quality yield and economic aspects of ginger production are examined. The study was conducted in nine randomly selected villages of Champawat district, Uttrakhand (Western Himalaya). Data was collected using open ended questions in association with participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools. Results indicated that farmers have developed major TEK led adaptive practices for organic ginger production after seeding in the field, namely using the leaves of oak (Quercus leucotrichophora A. Camus.), chir pine needles (Pinta roxburghii Sarg.), local mixed grasses (e.g., Chrysopogon fulvus (Spreng.) Chiov, [Cymbopogon distans (Nees ex Steud.) W. Watson], [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br. syn. Setaria glauca (L.) P. Beauv], [Heteropogon contortus (L.) P.Beauv. ex Roem. & Schult]. shrubs [Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M.King & H.Rob.] syn. Eupatorium odoratum L.) and animal wastage. This last consists of mixed oak, bhimal (Grewia optiva J.R. Drumm ex Burret), kharik (Celtis australis L.), timala (Ficus auriculata Lour.syn. Ficus roxburghii Stud.) leaves, grasses, paddy and finger millet straw and cow dung and urine. Women were observed to be using more of these TEK led adaptive practices than men. Empirical field studies carried out on TEK led adaptive practices under rain-fed agro ecosystems of farmers revealed significant results including longer rhizome length (up to 6.50 cm), higher number of rhizomes per plant (35.30), higher ginger yield (211.50 q/ha), higher B:C (benefit to cost) ratio (1:2.18) and lower percentage of disease (bacterial wilt; soft rot and leaf spot) incidence (17.5%) in oak leaf mulch. Soil moisture conservation (44.75%) and optimum soil temperature (24.80 degrees C) were recorded as significantly better under the oak leaves for using bio-mulching as compared to all other TEK led bio-mulching practices for organic ginger production. The oak leaves used as bio-mulch in organic ginger increased yield by 43% and net returns by 61% as compared to no mulching (control). It is concluded that, under temperate climate and rain-fed agro ecosystems, TEK led adaptive practices by farmers in growing ginger are economically feasible, energy efficient and ecologically sustainable, through the addition of soil organic carbon. However, there is need for scientific and institutional promotion in participatory modes for such practices, with a provision for integrating these practices with science and policy on climate adaptation.","[Singh, Awani K.; Thakur, Shailja] Indian Agr Res Inst, Ctr Protected Cultivat Technol, New Delhi 110012, India; [Singh, Ranjay K.] Cent Soil Salin Res Inst, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India; [Singh, A.

This study is based on a primary dataset collected from 500 farmers through a field survey from the seven districts of the Himalayan region of northern Pakistan: Ghizer, Gilgit, Diamer, Astore, Skardu, Ghance, and Hunza-Nagar. A multivariate probit was employed to estimate the determinants of choice of adaptation strategies by farmers and a propensity score matching approach was used to estimate the impact of coping strategies on wellbeing. The most common climate-risk management strategies adopted at farm level include an adjustment in the sowing time, adoption of resistant varieties, tree plantation, non-farm participation as well as crop-livestock interaction. The impact of all these risk-management strategies was estimated individually as well as jointly. The empirical results indicated that farmers with higher levels of education and secured land rights mostly adopt more climate-risk mitigating strategies. The overall PSM results show that household income levels are high (in the range of PKR 1658-2610 per month), indicating that those households adopting climate-risk management strategies have higher income levels. The ATT results for the wheat yield are in the range of 42-65 kg per hectare, indicating that farmers adopting climate-risk management strategies have higher wheat yields. The ATT results for poverty are negative and significant, indicating that households adopting climate-risk management strategies have lower poverty levels (in the range of 2-4%). Increasing public awareness and supporting households in risk-mitigating strategies in the Himalayan region could be a crucial policy measure in reducing vulnerability to climate change, thereby increasing wellbeing.","[Bahadur Rahut, Dil] CIMMYT, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Carretera Mexico Veracruz Km 45, El Batan 56237, Texcoco, Mexico; [Ali, Akhter] CIMMYT, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, NARC, CSI Complex,Pk Rd, Islamabad, Pakistan",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); National Agricultural Research Council - Pakistan,"Ali, A (corresponding author), CIMMYT, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, NARC, CSI Complex,Pk Rd, Islamabad, Pakistan.",akhter.ali@cgiar.org,"Rahut, Dil Bahadur/AAD-8370-2022","Rahut, Dil Bahadur/0000-0002-7505-5271",,,,,43,25,27,2,26,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

The projected impacts of climate change in the Keiskamma River Catchment, Eastern Cape Province, are, for example, changes in rainfall with effects on streamflow, salt water intrusion, decreasing water quality due to runoff and erosion, and droughts. This paper uses an existing framework, the Adaptive Capacity Wheel (ACW), complemented by two additional dimensions: adaptation motivation and adaptation belief. The objectives were, first, to assess the adaptive capacity of water governance in the study region, and, second, to show how the ACW can be used as an approach and a communication tool with stakeholders to identify strengths and weaknesses. Based on this, recommendations can be drawn that could help water experts and stakeholders in the future. The results depict a 'medium' score for adaptive capacity. However, it is important to look closely at each dimension assessed by the ACW. The key recommendations are: to overcome the implementation gap, to ensure better coordination across and within governmental levels; to raise awareness, capacity and skill among decision makers and the public; and to increase the political will to overcome adaptation barriers.","Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ & Law, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Grecksch, K (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ & Law, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",kevin.grecksch@uni-oldenburg.de,"Grecksch, Kevin/AAA-1826-2021","Grecksch, Kevin/0000-0002-1913-0134",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); project 'Clim-A-Net,German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); project 'Clim-A-Net,This research was funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the project 'Clim-A-Net.

Yet, the relationship between the trends of LPSs and rainfall extremes remains uncertain. Using two tracking algorithms and reanalyses-derived LPSs, we find that LPS activity and extreme rainfall exhibit coherent trends during the post-1979 satellite era. Over time, the LPSs propagate preferentially into south-central India rather than north-central India, imparting a corresponding dipole footprint in rainfall extremes. Consistent with existing theories that the diabatic heating is instrumental in shifting the LPSs west-southwestward, the LPSs traveling through south-central India have stronger updrafts on their west-southwestern flank than those passing through north-central India. The increased frequency of LPSs propagating into south-central India is likely due to a strengthened cross-equatorial moisture transport, which favors stronger storm ascents. Plain Language Summary The South Asian synoptic-scale low-pressure systems (LPSs), which typically form over the Bay of Bengal and propagate upstream against the time-mean low-level westerlies, produce more than half of the summer rainfall extremes over the densely populated central India. Given the vulnerability of societies in this region to rainfall extremes, investigating the connection between LPSs and extreme rainfall regarding their long-term trends has important implications for climate adaptation. Using two different tracking algorithms and reanalyses-derived LPS tracks, we find that the trends of extreme rainfall and LPS activity exhibit a strong coherence during the post-1979 satellite era. Specifically, the LPSs prefer to propagate into south-central India than north-central India over time, imparting a corresponding dipole footprint in rainfall extremes. In agreement with previous studies that the LPS propagation is a combined effect of the northwestward-propagating component due to horizontal nonlinear adiabatic advection and the southwestward-propagating component due to diabatic heating, we notice that the LPSs migrating through the south-central India have stronger updrafts on their west-southwestern flank compared to those passing through north-central India. Our results indicate that the increasing number of LPSs propagating into south-central India is likely due to a strengthened cross-equatorial moisture transport, which provides a wetter environment and favors stronger storm ascents. Key Points An extreme rainfall dipole with positive trends over south-central India and negative trends over north-central India is observed since 1979 The extreme rainfall dipole aligns with the trends in the number of Indian monsoon low-pressure systems passing through the two regions The changing LPS translation is likely associated with a wetter environment owing to a strengthened cross-equatorial moisture transport","[You, Yujia; Ting, Mingfang] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [You, Yujia] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"You, YJ (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.;You, YJ (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",yujia@ldeo.columbia.edu,"You, Yujia/HLP-4215-2023","You, Yujia/0000-0002-3494-2456; Ting, Mingfang/0000-0002-4302-4614",National Science Foundation [AGS16-07348]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under the Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) program [19-EARTH20-0243],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under the Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) program,This research was supported by the National Science Foundation grant AGS16-07348.

Almost fifty classrooms were studied and around one thousand pool-surveys distributed among their occupants, aged 12 to 17. These measurements were performed during spring, autumn, and winter, considered the most representative periods of use for schools. A new proposed protocol has been developed for the collection and subsequent analysis of data, applying thermal comfort indicators and using the most frequent predictive models, rational (RTC) and adaptive (ATC), for comparison. Cooling is not provided in any of the rooms and natural ventilation is found in most of the spaces during midseasons. Despite the existence of a general heating service in almost all classrooms in the cold period, the use of mechanical ventilation is limited. Heating did not usually provide standard set-point temperatures. However, this did not lead to widespread complaints, as occupants perceive the thermal environment as neutral-varying greatly between users-and show a preference for slightly colder environments. Comparison of these thermal comfort votes and the thermal comfort indicators used showed a better fit of thermal preference over thermal sensation and more reliable results when using regional ATC indicators than the ASHRAE adaptive model. This highlights the significance of inhabitants' actual thermal perception. These findings provide useful insight for a more accurate design of this type of building, as well as a suitable tool for the improvement of existing spaces, improving the conditions for both comfort and wellbeing in these spaces, as well as providing a better fit of energy use for actual comfort conditions.","[Angel Campano, Miguel; Dominguez-Amarillo, Samuel; Fernandez-Aguera, Jesica; Jose Sendra, Juan] Univ Seville, Escuela Tecn Super Arquitectura, Inst Univ Arquitectura & Ciencias Construcc, Reina Mercedes Ave 2, E-41012 Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Fernandez-Aguera, J (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Escuela Tecn Super Arquitectura, Inst Univ Arquitectura & Ciencias Construcc, Reina Mercedes Ave 2, E-41012 Seville, Spain.",jfernandezaguera@us.es,"DOMÍNGUEZ-AMARILLO, SAMUEL/K-3377-2014; Sendra, Juan J./A-5614-2008; Campano Laborda, Miguel Angel/M-6209-2014","DOMÍNGUEZ-AMARILLO, SAMUEL/0000-0002-9177-8736; Sendra, Juan J./0000-0003-3070-6680; Campano Laborda, Miguel Angel/0000-0002-0221-4657; FERNANDEZ-AGUERA, JESICA/0000-0002-0082-3627",government of Spain through the research project Energy Rehabilitation of tertiary buildings in Mediterranean climate by optimizing Solar Protection Systems [BIA2014-53949-R]; PIF Program of the Universidad de Sevilla (V Plan Propio),government of Spain through the research project Energy Rehabilitation of tertiary buildings in Mediterranean climate by optimizing Solar Protection Systems; PIF Program of the Universidad de Sevilla (V Plan Propio),This research was partially funded by the government of Spain through the research project Energy Rehabilitation of tertiary buildings in Mediterranean climate by optimizing Solar Protection Systems (ref.

Transformative adaptation that addresses the risks and vulnerabilities to livelihoods that climate change imposes is essential for effective and inclusive transformation of food systems. Financing that is adequate, accessible and appropriate is essential to realizing these objectives. Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) are already playing an important role in financing transformative adaptation in the agri-food sector and are well-placed to address some of the existing shortcomings. Expanding public sector climate finance and incentivizing private sector investments is needed to attain adequate levels of financing. Reconsidering the rules and procedures for obtaining public sector finance and the capacity to utilize already existent administrative structures, as well as better targeting of activities and communities is important for accessibility. Appropriate finance requires use of mechanisms that address characteristics of the investment, including riskiness, delayed returns, high social values and new and unproven activities. Utilizing blended finance integrated with development finance can generate financing appropriate to the investment needs. Some positive shifts in these directions are already being undertaken by MDBs but more is required.","[Lipper, Leslie] Cornell Univ, Dept Global Dev, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Cavatassi, Romina] Int Fund Agr Dev, Res & Impact Assessment Div, Rome, Italy; [Symons, Ricci; Gordes, Alashiya] Int Fund Agr Dev, Environm Climate Gender & Social Inclus Div, Environm & Climate Change, Rome, Italy; [Page, Oliver] Int Fund Agr Dev, Latin Amer & Caribbean Reg, Rome, Italy",Cornell University,"Lipper, L (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Global Dev, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",leslie.lipper@gmail.com; r.cavatassi@ifad.org; r.symons@ifad.org; a.gordes@ifad.org; o.page@ifad.org,,"Lipper, Leslie/0000-0003-0889-1023",,,,,49,0,0,4,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1876-4517,1876-4525,,FOOD SECUR,Food Secur.,DEC,2021,13,6,,,,,1525,1540,,10.1007/s12571-021-01210-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-021-01210-7,,OCT 2021,16,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Food Science & Technology,XQ2RK,34667483,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000707514500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper then investigates the relative effectiveness of the different media in reducing mortality econometrically. The government adopted awareness generation as an adaptation strategy for heat waves in the year 2003 and intensified the use of public media from 2007 when multiple newspapers and radio and television channels were used for dissemination. I analyze the district-level daily death occurrences due to heat stroke using both linear and non-linear econometric models. Media used on the same day or on previous days are represented in the models by grouping them as either print, audio or video media. The data used is a daily panel data set consisting of only summer days (15th March-20th June) for the years 2005-12 for each of the 30 districts of the state. The estimated models account for the gap in data and the multidimensional nature of the panel, (days, months, years). The results show the repeated use of video media to be the most effective in reducing deaths followed by newspapers and radio. The paper's novel contribution is the use of secondary data to evaluate media and compare media effect of public health communication strategies in a developing country. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In total, 17 companies offered guided glacier activities for approximately 2030,000 visitors per year. Data were collected by repeated interviews, website studies, and participant observation. The product variety covers guided day tours, longer guided tours, and glacier instructor courses. There has been product development from traditional glacier surface walks and activities in the glacier-arm area as well as glacier lake kayaking, terminal face walks, and ice climbing. Glacier tourism can be seen as a mix between purchasable short-term holidays and gradually acquired life-time skill. This analysis focuses on five important preconditions for this adventure tourism niche, namely, natural resources, access, demand, entrepreneurship, and need for special competence. The study also provides insight into current and future challenges and perceived risks on three levels. Results indicate that glacier tourism is not dependent on large glaciers. Studying current companies' location shows there is room for expansion in terms of extensively using natural resources where there is demand. However, some entrepreneurs are sceptical of the industry's future as recent recession of the glaciers has made access more difficult.","[Furunes, Trude; Mykletun, Reidar J.] Univ Stavanger, Norwegian Sch Hotel Management, Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Furunes, T (corresponding author), Univ Stavanger, Norwegian Sch Hotel Management, Stavanger, Norway.",trude.furunes@uis.no,,"Furunes, Trude/0000-0003-4864-7076",,,,,61,39,43,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1502-2250,1502-2269,,SCAND J HOSP TOUR,Scand.

This issue is particularly relevant in the case of the European Union's Natura 2000 network of areas for nature protection, where the sensitivity of local ecosystems calls for intervention to increase resistance and resilience to climate-related risks. Given the complex ways in which climate can influence conservation hotspot areas, there is a need to develop effective strategic approaches and general operational models to identify priorities for management and inform adaptation and mitigation measures. Here, a novel methodological proposal to perform climate risk assessment in Natura 2000 sites is presented that implements the systematic approach of ISO 14090 in combination with the theoretical framework of ecosystem services assessment and local stakeholder participation to identify climate-related issues for local protected habitats and improve the knowledge base needed to plan sustainable conservation and restoration measures. The methodology was applied to five Natura 2000 sites located along the Adriatic coast of Italy and Slovenia. Results show that each of the assessed sites, despite being along the coast of the same sea, is affected by different climate-related issues, impacting different habitats and corresponding ecosystem services. This novel methodology enables a simple and rapid screening for the prioritization of conservation actions and of the possible further investigations needed to support decision making, and was found to be robust and of general applicability. These findings highlight the importance of designing site-specific adaptation measures, tailored to address the peculiar response to climate change of each site in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services.","[Barausse, Alberto] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Via U Bassi 58-B, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Barausse, Alberto; Occhipinti, Irene; Endrizzi, Lara; Guadagnin, Giovanna; Piron, Mirco; Manzardo, Alessandro] Univ Padua, Dept Ind Engn, Via Gradenigo 6-A, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Meulenberg, Cecil; Vizintin, Liliana] Mediterranean Inst Environm Studies, Sci & Res Ctr Koper, Garibaldijeva 1, Koper 6000, Slovenia; [Abordi, Marco] Terra Srl, Galleria Progresso 5, I-30027 San Dona Di Piave, Italy; [Visintin, Francesca] eFrame Srl, Via J Linussio 51, I-33100 Udine, Italy",University of Padua; University of Padua,"Manzardo, A (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Ind Engn, Via Gradenigo 6-A, I-35131 Padua, Italy.;Meulenberg, C (corresponding author), Mediterranean Inst Environm Studies, Sci & Res Ctr Koper, Garibaldijeva 1, Koper 6000, Slovenia.",alberto.barausse@unipd.it; cecil.meulenberg@zrs-kp.si; irene.occhipinti.1@unipd.it; m.abordi@terrasrl.com; lara.endrizzi@gmail.com; giovanna.guadagnin@studenti.unipd.it; mirco.piron@phd.unipd.it; francesca.visintin@eframe.it; liliana.vizintin@zrs-kp.si; alessandro.manzardo@unipd.it,"VISINTIN, FRANCESCA/AIF-3722-2022","VISINTIN, FRANCESCA/0000-0001-5709-9636; Meulenberg, Cecil/0000-0001-8778-3316; Barausse, Alberto/0000-0002-2849-7624; Manzardo, Alessandro/0000-0003-0245-6944",EU Programme 'Interreg V-A Italia-Slovenija [4295/2019],EU Programme 'Interreg V-A Italia-Slovenija,"This research was funded by EU Programme 'Interreg V-A Italia-Slovenija 2014-2020', project number 4295/2019, which also funded the APC.",,29,0,0,6,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2022,14,13,,,,,,,7567,10.3390/su14137567,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14137567,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2W1RR,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000824310200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study is based on a large-scale survey of practices of aquaculture operators in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Climate-related risks to profits of aquaculture farms in the Mekong Region are typically managed alongside water-related, disease and other business risks. Farmers who were more concerned with risks to profitability had a history of undertaking more risk management practices. Farmers growing shrimp (rather than fish), or adopting more intensified production systems, had more risk management practices. Wealthier and more educated farmers had experience with more practices for dealing with current risks, as well as recognized the need for strategies to adapt to a changing climate in the future. Information access is a factor in the adoption of new practices and strategies. Adoption of aeration or use of information-communication technologies to manage climate-related risks, for example, was more likely among more educated and wealthy farmers who belonged to growers' groups. The findings also suggest that attitudes toward innovation, levels of investment and social norms influence adoption of technological, organizational and informational practices.","[Lebel, Louis; Lebel, Phimphakan; Lebel, Boripat] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Social Sci & Dev, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Jutagate, Tuantong] Ubon Ratchathani Univ, Fac Agr, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand; [Nguyen Thanh Phuong] Can Tho Univ, Can Tho, Vietnam; [Akester, Michael Joseph; Soe, Khin Maung] WorldFish, Yangon, Myanmar; [Rangsiwiwat, Amornrat] Rajamangala Univ Technol, Fac Nat Resources, Isan Sakon Nakhon Campus, Sakon Nakhon, Thailand; [Phousavanh, Phouvin] Natl Univ Laos, Fac Agr, Viangchan, Laos; [Navy, Hap] Inland Fisheries Res & Dev Inst, Phnom Penh, Cambodia",Chiang Mai University; Ubon Ratchathani University; Can Tho University; CGIAR; Worldfish; Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi,"Lebel, L (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Social Sci & Dev, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai, Thailand.",louis@sea-user.org,"Jutagate, Tuantong/HJI-4778-2023","Lebel, Boripat/0000-0002-5564-8379","International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada [108526]","International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR)","This study was supported by the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada [Grant No. 108526].",,34,2,3,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

This research investigates the runoff and energy production in the current and future climate for the Tekeze hydropower plant located in the Tekeze river basin in the northern part of Ethiopia. The rainfall-runoff model HBV and the hydropower simulator nMAG were used to generate runoff and energy production in the current and future climate. A combination of five regional climate models and seven global climate models from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment were used to generate bias-corrected scenarios for the future climate. The result shows an increase in future runoff which was shown to be due to an increase in precipitation. However, the current operational strategy of the power plant did not utilize the future runoff in an optimal way. Therefore, based on the projected future inflow, we have developed a new reservoir operational strategy to preserve water for power production. As a result, the energy production was increased, and the flood spill from the reservoir reduced. This shows the need to adapt the hydropower production system to the future flow regimes to get the most out of the available water.","[Adera, Abebe G.; Alfredsen, Knut T.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Adera, AG (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",abbygirma@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,4,4,3,14,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",2040-2244,,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

With accelerated Sea Level Rise, intensification of waves and storm surge severity and increasing anthropogenic pressures, these areas are under multiple threats and society may not receive the same level of ecosystems services. This study aims at measuring the trend of beach erosion and at identifying and quantifying the role of some coastal and marine ecosystems in mitigating beach erosion in the region of Negril (Jamaica). In this location, the tourism industry provides the main source of economic revenue. Even at the national level, the two beaches are important assets linked with 5% of the national revenue as 25% of the hotel rooms are located around Negril. In Jamaica, the tourism industry is a significant component of national GDP. 25% of hotel rooms are located around the two beaches of Negril, which have lost an average of 23.4 m of width since 1968. Given the importance of Negril's beaches to their economy, the Government of Jamaica asked UNEP to conduct a study to identify causes of beach erosion in Negril and potential solutions to address trends of beach erosion, in the context of future sea level rise scenarios induced by climate change. This paper addresses the current beach erosion status and future trends under different climate scenarios. We explain how, by using remote sensing, GIS, wave modelling and multiple regressions analysis associated with national, local and community consultations, we were able to identify and quantify the role of ecosystems for mitigating beach erosion. We show that larger widths of coral and seagrass meadows reduce beach erosion.","[Peduzzi, Pascal] UNEP GRID Geneva, United Nations Environm Programme, CH-1219 Geneva, Switzerland; [Peduzzi, Pascal; Chatenoux, Bruno] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Peduzzi, Pascal] Univ Geneva, Fac Sci, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Velegrakis, Adonis] Univ Aegean, Dept Marine Sci, Mitilini 81100, Greece; [Estrella, Marisol] United Nations Environm Programme, Postconflict & Disaster Management Branch, CH-1219 Geneva, Switzerland; [Karambas, Theofanis] Aristotelian Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Civil Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",University of Geneva; University of Geneva; University of Aegean; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Peduzzi, P (corresponding author), UNEP GRID Geneva, United Nations Environm Programme, CH-1219 Geneva, Switzerland.;Peduzzi, P (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.;Peduzzi, P (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Fac Sci, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",pascal.peduzzi@unige.ch; afv@aegean.gr; bruno.chatenoux@unepgrid.ch; marisol.estrella@un.org; karambas@civil.auth.gr,,"Velegrakis, Adonis/0000-0001-8222-1189; Peduzzi, Pascal/0000-0002-6166-9555; Karambas, Theofanis/0000-0002-6142-7855",United Nations Environment Programme,United Nations Environment Programme,This research was funded by the United Nations Environment Programme.,,95,0,0,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3298,,ENVIRONMENTS,Environments,MAY,2022,9,5,,,,,,,62,10.3390/environments9050062,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments9050062,,,19,Environmental Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1P3FQ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000801899300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the fact that some of these TMCNs have been active for more than two decades, there has been no systematic investigation of the networks' impact on local climate governance. In this article we attempt to answer if and how local climate governance has been influenced by municipalities' memberships in TMCNs. Our assessment is based on an online survey conducted with staff from all German cities above 50,000 inhabitants with membership in TMCNs, fieldwork and interviews in seven German cities. Network membership mainly influences local climate governance through the following processes: (1) Enabling internal mobilisation (2) Formulating emission reduction goals (3) Institutionalising Climate Trajectories (4) Enabling direct exchange and (5) Offering project support. Our data suggests that the main influences of TMCN membership unfold in internal political processes in the member cities. External interactions, such as between cities or between network staff and cities is comparably less important. We also found that many of these benefits can be associated with laggards rather than pioneering cities. We conclude that TMCNs have considerable influence on local climate governance in Germany.","[Busch, Henner] Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Solvegatan 12, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Busch, Henner] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, POB 170, SE-22270 Lund, Sweden; [Bendlin, Lena] Deutsch Inst Urbanist gGmbH, Zimmerstr 13-15, D-10969 Berlin, Germany; [Fenton, Paul] Linkoping Univ, Div Environm Technol & Management, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Linkoping University,"Busch, H (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, POB 170, SE-22270 Lund, Sweden.",henner.busch@keg.lu.se; bendlin@difu.de; paul.fenton@stockholm.se,"Busch, Henner/AFP-4528-2022","Busch, Henner/0000-0002-0468-2155; Bendlin, Lena/0000-0003-0004-0953",Swedish Research Council Formas grant [259-2008-1718],Swedish Research Council Formas grant(Swedish Research Council Formas),Henner Busch's contribution to this article was supported by the Linneus Centre LUCID funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas [grant number 259-2008-1718].,,34,25,25,3,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,JUN,2018,24,,,,,,221,230,,10.1016/j.uclim.2018.03.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2018.03.004,,,10,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,GH1VF,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000433190000016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The developed model is based on a generalized linear model with the number of ambulance transport due to heatstroke (hereafter the patients with heatstroke) as the explained variable and the daily maximum temperature or wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) as the explanatory variable. With the model based on the daily maximum temperature, we performed the projection of the patients with heatstroke in case of considering only climate change (Case 1); climate change and population dynamics (Case 2); and climate change, population dynamics, and long-term heat acclimatization (Case 3). In Case 2, the number of patients with heatstroke in the near future will be 2.3 times higher than that in the baseline period (1981 - 2000) on average nationwide. The number of future patients with heatstroke in Case 2 is about 10 % larger than that in Case 1 on average nationwide despite population decline. This is due to the increase in the number of elderly people from the baseline period to the near future. However, in 20 prefectures, the number of patients in Case 2 is smaller compared to Case 1. Comparing the results from Cases 1 and 3 reveals that the number of patients with heatstroke could be reduced by about 60 % nationwide by acquiring heat tolerance and changing lifestyles. Notably, given the lifestyle changes represented by the widespread use of air conditioners, the number of patients with heatstroke in the near future will be lower than that of the baseline period in some areas. In other words, lifestyle changes can be an important adaptation to the risk of heatstroke emergency. All of the above results were also confirmed in the prediction model with WBGT as the explanatory variable.","[Nakamura, Shingo; Sato, Ryogo] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kusaka, Hiroyuki; Sato, Takuto] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Sato, Ryogo] Sompo Risk Management Inc, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tsukuba; University of Tsukuba,"Kusaka, H (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.",kusaka@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,"Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan [JPMXD0715667165]; Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [JPMEERF20192005]","Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan","This work was supported by the Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT) Grant Number JPMXD0715667165 from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan.

Despite the advances in research, there is still a gap between research and effective conservation. To fill this gap, a change is needed in the paradigm of soil conservation research. Therefore, this paper aims to: (i) introduce the concept of Eco-Holistic-Soil Conservation (EHSC) to support the Sustainable Development Goals, (ii) present a framework for the implementation of EHSC, and (iii) show practical examples and recommendations of EHSC. The theory behind the concept of EHSC builds on a critical review of the main causes for success or failure of previous conservation projects and evaluation of latest holistic concepts and visions on conservation of soils and socio-ecosystems. The key principles underlying EHSC are: (1) perception of soils as living-systems, (2) holistic ecosystem approach, (3) central role of soil conservation for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and (4) ethical behavior in soil use. Implementation of EHSC requires a transdisciplinary approach involving a range of actions in three iterative phases: (1) diagnosis of the causes and processes of land degradation and the socioeconomic context, (2) integrated assessment of the interactions and synergies between the factors and actors involved and the selection of EHSC actions, and (3) participatory evaluation and monitoring of impacts. Successful conservation requires more research on the resilience and adaptation of soils to climate change, integrated economic valuations of soil conservation, and protection of native peoples right to land in international legislation.","[Albaladejo, Juan; Diaz-Pereira, Elvira; de Vente, Joris] CEBAS CSIC, Soil & Water Conservat Res Grp, E-30100 Murcia, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Edafologia y Biologia Aplicada del Segura (CEBAS),"Albaladejo, J (corresponding author), CEBAS CSIC, Soil & Water Conservat Res Grp, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",jalba@cebas.csic.es,"DIAZ, ELVIRA/F-4717-2011; de Vente, Joris/C-1304-2012","DIAZ, ELVIRA/0000-0002-7459-5137; de Vente, Joris/0000-0001-7428-0621; Albaladejo, Juan/0000-0002-9603-3864",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [CGL2013-48753-R]; European Union FEDER funds; Fundacion Seneca [20917/PI/18],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); European Union FEDER funds(European Commission); Fundacion Seneca(Fundacion Seneca),This study was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (CGL2013-48753-R co-funded by European Union FEDER funds) and Fundacion Seneca (20917/PI/18).

In Indonesia, the Southeast Asian country in the tropical climate zone, the increasing heat wave duration due to climate change will be also magnified by projected rapid urbanization. Therefore, not only climate change mitigation measures but also adaptation solutions to more frequent extreme weather events are necessary. Adaptation is essential at local levels. The projected increase of the heat wave duration will trigger greater health-related risks. It will also drive higher energy demands, particularly in urban areas, for cooling. New smart solutions for growing urbanization for reducing urban heat island phenomenon are critical, but in order to identify them, analyzing the changing magnitude and spatial distribution of urban heat is essential. We projected the current and future spatial variability of heat stress index in three cities in Indonesia, namely, Medan, Surabaya, and Denpasar, under climate change and land-cover change scenarios, and quantified it with the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) for two periods, baseline (1981-2005) and future (2018-2042). Our results demonstrated that currently the higher level of the UTCI was identified in the urban centers of all three cities, indicating the contribution of urban heat island phenomenon to the higher UTCI. Under climate change scenarios, all three cities will experience increase of the heat, whereas applying the land-cover scenario demonstrated that in only Medan and Denpasar, the UTCI is likely to experience a higher increase by 3.1 degrees C; however, in Surabaya, the UTCI will experience 0.84 degrees C decrease in the period 2018-2042 due to urban greening. This study advanced the UTCI methodology by demonstrating its applicability for urban heat warning systems and for monitoring of the urban green cooling effect, as well as it provides a base for adaptation measures' planning.","[Setiawati, Martiwi Diah; Fukushi, Kensuke] Univ Tokyo, Inst Future Initiat, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Setiawati, Martiwi Diah] Indonesian Inst Sci LIPI, Res Ctr Oceanog, Ancol Timur, Indonesia; [Jarzebski, Marcin Pawel] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo Coll, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Gomez-Garcia, Martin] Nippon Koei R&D Ctr, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev Team, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Fukushi, Kensuke] United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil, Shibuya Ku, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; National Research & Innovation Agency of Indonesia (BRIN); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI); University of Tokyo; United Nations University,"Setiawati, MD (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Future Initiat, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan.;Setiawati, MD (corresponding author), Indonesian Inst Sci LIPI, Res Ctr Oceanog, Ancol Timur, Indonesia.",martiwi1802@gmail.com,"Setiawati, Martiwi Diah/AAY-2116-2020","Setiawati, Martiwi Diah/0000-0003-0465-7985",JSPS KAKENHI [19H01144]; JSPS Core-to-Core Program B under Asia-Africa Science Platforms Center of Excellence in Health Risk Assessment for Adaptation to Climate Change; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19H01144] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); JSPS Core-to-Core Program B under Asia-Africa Science Platforms Center of Excellence in Health Risk Assessment for Adaptation to Climate Change; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI with the grant number 19H01144 and JSPS Core-to-Core Program B under Asia-Africa Science Platforms Center of Excellence in Health Risk Assessment for Adaptation to Climate Change.,,62,2,2,7,12,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2297-3362,,FRONT BUILT ENVIRON,Front.

This being due to limited resources, among others, this paper aims to propose a simple and low-cost approach to assess the viability of human activities under climate change. Design/methodology/approach - Many human activities are feasible only within a narrow range of climatic conditions. Comparing such climate corridors with future climate projections provides an intuitive yet quantitative means for assessing needs for, and the viability of, adaptation activities under climate change. Findings - The approach was tested within development projects in Pakistan, Peru and Tajikistan. The approach was shown to work well for forestry and agriculture, indicating positive/negative prospects for wheat in two districts in Pakistan, temperature constraints for maize in Peru and widening elevation ranges for walnut trees in Tajikistan. Practical implications - Climate corridor analyses feed into the preparation of Local Adaptation Plans of Action in Pakistan.

This study uses panel data methods to document that climate change could also reduce harvested area. We find that 'crop failures' are sensitive to spring and fall temperature conditions. Using perturbations of temperature and precipitation conditions, we show that a uniform 1 C-circle increase in temperature across the U.S. with no adaptation is expected to cause about 3.2 million additional failed acres in the United States, which is equal to a 0.9% decline in acreage. These harmful impacts are predicted to be stronger in the southern than northern United States. For illustrative purposes, we also examine a uniform 3 C-circle warming scenario with no adaptation, and project that damage increases to 11 million lost acres, about a 3% decrease in crop acreage. Projected increases in local precipitation have little effect. The effect of crop failure must be added to previously measured reductions in crop yields from harvested acres, implying climate change is likely to be more harmful to American crop production than previously thought.","[Kim, Seung Min; Mendelsohn, Robert] Yale Univ, Sch Environm, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Mendelsohn, R (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Environm, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",robert.mendelsohn@yale.edu,,,,,,,33,0,0,5,5,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

This paper analyses how impacts of climate change on the hydrological regimes and temperature patterns could affect the irrigated agricultural production in two case study areas, the Aspara and Isfara river basins. The methodology applied is based on analysis of temperature indicators and current cropping calendars in target locations combined with hydrological simulations by the process-based Soil and Water Integrated Model (SWIM) of the two river basins. The selected climate change projections comprise the moderate and high emissions scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The results reveal that climate change will create unfavourable conditions for irrigated spring crops, due to decrease of discharge during the vegetation period. On the other hand, the projected shift of peak discharge to an earlier date offers benefits for irrigated winter cereals, providing more water for irrigation in spring. Results suggest that, there is an opportunity to adapt the irrigated agricultural production in the selected regions by fitting the cropping calendars to changing vegetation periods and to the timing of peak discharges.","[Lobanova, Anastasia; Didovets, Iulii; Menz, Christoph; Hattermann, Fred; Krysanova, Valentina] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegraphenberg A 31, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Umirbekov, Atabek] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Babagalieva, Zhanna] Reg Environm Ctr Cent Asia, Orbita 1, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Lobanova, A (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegraphenberg A 31, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",lobanova@pik-potsdam.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019",", IAMO/0000-0001-7922-9665; Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; Lobanova, Anastasia/0000-0001-5025-4912; Umirbekov, Atabek/0000-0001-5567-2574","Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia - World Bank [D094-7C, IDA D0940]",Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia - World Bank,"This work was supported by the Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia, in the frameworks of the Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Program for Aral Sea Basin (CAMP4ASB) Project, funded by World Bank [Grant No.#D094-7C; Loan Info.: IDA D0940];",,41,4,5,1,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-3774,1873-2283,,AGR WATER MANAGE,Agric.

This article addresses this gap; it draws on literature of political and environmental subjects to examine how political authorities use global climate change knowledge to form 'climate subjects.' It argues that through formation of climate subjects, political authorities can steer the climate change response and simultaneously reproduce structures of political authority. The article takes Vietnam as a case. Vietnam is projected to be one of the countries most affected by climate change, and political authorities have been active in responding, with policies emphasizing knowledge dissemination. The article traces the influence of global climate change knowledge in Vietnamese climate change policy through analysis of national policymaking. It then examines policy implementation and subject formation in sub-national levels of government, as sub-national officials' climate subjectivities are a potent political tool. Such 'street-level bureaucrats' translate policy to practice and shape local climate change responses, livelihoods and lives. The article draws on interviews with sub-national officials and document review of sub-national climate change policies and training documents. The article finds that climate subject formation in Vietnam reflects and contributes to the reproduction of existing political and economic structures. It thereby limits alternative visions of climate change response. This indicates the importance of diverse forms of knowledge - ontologies, epistemologies and conceptualizations of climate change - to support transformational responses rather than functional persistence.","[Lindegaard, Lily Salloum] Danish Inst Int Studies, Ostbanegade 117, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies,"Lindegaard, LS (corresponding author), Danish Inst Int Studies, Ostbanegade 117, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",,,,,,,,63,0,0,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0803-9410,1891-1765,,FORUM DEV STUD,Forum Dev.

While the former has a regional character and uncertainty is approached by means of probabilities and confidence, the latter is context-specific, relies on local knowledge and uncertainty is barely assessed. The objective of this paper is to highlight the relevance of uncertainty analysis in the vulnerability assessment of local adaptation plans by enhancing the Knowledge Quality Assessment tool. This analytical proposal differs from technical uncertainty analysis because it addresses both the social context and the process of knowledge production. Next, the advanced uncertainty dimensions have been applied in the vulnerability assessment used in two Mediterranean adaptation plans. Findings show that institutional arrangements and the role of intermediate parties (contextual dimension) shape the knowledge used, produced, and reproduced (substantive dimension) and hamper community-engaged assessments (procedural dimension). Resulting vulnerability repre-sentations, which are poorly grounded on context-sensitive knowledge, compromise the relevance of risk-assessment outputs and local agency in adaptation governance. The present research contributes to the academic study of plans evaluation and of the adaptation science-governance interface at the local scale.","[Marin-Puig, Anna] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, SGR INTERFASE Grp, Edifici B,Despatx Carrer Fortuna S-N,Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Marin-Puig, Anna] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, Edifici B,Despatx Carrer Fortuna S-N,Campus S-N, Barcelona, Cerdanyola Del, Spain; [Ariza, Eduard; Casellas, Antonia] SGR INTERFASE Grp, Edifici B,Despatx Carrer Fortuna S-N,Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain; [Ariza, Eduard; Casellas, Antonia] Dept Geog, Edifici B,Despatx Carrer Fortuna S-N,Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Marin-Puig, A (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, SGR INTERFASE Grp, Edifici B,Despatx Carrer Fortuna S-N,Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain.;Marin-Puig, A (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, Edifici B,Despatx Carrer Fortuna S-N,Campus S-N, Barcelona, Cerdanyola Del, Spain.",anna.marin@uab.cat; eduard.ariza@uab.cat; antonia.casellas@uab.cat,,,Spanish government within the framework of the POLICLIMA project [CSO2016-76842-C2-1-R]; ECOLEARN project [PID2019-106438RB-I00]; Catalan government through the SGR-INTERFASE group [2017-SGR1458]; FPI grant [FPI BES-2017-080771],Spanish government within the framework of the POLICLIMA project; ECOLEARN project; Catalan government through the SGR-INTERFASE group; FPI grant,"This work was supported by the Spanish government within the framework of the POLICLIMA project (CSO2016-76842-C2-1-R), the ECOLEARN project (PID2019-106438RB-I00), and by the Catalan government through the SGR-INTERFASE group: 2017-SGR1458.

Therefore, the adaptation of cities to counterbalance these adverse changes is urgent. Among available adaptation strategies, urban greening is a measure that is frequently encouraged to improve thermal comfort or energy demand, but whose impacts are not well known at the scale of cities. In this study we evaluate the effects of various urban greening scenarios based on urban climate simulations across the Paris area. The modelling relies on the Town Energy Balance model. The scenarios tested consist of an increase in ground-based vegetation or an implementation of green roofs on compatible buildings, or the two combined. Results show that increasing the ground cover has a stronger cooling impact than implementing green roofs on street temperatures, and even more so when the greening rate and the proportion of trees are important. Green roofs are however the most effective way to reduce energy consumption, not only in summer but also on an annual basis. The effects the various greening measures may have over different seasons is finally addressed in order to draw up a comprehensive inventory of the climatic impacts of such strategies.

The approach is concretely applied to and quantified for two specific study case examples in southwest Sweden, with documented road flooding effects of recorded extreme rainfall.

It is grown in a variety of environments with mean air temperatures of between 14 degrees C and 35 degrees C and is more sensitive to high temperatures than other legumes. As global heating continues, breeding for heat tolerance in common bean is an urgent priority. Transpirational cooling has been shown to be an important mechanism for heat avoidance in many crops, and leaf cooling traits have been used to breed for both drought and heat tolerance. As yet, little is known about the magnitude of leaf cooling in common bean, nor whether this trait is functionally linked to heat tolerance. Accordingly, we explore the extent and genotypic variation of transpirational cooling in common bean. Our results show that leaf cooling is an important heat avoidance mechanism in common bean. On average, leaf temperatures are 5 degrees C cooler than air temperatures, and can range from between 13 degrees C cooler and 2 degrees C warmer. We show that the magnitude of leaf cooling keeps leaf temperatures within a photosynthetically functional range. Heat tolerant genotypes cool more than heat sensitive genotypes and the magnitude of this difference increases at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, we find that differences in leaf cooling are largest at the top of the canopy where determinate bush beans are most sensitive to the impact of high temperatures during the flowering period. Our results suggest that heat tolerant genotypes cool more than heat sensitive genotypes as a result of higher stomatal conductance and enhanced transpirational cooling. We demonstrate that it is possible to accurately simulate the temperature of the leaf by genotype using only air temperature and relative humidity. Our work suggests that greater leaf cooling is a pathway to heat tolerance. Bean breeders can use the difference between air and leaf temperature to screen for genotypes with enhanced capacity for heat avoidance. Once evaluated for a particular target population of environments, breeders can use our model for modeling leaf temperatures by genotype to assess the value of selecting for cooler beans.","[Deva, Chetan R.; Challinor, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Climate Impacts Grp, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Urban, Milan O.] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Falloon, Pete] Hadley Ctr, Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Svitakova, Lenka] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Expt Plant Biol, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Leeds; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Charles University Prague,"Deva, CR (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Climate Impacts Grp, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",C.R.Deva@leeds.ac.uk,"Challinor, Andrew J/C-4992-2008","Challinor, Andrew J/0000-0002-8551-6617; Urban, Milan/0000-0002-3684-856X","UK National Environmental Research Council Industrial Case Award; UK Met Office [NE/M009793/1]; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme - BEIS; Defra; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/S018964/1]; BBSRC [BB/S018964/1, BB/R022801/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [1652933] Funding Source: UKRI","UK National Environmental Research Council Industrial Case Award; UK Met Office; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme - BEIS; Defra(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","CD was supported by a UK National Environmental Research Council Industrial Case Award in collaboration with the UK Met Office NE/M009793/1.

Approaches have been developed for this type of problem, one of which, Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach (DAPP), has been applied in practice in a limited number of circumstances, mainly for large infrastructure projects and at national scales. To better understand what it takes to catalyse uptake of DAPP to better address uncertainty and change than typical static planning approaches, we examined the role of a simulation game facilitated by a knowledge broker, in a real-life local decision setting on flood risk management in New Zealand. Four intervention phases over four years are described and their influence analysed: 1) creating interest through framing the science, 2) increasing awareness using the Game, 3) experimenting with DAPP, and 4) uptake of DAPP. We found that a knowledge broker introducing new framing of changing risk profiles, facilitating use of the Game and the-DAPP approach in a real-life decision making setting, with contextual support from events and (inter)national reports, catalysed the uptake of adaptive pathways planning. We identified enabling requirements necessary for embedding adaptive planning into decision-making practice for addressing uncertainty and change. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We took advantage of a 2-yr extension of a severe drought following an initial study of woody plant dieback in a woody-encroached semiarid savanna in west-central Texas, United States. This study tests for the emergence of alternative vegetation trajectories as a result of continued drought persistence: 1) whether additional woody plant dieback occurred following the initial study, leading to a grass-dominated community, or 2) whether desertification became a major feature (defined as a loss of herbaceous cover and increase in bare ground). Neither the emergence of a grass-dominated community nor the prevalence of desertification was observed during the initial study. After 2 additional yr of drought, we found that dieback of woody plants did not increase above previously observed levels, suggesting that the prolongation of drought did not cause the emergence of a grass-dominated community in this heavily encroached rangeland. However, drought severity did lead to increases in desertification, with increases in bare ground owed to declines in grass cover. While previous research at this long-term research site suggests that desertification is transient with grasses rebounding once precipitation returns to predrought levels, rangeland managers should be aware of lags in vegetation response to drought and the increased potential for a shift toward a bare-ground dominated community following extended extreme drought. In this Texas semiarid savanna, major losses in herbaceous cover lagged behind woody plant dieback, so dieback of the woody component might hold promise as an indicator for near-termpotential of desertification.

This section of the Journal, Review Notes, is the expression of a continuous updating of emerging topics concerning relationships between urban planning, mobility and environment, through a collection of short scientific papers written by young researchers. The Review Notes are made of four parts. Each section examines a specific aspect of the broader information storage within the main interests of TeMA Journal. In particular, the Urban planning literature review section aims at presenting recent books and journals, within global scientific panorama, on selected topics and issues. This first contribution aims to outline the scenario of climate risks faced by cities on the Mediterranean coasts. The mare nostrum region is particularly sensitive to global warming-related phenomena, both because of its position exposed to oceanic, Saharan and polar currents, and because of its intrinsic vulnerability, the roots of which are to be found in the history of conflicts and migrations, of development visions that are antithetic yet complementary. The first contribution of the Review Notes for TeMa vo. 15 highlights the need for integrated action to address the climate crisis in the Mediterranean region, bringing together the strengths and weaknesses of its shores, despite social, economic and political differences.","[Guida, Carmen] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Civil Bldg & Architectural Engn, Civil Syst Engn, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Guida, C (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Civil Bldg & Architectural Engn, Civil Syst Engn, Naples, Italy.",carmen.guida@unina.it,,,,,,,37,0,0,2,2,"UNIV STUDI NAPOLI FEDERICO II, DIPT PIANIFICAZIONE & SCIENZA TERRITORIO",NAPLES,"PIAZZALE TECCHIO 80, NAPLES, 80125, ITALY",1970-9889,1970-9870,,TEMA,TeMA,APR,2022,15,1,,,,,141,148,,10.6092/1970-9870/9037,http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/1970-9870/9037,,,13,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,1K3LS,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000798507300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, a modelling framework is developed to explore how PES negotiations between forestry and fishery-based communities may be affected when warming reduces the stock of fish as well as forest biomass growth rates. Under a PES arrangement, forestry-based communities afforest the lake's catchment region, which helps improve fish stock abundance through reduced sediment loading. When climate warming adversely impacts fish yields, the value of restoring degraded lands in the catchment region increases, making the negotiating powers of the fishing and forestry dependent communities dynamic. Results suggest that the prospect of a climate-driven negotiating power in the future calls for higher PES payments by the fishing community in order to incentivize early restoration. Warming could also affect forest biomass growth rates in the long run. However, findings from this study suggest that warming driven forest biomass growth rate decline may have a relatively lower impact on PES negotiations compared to the direct impact of warming on lake's fish productivity.","[Ranjan, Ram] Shiv Nadar Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Econ, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India",Shiv Nadar University,"Ranjan, R (corresponding author), Shiv Nadar Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Econ, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.",ram.ranjan@snu.edu.in,,,,,,,57,2,2,0,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Technological advances allow to make crisis management more effective, but innovation is hindered by dispersed and often disconnected knowledge on the lessons learned, gaps, and solutions.

This article presents a taxonomy of crisis management functions, designed on the basis of a conceptual model integrating the concepts of hazard, vulnerability, risk, and community, and the main consequence- and management-based concepts. At its highest level, the taxonomy includes ten functional areas: preparatory (mitigation, capability development, and strategic adaptiveness), operational (protection, response, and recovery), and common (crisis communications and information management; command, control, and coordination; logistics; and security management). The taxonomy facilitates the navigation of online platforms and the matching of needs and solutions. It has broader applications, e.g., for structuring the assessment of the societal impact of crisis management solutions and as a framework for a comprehensive assessment of disaster risk reduction measures. While the taxonomy was developed within a research and innovation project supported by the European Union, it reflects and is compatible with established international concepts and classification schemes, and is thus applicable by a wider international community.","[Tagarev, Todor; Ratchev, Valeri] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria",Bulgarian Academy of Sciences,"Tagarev, T (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria.",tagarev@bas.bg; ratchevv@gmail.com,"Tagarev, Todor/AAP-2598-2020","Tagarev, Todor/0000-0003-4424-0201",European Union [607798],European Union(European Commission),"The research leading to these results was performed by the Centre for Security and Defence Management, Institute of ICT, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, as part of the DRIVER+ project and has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement no. 607798.",,111,7,7,4,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2020,12,12,,,,,,,5147,10.3390/su12125147,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12125147,,,32,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MP9AH,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000552489500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper sets out what we learned by complementing multi-criteria decision analysis with DAPP and ROA when developing a 100-year coastal adaptation strategy in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand. Lessons include the value of collaborative community and decision maker processes for increasing understanding about the changing risk over time, and the need to take early actions that enable a shift in pathway before those actions become ineffective. Modifications to the methods highlighted the importance of using several plausible scenarios for stress-testing options; considering costs and consent-ability early, to avoid the perception that hard protection will last; which criteria are appropriate for communities to assess; and making many pathways visible for future decision makers. We learned about the difficulties shifting thinking from short-term protection actions to longer-term anticipatory strategies. We found that a pathways system will require ongoing political leadership and governance with monitoring systems that can manage the adaptive process over long timeframes, by governments and their constituent communities.","[Lawrence, Judy] Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Bell, Robert] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Hamilton 3216, New Zealand; [Stroombergen, Adolf] Infometrics, Wellington 6146, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand,"Lawrence, J (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",judy.lawrence@vuw.ac.nz; rob.bell@niwa.co.nz; adolfs@infometrics.co.nz,"Lawrence, Judy/W-9823-2019","Lawrence, Judy/0000-0001-6798-3636; Bell, Robert/0000-0002-8490-8942","Strategic Science Investment Funding [CAVA1804, CAVA1904]; Hawkes Bay Regional Council; National Science Challenge, Resilience to Nature's Challenges [GNS-RNC005]","Strategic Science Investment Funding; Hawkes Bay Regional Council; National Science Challenge, Resilience to Nature's Challenges","This research under the Living at the Edge Project was funded by The National Science Challenge, Resilience to Nature's Challenges (GNS-RNC005).

With a case study for Flevoland, the Netherlands, we illustrate that (1) crop models cannot account for all relevant climate change impacts and adaptation options, and (2) changes in technology, policy and prices have had and are likely to have larger impacts on farms than climate change. While crop modelling indicates positive impacts of climate change on yields of major crops in 2050, a semiquantitative and participatory method assessing impacts of extreme events shows that there are nevertheless several climate risks. A range of adaptation measures are, however, available to reduce possible negative effects at crop level. In addition, at farm level farmers can change cropping patterns, and adjust inputs and outputs. Also farm structural change will influence impacts and adaptation. While the 5th IPCC report is more negative regarding impacts of climate change on agriculture compared to the previous report, also for temperate regions, our results show that when putting climate change in context of other drivers, and when explicitly accounting for adaptation at crop and farm level, impacts may be less negative in some regions and opportunities are revealed.

The challenges of managing urban water systems under a changing and uncertain climate became starkly apparent during Australia's 'Millennium Drought', a decade-long period of extremely dry conditions throughout the 2000s. As the drought progressed, several state and territory governments assumed control of planning and approvals processes in order to implement large water-supply infrastructure projects with great urgency. However, at the end of the decade La Nina rains saturated catchments, spilled over dam walls and devastated several communities with flooding. Analysis of the frameworks for third-party access, private-sector participation, planning, and water-conservation initiatives reveals that the rules, roles and responsibilities of the many actors are interlinked but not always effectively integrated. The introduction and expansion of competition in the urban water industry are an ongoing experiment with great influence on the governance of the sector and the ways in which water services are planned for and provided.","Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Chong, J (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, POB 123,Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",joanne.chong@uts.edu.au,,"Chong, Joanne/0000-0001-9035-2277",,,,,57,11,11,0,30,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1366-7017,1996-9759,,WATER POLICY,Water Policy,,2014,16,1,,,,,1,18,,10.2166/wp.2013.058,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wp.2013.058,,,18,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,AF1WU,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000334505400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study explores how inhabitants of two Mediterranean French cities, Frejus and Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhone (PSLR), understand and prepare for coastal flood risk. A constructivist approach was adopted combining elements of the Theory of Social Representations and the Social Amplification of Risk Framework. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 41 inhabitants of these two localities. Local dwellers of the two cities base their knowledge of coastal flood risk on previous fluvial flood experiences. Affective attachment to the coast is expressed differently between localities - PSLR inhabitants describe an environmental history that is part of their personal history; whereas Fre ' jus inhabitants have elected this place to live. Risk attenuation argumentative strategies are identified: social comparison, risk comparison and fatalism. A shared understanding that 'something must happen' before coastal floods are taken seriously was also identified. This is discussed as an example of how the objectification process of social representations contributes to raising the societal awareness of new risks, or to their social amplification.","[Bertoldo, Raquel] Aix Marseille Univ, LPS, Aix En Provence, France; [Guignard, Severin; Dias, Pierre; Schleyer-Lindenmann, Alexandra] Aix Marseille Univ, Univ Cote dAzur, Avignon Univ, CNRS,ESPACE,UMR, F-7300 Avignon, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Avignon Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite Cote d'Azur,"Bertoldo, R (corresponding author), Aix Marseille Univ, Lab Psychol Sociale, UR 849, 29 Ave Robert Schuman, F-13621 Aix En Provence, France.",raquel.bohn-bertoldo@univ-amu.fr,"Schleyer-Lindenmann, Alexandra/AAP-4511-2021; Bertoldo, Raquel/F-9319-2012","Schleyer-Lindenmann, Alexandra/0000-0002-6173-4628; Bertoldo, Raquel/0000-0003-0172-5540",Labex OT-Med [ANR-11-LABX0061]; Excellence Initiative of Aix-Marseille University-A*MIDEX; French Investissements d'Avenir programme (RISKMED project); European Union-FEDER programme,Labex OT-Med; Excellence Initiative of Aix-Marseille University-A*MIDEX; French Investissements d'Avenir programme (RISKMED project)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); European Union-FEDER programme,"This work is a contribution to Labex OT-Med (n.

The drivers of change include climate change, management regulations, demographic shifts, and market trends, and their intersectionality and, ultimately, impacts on commercial fishing communities are poorly understood. The research presented here explores connections between climate change and the increase in the average age of commercial fishermen, referred to as ?graying of the fleet?. Ultimately, these connections inform our overall objective: to understand how cumulative impacts from these two ongoing phenomena affect the resilience and adaptive capacity of the fishing community. Parsing out the connections may help managers or policy makers more accurately conceptualize future scenarios of community change and simultaneously enables the location of specific target areas for intervention or opportunity. Oral history semi-structured interviews with members of Oregon?s fishing community were analyzed and recent climate change projections from the literature were synthesized to parameterize a set of possible scenarios regarding impacts on the fishing community. Results indicate that climate change will likely intensify both the stressors contributing to and the impacts of the graying of the fleet in Oregon. Analysis of the cumulative impacts from climate change and graying of the fleet reveal a greater impact on resilient and adaptive capacities of Oregon?s fishing community than analysis of the drivers individually indicates. Therefore, an important implication from this research is the need to evaluate cumulative impacts within these coupled social-ecological systems. Relying on the responsive adaptability of fishing community members alone may not be sufficient, as their resilience and capacity to do so could be limited in the future.","[Haugen, Brianna, I] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Marine Resources Management Program, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Cramer, Lori A.; Conway, Flaxen D.

An inquiry into the coining of the neologisms 'wicked' and 'tame' problems is reported and the implications for research and policy practice explored. As practices, neologising, reifying, categorising and typologising have unintended consequences - they remove us from the primary experiences and underlying emotions that provided the motivation for formulating these concepts in the first place. The failure to institutionalise the understandings and experiences that sit behind the invention of the terms 'wicked' and 'tame' problems (or similar framing choices such as 'problematique', 'messes', 'lowland real-life swamps', 'resource dilemmas' or 'complex adaptive systems') present systemic constraints to institutionalising social learning as an alternative yet complementary governance mechanism within an overall systemic and adaptive governance framework. Ultimately situations usefully framed as `wicked',' such as water managing and climate change are problems of relationship - of human beings with the biosphere. Re-framings, such as institutions as social technologies and other research and praxis traditions concerned with the breakdown of relationships may offer ways forward in the purposeful designing and crafting of more effective institutions.

Cette reference est egalement importante pour de nombreuses applications en hydrologie et en gestion des eaux. Cependant, la reference est difficile a etablir dans des regions ou la couverture des stations meteorologiques est lacunaire, comme dans le nord du Canada ou dans les regions montagneuses. Les reanalyses semblent etre une option interessante pour y parvenir. Elles doivent toutefois etre validees et corrigees des biais avant de pouvoir etre utilisees. Dans cet article, deux methodes d'assimilation de donnees, l'interpolation optimale (IO) et l'interpolation optimale d'ensemble (IOE), ont servi a combiner quatre jeux de donnees de reanalyses avec observations afin d'ameliorer la representation de divers indices de precipitations au Canada. Au total, 986 stations meteorologiques ayant des releves de precipitations couvrant au moins 20 des 30 annees de la periode de reference (1980-2009) ont ete utilisees. Les valeurs annuelles de dix indices de precipitations ont ete estimees pour chaque jeu de donnees disponibles puis combinees (reanalyses plus observations) par IO et IOE. Enfin, une strategie de validation croisee a ete appliquee pour evaluer la performance de chacun des jeux de donnees en question. Selon les resultats, la combinaison de reanalyses et d'observations par IO ou IOE ameliore les estimations d'indices de precipitations des sites ou les precipitations ne sont pas enregistrees. Le jeu de donnees de l'IOE a surpasse l'IO appliquee a chaque reanalyse separement. Une evaluation du jeu de donnees d'observation interpolees aux points de grille de Ressources naturelles Canada montre qu'il doit etre utilise avec circonspection en ce qui a trait aux indices de precipitations extremes, car les valeurs annuelles de precipitations maximales en un jour peuvent etre sous-estimees et le nombre de jours de pluie par annee surestime. Defining a reference climate for precipitation is an important requirement in the development of climate change scenarios to support climate adaptation strategies. It is also important for many hydrological and water resource applications. This, however, remains a challenge in regions that are poorly covered by meteorological stations, such as northern Canada or mountainous regions. Reanalyses may represent an interesting option to define a reference climate in such regions. However, these need to be validated and corrected for bias before they can be used. In this paper, two data assimilation methods, Optimal Interpolation (OI) and Ensemble Optimal interpolation (EnOI), were used to combine four reanalysis datasets with observations in order to improve the representation of various precipitation indices across Canada. A total of 986 meteorological stations with minimally 20-year precipitation records over the 30-year reference period (1980-2009) were used. Annual values of ten Climate Precipitations Indices (CPIs) were estimated for each available dataset and were then combined (reanalysis plus observations) using OI and EnOI. A cross-validation strategy was finally applied to assess the relative performance of these datasets. Results suggest that combining reanalysis and observations through OI or EnOI improves CPI estimates at sites where no recorded precipitation is available. The EnOI dataset outperformed OI applied to each reanalysis independently. An evaluation of the gridded interpolated observational dataset from Natural Resources Canada showed it should be used with considerable caution for extreme CPIs because it can underestimate annual maximum 1-day precipitation, as well as overestimate the annual number of wet days.","[Perez Bello, Alexis; Mailhot, Alain] Ctr Eau Terre Environm INRS ETE, Inst Natl Rech Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS),"Bello, AP (corresponding author), Ctr Eau Terre Environm INRS ETE, Inst Natl Rech Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",Alexis.Perez_Bello@ete.inrs.ca,,"Perez Bello, Alexis/0000-0002-8689-2374",ArcticNet research program,ArcticNet research program,This work was financially supported by the ArcticNet research program.,,55,0,0,1,8,CMOS-SCMO,OTTAWA,"BOX 3211, STATION D, OTTAWA, ON K1P 6H7, CANADA",0705-5900,1480-9214,,ATMOS OCEAN,Atmos.-Ocean,AUG 7,2020,58,4,,,,,243,257,,10.1080/07055900.2020.1800444,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.2020.1800444,,OCT 2020,15,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,OL8ZI,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000577340500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, those affected by climate change have also been the largest contributors to climate change, increasing the risks they will face in the near future. The intensive use of chemical pesticides in conventional agriculture has harmed not only the environment and biodiversity but health of both users and consumers. Responding to these problems, several policies have been put in place over the past decades to reduce pesticide usage as well as to encourage farmers to switch to low-carbon and low-pesticide agriculture, namely, organic agriculture. This study reviews policies related to the development of organic agriculture in Thailand and examines whether organic agriculture is an effective adaptation and mitigation strategy to climate change that can also generate enough food. This study finds that the organic sector has been largely driven by the private sector, particularly the agricultural cooperatives and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which have provided various support ranging from technology transfer, production, financing, distribution, to marketing of organic products. Their role is vital in encouraging farmers to switch to organic farming and growing market opportunities for organic goods. Nevertheless, constraints including inconsistent policies and limited support from the government remain, which, to some extent, weakens the efforts to build sustainable agriculture and climate resilience. To improve organic farming, there is a need for the government agencies to work together with all relevant stakeholders in the organic sector, namely agricultural cooperatives, NGOs, and consumers.","[Lee, Suyeon] Seoul Natl Univ, Asia Dev Inst, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, S (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Asia Dev Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",lee.suyeon@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,71,1,1,6,12,SOUTHEAST ASIAN REGIONAL CENTER GRADUATE STUDY & RESEARCH AGRICULTURE,LAGUNA,"UPLB CAMPUS, LOS BANOS, LAGUNA, 00000, PHILIPPINES",1656-4383,,,ASIAN J AGRIC DEV,Asian J.

Infrastructure design and adaptation are key to addressing theses issues. This article argues for the formulation of a landscape approach that integrates biotic and abiotic systems to envision more dynamic interactions among infrastructure, ecology, and urbanism. Conceptualized as cyborg landscapes, this approach embraces notions of change, adaptation, and feedback to create hybrid infrastructures of human and non-human systems, of living and non-living entities, across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Three examples illustrate that the profession is already (knowingly or unknowingly) working within this framework. Designed as co-dependent socioecological networks, these projects transform and choreograph landscape processes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. They promote an aesthetic that is predicated on relationships between dynamic things and systems. By stressing co-evolutionary processes between human agency and ecological systems, cyborg landscapes aspire to create multifunctional landscapes that do not simply operate in the present, but learn from experiences in order to adapt and grow smarter.","[Lokman, Kees] Univ British Columbia, Sch Architecture & Landscape Architecture, 379 2357 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Lokman, K (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Architecture & Landscape Architecture, 379 2357 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",,,,,,,,47,8,8,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1862-6033,2164-604X,,J LANDSC ARCHIT,J.

In this article, we present an integrated assessment of vulnerability to natural hazards, which incorporates both exposure and social vulnerability. In our assessment, we screen places and rank them by their relative scores on exposure and vulnerability indices. We also design a web-based visualization tool - ViewExposed - that shows maps that reveal a considerable geographic variation in integrated vulnerability. ViewExposed makes it easy to identify the places with the highest integrated vulnerability, and it facilitates the understanding of the factors that make these places exposed and/or vulnerable. For empirical validation, we correlate the exposure indices with insurance claims due to natural damage. However, we also emphasize the importance of a dialog with relevant stakeholders to ensure a participatory validation. Our top-down exposure and vulnerability assessment benefits from a participatory bottom-up assessment.

Using a discrete number of plan forms selected from case studies, a virtual risk database was populated with the results of a large number of parametric dynamic thermal simulations based on the EnergyPlus calculation engine and including aspects such as location within Greater London, orientation, fenestration size and natural ventilation, which are associated with known overheating risk factors. Alternative statistical meta-models were developed with both explanatory and predictive purposes, correlating the simulation input with the overheating risk predictions expressed according to multiple metrics. Results from multiple linear regression analysis show that while all factors considered are relevant towards determining the propensity to overheating, window opening and natural ventilation capacity are by far the strongest predictors among those considered. The implementation of machine learning algorithms is shown to improve the accuracy of the meta-model, producing very high coefficients of determination (R-2) and lower prediction errors (RMSE). The development of a meta-model demonstrates the ability of returning accurate predictions with limited input, albeit with significant limitations. Possibilities of further improvements to the tool are briefly outlined, including the coupling with a User Interface for applicability in a design environment for early-stage design advice.

In order to enhance the risk management capabilities of countries and the institutions responsible for carrying out DRM tasks, new approaches to governance should be explored. In heeding this claim, the Enhancing Risk Management Capabilities Guidelines creates a list of recommendations for how governance and management measures can support work in each of the DRM phases and across them. These guidelines are built around the SHIELD model, encompassing a set of strategic recommendations across six identified key themes: (1) Sharing Knowledge; (2) Harmonizing Capacities; (3) Institutionalizing Coordination; (4) Engaging Stakeholders; (5) Leveraging Investments; and finally, (6) Developing Communication. This paper presents each of these recommendations, and discusses why they should be seen as central aspects of the future of DRM in which governance is central. In addition, the paper reflects on the process of crafting the guidelines, and the issues inherent in attempting to propose suggestions and recommendations across a range of complex topics in the domain of disaster management.

However, this view has recently changed as researchers, governments, and the UNFCCC have acknowledged the necessity of both mitigation and adaptation. Yet there has been little research on the public's view of adaptation and whether public consideration of adaptation (local or otherwise) might have positive effects or, as feared, distract people from mitigation. Contrary to these fears, here we experimentally show that consideration of local adaptation to sea-level rise significantly increased people's willingness to perform personal emissions-reducing behaviors, such as using public transport, eating less meat, and flying less. We surveyed residents in the Wellington region of New Zealand, randomly assigning respondents either to answer questions about climate change and mitigation only, or first to answer questions about potential local sea-level rise and adaptation measures that could be taken in their region. Respondents who first considered this local adaptation scored significantly higher on a measure of personal willingness to mitigate, and responses did not change depending on participants' level of skepticism of anthropogenic climate change. These results reveal the potential for discussion and consideration of local adaptation to engage the public in mitigation actions, possibly by making the problem of climate change less distant and more tangible.

The impact on other yeast metabolites was also compared using an S. uvarum isolate and an S. cerevisiae wine yeast. The upper limit of fruit concentration that allowed the S. uvarum isolate to ferment wines to < 5 g/L residual sugar was defined. Methods and results: Cabernet franc grapes were partially dehydrated to three different post-harvest sugar targets (24.5 degrees Brix, 26.0 degrees Brix, and 27.5 degrees Brix) along with non-dehydrated rapes (21.5 degrees Brix control). Musts from all treatments were vinified with either the S. uvarum isolate CN1, formerly identified as S. bayanus, or S. cerevisiae EC1118. All wines were successfully vinified to less than 5 g/L residual sugar. Fermentation kinetics between the two yeasts were similar for all wines other than 27.5 degrees Brix, where CN1 took three days longer. During fermentation with CN1, acetic acid peaked on day two, then decreased in concentration, resulting in final wine acetic acid lower than that measured on day two. Wines fermented with EC1118 showed an increase in acetic acid over the time-course of fermentation. Significantly lower wine oxidative compounds (acetic acid, acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate) and higher glycerol resulted in wine produced with CN1 in comparison to EC1118. Both yeasts produced comparable ethanol at each Brix level tested. Further studies showed that CN1 lowered acetic acid seven-fold from 0.48 g/L in juice to 0.07 g/L in wine whereas EC1118 reduced acetic acid to 0.18 g/L. Conclusions: The autochthonous S. uvarum yeast isolate successfully fermented partially dehydrated grapes to < 5 g/L sugar up to 27.5 degrees Brix. The consumption rate of acetic acid was faster than its production during fermentation, resulting in low acetic acid, acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate in wine in comparison to a commercial S. cerevisiae yeast while consistently producing higher glycerol. Significance and impact of the study: The S. uvarum yeast isolate can metabolize acetic acid during fermentation to significantly lower acetic acid, ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde in wine. It can also reduce acetic acid by seven-fold from the starting juice to the finished wine, which could have potential application for managing sour rot arising in the vineyard or during the dehydration process in making appassimento-style wines.","[Kelly, Jennifer M.; Inglis, Debra L.] Brock Univ, Ctr Biotechnol, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Dowling, Lisa K.; Pickering, Gary J.; Kemp, Belinda; Inglis, Debra L.] Brock Univ, Cool Climate Oenol & Viticulture Inst, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Van Dyk, Stephanie A.; Pickering, Gary J.; Kemp, Belinda; Inglis, Debra L.] Brock Univ, Dept Biol Sci, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",Brock University; Brock University; Brock University,"Inglis, DL (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Ctr Biotechnol, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.;Inglis, DL (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Cool Climate Oenol & Viticulture Inst, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.;Inglis, DL (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Dept Biol Sci, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",dinglis@brocku.ca,,,Ontario Research Fund-Research Excellence grant [ORF RE-05-038]; Ontario Grape and Wine Research Inc.; Canadian Grapevine Certification Network [ASC-012]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [NSERC 238872-2012],Ontario Research Fund-Research Excellence grant; Ontario Grape and Wine Research Inc.; Canadian Grapevine Certification Network; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"This project was funded by an Ontario Research Fund-Research Excellence grant (ORF RE-05-038) including financial contribution from Ontario Grape and Wine Research Inc., a grant from the Canadian Grapevine Certification Network (ASC-012, activity 14B), and a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC 238872-2012).

Design/methodology/approach - The analytic hierarchy process was applied to prioritize key criteria, NELD indicators and practices that should be integrated into disaster risk reduction decisions at the local level. Findings - The results showed the need for prioritizing NELDs at the local level, and especially for integrating into DRR policy and planning for addressing NELDs. The results indicated that the national disaster management plan could be enhanced to address issues related to inaccessible sanitation, waterborne diseases and mental disorders, and the school discontinuation. Research limitations/implications - The results are specific to Bangladesh. Readers may find them applicable to other similar country situations. Practical implications - The suggested risk reduction practices for addressing NELDs are effective for policymakers to prepare for the future extreme cyclone disasters. Social implications - The study identifies compliance with societal value as an important criterion for decision-making in the affected communities. Societal value can be a basis to determine effective practices to address the NELDs. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, the study is the first ever effort to identify and prioritize NELDs of cyclones in the coastal areas of Bangladesh and therefore might have a greater implication for DRR policy of Bangladesh.","[Chiba, Yohei] IGES, Hayama, Japan; [Prabhakar, S.

For example, Storm Xynthia in France in 2010 resulted in 41 drowning deaths inside buildings. Therefore, there has been increasing recognition of the risk of people becoming trapped in buildings during floods. To identify buildings which could expose their occupants to a risk of death in the case of flooding, we propose the use of the extreme vulnerability index (VIE index), which identifies which buildings are at greatest risk of trapping people during floods. In addition, the mortality function method is used to further estimate the expected number of fatalities based on (1) groups of vulnerable people (e.g., aged or disabled), (2) the location of buildings in relation to major watercourses, and (3) the configuration of buildings (e.g., single or multiple entries and single or multiple stories). The overall framework is derived from case studies from Storm Xynthia which give a deterministic approach for deaths inside buildings for coastal floods, which is suited for low-lying areas protected by walls or sandy barriers. This methodology provides a tool which could help make decisions for adaptation strategy implementation to preserve human life.","[Creach, Axel; Mercier, Denis] Sorbonne Univ, Geog & Planning Dept, Lab Phys Geog Actual & Quaternary Environm, 191 Rue St Jacques, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bastidas-Arteaga, Emilio] La Rochelle Univ, CNRS, Lab Engn Sci Environm, LaSIE,UMR 7356, Ave Michel Crepeau, F-17042 La Rochelle 1, France; [Pardo, Sophie] LEMNA Nantes Univ, Lab Econ & Management Nantes, Chemin Cens Tertre Batiment Erdre, F-44322 Nantes, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Creach, A (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, Geog & Planning Dept, Lab Phys Geog Actual & Quaternary Environm, 191 Rue St Jacques, F-75005 Paris, France.",axel.creach@sorbonne-universite.fr; ebastida@univ-lr.fr; sophie.pardo@univ-nantes.fr; denis.mercier@sorbonne-universite.fr,"Pardo, Sophie/AHA-6091-2022; Bastidas-Arteaga, Emilio/A-6090-2012","Pardo, Sophie/0000-0002-9839-4946; Bastidas-Arteaga, Emilio/0000-0002-7370-5218; Mercier, Denis/0000-0003-2325-1390; Creach, Axel/0000-0002-6444-735X",COSELMAR research program - Regional Council of Pays de la Loire,COSELMAR research program - Regional Council of Pays de la Loire,"This research was supported by the COSELMAR research program, funded by the Regional Council of Pays de la Loire (20122017): www.coselmar.fr (accessed 19 January 2022).",,66,0,0,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,FEB,2022,12,2,,,,,,,125,10.3390/buildings12020125,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings12020125,,,26,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,ZL5YP,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000763752900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In some countries a cause of low demand for flood insurance is the crowding out of private insurance uptake due to the anticipation of government compensation for uninsured damage, a phenomenon known as charity hazard. This study applies a partial equilibrium model of flood insurance markets to explore the extent of charity hazard and the insurance protection gap for EU-countries until 2050. For this analysis, we apply an expected utility framework with insurance purchase decision functions that capture the probability, ambiguity and extent of government compensation. By accounting for country-level insurance systems and government compensation types, as well as regional flood risk, we aim to assess how charity hazard develops under different conditions. The extent of charity hazard decreases with uncertainty of government compensation, as well as with higher flood risk. Considering current and future conditions, the highest impact of charity hazard is observed in regions of Germany and Italy. The projected insurance protection gap is highest in Germany, followed by Spain, Poland and Italy, and is expected to grow towards 2050.","[Tesselaar, Max; Botzen, W. J.

Using survey data from 1,267 farm households in 25 villages from Bihar and Haryana in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, this study analyzes the factors that determine the probability and level of adoption of multiple CSA practices, including seeds of stress-tolerant varieties, minimum tillage, laser land leveling, site-specific nutrient management and crop diversification. We applied a multivariate probit model for the simultaneous multiple adoption decisions, and ordered probit models for assessing the factors affecting the level of adoption. The adoption of the various CSA practices is interrelated, whereas several factors, including household characteristics, plot characteristics, market access and major climate risks are found to affect the probability and level of CSA adoption. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) adoption and its intensity also vary significantly between eastern Bihar, which is relatively poor and densely populated, and north-western Haryana. Engaging multiple stakeholders such as farmers, agricultural institutions, agricultural service providers and concerned government departments at the local level is crucial for the large-scale uptake of CSA. The study, therefore, calls for agricultural policy reforms so that most of the issues related to the uptake of CSA can be adequately addressed.","[Aryal, Jeetendra Prakash; Rahut, Dil Bahadur; Erenstein, Olaf] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Maharjan, Sofina] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Nairobi, Kenya",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Aryal, JP (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",jeetenaryal@gmail.com; D.Rahut@cgiar.org; sofina.maharjan@cgiar.org; O.Erenstein@cgiar.org,"Rahut, Dil Bahadur/AAD-8370-2022","Aryal, Jeetendra/0000-0002-9128-5739; Erenstein, Olaf/0000-0002-7491-5786; Rahut, Dil Bahadur/0000-0002-7505-5271","CGIAR Research Program (CRPs) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Research Program (CRPs) on Wheat Agri-Food Systems (CRP WHEAT); government of Australia; government of Belgium; government of Canada; government of China; government of France; government of India; government of Japan; government of Korea; government of Netherlands; government of New Zealand; government of Norway; government of Sweden; government of Switzerland; government of United Kingdom; government of United States; World Bank","CGIAR Research Program (CRPs) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Research Program (CRPs) on Wheat Agri-Food Systems (CRP WHEAT)(CGIAR); government of Australia; government of Belgium(CGIAR); government of Canada(CGIAR); government of China; government of France; government of India; government of Japan; government of Korea(Korean Government); government of Netherlands(Netherlands Government); government of New Zealand; government of Norway; government of Sweden; government of Switzerland; government of United Kingdom; government of United States; World Bank(The World Bank India)","The authors acknowledge the support of the CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and Wheat Agri-Food Systems (CRP WHEAT) for this study.

Resilient buildings need to be designed, capable of adapting to future extreme heat. Simulations are required assuming a one-dimensional heat transfer problem through walls and a simulation horizon of several years (nearly 30). The computational cost associated with such modeling is quite significant and model reduction methods are worth investigating. The objective is to propose a reliable reduced-order model for such long-term simulations. For this, an alternative model reduction approach is investigated, assuming a known Proper Orthogonal Decomposition reduced basis for time, and not for space as usually. The model enables computing parametric solutions using basis interpolation on the tangent space of the GRASSMANN manifold. Three study cases are considered to verify the efficiency of the reduced-order model. Results highlight that the model has a satisfying accuracy of 10-3 compared to reference solutions. The last case study focuses on the wall energy efficiency design under climate change according to a four-dimensional parameter space. The latter is composed of the load material emissivity, heat capacity, thermal conductivity and thickness insulation layer. Simulations are carried over 30 years considering climate change. The solution minimizing the wall work rate is determined with a computational ratio of 0:1% compared to standard approaches.","[Berger, Julien; Allery, Cyrille] La Rochelle Univ, Lab Sci Ingenieur Environm LaSIE, UMR CNRS 7356, CNRS, F-17000 La Rochelle, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Berger, J (corresponding author), La Rochelle Univ, Lab Sci Ingenieur Environm LaSIE, UMR CNRS 7356, CNRS, F-17000 La Rochelle, France.",,,,,,,,66,0,0,8,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0378-7788,1872-6178,,ENERG BUILDINGS,Energy Build.,AUG 1,2022,268,,,,,,,,112187,10.1016/j.enbuild.2022.112187,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2022.112187,,MAY 2022,21,"Construction & Building Technology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering,2E6FD,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000812321200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The resulting quantitative, comparative and integrative concepts and findings are explored to answer fundamental questions: what to adapt, how to adapt, and who adapts. From this, a refreshing outlook of the targets, mechanisms and attitudes that shape agricultural adaptation is proposed as part of transformational changes, multifunctional landscapes, resilience building, and sustainable agriculture. These visions are seen here as mainstreaming facilitators.

To deal with these uncertainties, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and methods for robust decision-making can be combined. This paper sequentially applies CBA, robust optimisation methods and info-gap analysis to find efficient and robust coastal flood protection strategies for the German Baltic Sea coast. The CBA results suggest that - under flood risk assumptions - a share of the coast of Schleswig-Holstein (9.3-10.1%; 60-65 km) and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4.1-10.0%; 78-189 km) with relatively high flood exposure, might currently be under-protected from a social welfare perspective. Present Value estimates of regional investment costs of five regret or loss minimising strategies range from 1.7 to 4.8 billion Euro across robustness metrics at 3% discounting. The info-gap analysis suggests that some of these strategies will fail to prevent large-scale damages under high-end scenarios. We conclude that a multi-method cost-benefit approach can be used to narrow down the number of solutions that are both potentially efficient and sufficiently robust by investigating strategy performance within, across and beyond predefined scenarios.","[van der Pol, Thomas; Hinkel, Jochen] Global Climate Forum, Adaptat & Social Learning, Berlin, Germany; [Hinkel, Jochen] Humboldt Univ, Div Resource Econ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst, Berlin, Germany; [Hinkel, Jochen] Humboldt Univ, Berlin Workshop Inst Anal Social Ecol Syst WINS, Berlin, Germany; [Merkens, Jan; Vafeidis, Athanasios T.] Univ Kiel, Coastal Risks & Sea Level Rise Res Grp, Kiel, Germany; [MacPherson, Leigh] Siegen Univ, Dept Hydraul & Coastal Engn, Siegen, Germany; [Arns, Arne] Univ Rostock, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Rostock, Germany; [Dangendorf, Sonke] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA USA",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Kiel; Universitat Siegen; University of Rostock; Old Dominion University,"van der Pol, T (corresponding author), Global Climate Forum, Adaptat & Social Learning, Berlin, Germany.",thomas.van.der.pol@globalclimateforum.org,"Vafeidis, Athanasios Thomas/Z-6053-2019","Vafeidis, Athanasios Thomas/0000-0002-3906-5544; Hinkel, Jochen/0000-0001-7590-992X; Arns, Arne/0000-0002-3709-2514",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SPP-1889],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"\All authors have received funding from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), [grant SEASCAPE], as part of the Special Priority Program Regional Sea Level Change and Society (SPP-1889).",,66,4,4,2,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Rapid rates of change in coastal environments, from wetlands and deltas to inlets and dune systems, help researchers recognize, observe, and investigate coupling in natural (non-human) morphodynamics and biomorphodynamics. This same intrinsic quality of fast-paced change also makes developed coastal zones exemplars of observable coupling between physical processes and human activities. In many coastal communities, beach erosion is a natural hazard with economic costs that coastal management counters through a variety of mitigation strategies, including beach replenishment, groynes, revetments, and seawalls. As cycles of erosion and mitigation iterate, coastline change and economically driven interventions become mutually linked. Emergent dynamics of two-way economic-physical coupling is a recent research discovery. Having established a strong theoretical basis, research into coupled human-coastal systems has passed its early proof-of-concept phase. This paper frames three major challenges that need resolving in order to advance theoretical and empirical treatments of human-coastal systems: (1) codifying salient individual and social behaviors of decision-making in ways that capture societal actions across a range of scales (thus engaging economics, social science, and policy disciplines); (2) quantifying anthropogenic effects on alongshore and cross-shore sediment pathways and long-term landscape evolution in coastal zones through time, including direct measurement of cumulative changes to sediment cells resulting from coastal development and management practices (e.g., construction of buildings and artificial dunes, bulldozer removal of overwash after major storms); and (3) reciprocal knowledge and data exchange between researchers in coastal morphodynamics and practitioners of coastal management. Future research into human-coastal systems can benefit from decades of interdisciplinary work on the complex dynamics of common-pool resources, from computational efficiency and new techniques in numerical modeling, and from the growing catalog of high-resolution geospatial data for natural and developed coastlines around the world.

It is therefore important to understand the resulting potential changes in bicycle flows in order to accommodate adaptation planning for cycling. We propose a framework to model the changes in bicycle flow in London by developing a negative binomial count-data model and by incorporating future projected weather data from downscaled global climate models, a first such approach in this area. High temporal resolution (hourly) of our model allows us to decipher changes not only on an annual basis, but also on a seasonal and daily basis. We find that there will be a modest 0.5% increase in the average annual hourly bicycle flows in London's network due to a changed climate. The increase is primarily driven by a higher temperature due to a changed climate, although the increase is tempered due to a higher rainfall. The annual average masks the differences of impacts between seasons though - bicycle flows are expected to increase during the summer and winter months (by 1.6%), decrease during the spring (by 2%) and remain nearly unchanged during the autumn. Leisure cycling will be more affected by a changed climate, with an increase of around 7% during the weekend and holiday cycle flows in the summer months. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the last several decades, countries around the globe have embraced variants of the philosophy of administration broadly called New Public Management (NPM) in an effort to improve administrative efficiencies and the provision of public services. Using evidence from a case study of reforms in the building sector in Norway, and a case study of water and flood risk management in central Mexico, we analyze the implications of the adoption of the tenets of NPM for adaptive capacity. Our cases illustrate that some of the key attributes associated with governance for adaptation-namely, technical and financial capacities; institutional memory, learning and knowledge; and participation and accountability-have been eroded by NPM reforms. Despite improvements in specific operational tasks of the public sector in each case, we show that the success of NPM reforms presumes the existence of core elements of governance that have often been found lacking, including solid institutional frameworks and accountability. Our analysis illustrates the importance of considering both longer-term adaptive capacities and short-term efficiency goals in public sector administration reform.","[Eakin, Hallie] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Eriksen, Siri] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, N-1432 As, Norway; [Eikeland, Per-Ove] Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, Lysaker, Norway; [Oyen, Cecilie] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architectural Design & Management, Oslo, Norway",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Eakin, H (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Hallie.Eakin@asu.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Eakin, Hallie/J-3654-2012",,SINTEF; University of Oslo Potentials of and Limits to Adaptation in Norway project; National Science Foundation [0401939],SINTEF(SINTEF); University of Oslo Potentials of and Limits to Adaptation in Norway project; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors appreciate the helpful comments of the anonymous reviewers of this manuscript.

To achieve such societal impact, scientists are using climate services to engage directly with stakeholders to better understand their needs and inform knowledge production. However, the wide variety of climate-services outcomes-ranging from establishing collegial relationships with stakeholders to obtaining specific information for inclusion into a pre-existing decision process-do not directly connect to traditional methods of measuring scientific impact (e.g., publication citations, journal impact factor). In this paper, we describe how concepts from the discipline of evaluation can be used to examine the societal impacts of climate services. We also present a case study from climate impacts and adaptation research to test a scalable evaluation approach. Those who conduct research for the purposes of climate services and those who fund applied climate research would benefit from evaluation from the beginning of project development. Doing so will help ensure that the approach, data collection, and data analysis are appropriately conceived and executed.","[Bamzai-Dodson, Aparna] US Geol Survey, North Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Bamzai-Dodson, Aparna; McPherson, Renee A.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, Norman, OK 73071 USA; [McPherson, Renee A.] US Geol Survey, South Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Norman, OK 73071 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Bamzai-Dodson, A (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, North Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.;Bamzai-Dodson, A (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, Norman, OK 73071 USA.",abamzai@usgs.gov,"; McPherson, Renee/H-6256-2016","Bamzai-Dodson, Aparna/0000-0002-2444-9051; McPherson, Renee/0000-0002-1497-9681",U.S. Geological Survey South Central and North Central Climate Adaptation Science Centers,U.S. Geological Survey South Central and North Central Climate Adaptation Science Centers,"This work was funded by the U.S. Geological Survey South Central and North Central Climate Adaptation Science Centers.

Given the climate challenges ahead this seems unjustified. Small and medium-sized cities (SMCs) deserve scholarly attention as well. The main question is: What factors influence climate change policy and local climate actions in SMCs? In this article we present an analytical framework to analyze climate change policy and local climate actions of SMCs. The framework addresses different aspects: policy-input, -throughput, -output, -outcome, characteristics of the local environment, local action arenas, influence by higher government levels, and interaction with climate change issue networks. The framework is used to analyze and compare four case studies of SMCs in the Dutch region of Twente (two urban and two rural municipalities, and addresses both adaptation and mitigation). Results show that both localist', multi-level' and issue network membership factors influence local climate policy action. Governance modes discerned concern mostly governing by authority' and self-governing'. When reflecting on the role of SMCs in climate action the study revealed the importance of local capacity building schemes issued by provincial government, inter-municipal network collaboration, and the potential for local governments to mobilize and organize citizen action.","[Hoppe, Thomas] Delft Univ Technol, Policy Org Law & Gaming POLG, Dept Multiactor Syst MAS, Fac Technol Policy & Management TPM, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; [van der Vegt, Arjen; Stegmaier, Peter] Univ Twente, Dept Sci Technol & Policy Studies STPS, Inst Innovat & Governance Studies IGS, Fac Behav Management & Social Studies BMS, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; University of Twente,"Hoppe, T (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Policy Org Law & Gaming POLG, Dept Multiactor Syst MAS, Fac Technol Policy & Management TPM, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",T.Hoppe@tudelft.nl; arjenvdvegt@gmail.com; p.stegmaier@utwente.nl,"Hoppe, Thomas/W-7895-2019",,,,,,94,37,37,4,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2016,8,9,,,,,,,847,10.3390/su8090847,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su8090847,,,41,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DZ0LC,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000385529400019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Introducing an N-2-fixing legume cover crop in rubber plantations may reduce runoff and soil erosion as well as increasing the availability of nutrients but may also increase competition for water. This study quantified the effect of the legume cover crop Pueraria phaseoloides on N, P and K nutrition, water status and growth of young rubber trees (three years old in 2007) over a four year period (2007-2010). The plantation was located on a toposequence with a range of soil depths and water storage capacities in northeast Thailand. The legume aboveground biomass production and its nutrient content and decomposition rate were measured and the N-2 fixation was estimated using the abundance of N-15 (delta N-15) in the legume. Measurements were taken of the tree stem girth and height and tree leaf predawn water potential, nutrient content and greenness. The transfer of N2 fixed by the cover crop to the trees was estimated using delta N-15 in the tree leaves. The annual biomass production of the legume was 8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) and the N accumulation by the legume was 250 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). The natural abundance method applied to the aboveground components of the legume gave N-2 fixation rates varying from 85 to 93% depending on the year. The leaf delta N-15 was similar in the three non-legumes (H. brasiliensis,Vetiveria zizanioides and Praxelis clematidea) used as reference plants for estimating the N-2 fixation. The higher level of N and the much lower leaf delta N-15 values for the rubber trees intercropped with P. phaseoloides, compared to rubber trees growing without a legume cover crop, showed that there was a relatively high transfer of fixed N from the legume to the trees, varying from 39% to 46% of tree leaf N depending on the year. Neither N2 fixation nor N transfer varied significantly along the toposequence. At the bottom of the toposequence, both the nutrient (N, P and K) and water status of trees was significantly improved with the legume cover crop, doubling the tree girth at seven years of age (tree girth: 28 cm, tree height: 700 cm). However, at the top of the toposequence with low water storage capacity, the legume cover crop improved tree nutrition and growth but reduced the trees' ability, to survive intense drought. These results raise concern about the resilience to drought of the rubber tree/P. phaseoloides system, since the positive effect of the legume on rubber tree nutrition and growth may increase the risk of water stress and tree mortality. With future changes in climate, an increasing number of areas will be concerned by the question of optimizing the tradeoff between N inputs and water availability.

However, the impact of future climate on the geographic range of many crops in West Africa is still uncertain. This is exacerbated by considerable uncertainty in projecting future West African climate by global circulation models (GCMs). In this paper, the current land suitability for rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) production in West Africa and how it would change in response to a range of future climate changes were assessed. A novel non-additive approach involving the integration of a fuzzy measure modelling procedure and the Choquet integral to deal with non-linear relationships among criteria was introduced. The supervised and unsupervised variants of the approach and the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregators were evaluated and compared using data on the current climate, soil characteristics, and actual maize yield estimates at some locations across the region. The supervised fuzzy measure modelling outperformed the unsupervised variant and the OWA operators, demonstrating the importance of considering interaction among criteria and incorporating human reasoning in multicriteria analysis. Consequently, the supervised modelling approach was used to estimate suitability scores for rainfed maize for the current and a range of plausible future climates which were generated from unique combinations of temperature and rainfall percentile values (5th, 50th and 95th) from 25 and 32 GCMs projections under the RCPs 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. Under the current climate in West Africa, the combined suitable/highly suitable areas for rainfed maize production are in the humid savanna zones. In contrast, the forest region to the south exhibited moderate suitability with the semi-arid savanna zones being marginally suitable. Relative to the current climate in which 91.3% of West Africa is at least moderately suitable for maize production, suitability for maize will change in at least 43% of West Africa in response to future climate change. Across all scenarios and years, future suitability in the semi-arid region of the Sudano-Sahelian savannas shows strong sensitivity to uncertainty in rainfall projections. However, regardless of the trajectory of future rainfall projection, the 95th percentile temperature projection will decrease suitability in about 15% of the West African region by 2080 under the RCP8.5 scenario. Because of the incorporation of uncertainties of future climate projections in this analysis, the results from this study can be used in the development of flexible climate adaptation strategies.","[Ugbaje, S.

A conceptual framework for identifying the triggers of change is presented that was developed under a participatory process and tested during stakeholder dialogues with representatives from 15 cities in 12 European countries. The framework comprises of the following three steps: 1. Indicator-based vulnerability assessment, conducted to analyse city vulnerability and problem identification; 2. Constructed visions of the underpinning factors; and 3. Backcasting exercise, to detect the triggers of change. Following a prioritisation exercise across our European sample, regional differences and the prominence of the following patterns in supporting triggers of change have been noted. In Mediterranean region main triggers were public decision and political leadership, regulatory framework (including building codes, accountability, pricing, taxation, penalties and incentives) and learning from disasters triggers of change. Whereas in the Southern-Central region, adaptive multi-level governance, horizontal and vertical improved relationships governance were the main triggers of change. These patterns and framework are applicable to other cities, and indeed to other topics (e.g. mitigation, sustainability, etc.) that support implementation on the ground to achieve truly sustainable, resilient and adaptive cities. We acknowledge the challenges in deriving universally applicable triggers of change, however the study identifies eight overarching triggers of change that can facilitate the transformation of cities.","[Mendizabal, Maddalen; Feliu, Efren] Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Energy & Environm Div Tecnalia Res & Innovat, TECNALIA, Edificio 700,Parque Tecnol Bizkaia, E-48160 Derio, Spain; [Tapia, Carlos] Nordregio, SE-11186 Stockholm, Sweden; [Rajaeifar, Mohammad Ali; Heidrich, Oliver] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Tiwary, Abhishek] De Montfort Univ, Sch Engn & Sustainable Dev, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England; [Sepulveda, Joel] AS Fabrik Bilbao, Campus Bilbao Fabrik,Olagorta Kalea 26, Bilbao 48014, Bizkaia, Spain; [Heidrich, Oliver] Newcastle Univ, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK; De Montfort University; Newcastle University - UK,"Mendizabal, M; Heidrich, O (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",maddalen1214@gmail.com; Oliver.Heidrich@newcastle.ac.uk,"Tapia, Carlos/HJY-5549-2023; Tiwary, Abhishek/CAF-7186-2022","Tapia, Carlos/0000-0002-0075-4668; ","European Community [308497]; Project RAMSES Reconciling Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development for Cities","European Community(European Commission); Project RAMSES Reconciling Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development for Cities","We thank the 50+ stakeholders and the 15 cities that have actively taken part in the stakeholder dialogues.

It attempts to address a practically important question: does policy research actually make a difference in the processes of formulating and institutionalizing local climate change policy? Two case studies from Central Java Indonesia are presented. The analysis focuses on the policy development processes in the cities of Semarang and Pekalongan, both of which were based on an urban climate vulnerability assessment. We discuss and compare the policy-making processes in terms of three analytic dimensions: the type of policy measures, agent, and policy approach. We examine the relationship between assessment outcomes and the efforts to institutionalize climate change policy in the two cities. These case studies show that although policy actors in both cities have developed strategies and policy measures for addressing climate change, the quality of policy-relevant research was a marginal consideration in the policy formulation processes. An established agenda within a policy network had greater impacts on policy-making than research outputs, which were articulated and used in the context of this agenda. Advocacy coalitions re-defined and re-interpreted what research has shown. Understanding this ability is key to ascertain why or why not policy-relevant research matters.","[Setiadi, Rukuh] Diponegoro Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Semarang, Indonesia; [Lo, Alex Y.] Univ Hong Kong, Kadoorie Inst, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Diponegoro University; University of Hong Kong,"Setiadi, R (corresponding author), Diponegoro Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Semarang, Indonesia.",rukuh.setiadi@pwk.undip.ac.id,"Lo, Alex/B-7948-2008; Setiadi, Rukuh/AAM-2309-2020","Lo, Alex/0000-0002-5953-4176; Setiadi, Rukuh/0000-0003-3419-2584",,,,,30,4,4,4,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0811-1146,1476-7244,,URBAN POLICY RES,Urban Policy Res.,JAN 2,2019,37,1,,,,,111,124,,10.1080/08111146.2017.1377607,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08111146.2017.1377607,,,14,Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,HW0HR,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000466362000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Public officers play a crucial role in social-ecological management and decision-making processes, but there is a paucity of research exploring their perceptions on ES supply and demand under a changing climate. We address this gap through an exploratory study that analyses the views of public officers on the potential impacts of climate-change related drivers on multiple ES in a major administrative region from Portugal (EU NUTS 3). We combined qualitative spatial data from participatory maps and semi-quantitative answers from questionnaire-based surveys with 22 officers from public institutions contributing to territorial planning. Contrary to other similar studies, public officers shared a common view on the importance of ES. This view aligns with scientific projections on how a changing climate is expected to influence ES in the region over the next decade. In agreement with other observations in Mediterranean regions, the most perceivably valued ES concerned tangible socio-economic benefits (e.g., periurban agriculture and wine production). Surprisingly, despite the region's potential for cultural ES, and considering the impacts that climate change may hold on them, recreation and tourism did not seem to be embedded in the officers' views. We explore the implications of our findings for territorial planning and social-ecological adaptation, considering that the way stakeholders manage the territory in response to climate change depends on the extent to which they are aware and expect to experience climatic consequences in the future.","[Vaz, Ana Sofia; Pinto, Eva; Vicente, Joana R.

Nevertheless, the agency of local stakeholders in decisions on how to adapt to climate-related environmental change has been largely underappreciated in the climate change sciences as well as in policy decisions. We, therefore, conducted a survey study in Tuvalu, Samoa, and Tonga, asking specifically how residents perceive their situation regarding climate-related challenges, what adaptation strategies they have devised and implemented, and what they expect of governmental and nongovernmental organisations in these efforts. In contrast to the common perception that Pacific small island states are primarily threatened by rising sea levels, residents' perceptions indicate that drought, cyclones and other flood-related problems pose a far more imminent danger. Our results suggest that further research on those perceived environmental changes is advisable to provide reliable data for scientific models and policy decisions.","[Beyerl, Katharina] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany; [Beyerl, Katharina; Mieg, Harald A.] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Weber, Eberhard] Univ South Pacific, Suva, Fiji",Humboldt University of Berlin; University of the South Pacific,"Beyerl, K (corresponding author), Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany.;Beyerl, K (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.",katharina.beyerl@iass-potsdam.de; harald.mieg@hu-berlin.de; eberhard.weber@usp.ac.fj,,,"German Research Foundation (DFG Research Training Group) [GRK 780/III]; German Academic Exchange Service [D/10/43472]; Faculty of Science, Technology and Environment at The University of the South Pacific","German Research Foundation (DFG Research Training Group)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Academic Exchange Service(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Faculty of Science, Technology and Environment at The University of the South Pacific","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG Research Training Group GRK 780/III), The German Academic Exchange Service (D/10/43472), and The Faculty of Science, Technology and Environment at The University of the South Pacific.

Urban pluvial flooding causes damage to buildings and contents, and disturbs stormwater drainage, transportation, and electricity provision. Designing and implementing efficient adaptation measures requires proper understanding of the urban response to heavy rainfall. However, implemented stormwater drainage models lack flood impact data for calibration, which results in poor flood predictions. Moreover, such models only consider rainfall and hydraulic parameters, neglecting the role of other natural, built, and social conditions in flooding mechanisms. This paper explores the potential of open spatial datasets to explain the occurrence of citizen-reported flood incidents during a heavy rain event. After a dimensionality reduction, imperviousness and proximity to watershed outflow point were found to significantly explain up to half of the flooding incidents variability, proving the usefulness of the proposed approach for urban flood modelling and management.

A rapidly warming climate accelerates the need for these restorative treatments, but the treatment priority among forest patches varies considerably. We simulated four treatment scenarios across the 3,450 km(2) Wenatchee River basin in eastern Washington, United States. We used a decision support tool (DST) to assess trade-offs and synergies within and among treatments on wildfire risk and smoke emissions, water yield and snow retention, biomass production, and economic return. Treatment scenarios emphasized prescribed burning (BurnOnly), biomass production (MaxBiomass), gap-based thinning to optimize water yield (IdealWater), and a principle-based restoration scenario (RA1). Fire hazard, smoke emissions, and biomass production metrics were evaluated across scenarios using the Forest Vegetation Simulator, and water yields were modeled using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model. Simulations were summarized to both patch- (10(1)-10(2) ha) and subwatershed- (10(3)-10(4) ha) scales, and treatment effects were evaluated against an untreated baseline landscape. We used logic models to rank effect sizes by scenario across metrics along a continuum between -1 (no or weak effect) to +1 (large effect). All treatments produced benefits across one or more ecosystem services and led to synergistic benefits to water yield and wildfire hazard reduction. Tradeoffs among resource benefits were clear in wilderness where reliance on prescribed burning without mechanical treatment increased costs and eliminated the potential for biomass recovery. The BurnOnly scenario improved fire risk metrics and streamflow, but effect sizes were lower compared to other treatments. IdealWater showed the strongest benefits overall, demonstrating the ability to capture multiple resource benefits through spatially explicit thinning. Our study provides a framework for integrating strategic and tactical models that evaluate tradeoffs and synergies gained through varied management approaches. We demonstrate the utility of decision support modeling to enhance management synergies across large landscapes.","[Povak, Nicholas A.] US Dept Agr Forest Serv Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Placerville, CA 94710 USA; [Povak, Nicholas A.; Hessburg, Paul F.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Povak, Nicholas A.; Furniss, Tucker J.; Hessburg, Paul F.; Salter, R.

This study advances the literature by studying organizational risk perception and adaptation in a multi-hazard context. Instead of treating all weather types indiscriminately, we explicitly consider their unique characteristics and potential distinct effects on risk perception and adaptation in public organizations. The study distills three dimensions along which extreme weather hazards can vary-expected recurrence, impact dispersion, and rate of onset-and theorizes their relationship with organizational risk perception and response. The empirical analysis uses a national two-wave survey on the U.S. largest transit agencies in 2016 and 2019, merged with the National Center for Environmental Information Storm Events Database. We find that extreme weather events are not equal in creating impacts on organizational risk perception and adaptation. Specifically, extreme weather hazards conducive to risk perception and adaptation possess three characteristics: high expected recurrence, widespread impact dispersion, and rapid onset. Meanwhile, the results demonstrate signs of normalizing bias when extreme weather events with all the three characteristics occur at higher frequencies and in moderate intensity.

This nonstationarity challenges traditional conservation goals and human well-being. It also confounds a longstanding management paradigm that assumes a future that reflects the past. As once-familiar ecological conditions disappear, managers need a new approach to guide decision-making. The resist-accept-direct (RAD) framework, designed for and by managers, identifies the options managers have for responding and helps them make informed, purposeful, and strategic choices in this context. Moving beyond the diversity and complexity of myriad emerging frameworks, RAD is a simple, flexible, decision-making tool that encompasses the entire decision space for stewarding transforming ecosystems. Through shared application of a common approach, the RAD framework can help the wider natural resource management and research community build the robust, shared habits of mind necessary for a new, twenty-first-century natural resource management paradigm.","[Schuurman, Gregor W.; Hoffman, Cat Hawkins; Lawrence, David J.] Natl Pk Serv, Climate Change Response Program, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA; [Cole, David N.] Aldo Leopold Wilderness Res Inst, US Forest Serv, Missoula, MT USA; [Cravens, Amanda E.] US Geol Survey, Social & Econ Anal Branch, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Covington, Scott] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Refuge Syst, Falls Church, VA USA; [Crausbay, Shelley D.] Conservat Sci Partners Inc, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Crausbay, Shelley D.] US Geol Survey, North Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Boulder, CO USA; [Magness, Dawn R.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Kenai Natl Wildlife Refuge, Soldotna, AK USA; [Morton, John M.] Alaska Wildlife Alliance, Anchorage, AK USA; [Nelson, Elizabeth A.] Pk Canada, Conservat & Climate Change, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [O'Malley, Robin] USGS North Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service,"Schuurman, GW (corresponding author), Natl Pk Serv, Climate Change Response Program, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA.",gregor_schuurman@nps.gov,,"Crausbay, Shelley/0000-0003-3028-801X; Schuurman, Gregor/0000-0002-9304-7742",North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center Award [G18AC00377]; US National Park Service,North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center Award; US National Park Service,"The Federal Navigating Ecological Transformation (FedNET) working group and The American Fisheries Society and The Wildlife Society's Ecosystem Transformation working group were important partners in the development of the RAD framework from 2018 to 2020.

As such, spatial planning deals with challenges occurring at different scales and across sectors. The international literature points out the need for horizontal and vertical cooperation to tackle climate change impacts. This paper discusses the general challenges for climate proofing across planning levels, sectors, and areas and provides a systematic overview of challenges that would affect an integrative theoretical framework for climate proofing. Based on the latter, the study ultimately aims at presenting a novel theoretical framework for Climate Proofing specific to spatial planning involving a multi-sectoral perspective. An iterative process was used for conceptual development, based on a literature review followed by external feedback meetings with the core team of planning experts responsible for exchange across federal states and two workshops with focus groups of experts of planning departments responsible for federal, regional, and local spatial planning. Implementation and further development of the framework are planned as the second phase of this study. By specifically addressing the challenges relating to cross-regional and cross-sectoral planning, this novel framework attempts to discuss the (i) consideration of the hierarchy of climate proofing measures through enhanced vertical and horizontal cooperation as well as the (ii) long-term institutionalisation of integrative planning processes across planning borders.

However, agricultural production is strongly influenced by the management decisions of growers, including their practices to modify the microclimate experienced by the growing crop; these adaptations have not been studied at the vineyard level, where managers on the ground are on the front lines of responding to global change. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with winegrowers to examine farm-scale adaptive responses to environmental stresses, to understand the views and motivations of agricultural managers, and to explore adaptive capacity in practice. We found that growers tend to respond to stresses individually rather than collectively, except when facing severe, unfamiliar pests and diseases. Responses may be reactive or anticipatory; most anticipatory strategies have been short-term, in response to imminent threats. Growers tend to rely on their own experience to guide their management decisions, which may offer poor guidance under novel climate regimes. From using a Vulnerability Scoping Diagram, we find that changing exposure (vineyard location) and sensitivity (planting choices such as vine variety) have the biggest impact on reducing vulnerability, but that adaptations in growing or processing the crop in the vineyard and winery are easier to implement, much more commonly undertaken, and may also offer substantial adaptive capacity. Understanding the context of adaptations, as well as the decision-making processes motivating them, is important for understanding responses to global change. These findings highlight some innovations in adapting to global change, as well as some of the barriers, and point to the need for strategic investments to enhance agricultural resilience to climate change. In particular, strategies to enhance both effective and easy to implement farming adaptations, as well as broader-scale anticipatory, collective responses, could reduce vulnerability in the context of climate change.

We used a well-tested simulation model, APSIM-Sorghum, to evaluate the impact of temperatures +1 degrees C, +2 degrees C, +3 degrees C, +4 degrees C and +5 degrees C above current temperatures measured over the past similar to 50 years at four sites in eastern and southern Africa, namely, Katumani and Makindu in Kenya, Chitala in Malawi and Beitbridge in Zimbabwe, on the yield, aboveground biomass, transpiration and soil evaporation of short-, medium- and long-duration sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] cultivars given, 0, 20, 40, and 80 kg nitrogen (N) ha(-1). When fertilized with 80 kg N ha(-1), warming temperatures decreased average yields at Chitala and Beitbridge and yields were unchanged at Makindu and Katumani, but with no added fertilizer average yields increased with increase in temperature at all sites except the hottest and driest site, Beitbridge, where the simulated yields decreased with increasing temperature. Simulation of the changes in soil organic carbon showed that the higher temperatures increased the rate of loss of soil organic carbon and increased nitrogen uptake at all except the driest and hottest site. A micro-dose (20 kg N ha(-1)) of added nitrogen increased the simulated yields by an average of 19% at Beitbridge, 36% at Makindu, 59% at Katumani and 72% at Chitala, considerably greater than any increase from increased temperatures. The use of longer-duration cultivars and lower or higher populations could not consistently be used to overcome any reductions in yield from warming temperatures. We conclude that low-input, small-holder farmers will not immediately have reduced sorghum yields as a consequence of global warming, but micro-dosing with nitrogen fertilizer will significantly increase yields even in the hottest and driest locations.

This paper provides a first evaluation of the performance of state-of-the-art Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) global climate models (GCMs) in simulating climate extremes over Australia. Here, we evaluate how well 37 individual CMIP6 GCMs simulate the spatiotemporal patterns of 12 climate extremes over Australia by comparing the GCMs against gridded observations (Australian Gridded Climate Dataset). This evaluation is crucial for informing, interpreting, and constructing multimodel ensemble future projections of climate extremes over Australia, climate-resilience planning, and GCM selection while conducting exercises like dynamical downscaling via GCMs. We find that temperature extremes (maximum-maximum temperature -TXx, number of summer days -SU, and number of days when maximum temperature is greater than 35 degrees C -Txge35) are reasonably well-simulated in comparison to precipitation extremes. However, GCMs tend to overestimate (underestimate) minimum (maximum) temperature extremes. GCMs also typically struggle to capture both extremely dry (consecutive dry days -CDD) and wet (99th percentile of precipitation -R99p) precipitation extremes, thus highlighting the underlying uncertainty of GCMs in capturing regional drought and flood conditions. Typically for both precipitation and temperature extremes, UKESM1-0-LL, FGOALS-g3, and GCMs from Met office Hadley Centre (HadGEM3-GC31-MM and HadGEM3-GC31-LL) and NOAA (GFDL-ESM4 and GFDL-CM4) consistently tend to show good performance. Our results also show that GCMs from the same modelling group and GCMs sharing key modelling components tend to have similar biases and thus are not highly independent.","[Nishant, Nidhi; Di Virgilio, Giovanni] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Nishant, Nidhi; Di Virgilio, Giovanni; Ji, Fei] Univ New South Wales, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Climate Ext, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Di Virgilio, Giovanni; Ji, Fei; Tam, Eugene; Beyer, Kathleen; Riley, Matthew L.] NSW Dept Planning & Environm, Sci Econ & Insights Div, Sydney, NSW 2141, Australia; [Beyer, Kathleen] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog Planning & Spatial Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Tasmania,"Nishant, N (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;Nishant, N (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Climate Ext, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",n.nidhi@unsw.edu.au,"Riley, Matthew/K-9038-2018","Riley, Matthew/0000-0002-9181-782X; Nishant, Nidhi/0000-0003-1792-7366",NSW Climate Change Fund,NSW Climate Change Fund,This research was funded by NSW Climate Change Fund.,,86,1,1,10,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,SEP,2022,13,9,,,,,,,1478,10.3390/atmos13091478,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13091478,,,28,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,4S4AP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000857385900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The mitigation strategy suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) against greenhouse gas emissions and their effects on climate change, has not yet yielded the desired results. It is therefore necessary to focus on adaptation strategies, to immediately counter the effects of climate change (CC) on most vulnerable people and environments, by increasing their resilience through local interventions and targeted resilience actions. Coordinated resilience actions are necessary to combat the effects of CC especially in urban areas. Useful tools to manage and optimize resilience actions are artificial neural networks (ANN) in complex and dynamic domains as cities are. The case of ANN applied to a city is presented as an example to increase the climate resilience of health local systems.

The Amami Islands in Southern Japan were selected as the study area. It is important to select areas that should be given priority for conservation and subsequently direct resources there. The objective of this study was to identify locations with low bleaching potential against future increases in water temperature, as well as high larval recruitment from other areas and high larval supply capacity to other areas based on connectivity. We simulated the coral bleaching rate and larval connectivity under historical (2000s) and future (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in the 2090s) climate conditions using a high-resolution (1/30 degrees x 1/50 degrees) future ocean regional projection dataset. From the model simulation, coral bleaching did not occur in most areas in the 2000s. However, the bleaching frequency would increase significantly under RCP8.5 in the 2090s, and it is projected that mass coral bleaching events will occur in more than half of the years of that decade. Larval dispersion simulation shows that some particles released from the Amami Islands remain in the same area. However, fluctuations in both the sink strength and the source strength among the islands were larger than those within each island, and differences in connectivity between scenarios were not apparent. Grid cells that have a low bleaching rate and high potential for a larval sink and source under each scenario were selected. Since our results can identify priority conservation areas, it is important to conduct conservation and/or adaptation strategies according to the specific characteristics of each island.","[Abe, Hiroya; Kumagai, Naoki H.; Yamano, Hiroya] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Biodivers Div, Onogawa 16 2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Abe, Hiroya; Kumagai, Naoki H.; Yamano, Hiroya] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Onogawa 16 2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Abe, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Biodivers Div, Onogawa 16 2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.;Abe, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Onogawa 16 2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",abe.hiroya@nies.go.jp,,"Abe, Hiroya/0000-0003-2777-5570","Climate Change Adaptation Research Program of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Japan; Japan Agency for Marine Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) under the SI-CAT project of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan [JPMXD0715667163]","Climate Change Adaptation Research Program of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Japan; Japan Agency for Marine Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) under the SI-CAT project of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan","This study was partially supported by the Climate Change Adaptation Research Program of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Japan.

Addressing this knowledge gap, this paper outlines two case studies that describe and map the flood risk management functions offered by green infrastructure landscapes situated within the Urban Mersey Basin in North West England. The case studies establish that areas potentially exposed to flooding can be located at some distance, and within different jurisdictions, from upstream areas where the flood hazard may be generated and could be moderated via functions provided by green infrastructure landscapes. This raises planning and governance challenges connected to supporting and enhancing flood risk management functions provided by green infrastructure landscapes.","[Carter, Jeremy G.; Handley, John] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Butlin, Tom; Gill, Susannah] Mersey Forest, Risley Moss, Ordnance Ave, Warrington, Cheshire, England",University of Manchester,"Carter, JG (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England.",Jeremy.carter@manchester.ac.uk,,"Carter, Jeremy/0000-0003-1640-3747",Climate Proof Cities project,Climate Proof Cities project,"The research underpinning this project was undertaken within the Climate Proof Cities project.

There is a need for greater qualitative and quantitative understanding of how transport systems respond under adverse conditions, to inform event management and to aid adaptation actions. The present study uses the intense storms of 28 June 2012 as a case study to present a novel exploration of the impacts of an extreme event using high spatial and temporal resolution transport data for the UK road and rail networks, as well as weather data from the UK Meteorological Office's MIDAS surface station network and NIMROD weather radar. This event caused widespread disruption, severing the main rail links between England and Scotland and causing 10000 delay minutes to train services throughout the country, as well as causing reduced speeds on local roads and motorways. The present study describes the meteorological situation in the build-up to and during the event, and uses Network Rail train delay data to visualize the way in which the failure of several sections of critical transport infrastructure caused disruption that propagated quickly through the rail network of Great Britain. Highway Agency motorway speed data are used to quantify the impact of this event on the M6 motorway in the West Midlands. Ways in which the insights gained from these data can be used to aid the transport sector in the prioritization of adaptation actions are discussed.","[Jaroszweski, David; Hooper, Elizabeth; Baker, Chris; Chapman, Lee; Quinn, Andrew] Univ Birmingham, Sch Civil Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Jaroszweski, D (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Civil Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",d.j.jaroszweski@bham.ac.uk,"chapman, lee/AAE-8287-2020; Quinn, Andrew/B-7793-2008; Chapman, Lee/F-4674-2014","chapman, lee/0000-0002-2837-8334; Quinn, Andrew/0000-0003-0254-4661; Chapman, Lee/0000-0002-2837-8334; Jaroszweski, David/0000-0002-8365-0193; Baker, Christopher/0000-0001-7572-1871",EPSRC [EP/G060762]; Network Rail; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G060762/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/G060762/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Network Rail; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was undertaken as part of the EPSRC funded FUTURENET project (EP/G060762) and the Network Rail funded REWARD project.

A second group of authors argue the opposite: planting additional forests should raise downstream water availability and intensify the hydrologic cycle. Obtaining supporting evidence for this second group of authors has been more difficult due to the larger scales at which the positive effects of forests on the water cycle may be seen. We argue that forest cover is inextricably linked to precipitation. Forest-driven evapotranspiration removed from a particular catchment contributes to the availability of atmospheric moisture vapor and its cross-continental transport, raising the likelihood of precipitation events and increasing water yield, in particular in continental interiors more distant from oceans. Seasonal relationships heighten the importance of this phenomenon. We review the arguments from different scales and perspectives. This clarifies the generally beneficial relationship between forest cover and the intensity of the hydrologic cycle. While evidence supports both sides of the argument trees can reduce runoff at the small catchment scale at larger scales, trees are more clearly linked to increased precipitation and water availability. Progressive deforestation, land conversion from forest to agriculture and urbanization have potentially negative consequences for global precipitation, prompting us to think of forest ecosystems as global public goods. Policy-making attempts to measure product water footprints, estimate the value of ecosystem services, promote afforestation, develop drought mitigation strategies and otherwise manage land use must consider the linkage of forests to the supply of precipitation.","[Ellison, David] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst World Econ, HU-1014 Budapest, Hungary; [Ellison, David] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Ellison, David] Umea Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Futter, Martyn N.; Bishop, Kevin] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Bishop, Kevin] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden",Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Umea University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Uppsala University,"Ellison, D (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst World Econ, HU-1014 Budapest, Hungary.",EllisonDL@gmail.com,"Bishop, Kevin H/C-7816-2012; Futter, Martyn N/G-6238-2011","Bishop, Kevin H/0000-0002-8057-1051; Futter, Martyn N/0000-0002-9789-7138; Ellison, David/0000-0002-3755-6024",Future Forests; Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA); Swedish Forestry Industry; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU); Umea University; Forestry Research Institute of Sweden,Future Forests; Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA); Swedish Forestry Industry; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU); Umea University; Forestry Research Institute of Sweden,"The authors thank Michael Bosilovich for sharing data and Linn Bishop for generous research assistance.

Since the Indian Ocean in this area has a very large tidal range of up to 7 m, reliable coastal protection is of great importance. The Chiveve tidal river, which runs through the city for a distance of approx. 5 km, was neglected in the past, and became increasingly silted up, to the point that it no longer served as a drainage channel for the surrounding area. The standing water promoted the spreading of diseases such as malaria and cholera. During very high tides or storm surges in the adjacent ocean, combined with heavy rainfall, the Chiveve regularly overflowed its banks and flooded much of its catchment area - particularly the informal settlements along its banks. To address this problem, Inros Lackner designed a new tidal outlet and flood barrier to protect Beira's city centre. The project also included a comprehensive plan for the reestablishment of the original river course and renaturation measures along its embankments. This included excavation of the river, dredging of sludge within the fishing port downstream, resettlement measures, and planting of young mangroves along the river banks.","[Spekker, Heiko; Heskamp, Jan] INROS LACKNER SE, Linzer Str 3, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",,"Spekker, H (corresponding author), INROS LACKNER SE, Linzer Str 3, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",bremen@inros-lackner.de,,,,,,,0,1,2,3,37,ERNST & SOHN,BERLIN,"ROTHERSTRASSE 21, BERLIN, DEUTSCHLAND 10245, GERMANY",0932-8351,1437-0999,,BAUTECHNIK,Bautechnik,DEC,2017,94,12,,,,,872,874,,10.1002/bate.201710102,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bate.201710102,,,3,"Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,FO7QS,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000417071800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, strategies for adaptive rice planting in a rapidly changing climate are not well established. In this ex-ante analysis, regional gridded crop model simulations are deployed to investigate the impact of different rice planting strategies on system level productivity, resilience, and environmental benefits. Our results suggest that synchronizing rice planting dates with the monsoon onset substantially outperforms farmer practice (+41%) and static state recommendations in the Eastern IGP. However, planting long-duration rice with the monsoon onset is ineffective in the Northwestern IGP since the later arrival of the monsoon increases the probability of cold damage to rice and terminal heat stress in wheat. Here, fixed planting dates (+12.5%) or planting medium duration varieties at monsoon onset (+18%) performed best. We conclude that resilient and productive rice planting strategies must account for interannual weather variability and divergent climate conditions across sub-regions in the IGP.","[Urfels, Anton] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Urfels, Anton; van Halsema, Gerardo] Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Resources Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Urfels, Anton; Struik, Paul C.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Ctr Crop Syst Anal, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Montes, Carlo] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Texcoco, Mexico; [Balwinder-Singh, Gerardo] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, New Delhi, India; [Krupnik, Timothy J.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [McDonald, Andrew J.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Sect Soil & Crop Sci, Ithaca, NY USA; [Balwinder-Singh, Gerardo] Govt Western Australia, Dept Primary Ind & Reg Dev, Northam, WA 6401, Australia",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Cornell University,"Urfels, A (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Kathmandu, Nepal.;Urfels, A (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Resources Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Urfels, A (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Ctr Crop Syst Anal, Wageningen, Netherlands.",anton.urfels@wur.nl,", Balwinder-Singh/F-3063-2011",", Balwinder-Singh/0000-0002-6715-2207; Urfels, Anton/0000-0003-2920-8721","United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) [INV-029117]; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Fund Donors; CGIAR Regional Integrated Initiative Transforming Agrifood Systems in South Asia","United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIAR); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR); CGIAR Regional Integrated Initiative Transforming Agrifood Systems in South Asia","We thank D Gaydon, P A J van Oort, and P Craufurd for their feedback and discussions on parameterizing the model and D Kelly, P deVoil, and J A Campos for their support in installing the simulation framework.

Because of the importance of terrestrial ecosystems to human well-being and supporting services, decision makers throughout the world are busy creating policy responses that secure multiple development and conservation objectives- including that of supporting terrestrial ecosystem resilience in the context of climate change. This article aims to advance analyses on climate policy evaluation and planning in the area of terrestrial ecosystem resilience by discussing adaptation policy options within the ecology-economy-social nexus. The paper evaluates these decisions in the realm of terrestrial ecosystem resilience and evaluates the utility of a set of criteria, indicators, and assessment methods, proposed by a new conceptual multi-criteria framework for pro-development climate policy and planning developed by the United Nations Environment Programme. Potential applications of a multicriteria approach to climate policy vis-A -vis terrestrial ecosystems are then explored through two hypothetical case study examples.

This study estimates the future work capacity under the Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 scenario and discusses its regional impacts on the occupational structure in the Republic of Korea. Methods: The data utilized for this study constitute the local wet bulb globe temperature from the Korea Meteorological Administration and information from the Korean Working Condition Survey from the Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute of Korea. Using these data, we classify the occupations vulnerable to heat stress and estimate future changes in work capacity at the local scale, considering the occupational structure. We then identify the spatial cluster of diminishing work capacity using exploratory spatial data analysis. Results: Our findings indicate that 52 occupations are at risk of heat stress, including machine operators and elementary laborers working in the construction, welding, metal, and mining industries. Moreover, spatial clusters with diminished work capacity appear in southwest Korea. Conclusion: Although previous studies investigated the work capacity associated with heat stress in terms of climatic impact, this study quantifies the local impacts due to the global risk of climate change. The results suggest the need for mainstreaming an adaptation policy related to work capacity in regional development strategies.

Manual systems of conservation agriculture (CA) based on seeding into planting basins or direct seeding techniques have received increased attention over the last decade. However, a critical review of the pros and cons of the different manual seeding systems under different agro-ecologies has been lacking. This paper aims at analysing different manual seeding systems in areas extending from central Mozambique to central Malawi. Results show that CA systems perform differently in contrasting agro-ecological environments. Direct seeded treatments had greater maize yields than conventional tillage practices by an average of 12-27% and outperformed the conventional practice in nine out of fourteen yield comparisons. Basin planted treatments performed well only in Sofala and Manica (15%) with yield penalties of 9% in Tete. The strongest factor influencing maize grain yields in the more variable areas of Manica and Sofala was the quality of season and the location, whereas tillage treatment and location were more important in the higher rainfall areas of Tete. Direct seeding systems out-yielded other treatments in areas of higher rainfall and responded better to a favourable environment than conventional tillage practices. CA systems, especially direct seeding in Malawi, Manica and Sofala, showed greater financial returns to investments and labour productivity due to reduced labour costs and higher yields. Labour savings of up to 43 labour days ha(-1) could be achieved with direct seeded treatments in Malawi. The results of this research clearly highlight the need for site-specific recommendations and adaptation of CA systems to different agro-ecological environments. Blanket recommendations of one CA system across many agroecologies, as has often been done in the past, will only lead to underperformance of CA in some areas and rejection by smallholder farmers if yield benefits are not achieved.

In Latin America, such forces are especially conspicuous, particularly in respect of extreme climatological, hydrological, and weather events (EWEs) and climate-sensitive disasters (CSDs). Consistent with the need to study further such connections, this paper presents an analysis of some of the vulnerabilities of environmental health issues and climate-related impacts that are focusing on EWEs and CSDs in Latin American countries. The research includes an analysis of the (i) human and socio-economic development; (ii) geographical and socio-economic determinants of vulnerability and adaptability of environmental health issues (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity); (iii) occurrence of CSDs from 1988 to 2017 and their direct impacts on human wellbeing (Total death and Affected people); (iv) an online survey on the perceptions of the effects of EWEs on human wellbeing in a sample of countries in the region; and (v) discussion of possible solutions. The socio-economic and development indices, and the International Disaster Database (EM-DAT) and Climate-Risk Index (CRI) disaster statistics suggest that the impacts of CSDs are primarily related to socio-economic determinants of human wellbeing and health inequalities. Also, >80% respondents to the survey say that the leading causes of climate-related human impacts are the lack of (i) public awareness; (ii) investment and (iii) preparedness. The paper concludes by adding some suggestions that show how countries in Latin America may better cope with the impacts of Climate-sensitive Disasters.","[Nagy, Gustavo J.; Verocai, Jose E.] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, IECA, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay; [Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Chester St, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Leal Filho, Walter; Heimfarth, Johanna; Li, Chunlan] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci HAW, Fac Life Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr FTZ NK, Sustainable Dev & Climate Change Management FTZ N, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Azeiteiro, Ulisses M.] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Azeiteiro, Ulisses M.] Univ Aveiro, CESAM Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Manchester Metropolitan University; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; East China Normal University","Leal, W (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Chester St, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England.;Leal, W (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Appl Sci HAW, Fac Life Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr FTZ NK, Sustainable Dev & Climate Change Management FTZ N, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany.",gnagy@fcien.edu.uy; walter.leal2@haw-hamburg.de; ulisses@ua.pt; Johanna.Heimfarth@haw-hamburg.de; otolito@fcien.edu.uy; ulisses@ua.pt,"Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; Azeiteiro, Ulisses Manuel de Miranda/C-5933-2008; Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022; nagy, gustavo/G-8097-2017","Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Azeiteiro, Ulisses Manuel de Miranda/0000-0002-5252-1700; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; nagy, gustavo/0000-0002-8296-4465",,,,,66,23,25,8,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Norm nudges aim to improve preparedness for risks through information provision that appeals to social norms. Based on data collected in an online experiment among homeowners, we tested for the influence on flood insurance demand of providing individuals with a norm nudge about the flood insurance purchase decisions of their neighbours. Potential moderators of the effectiveness of this norm nudge were examined, such as whether the norm is consistent with homeowners' prior beliefs as well as whether homeowners trust insurance agents, who are used as the messenger of the norm.

Questions of awareness, preparedness, organizational issues, and actor networks have to be addressed in a proactive and focused manner in order to avoid future heat wave damages.

These same issues have relevance today, in the face of growing concern about the availability of fresh water worldwide. The central point of this article is that appropriative water rights and irrigation districts that emerged in the American West in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in response to aridity to facilitate agricultural water delivery, use, and trade raise the transaction costs today of water markets. These markets are vital for smooth reallocation of water to higher-valued uses elsewhere in the economy and for flexible response to greater hydrological uncertainty.

We draw inspiration from technological and policy interventions for living with sea-level change across two cases studies on Jakarta and Manila, and ask how these policies and practices constantly morph when being translated into specific sociopolitical and ecological contexts.

Yet these types of interactions between parties in different southern countries that influence natural resource conflicts receive little consideration, although they may help in transforming conflicts, developing capacity, and contribute to resilience. CoCooN and CCMCC initiatives were designed to contribute to evidence-based policy development and practices in developing countries and an important aspect of this may be the potential to influence and enhance South-to-South communication, learning, and networks. We examine south-to-south exchanges within the 13 CoCooN and CCMCC projects to identify situations that led to these exchanges and better understand their value.

Plants growing in soil types with low water holding capacity may experience intensified effects of reduced water availability as a result of climate change. Furthermore, complex biotic interactions between plants and soil organisms may mitigate or exacerbate the effects of climate change. This 3-year field experiment observed the performance of Bouteloua gracilis ecotypes that were transplanted across an environmental gradient with either sympatric soil from the seed source location or allopatric soil from the location that plants were transplanted into. We also inoculated plants with either sympatric or allopatric soil biotic communities to test: (1) how changes in climate alone influence plant growth, (2) how soil types interact with climate to influence plant growth, and (3) the role of soil biota in mitigating plant migration to novel environments. As expected, plants moved to cooler-wetter sites exhibited enhanced growth; however, plants moved to warmer-drier sites responded variably depending on the provenance of their soil and inoculum. Soil and inoculum provenance had little influence on the performance of plants moved to cooler-wetter sites, but at warmer-drier sites they were important predictors of plant biomass, seed set, and specific leaf area. Specifically, transplants inoculated with their sympatric soil biota and grown in their sympatric soil were as large as or larger than reference plants grown at the seed source locations; however, individuals inoculated with allopatric soil biota were smaller than reference site individuals at warmer, drier sites. These findings demonstrate complicated plant responses to various aspects of environmental novelty where communities of soil organisms may help ameliorate stress. The belowground microbiome of plants should be considered to predict the responses of vegetation more accurately to climate change.","[Remke, Michael J.] Ft Lewis Coll, Dept Biol, Durango, CO 81301 USA; [Remke, Michael J.; Bowker, Matthew A.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Johnson, Nancy C.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sch Earth & Sustainabil, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University,"Remke, MJ (corresponding author), Ft Lewis Coll, Dept Biol, Durango, CO 81301 USA.",mremke@fortlewis.edu,,"Remke, Michael/0000-0002-9972-8848; Bowker, Matthew/0000-0002-5891-0264",McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research Program [2014-32100-06014]; U.S. Bureau of Land Management [L17AC00031],McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research Program; U.S. Bureau of Land Management,"McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research Program, Grant/Award Number: 2014-32100-06014; U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Grant/Award Number: L17AC00031",,62,0,0,15,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

To fill this gap, this article reports the result of a study on the impact of an automated phone heat warning system on adaptation behaviours and health services use. A sample of 1328 individuals vulnerable to heat was constituted for this purpose and participants were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The day before a heat episode, a phone heat warning was sent to the treatment group. Data were obtained through two surveys before and one survey after the heat warning issuance. The results show that members of the treatment group were more aware of how to protect themselves from heat and more likely to adopt the recommended behaviours. Moreover, a much smaller proportion of women in this group used the health-care system compared to the control group. Thus, the exposure to an automated phone warning seems to improve the adaptation to heat and reduce the use of health services by some important at-risk groups. This method can thus be used to complement public health interventions aimed at reducing heat-related health risks.","[Mehiriz, Kaddour] Doha Inst Grad Studies, Sch Publ Adm & Dev Econ, POB 200592,Zone 70, Doha, Qatar; [Gosselin, Pierre] Inst Natl Sante Publ & Ouranos, 945 Ave Wolfe, Quebec City, PQ G1V 5B3, Canada; [Tardif, Isabelle; Lemieux, Marc-Andre] Direct Sante Publ Monteregie, 1255 Rue Beauregard, Longueuil, PQ J4K 2M3, Canada",Doha Institute for Graduate Studies,"Mehiriz, K (corresponding author), Doha Inst Grad Studies, Sch Publ Adm & Dev Econ, POB 200592,Zone 70, Doha, Qatar.",kmehiriz@gmail.com; Pierre.gosselin@inspq.qc.ca; Isabelle.tardif.agence16@ssss.gouv.qc.ca; marc-andre.lemieux.agence16@ssss.gouv.qc.ca,,,"Quebec Government's Fond Vert, under the health component of Climate Change Action Plan; Health Canada","Quebec Government's Fond Vert, under the health component of Climate Change Action Plan; Health Canada","This project was funded by the Quebec Government's Fond Vert, under the health component of 2013-2020 Climate Change Action Plan, and by Health Canada.",,47,8,8,1,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1660-4601,,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The number and scale of flood damage in urban areas will continue to increase in the next several decades due to global trend in urbanization and climate change. Despite the extensive construction of grey infrastructures, many cities in the world remain vulnerable to surface water flooding, especially during the extremely weather events. Since the 1990s, green infrastructure has developed as an alternative and sustainable approach to mitigate flood hazard in urban areas. Despite the great effectiveness of urban green infrastructures in alleviating storm water runoff, there is comparatively little research for planners and designers to determine an appropriate strategy for green infrastructure planning. To address this gap, we propose a GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation method to identify the priority areas to site green infrastructure, based on five criteria: 1) storm-water runoff mitigation; 2) social flood vulnerable group protection; 3) flood sensitive area road infrastructures protection; 4) flood sensitive area buildings protection and 5) environmental justice. The weights of the five criteria are defined by the Analytic Hierarchy Process. We focus particularly on mitigating urban surface water flooding risk and demonstrate how the method can be applied using a case study of Ghent.","[Li, Luyuan; Uyttenhove, Pieter] Univ Ghent, Dept Architecture & Urban Planning, Jozef Plateaustr 22, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vaneetvelde, Veerle] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"Li, LY (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Architecture & Urban Planning, Jozef Plateaustr 22, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.;Vaneetvelde, V (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",luyuan.li@ugent.be; pieter.Uyttenhove@UGent.be; veerle.vaneetvelde@ugent.be,", Veerle Van Eetvelde/HII-8269-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Van Eetvelde, Veerle/AAK-1324-2020","Van Eetvelde, Veerle/0000-0003-2382-6182",China Scholarship Council [201506270150],China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from China Scholarship Council, grant ID: 201506270150.",,46,70,71,70,355,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-2046,1872-6062,,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

Across probabilistic phenomena, climate change is an exemplar of paramount uncertainties. These uncertainties have been em-braced in supporting governments' decisions; yet receive scarce attention when studying individual behavior. Analyzing a survey conducted in the USA, China, Indonesia, and the Netherlands (N=6242), we explore socio-economic, psychological, and behavioral differences between individuals who can subjectively assess risks, and those who are risk-uncertain. We find that risk-uncertain individuals are more likely to belong to societal subgroups classically considered as vulnerable, and have reduced capacities and intentions to adapt to hazards-specifically floods. The distinctions between risk-aware and risk-uncertain individuals indicate that ignoring differences in individuals' capacity to assess risks could amount to persistent vulnerability and undermine climate-resilience efforts. While we use floods emblematically, these finding have consequences for the standard practice of dropping or bootstrapping uncertain responses, irrespective of the hazard, with implications for environmental management.","[Noll, Brayton; Filatova, Tatiana] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands; [Need, Ariana; de Vries, Peter] Univ Twente, Fac Behav, Management & Social Sci, Twente, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; University of Twente,"Noll, B; Filatova, T (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands.",B.L.Noll@tudelft.nl; T.Filatova@tudelft.nl,"; Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","Noll, Brayton/0000-0002-2962-3258; Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program [758014],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(European Research Council (ERC)),This work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program (grant agreement number 758014) .

We show that Italy can be considered a good representative for rice cultivation in temperate regions that are not freshwater-limited. However, this situation is changing. We report strong evidence linking the largest European reduction of seasonal surface water that have gradually occurred since 2000 over the rice cultivation area of Northern Italy, to the change in paddy management from traditional continuous flooding to a less greenhouse-gases-emitting practice, that is, dry-seeding with postponed flooding. This change was accompanied by several improvements in agro-practices and crop varieties. Concurrently, regional climate rapidly shifted towards sunnier weather conditions that partly contributed to higher rice yields and stability, decoupling yields from inter-annual climate variability, but also reducing water availability. In Northern Italy, a complete shift of rice cultivation towards dry-seeding is not compatible with seasonal water availability, and a number of drawbacks, with respect to the traditional wet seeding, are also identified from literature review.

It also requires transforming this understanding into political engagement to support systems change. Based on a national representative survey in Sweden (N 1,237), this research uses the novel SenseMaker methodology to look into these matters. More specifically, in order to understand the social and institutional prerequisites that must be in place to develop inclusive climate responses, we investigate how citizens perceive their everyday life and future, and the implications for their sense of responsibility, agency, and political engagement. Our research findings show how citizens perceive and act on climate change (individually, cooperatively, and by supporting others), their underlying values, beliefs, emotions and paradigms, inter-group variations, and obstacles and enablers for change. The findings reveal that, in general, individual and public climate action is perceived as leading to improved (rather than reduced) wellbeing and welfare. At the same time, climate anxiety and frustration about structural and governance constraints limit agency, whilst positive emotions and inner qualities, such as human-nature connections, support both political engagement and wellbeing. Our results shed light on individual, collective, and structural capacities that must be supported to address climate change. They draw attention to the need to develop new forms of citizen involvement and of policy that can explicitly address these human interactions, inner dimensions of thinking about and acting on climate change, and the underlying social paradigms. We conclude with further research needs and policy recommendations.","[Wamsler, Christine; Osberg, Gustav] Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Panagiotou, Anna; Smith, Beth; Stanbridge, Peter] Cognit Edge, Conwy, Wales; [Osika, Walter] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Osika, Walter] Karolinska Inst, Ctr Social Sustainabil, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mundaca, Luis] Int Inst Ind Environm Econ IIIEE, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska Institutet,"Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden.",christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,,"Osberg, Gustav/0000-0003-4981-8113; Mundaca, Luis/0000-0002-1090-7744; Osika, Walter/0000-0002-1583-7319","Swedish Research Council [2019-00390,2019-01969]",Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"This work was supported by Swedish Research Council: [grant no 2019-00390,2019-01969].",,75,0,0,15,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Its adverse effects on the urban population range from economy, social, environment, and human health. With the increasing urbanization and economic development in cities, heat stress is expected to worsen. This particular study aims to achieve two objectives: (1) to understand the determinants of heat stress, especially the roles of the urban environment in exacerbating the heat stress, and (2) to explore the effects of heat stress to human health using self-reported health assessment. We employed a cross-sectional study using a survey questionnaire from 505 respondents living in the urban area of Bangkok, Thailand. We found that socioeconomic conditions of the individual and urban environment were significant determinants of urban heat stress. Low-income urban populations living in high-density areas with less green open space were more likely to experience heat stress. We also found that heat stress significantly affects human health. Those who reported a higher level of heat stress were more likely to have adverse health and well-being outcomes. The findings suggest that the increased risk of heat stress represents a major problem in the Bangkok, Thailand. It is necessary to address heat stress in adaptation policy and measures at the city levels amid the continued increase of global temperature and climate change.","[Arifwidodo, Sigit D.] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Architecture, Dept Landscape Architecture, Bangkok, Thailand; [Chandrasiri, Orana] Minist Publ Hlth, Int Hlth Policy Program, Bangkok, Thailand",Kasetsart University; Ministry of Public Health - Thailand,"Arifwidodo, SD (corresponding author), Kasetsart Univ, Fac Architecture, Dept Landscape Architecture, Bangkok, Thailand.",sigit.d@ku.ac.th,,"Arifwidodo, Sigit/0000-0001-9517-2611",Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APNGCR) [CAF2016-RR12CMY],Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APNGCR),This study would not have been possible without the financial support of the Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APNGCR) under the project Understanding Urban Heat Island Effect and Its Implications to Climate Change Adaptation Strategies in Major Southeast Asian Cities with project reference number: CAF2016-RR12CMY-Arifwidodo,,57,35,35,20,71,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

Despite many studies on barrier island dynamics, few have investigated the impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) on sandspits. In peri-urban settings, we hypothesised that shoreline environment change would be strongly dependent on contemporary land use decisions, whilst modern engineering capabilities also present new opportunities for working with nature. Our study site in Christchurch, New Zealand, included a unique example of SLR caused by tectonic subsidence and an associated managed retreat initiative. We used a novel scenario modelling approach to evaluate both shorelines simultaneously for 0.25m SLR increments and incorporating open coast sediment supply in 25-year periods. Our key questions addressed the potential impacts of shoreline change on open coast dune and estuarine-coast saltmarsh ecosystems and implications for the role of 'nature-based' climate change solutions. The results identify challenges for dune conservation, with a third of the dune system eliminated in the '1-m SLR in 100-year' scenario. The associated exposure of urban areas to natural hazards such as extreme storms and tsunami will likely fuel demand for seawalls unless natural alternatives can be enabled. In contrast, the managed retreat initiative on the backshore presents an opportunity to restart saltmarsh accretion processes seaward of coastal defences with the potential to reverse decades of degradation. Considering both shorelines simultaneously highlights the existence of pinch-points from opposing forces that result in small land volumes above the tidal range. Societal adaptation is delicately poised between the paradigms of resisting or accommodating nature and challenged by the long perimeter and confined nature of the sandspit feature. The use of innovative policy measures in disaster recovery contexts, as highlighted here, may offer a beneficial framework for enabling nature-based solutions to climate change and natural hazards.YY","[Orchard, Shane] Univ Canterbury, Waterways Ctr Freshwater Management, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Orchard, Shane] Lincoln Univ, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Orchard, Shane; Schiel, David R.] Univ Canterbury, Marine Ecol Res Grp, Christchurch, New Zealand",University of Canterbury; University of Canterbury,"Orchard, S (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Waterways Ctr Freshwater Management, Christchurch, New Zealand.;Orchard, S (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Christchurch, New Zealand.;Orchard, S (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Marine Ecol Res Grp, Christchurch, New Zealand.",s.orchard@waterlink.nz,"Orchard, Shane/AAS-8102-2021","Orchard, Shane/0000-0002-9040-6404","Ngai Tahu Research Centre, University of Canterbury; Coastal Restoration Trust of New Zealand","Ngai Tahu Research Centre, University of Canterbury; Coastal Restoration Trust of New Zealand","This work was funded by the Ngai Tahu Research Centre, University of Canterbury.

These technologies were compared to application of retrofitting traditional insulation. Initial microclimatic modelling of the impact of the roofs showed that both green and cool roofs can reduce air temperatures directly above their surfaces, with maximum air temperature reductions of 1 degrees C. The results of the microclimatic modelling were then used as input into a whole building thermal simulation model, in order to assess the direct and indirect effects of the roofs. The building modelling results indicate that in the current climate, green roofs reduce annual energy use within the building. The level of savings are reduced when green roofs are dry in the summer. Cool roofs are more effective in the summer, but result in an annual energy penalty due to their performance in winter. In a 2050 climate scenario, both green and cool roofs result in a reduction in annual energy use. The application of traditional insulation is the most effective technology at reducing annual energy use. Adding insulation and a green or cool roof reduces the relative effectiveness of the roofs.

To ensure communities are not left without fundamental supplies and services, the adaptation of critical infrastructure to climate change needs to be understood holistically. This paper uses a scoping literature review to investigate the relationship between critical infrastructure and climate change. In the absence of a common definition for adaptive critical infrastructure, an outcomes-based definition is proposed that captures the four types of critical infrastructure: physical, ecological, institutional and cultural. A typology was developed to critically interrogate the focus of adaptive critical infrastructure. It shows that the focus across elements such as conceptualisation and management ranges from tangible to intangible infrastructure, and from positivist to interpretivist in approach. The literature review identified relationship-building as a key management objective across the spectrums. The typology contributes knowledge on how the choice of infrastructure focus and adaptation methods influences adaptation outcomes and path dependencies.","[Huddleston, Pippa; Smith, Tim; Elrick-Barr, Carmen] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sch Law & Soc, Maroochydore, Australia; [White, Iain] Waikato Univ, Sch Social Sci, Environm Planning Programme, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Smith, Tim] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON, Canada; [Smith, Tim] Uppsala Univ, Dept Womens & Childrens Hlth, SWEDESD, Uppsala, Sweden",University of the Sunshine Coast; University of Waikato; Brock University; Uppsala University,"Huddleston, P (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sch Law & Soc, Maroochydore, Australia.",pippa.huddleston@research.usc.edu.au,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Elrick-Barr, Carmen/Q-9861-2019","Elrick-Barr, Carmen/0000-0001-6868-1373",Australian Government; Australian Research Council [FT180100652]; Australian Research Council [FT180100652] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Government(Australian Government); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the Australian Government through the Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship and the Australian Research Councils Discovery Projects funding scheme (project FT180100652).,,65,4,4,19,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Environmental decision support systems (EDSS) have been developed to assist managers and stakeholders make decisions about complex natural resource problems. Research has shown that these EDSS are valuable and used internationally. However, sustainability science literature reports that too often these natural resource management (NRM) plans are not consulted upon completion, and the EDSS are no longer used. To gain insight into why the EDSS are no longer used after the research and development phase of the NRM planning project, we have asked the stakeholders, as end users of the EDSS tool themselves, to share their perceptions of, and experience with development of the tool and then, the tool itself. This paper reports on the perspectives of the end users of an EDSS used in a South Australian NRM planning project from 2011 to 2013. The findings were mixed in that they show that the majority (90%) of respondents felt the EDSS had overall value, yet it was virtually abandoned after the completion of the planning project. Further, just over half of respondents reported that they thought that the EDSS should have been used on a regular basis after the pilot project ended. We conclude that genuine capacity development, aided by the EDSS, took place during the project. However, the lack of use of the EDSS after the pilot project finished was the result of failures both with researcher follow up and especially with the lack of commitment from government agencies who support and influence the array of end users. Unless agencies commit to the changed practices identified by end users that would support ongoing use of EDSS it is inevitable that the legacy value of EDSS development will remain limited.","[Reiter, Dana] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Meyer, Wayne] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Landscape Syst, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Parrott, Lael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth Environm & Geog Sci, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Parrott, Lael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC, Canada",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Adelaide; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Reiter, D (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",dana.reiter@hdr.qut.edu.au,,"Meyer, Wayne/0000-0003-3477-9385",,,,,44,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Concrete component reuse in urban renewal will be an effective means to reduce concrete and steel production demands, whereas the conventional structural design encounters difficulties to ensure the reliability of reused components. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for sustainability-based reliability design for the reuse of concrete components (abbreviated to sustainability-based reuse design paradigm), and a domain-specific machine learning approach is adopted to identify the reusability of concrete components and evaluate possible risks under the uncertain environment due to climate change, on the basis of the carbonation-induced degradation pattern and in-situ structure and climate data collected. The proposed paradigm has been implemented and validated in a case study of reused concrete structure design in Guangzhou area. Our results have shown that the proposed sustainability-based reuse design paradigm improves the design credibility, while the conventional design, which ignores climate change, underestimates failure probabilities grossly and overestimates the component's maximum service life by up to 22.5 years. By dispelling the reliability concerns on concrete component reuse, the sustainability-based reuse design paradigm will boost its promotion and unleash its substantial potential for carbon emission reduction.","[Xia, Bing; Xiao, Jianzhuang] Tongji Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Dept Struct Eng, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Shaofan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xiao, Jianzhuang] Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Disaster Reduct Civil Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Tongji University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Tongji University,"Xiao, JZ (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Dept Struct Eng, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",jzx@tougji.edu.cn,"Xiao, Jian/GYU-4351-2022; Li, Shaofan/G-8082-2011","Li, Shaofan/0000-0002-6950-1474; Xia, Bing/0000-0002-8597-0254","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51325802, 52078358]; National Key R&D Program of China [2022YFE0198300]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51325802, 52078358]; National Key R&D Program of China [2022YFE0198300]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China,"B.X. and JZ.X. acknowledge the financial support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, No. 51325802, 52078358) and the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2022YFE0198300).",,65,0,0,21,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-4730,1879-3355,,STRUCT SAF,Struct.

We examine how exposure to poor air quality during wildfires relates to public opinion toward Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPSs). PSPSs have been increasingly deployed in the Western U.S. during extreme wildfire conditions to reduce ignition risk from power equipment by de-energizing sections of the electrical grid, potentially leaving impacted areas without electricity for multiple days. We surveyed Oregon residents (n = 1,308), a state where few PSPSs have been deployed, and found that a majority of respondents supported PSPSs, and that poorer air quality during wildfires, recorded from monitoring stations proximal to respondents, was related to increased support for PSPSs. We also found that females and those with liberal political orientations were more supportive of PSPSs. This research has implications for utilities, emergency managers, and policymakers as they consider deployment of PSPSs to mitigate wildfire.","[Zanocco, Chad; Flora, June] Stanford Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Y2E2,473 Via Ortega,Room 311, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Stelmach, Greg; Boudet, Hilary] Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Giordono, Leanne] Univ Oregon, Sch Planning Publ Policy & Management, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Stanford University; Oregon State University; University of Oregon,"Zanocco, C (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Y2E2,473 Via Ortega,Room 311, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",czanocco@stanford.edu,,"Giordono, Leanne/0000-0002-7412-3340","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA15OAR4310145, NA20OAR4310145A]",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),Support for this research was provided to Oregon State University by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under grants [NA15OAR4310145 and NA20OAR4310145A].,,54,0,0,1,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1920,1521-0723,,SOC NATUR RESOUR,Soc.

The assessment was co-designed with regional public sector managers to address their needs for an improved understanding of regional vulnerabilities to climate change and variability. Design/methodology/approach - The study used IA of climate change impacts through a complex adaptive systems approach incorporating social learning and stakeholder-led research processes. Workshops were conducted with stakeholders from NSW government agencies, state-owned corporations and local governments representing the tourism, water, primary industries, human settlements, emergency management, human health, infrastructure and natural landscapes sectors. Participants used regional socioeconomic profiling and climate projections to consider the impacts on and the need to adapt community service provision to future climate. Findings - Many sectors are currently experiencing difficulty coping with changes in regional demographics and structural adjustment in the economy. Climate change will result in further impacts on already vulnerable systems in the forms of resource conflicts between expanded human settlements, the infrastructure that supports them and the environment (particularly for water); increased energy costs; and declining agricultural production and food security. Originality/value - This paper describes the application of meta-analysis in climate change policy research and frames climate change as a problem of environmental pollution and an issue of development and social equity.","[Jacobs, Brent C.] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Lee, Christopher; O'Toole, David; Vines, Katie] NSW Off Environm & Heritage, Climate Change Air & Noise Branch, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; Office of Environment & Heritage - New South Wales,"Jacobs, BC (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",brent.jacobs@uts.edu.au,"Jacobs, Brent/K-2523-2012","Jacobs, Brent/0000-0003-3147-341X",,,,,63,10,10,1,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Livestock production will be affected by changes in temperature and water availability through impacts on pasture and forage crop quantity and quality, feed-grain production and price, and disease and pest distributions. This paper provides an overview of these impacts and the broader effects on landscape functionality, with a focus on recent research on effects of increasing temperature, changing rainfall patterns, and increased climate variability on animal health, growth, and reproduction, including through heat stress, and potential adaptation strategies. The rate of adoption of adaptation strategies by livestock producers will depend on perceptions of the uncertainty in projected climate and regional-scale impacts and associated risk. However, management changes adopted by farmers in parts of Australia during recent extended drought and associated heatwaves, trends consistent with long-term predicted climate patterns, provide some insights into the capacity for practical adaptation strategies. Animal production systems will also be significantly affected by climate change policy and national targets to address greenhouse gas emissions, since livestock are estimated to contribute similar to 10% of Australia's total emissions and 8-11% of global emissions, with additional farm emissions associated with activities such as feed production. More than two-thirds of emissions are attributed to ruminant animals. This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities facing livestock industries in Australia in adapting to and mitigating climate change. It examines the research needed to better define practical options to reduce the emissions intensity of livestock products, enhance adaptation opportunities, and support the continued contribution of animal agriculture to Australia's economy, environment, and regional communities.","[Henry, Beverley] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Sustainable Resources, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Charmley, Ed] Australian Trop Sci Innovat Precinct, Sustainable Agr Flagship, Townsville, Qld 4814, Australia; [Eckard, Richard] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Eckard, Richard] Dept Primary Ind, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Gaughan, John B.] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia; [Hegarty, Roger] Beef Ind Ctr Excellence Ind & Investment NSW, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Melbourne; University of Queensland; NSW Department of Primary Industries,"Henry, B (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Sustainable Resources, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",beverley.henry@qut.edu.au,"Gaughan, John/B-3484-2010; Eckard, Richard/M-9572-2014; Charmley, Ed/G-4427-2010; mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020","Gaughan, John/0000-0001-5395-6901; Eckard, Richard/0000-0002-4817-1517; Charmley, Ed/0000-0002-4189-1861","Climate Change Research Strategy for Primary Industries; Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Climate Change Research, Rural Research and Development Corporations","Climate Change Research Strategy for Primary Industries; Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Climate Change Research, Rural Research and Development Corporations","We thank Dr Brian Keating, Director CSIRO Sustainable Agriculture Flagship for his insights and expert review.

If such adaptation does not occur in a timely manner, then it could result in socio-economic problems that will reverberate throughout the region. Using examples of coastal Asia-Pacific cities that are characterised by contrasting geographical settings and cultural contexts, this study argues that the main barrier to such adaptation is path dependency. In this sense, path dependency is a legacy of past decisions that have been influenced by topography, economic goals, and the cultural-political characteristics of key decision-making groups. These path dependencies manifest as various adaptation preferences, which to date have been dominated by hard engineering solutions. In an era of accelerating climate change there is now a need to seek alternatives to in-situ urban growth. This paper argues that an understanding of a city's path dependency is key to optimizing the effectiveness of future adaptation.","[Nunn, Patrick D.; Smith, Timothy F.; Elrick-Barr, Carmen] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr & Australian Ctr Pacific Isl, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia; [Smith, Timothy F.] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON, Canada; [Smith, Timothy F.] Uppsala Univ, SWEDESD, Uppsala, Sweden",University of the Sunshine Coast; Brock University; Uppsala University,"Nunn, PD (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr & Australian Ctr Pacific Isl, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia.",pnunn@usc.edu.au,"Nunn, Patrick D./C-7864-2011; Elrick-Barr, Carmen/Q-9861-2019","Nunn, Patrick D./0000-0001-9295-5741; Elrick-Barr, Carmen/0000-0001-6868-1373",Australian Government through the Australian Research Council [FT180100652],Australian Government through the Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This research was supported by the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects Funding Scheme (Project FT180100652).,,132,3,3,3,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Five PASTs, each constructed by a different group of stakeholders, namely the state government, the local government, researchers, development agencies, and the local community, were analysed to obtain a holistic and multi-sectoral understanding of water security in the region, and the analysis was supplemented with field data. The systematic study helped in (1) identifying many factors - climatic, geographical, cultural, and socio-economic - that influence water security, (2) assessing their impacts on mountain livelihoods, and (3) documenting thirty-two potential interventions in the form of adaptations (e.g. springshed management programme) and coping strategies (e.g. buying water from informal water markets) to strengthen water security. These strategies followed three main themes namely conserving water resources, improving rural livelihood and sustainable infrastructure development and risk management. The study also helped in building a shared sense of understanding, purpose, and action between the diverse groups of stakeholders. The study suggests that ensuring water security in rural mountain areas requires holistic and multi-sectoral policies, which should be developed by including all actors in the network of stakeholders; that local conditions be given utmost importance in the policy planning cycle (e.g. focus on springs in mountains); and that cultural landscape and local identities be closely examined to reduce the inequalities in access to resources.","[Sen, Sudeshna Maya; Kansal, Arun] TERI Sch Adv Studies, Coca Cola Dept Reg Water Studies, 10 Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India",TERI University,"Kansal, A (corresponding author), TERI Sch Adv Studies, Coca Cola Dept Reg Water Studies, 10 Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India.",akansal37@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Kansal, Arun/AAS-8269-2020","Kansal, Arun/0000-0002-2985-2480; Sen, Sudeshna Maya/0000-0002-2292-033X","Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) Research Consortium","Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) Research Consortium","We thank all the respondents who participated in the workshop and field discussions.

Cities pursue myriad tactics to resist, recover from and adapt to shocks and stresses, but little is known about how these approaches relate across the scales of a city nor how cities compare in their abilities. Part of the challenge in addressing these gaps is that the risk to cities is typically studied with an emphasis on one or a few hazards or through the lens of a singular sector. This paper proposes a framework, dubbed the Urban Immune System (UIS) to coalesce and expand industrial ecology research on urban risk management. In the same way that Urban Metabolism (UM) is a unifying framework for urban environmental sustainability, UIS can be a unifying framework for urban resilience, especially related to climate change. Herein, UIS is defined, its many capabilities are dissected and linked to disparate studies; and opportunities for application of the concept are provided. The paper concludes by examining the relationship between UIS and climate change and by identifying those attributes of the UIS that are expected to be of increasing importance under climate change.","[Bristow, David N.] Univ Victoria, Dept Civil Engn, POB 1700,Stn CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Mohareb, Eugene A.] Univ Reading, Sch Construct Management & Engn, Reading, Berks, England",University of Victoria; University of Reading,"Bristow, DN (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Civil Engn, POB 1700,Stn CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",dbristow@uvic.ca,,"Mohareb, Eugene/0000-0003-0344-2253",,,,,80,5,6,5,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

Spatial configuration of a green network supports ecological functions and services, that depend on living organisms and material movements across the landscape. It is important to study the structure of green infrastructure networks and to develop robust methodologies that can inform future planning. In this paper we describe a framework for connectivity analysis and enhancement within the green infrastructure networks. We review and combine methods to map and analyse the current spatial network configuration of green elements, in order to identify the key nodes and links that can maintain connectivity and consequently support the benefits provided across the landscape. The study explores the creation of network scenarios and the improvement or reduction of connectivity by adding, preserving, or removing corridors and core areas. Methods include morphological spatial pattern analysis, landscape connectivity metrics and graph theory elements. The analysis has been applied in the Northern Italian Plain, considering green riparian zones and the protected areas as elements of the network.

For this purpose, 36 male and female heads of households in Arab Mahalla and Qajar Khel villages and 10 heads of households in Kiasar village (in Mazandaran Province) were selected and studied through theoretical and purposeful sampling methods of Corbin and Strauss. These villages have the highest number of female household heads and have been severely affected by the climate crisis in recent years. For the male-headed households (n = 23), the most important climate crisis was drought (f=16), and for the female-headed house-holds (n = 23), drought, cold, and early off-season frost and monsoon storms were the most important (f=13). The results also indicated that in climatic crises, human (X?=12.35) and social (X?=13) capital from the women's perspective and financial (X?=12.5) and physical (X?=13) capital from the men's perspective had the highest vulnerability percentages whereas natural capital was equally affected from both the men's and women's viewpoints. One of the innovative aspects of this study is the gender analysis of the impact of climate change on the AS of sustainable livelihood framework based on a qualitative approach. This study recommends that beyond increasing the diversity of living amid climate change, deliberate climate change efforts should be directed at women and that fundamental gender discrimination such as prejudices and gender inequality should be eliminated.","[Goli, Imaneh; Najafabadi, Maryam Omidi; Lashgarara, Farhad] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Econ Agr Extens & Educ, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Azadi, Hossein; Witlox, Frank] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium; [Azadi, Hossein; Sklenicka, Petr; Janeckova, Kristina] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Azadi, Hossein; Kurban, Alishir] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, 818 South Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Viira, Ants-Hannes] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Chair Rural Econ, Tartu, Estonia; [Kurban, Alishir] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecol & Environm Cent Asia, 818 South Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Kurban, Alishir] Sino Belgian Joint Lab Geoinformat, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Kurban, Alishir] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Islamic Azad University; Ghent University; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Estonian University of Life Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Najafabadi, MO (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Econ Agr Extens & Educ, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran.;Azadi, H (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium.",hossein.azadi@ugent.be; m.omidi@srbiau.ac.ir,"Kurban, Alishir/AGK-9193-2022; Azadi, Hossein/E-2361-2011; Omidi Najafabadi, Maryam/AAU-1669-2021; Sklenicka, Petr/B-9774-2012","Kurban, Alishir/0000-0001-9387-8127; Azadi, Hossein/0000-0002-5108-1993; Omidi Najafabadi, Maryam/0000-0003-1830-7660; Sklenicka, Petr/0000-0001-9778-9674",,,,,112,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,FEB,2023,125,,,,,,,,106470,10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106470,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106470,,,15,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6U2SI,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000894218500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The decrease in emissions cannot be explained by economic reasons. Interannual temperature variations do not have a strong impact on the global dynamics of CO2, because energy consumption for air conditioning and heating in the world almost neutralize each other. Stabilizing emissions does not mean that they will go down - it is more likely that global emissions will be around the same level until 2030. Thus, the assessment of global dynamics according to the 3 degrees C pathway (based on the country's current national goals - INDC/NDC) remains valid. The active process of replacement of coal with gas, renewables and nuclear generation in China and the United States is the main reason of this stabilization. The decoupling of economic growth and carbon emissions is already clearly demonstrated across the world, except some underdeveloped countries, despite the fact that a definite correlation between economic growth and carbon emissions is expected to be observed for a long time. Obviously, decoupling for developing countries is still far away. It is too early to judge the global dynamics of emissions after 2030, but with some confidence we can say that until 2030, international payments for emissions will most likely not be introduced. The situation will depend both on climate change risks and possible damage caused by the consequences of climate change for the largest countries, and on the economic parameters of the use of various energy sources.","[Kokorin, Alexey O.] World Wide Fund Nat WWF Russia, 19,Str 3,Nikoloyamskaya Ul, Moscow 109240, Russia; [Potashnikov, Vladimir Yu.] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Inst Appl Econ Res, 82 Vernadskogo Pr, Moscow 119571, Russia",Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration,"Kokorin, AO (corresponding author), World Wide Fund Nat WWF Russia, 19,Str 3,Nikoloyamskaya Ul, Moscow 109240, Russia.",akokorin@wwf.ru; potashnikov@ranepa.ru,"Potashnikov, Vladimir/N-1892-2018","Potashnikov, Vladimir/0000-0001-9237-3100",,,,,17,2,2,0,3,EKONOMICESKAA POLITIKA,MOSCOW,"EKONOMICESKAA POLITIKA, MOSCOW, 00000, RUSSIA",1994-5124,2411-2658,,EKONOMICHESKAYA POLI,EKONOMICHESKAYA POLIT.,JUN,2018,13,3,,,,,234,255,,10.18288/1994-5124-2018-3-10,http://dx.doi.org/10.18288/1994-5124-2018-3-10,,,22,Economics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,GN2UF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000438855800010,View Full Record in Web of Science

These phenomena and their proper management have attracted the attention of hydrologists and agricultural scientists. This paper evaluates the climate change effects on hydrological extremes based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in the North-Western part of Crete (Greece) for the period of 1960-2019. This area is considered to be one of the most important agricultural regions in the Mediterranean, dominated by tree cultivations. The climate trend line for SPI values shows slight decrease, indicating more intense dry periods for the next decades, especially for semi-mountainous areas. A notable result of this analysis is that more frequent dry and wet spells have appeared in the last three decades. In addition, a fuzzy based GIS modeling approach for estimating both droughts and floods prone areas named SPIsERS is developed, incorporating the special distribution of long-term time period Standardized Precipitation Index (SPIs), Evapotranspiration, Runoff accumulation and Soil available water capacity. The proposed methodology was validated for several flood and drought affected areas that have been historically recorded in the study area. According to the results 24.67% of the total tree crops parcels in the study region is prone to hydrological extremes (droughts or floods). Finally, for adapting to the inevitable adverse effects of climate change, water-saving and flood protection measures for Mediterranean tree crops areas are proposed.","[Kourgialas, Nektarios N.] Hellen Agr Org HAO DEMETER, Inst Olive Tree Subtrop Crops & Viticulture, Water Recourses Irrigat & Env Geoinforrnat Lab, Agrokipio, Chania, Greece",,"Kourgialas, NN (corresponding author), Hellen Agr Org HAO DEMETER, Inst Olive Tree Subtrop Crops & Viticulture, Water Recourses Irrigat & Env Geoinforrnat Lab, Agrokipio, Chania, Greece.",kourgialas@nagref-cha.gr,,"Kourgialas, Nektarios/0000-0002-1312-6185",,,,,71,12,12,3,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

In order to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on water availability and optimal allocation of water resources, hydrological models and optimal water resource allocation models should be integrated. Given that increasing human water demand and varying water availability conditions necessitate adaptation measures, we propose a framework to assess the effects of these measures on optimal allocation of water resources. The proposed model and framework were applied to a case study of the middle and lower reaches of the Hanjiang River Basin in China. Two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5) were employed to project future climate, and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model was used to simulate the variability of flows under historical (1956-2011) and future (2012-2099) conditions. The water availability determined by simulating flow with the VIC hydrological model was used to establish the optimal water resources allocation model. The allocation results were derived under an extremely dry year (with an annual average water flow frequency of 95%), a very dry year (with an annual average water flow frequency of 90%), a dry year (with an annual average water flow frequency of 75%), and a normal year (with an annual average water flow frequency of 50%) during historical and future periods. The results show that the total available water resources in the study area and the inflow of the Danjiangkou Reservoir will increase in the future. However, the uneven distribution of water availability will cause water shortage problems, especially in the boundary areas. The effects of adaptation measures, including water saving, and dynamic control of flood limiting water levels (FLWLs) for reservoir operation, were assessed and implemented to alleviate water shortages. The negative impacts from the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (Middle Route) in the mid-lower reaches of the Hanjiang River Basin can be avoided through the dynamic control of FLWLs in Danjiangkou Reservoir, under the historical and future RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios. However, the effects of adaptation measures are limited due to their own constraints, such as the characteristics of the reservoirs influencing the FLWLs. The utilization of storm water appears necessary to meet future water demand. Overall, the results indicate that the framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on water resources allocation might aid water resources management, not only in the study area but also in other places where water availability conditions vary due to climate change and human activities.

The transition from rain-fed to irrigation-fed (RFtoIF) agriculture has significantly increased farm productivity and profitability elsewhere in the United States. Despite this potential to enhance stability and resilience in rural economies, irrigated cropland accounts for only 5% of Alabama's total cropland as numerous barriers remain to irrigation adoption. To encourage RFtoIF transition, it is imperative to identify the challenges faced by individual farmers at farm, community, and state levels. This study presents a multi-level mixed effects survival analysis to identify the physiographic, socioecological, and economic factors that influence the location and timing of irrigation adoption. We integrate spatiotemporal cropland and climatological data with field-verified locations of center-pivot irrigation systems, local physiographic characteristics, and parcel-level surface water access and average well depth. Access to surface water, costs to access groundwater, and soil characteristics were generally important influences in all regions, but regions were differentiated by the extent to which new irrigation was more responsive to social influences vs. precipitation and price trends. Our findings also highlighted the diversity of farming conditions across the state, which suggested that diverse policy tools are needed that acknowledge the varying motivations and constraints faced by Alabama's farmers.","[Price, Ashleigh N.; Pathak, Ruchie; Magliocca, Nicholas R.] Univ Alabama, Dept Geog, Tuscaloosa, AL 35294 USA; [Guthrie, Gregory M.] Geol Survey Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL USA; [Kumar, Mukesh; Moftakhari, Hamed; Moradkhani, Hamid] Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construction & Environm Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL USA; [Nadolnyak, Denis] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Magliocca, NR (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Geog, Tuscaloosa, AL 35294 USA.",nrmagliocca@ua.edu,,"Pathak, Ruchie/0000-0001-9157-9131",,,,,69,2,2,3,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

Upon this rationale, the study provides in-depth empirical evidence on how resilience is framed, pursued, and realized from the perspective of low-income households in the Philippines. The study adopted a mixed-methods strategy to expound on the dynamics that affect resilience-building measures at the household level. The quantitative tools were chosen to provide empirical evidence on how residents in selected areas understand resilience and the actions undertaken to realize desired outcomes. The findings were further examined through analysis of data gathered from key informant interviews, relevant local policies, and regulations. Key findings show that autonomous household responses are intended, albeit intuitively, as resilience-building measures from the need to address risks immediately. These measures are undertaken independently and can provide direct benefits to the household. However, they may become counterproductive when analyzed from the point of view of collective resilience. The key to addressing this is institutional interventions that allow flexible modes of resilience that could enable households to pursue better resilience-building measures. Autonomous household responses, transitioning to a more collective level approach, challenge the distribution of decision-making processes and could result in framing appropriate urban resilience policies, strategies, and measures.","[Maquiling, Karl Sam M.] Mindanao Dev Author, Old Airport Bldg,KM 9 Davao, Davao Del Sur 8000, Philippines; [De La Sala, Safira; Rabe, Paul] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Inst Housing & Urban Dev Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Maquiling, KSM (corresponding author), Mindanao Dev Author, Old Airport Bldg,KM 9 Davao, Davao Del Sur 8000, Philippines.",karlmaqs@gmail.com,"Maquiling, Karl Sam/AAN-1639-2021; De La Sala, Safira/AAH-2328-2021","Maquiling, Karl Sam/0000-0002-8564-9700; De La Sala, Safira/0000-0002-8314-6165",Orange Knowledge Programme,Orange Knowledge Programme,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article is based on the first author's master's thesis.

Whilst broad literature on sustainability has expanded significantly over the past decades, academic literature developing sustainability as a distinct science has received little attention. After more than two decades of sustainability research, the time has come for us to begin asking reflective questions about what sort of science we call sustainability science. How has the broader research on sustainability contributed to developing sustainability science as a unique discipline within the past two decades? How has the label science promoted or hindered the interdisciplinary project of integrating the natural and social sciences as well as arts and humanities in addressing human nature problems? I argue in this review paper that special efforts need to be made towards the building and positioning of sustainability as an umbrella science for global sustainability research. The benefits of the new sustainability science advocated for in this paper are that; a) it offers a universal definition of sustainability that accounts for both the needs of life and the capacity of planetary life support systems to provide for those needs and b) proposes ways of bridging gaps among different research traditions, facilitating cross disciplinary communication and addressing the challenge of multiple meanings and definitions of concepts facing sustainability research today.","[Shahadu, Hardi] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Coll Grad Studies, 117 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Shahadu, H (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Coll Grad Studies, 117 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada.",hardi.shahadu@usask.ca,,,SSHRC,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to my supervisors, Drs Maureen Reed and Toddi Steelman, and Dr Brian Walker, for their comments on early drafts of this work.

DON; ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS; CALIFORNIA CURRENT; ECOSYSTEM; DISTRIBUTIONS; PATTERNS; SCALE; FOG; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION,"Studies that model the effect of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems often use climate projections from downscaled global climate models (GCMs). These simulations are generally too coarse to capture patterns of fine-scale climate variation, such as the sharp coastal energy and moisture gradients associated with wind-driven upwelling of cold water. Coastal upwelling may limit future increases in coastal temperatures, compromising GCMs' ability to provide realistic scenarios of future climate in these coastal ecosystems. Taking advantage of naturally occurring variability in the high-resolution historic climatic record, we developed multiple fine-scale scenarios of California climate that maintain coherent relationships between regional climate and coastal upwelling. We compared these scenarios against coarse resolution GCM projections at a regional scale to evaluate their temporal equivalency. We used these historically based scenarios to estimate potential suitable habitat for coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens D. Don) under 'normal' combinations of temperature and precipitation, and under anomalous combinations representative of potential future climates. We found that a scenario of warmer temperature with historically normal precipitation is equivalent to climate projected by GCMs for California by 2020-2030 and that under these conditions, climatically suitable habitat for coast redwood significantly contracts at the southern end of its current range. Our results suggest that historical climate data provide a high-resolution alternative to downscaled GCM outputs for near-term ecological forecasts. This method may be particularly useful in other regions where local climate is strongly influenced by ocean-atmosphere dynamics that are not represented by coarse-scale GCMs.","[Fernandez, Miguel; Kueppers, Lara M.] Univ Calif Merced, Sierra Nevada Res Inst, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Fernandez, Miguel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fernandez, Miguel] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Hamilton, Healy H.] NatureServe, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Kueppers, Lara M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Nature Conservancy; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Fernandez, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Merced, Sierra Nevada Res Inst, 5200 North Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",miguel.fernandez@idiv.de,"Kueppers, Lara M/M-8323-2013","Kueppers, Lara M/0000-0002-8134-3579; Fernandez, Miguel/0000-0002-8301-1340",Save the Redwoods League; Bobcat fellowship,Save the Redwoods League; Bobcat fellowship,"We thank A.

Increasing urban heat has made high density housing units a vulnerability hotspot. Alternatives to extended air-conditioning are required. This research sought evidence on using urban parks as a sustainable alternative by low-income households deprived of adequate living space. We interviewed occupants of tiny flats (approx. 10 m(2)), known as subdivided units, and compared their park visiting routines and thermal comfort practices with other urban dwellers in Hong Kong. The substandard conditions of these small units have contributed to dwellers' sensitivity and lower capacity to adapt to summer heat, resulting in heat-related illness. The space-poor households have taken a wider range of adaptive actions and visited urban parks more frequently for cooling. Their higher mobility between home and nearby parks has shortened their home-stay time that would otherwise demand residential space cooling. The findings are important for reconsidering and redressing the uneven distribution of urban green spaces. Poor housing conditions and heat stress have forced disadvantaged households to seek refuge from natural cool spaces, such as vegetated and shaded areas of urban parks. Measures for increasing their accessibility, availability and capacity for heat mitigation are conducive to pro-poor and pro-climate spatial planning.","[Lo, Alex Y.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Jim, C.

This case study presents an empirical account of the impacts of rainfall variability on agriculture, food security, livelihoods and human mobility in the Janjigir-Champa district of Chhattisgarh. The research tests the hypothesis that human migration is a major coping mechanism against climate variability. The findings confirm that a coordination mechanism exists between rainfall changes (i.e. erratic rainfall patterns in terms of delayed monsoons, seasonal shifts, drought and floods) and livelihood and food security of a number of farmers and farm labourers in the research site. Because there is only a single annual harvest of paddy rice (practiced as monoculture) in the research site, which is partly due to the non-availability of water for a second crop, marginal farmers and farm labourers are left with very few options in finding sufficient employment in and around their villages. Some people cope with the situation by seeking assistance from their relatives, friends and the government. However, seasonal and permanent migrations are the most opted-for coping strategies in the study area.","[Murali, Janakaraj] Energy & Resources Inst TERI, Darbari Seth Block, IHC Complex, New Delhi, India; [Murali, Janakaraj] Energy & Resources Inst TERI, New Delhi 110003, India; [Afifi, Tamer] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UN EHS, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",TERI University; TERI University,"Afifi, T (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UN EHS, Hermann Ehlers Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",afifi@ehs.unu.edu,,"Murali, Janakaraj/0000-0003-0887-7256",,,,,20,27,27,1,44,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Declining terms of trade, limited recent gains in on-farm productivity, low profit margins under current management systems and current climatic conditions will leave little capacity for businesses to absorb climate change-induced losses. In order to generate a whole-of-business focus towards management change, the Climate Clever Beef project in the Maranoa-Balonne region of Queensland trialled the use of business analysis with beef producers to improve financial literacy, provide a greater understanding of current business performance and initiate changes to current management practices. Demonstration properties were engaged and a systematic approach was used to assess current business performance, evaluate impacts of management changes on the business and to trial practices and promote successful outcomes to the wider industry. Focus was concentrated on improving financial literacy skills, understanding the business' key performance indicators and modifying practices to improve both business productivity and profitability. To best achieve the desired outcomes, several extension models were employed: the group facilitation/empowerment model', the individual consultant/mentor model' and the technology development model'. Providing producers with a whole-of-business approach and using business analysis in conjunction with on-farm trials and various extension methods proved to be a successful way to encourage producers in the region to adopt new practices into their business, in the areas of greatest impact. The areas targeted for development within businesses generally led to improvements in animal performance and grazing land management further improving the prospects for climate resilience.","[Broad, Kiri C.] Queensland Dept Agr & Fisheries, Longreach, Qld 4730, Australia; [Sneath, Roger J.] Queensland Dept Agr & Fisheries, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Emery, Timothy M.

For a Texas electric power system with high wind and solar penetrations, we quantify how climate change will affect supply and demand during three types of high stress periods for the power grid: high demand hours, high net demand hours, and high system ramp hours. We specifically quantify effects on demand, reductions in available thermal capacity (i.e. thermal deratings), wind and solar generation, and net demand. We estimate each using meteorological variables from five climate change projections (2041-2050) assuming Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 and from a reference period (1996-2005). All five projections indicate that climate change will increase demand by up to 2 GWh during high demand hours (4% of demand in the reference period) and increase net demand by up to 3 GWh during high net demand periods (6% of net demand in the reference period). All five projections also indicate thermal deratings will increase during high demand and net demand periods by up to 2 GWh and high net demand ramps will increase by up to 2 GW.

The dilemma boils down to the countervailing imperatives of moving out of harm's way versus retaining ties to community and place. While there are growing calls for its use, managed retreat remains challenging in practice-across diverse settings. The approach has been tested with varied success in a number of countries, but significant uncertainties remain, such as regarding who 'manages' it, when and how it should occur, at whose cost, and to where? Drawing upon a case study of managed retreat in New Zealand, this research uncovers intersecting and compounding arenas of uncertainty regarding the approach, responsibilities, legality, funding, politics and logistics of managed retreat. Where uncertainty is present in one domain, it spreads into others creating a cascading series of political, personal and professional risks that impact trust in science and authority and affect people's lives and risk exposure. In revealing these mutually dependent dimensions of uncertainty, we argue there is merit in refocusing attention away from policy deficits, barrier approaches or technical assessments as a means to provide 'certainty', to instead focus on the relations between forms of knowledge and coordinating interactions between the diverse arenas: scientific, governance, financial, political and socio-cultural; otherwise uncertainty can spread like a contagion, making inaction more likely.","[Hanna, Christina; White, Iain] Univ Waikato, Environm Planning Dept, Gate 1 Knighton Rd,Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Glavovic, Bruce] Massey Univ, Sch People Environm & Planning, Tennent Dr,Private Bag 11 222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand",University of Waikato; Massey University,"Hanna, C (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Environm Planning Dept, Gate 1 Knighton Rd,Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",Christina.Hanna@waikato.ac.nz; Iain.White@waikato.ac.nz; B.Glavovic@massey.ac.nz,"Glavovic, Bruce/AAM-2684-2021; White, Iain/N-8461-2014","Glavovic, Bruce/0000-0001-5235-1425; Hanna, Christina/0000-0001-8149-2761; White, Iain/0000-0003-4277-5042","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment through the Resilience to Nature's Challenges, National Science Challenge","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment through the Resilience to Nature's Challenges, National Science Challenge","This project was funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment through the Resilience to Nature's Challenges, National Science Challenge.",,81,23,23,2,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN 2,2020,12,2,,,,,,,736,10.3390/su12020736,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12020736,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KQ3KE,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000516824600294,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nature-based solutions (NBS) can provide a means for cities to successfully navigate the water-energy-climate relationship, thus enhancing urban resilience. Implementation of NBS can improve local or regional economic resilience underpinned by the sustainable use of natural resources. The innovative governance, institutional, business, and finance models and frameworks inherent to NBS implementation also provide a wealth of opportunity for social transformation and increased social inclusiveness in cities. The ultimate benefit of NBS implementation in cities is increased livability, which is typically measured as a function of multiple social, economic and environmental variables. Given the range of different interventions classified as NBS and the cross-sectoral character of their co-benefits, different assessment schemes can be used to evaluate NBS performance and impact. Herein, performance and impact indicators within three robust NBS- and Smart City-related assessment schemes-Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES), Knowledge and Learning Mechanism on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (EKLIPSE), and Smart City Performance Measurement Framework (CITYkeys)-were critically analyzed with respect to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Each selected assessment scheme was benchmarked with respect to the Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDG Indicators' global indicator framework for the sub-objectives of SDG 11. The alignment between each of the selected NBS assessment schemes and the SDG indicator framework was mapped with particular emphasis on consistency with city-level framework indicators for each SDG 11 sub-objective. The results were illustrated as composite scores describing the alignment of the analyzed NBS and Smart city assessment schemes with the SDG 11 sub-objectives. These results facilitate NBS assessment scheme selection based on alignment between each analyzed assessment scheme and specific SDG 11 sub-objectives. Cities face multiple challenges amidst a complex hierarchy of legislative, regulatory and other stakeholder obligations. The present study showed that strategic selection of an NBS assessment scheme which closely aligns with one or more sub-objectives within SDG 11 canmaximize operational efficiency by exploiting synergies between evaluation schemes.","[Wendling, Laura A.; Huovila, Aapo; Castell-Rudenhausen, Malin Zu; Hukkalainen, Mari] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland Ltd, Espoo, Finland; [Airaksinen, Miimu] Finnish Assoc Civil Engineers RIL, Helsinki, Finland",VTT Technical Research Center Finland,"Wendling, LA (corresponding author), VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland Ltd, Espoo, Finland.",laura.wendling@vtt.fi,"Huovila, Aapo/B-8034-2018; BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/AAC-9538-2021; Wendling, Laura/A-2745-2014","Huovila, Aapo/0000-0001-5127-6929; BITOUN, RACHEL Elisabeth/0000-0002-3614-9910; Hukkalainen, Mari/0000-0003-3260-3079; Wendling, Laura/0000-0002-5728-3684; zu Castell-Rudenhausen, Malin/0000-0003-0914-7458","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [730052, SCC-022016-2017]",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,"The authors thank Sami Kazi and Satu Paiho (VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Ltd.) for insightful discussions and insights on the ideas presented herein.

Properly managed urban soils can offset some of the associated carbon (C) losses from urban soils and vegetation by retaining stabilized soil organic carbon (SOC) or soil inorganic carbon (SIC) such as mineral-associated C, black carbon (BC), and stable carbonate minerals. For example, SOC stocks of up to 810 Mg C ha(-1) to 1.5 m depth (Serebryanye Prudy, Russia) and SIC stocks of up to 300 Mg C ha(-1) to 2.5 m depth (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) have been reported, but data on urban soil C storage are scanty. Aside from contributing to climate change mitigation, protecting and increasing SOC stocks support critically important soil-derived ecosystem services. Thus, C-friendly soil and land-use management practices must be developed and implemented to enhance soil-derived ecosystem services in urban areas, and the resilience of urban ecosystems to climate change. A collective management approach for urban soil C is needed. The principal actors involved should be urban land users (e.g., urban dwellers, property owners, developers) as the immediate users and managers of soil C, local professionals, local government and NGOs.","[Lorenz, Klaus] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies eV, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany; [Lal, Rattan] Ohio State Univ, Coll Food Agr & Environm Sci, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Lorenz, K (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Coll Food Agr & Environm Sci, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lorenz.59@osu.edu,"Lal, Rattan/D-2505-2013",,"Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), Forschung fur Nachhaltigkeit (FONA); Ministerium fur Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur, Land Brandenburg","Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), Forschung fur Nachhaltigkeit (FONA)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Ministerium fur Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur, Land Brandenburg","Klaus Lorenz greatly acknowledges the research fellowship granted by Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) and its platform Forschung fur Nachhaltigkeit (FONA), and by Ministerium fur Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur, Land Brandenburg.",,117,47,47,7,126,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1758-3004,1758-3012,,CARBON MANAG,Carbon Manag.,MAR 4,2015,6,1-2,,,,,35,50,,10.1080/17583004.2015.1071182,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2015.1071182,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CS9IW,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000362405000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We also show how these irrigation practices, combined with more sustainable soil management and other agroecological practices, can help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on wine grapes cultivation and make irrigated Mediterranean vineyards more resilient and sustainable. We analyse the deficit irrigation (DI) strategies used most often for different varieties and edaphoclimatic conditions. We review the latest advances in the application of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and partial root zone drying irrigation (PRI) strategies in grapevines (red and white grapes), as well as other irrigation methods used less frequently in vineyards to improve WUEyield, berry quality and irrigation efficiency, such as subsurface drip irrigation. We also analyze recent findings concerning the physiological response of the vine to water stress with more holistic approaches such as, hydraulic safety marging and stress distance, and discuss how to translate these physiological approaches into the practical application of RDI management in field conditions, according to the genotypic characteristics and degree of drought tolerance of the variety/rootstock combination. We review optimum vine water status ranges and the thresholds proposed for better deficit irrigation scheduling in vineyards. In addition, we consider sustainable soil management practices - such as cover crops, mulching, composting, reduced tillage, mutualistic plant-microorganisms interactions, and agroforestry - and their potential as beneficial agroecological practices to improve WUE, soil/vine performance, and other ecological services in RDI vineyards within a more sustainable farming system (organic farming). The idea is to design sustainable and climate-change-resilient agricultural systems (e.g. vineyards) in Mediterranean semi-arid areas.","[Romero, Pascual; Navarro, Josefa Maria; Ordaz, Pablo Botia] Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Medioambi, Irrigat & Stress Physiol Grp, C Mayor S-N, Murcia 30150, Spain",,"Romero, P (corresponding author), Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Medioambi, Irrigat & Stress Physiol Grp, C Mayor S-N, Murcia 30150, Spain.",pascual.romero@carm.es,,"BOTIA ORDAZ, PABLO/0000-0002-3646-3264","Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA, Spain) [RTA2005-00103-00-00, RTA2008-00037-C04-04, RTA2012-00105-00-00, FEDER PO-07-033, FEDER 1420-13, FEDER 1420-24]; European Social Fund; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades within the program Challenges of Society [I+D+I AGL2017-83738-C3-2-R]; European Regional Development Fund (FEDER)","Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA, Spain)(Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA)); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades within the program Challenges of Society; European Regional Development Fund (FEDER)(European Commission)","This work was financed by the Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA, Spain), Subprograma Nacional de Recursos y Tecnologias Agrarias en coordinacion con las comunidades autonomas, through the projects RTA2005-00103-00-00, RTA2008-00037-C04-04 and RTA2012-00105-00-00, through the projects FEDER PO-07-033, FEDER 1420-13 and FEDER 1420-24, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) and the European Social Fund, and through the project I+D+I AGL2017-83738-C3-2-R, financed by the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades within the program Challenges of Society.

Therefore, the traditional landscape design often has some disadvantages, such as waste of design resources, serious design energy consumption, poor adaptability of design products, weak practicality, and fragile ecological structure. Based on this, this paper will fully consider the role of climate factors such as solar radiation, temperature, wind conditions, and relative temperature and humidity and air pollutants in landscape design. At the same time, various design factors in landscape design will be quantified and statistically analyzed by using the principle of nonlinear random matrix, so as to further optimize the index distribution of balanced design factors and optimize the landscape design scheme. In the actual principle design, this paper adopts the logic idea of digital garden design, based on the design process of garden logic design, garden design foundation preparation, garden design environment analysis, and digital garden design results display, and establishes a parametric digital garden forest model, so as to realize the digital design and simulation of intelligent garden. In the corresponding practical simulation part, this paper carried out an example verification based on the interior and exterior landscape design of a company and realized the establishment of the parametric analysis model of the case based on parametric and visual-related programmable software, thus completing the simulation design of functional components such as garden road layout optimization design, garden greening planting design, garden landscape visual creation effect design, and garden numerical service design; the experimental results show that compared with the traditional garden design, the garden designed in this paper has increased the degree of garden intelligence by about 30%, reduced the energy consumption by about 20% in the corresponding degree of energy conservation and environmental protection, and increased the degree of garden comfort by about 30%.","[Lu, Yao] Henan Univ Urban Construct, Art Design Coll, Pingdingshan 467000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yao] Dong a Univ, Sch Landscape Architecture, Busan 612022, South Korea; [Chen, Bingyan] Henan Univ Technol, Sch Design & Art, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Xin, Yicheng] Beijing Univ Civil Engn & Architecture, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiaofei] Henan Univ Urban Construction, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Pingdingshan 467000, Henan, Peoples R China",Henan University of Urban Construction; Dong A University; Henan University of Technology; Beijing University of Civil Engineering & Architecture,"Chen, BY (corresponding author), Henan Univ Technol, Sch Design & Art, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China.",20172080@hncj.edu.cn; artcby@haut.edu.cn; 992xin@gmail.com; 30030509@hncj.edu.cn,,,Henan Province Teaching Reform Project: Innovation and Practice of Talent Training Mode for New Construction Engineering Majors in the Digital Age;  [2021SJGLX529],Henan Province Teaching Reform Project: Innovation and Practice of Talent Training Mode for New Construction Engineering Majors in the Digital Age; ,AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by Henan Province Teaching Reform Project: Innovation and Practice of Talent Training Mode for New Construction Engineering Majors in the Digital Age (No. 2021SJGLX529).,,29,0,0,5,5,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1024-123X,1563-5147,,MATH PROBL ENG,Math.

Despite a proliferation of new coral reef restoration efforts globally and increasing scientific recognition and research on interventions aimed at supporting reef resilience to climate impacts, few restoration programs are currently incorporating climate change and resilience in project design. As climate change will continue to degrade coral reefs for decades to come, guidance is needed to support managers and restoration practitioners to conduct restoration that promotes resilience through enhanced coral reef recovery, resistance, and adaptation. Here, we address this critical implementation gap by providing recommendations that integrate resilience principles into restoration design and practice, including for project planning and design, coral selection, site selection, and broader ecosystem context. We also discuss future opportunities to improve restoration methods to support enhanced outcomes for coral reefs in response to climate change. As coral reefs are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to climate change, interventions that enhance reef resilience will help to ensure restoration efforts have a greater chance of success in a warming world. They are also more likely to provide essential contributions to global targets to protect natural biodiversity and the human communities that rely on reefs.","[Shaver, Elizabeth C.; McLeod, Elizabeth] Nature Conservancy, 4245 N Fairfax Blvd 100, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Hein, Margaux Y.] Marine Ecosyst Restorat Res & Consulting, Monaco, Monaco; [Palumbi, Stephen R.] Stanford Univ, Pacific Grove, CA USA; [Quigley, Kate] Minderoo Fdn, Perth, WA, Australia; [Vardi, Tali] ECS NOAA Fisheries Off Sci & Technol, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Smith, David] Sch Life Sci, Coral Reef Res Unit, Colchester, Essex, England; [Smith, David] Mars Inc, London, England; [Montoya-Maya, Phanor] Corales Paz, Cali, Colombia; [Muller, Erinn M.] Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL USA; [Banaszak, Anastazia T.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [McLeod, Ian M.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Water & Aquat Ecosyst Res, TropWATER, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Wachenfeld, David] Great Barrier Reef Marine Pk Authority, Townsville, Qld, Australia",Nature Conservancy; Stanford University; University of Queensland; Mars; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; James Cook University,"Shaver, EC (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, 4245 N Fairfax Blvd 100, Arlington, VA 22203 USA.",elizabeth.shaver@tnc.org,"McLeod, Ian/J-9062-2014; Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010","McLeod, Ian/0000-0001-5375-4402; Muller, Erinn/0000-0002-2695-2064; Smith, David/0000-0003-1886-8193; Shaver, Elizabeth/0000-0002-9039-372X; Quigley, Kate/0000-0001-5558-1904; Mumby, Peter/0000-0002-6297-9053",,,,,114,4,4,35,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

We analyze cocoa's vulnerability to climate change in the West African cocoa belt, based on climate projections for the 2050s of 19 Global Circulation Models under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change intermediate emissions scenario RCP 6.0. We use a combination of a statistical model of climatic suitability (Maxent) and the analysis of individual, potentially limiting climate variables. We find that: 1) contrary to expectation, maximum dry season temperatures are projected to become as or more limiting for cocoa as dry season water availability; 2) to reduce the vulnerability of cocoa to excessive dry season temperatures, the systematic use of adaptation strategies like shade trees in cocoa farms will be necessary, in reversal of the current trend of shade reduction; 3) there is a strong differentiation of climate vulnerability within the cocoa belt, with the most vulnerable areas near the forest-savanna transition in Nigeria and eastern Cote d'Ivoire, and the least vulnerable areas in the southern parts of Cameroon, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia; 4) this spatial differentiation of climate vulnerability may lead to future shifts in cocoa production within the region, with the opportunity of partially compensating losses and gains, but also the risk of local production expansion leading to new deforestation. We conclude that adaptation strategies for cocoa in West Africa need to focus at several levels, from the consideration of tolerance to high temperatures in cocoa breeding programs, the promotion of shade trees in cocoa farms, to policies incentivizing the intensification of cocoa production on existing farms where future climate conditions permit and the establishment of new farms in already deforested areas.

As the energy system decarbonises, it is likely that electricity will supply even more services, thereby increasing the dependence of communities on reliable electricity supply. In this situation, the risk of power outages during extreme weather events poses a serious challenge to the safety and wellbeing of communities. However, little is known of the capacity of households to manage normal day-to-day life in such circumstances. This paper focuses on the UK winter storms that occurred in February 2014, the result of which 80,000 homes were left without power and communities not reconnected for several days. We outline the impacts these power outages had on households, describing the challenges faced and the strategies adopted to alleviate impacts. This provides insight into everyday household-level resilience achieved through social and material elements that constitute everyday life. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Despite the importance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in environmental protec-tion and public health, they still consume considerable energy. This study employs bi-level nonlinear optimi-zation models and a systematic platform of four novel techniques to design an energy self-sufficient network of WWTPs on Jeju Island, South Korea. A systematic platform consisting of four novel techniques is employed for designing energy self-sufficient WWTPs. The four techniques are dehydration of generated biogas from an anaerobic digestion, a nonlinear thermo-mathematical program for maximizing the generated electricity per input sludge, a deficit-surplus trade to avoid storage usage, and a bi-level multi-integer nonlinear program for optimal sizing of photovoltaic (PV) arrays. Three self-sufficient designs (SSDs) are proposed, including a network of biogas-fed combined heat and power plants (CHPPs) coupled with WWTPs (SSD-1), solar-powered WWTPs (SSD-2), and hybrid CHPP WWTPs retrofitted with PV systems (SSD-3). The biogas obtained from anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge in the WWTPs is dehydrated to fuel the CHPPs that use the available grid as a storage unit to establish a self-sufficient network in SSD-1. The PV units substitute for the CHPPs in SSD-2, while the hybrid systems minimize the local power trade in SSD-3. Economic, social, and environmental models of the optimal configurations are developed to compare the proposed SSDs. The resulting life-cycle impacts (LCI) of the proposed designs vary between 2 and 4531 pts/day depending on the energy demand and SSDs of the WWTPs. When the energy demand is 155.1 kWh/day in SSD-2, the LCI is 2 pts/day, whereas it reaches 150 pts/day for the energy demand of 10,786.6 kWh/day. A maximum of 26,278 new jobs could be created at an annual cost of-1,345,458 USD in SSD-2. The solar-powered scenarios had lower environmental impacts and greater social benefits, but were more expensive, compared with anaerobic digestion-assisted designs. Gradually adding bio-energy to an energy mix using hybrid renewable networks can therefore facilitate a smooth transition to a carbon-free economy on Jeju Island by 2030.","[Woo, Taeyong; Charmchi, Amir Saman Tayerani; Ifaei, Pouya; Heo, SungKu; Nam, KiJeon; Yoo, ChangKyoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Integrated Engn, 1732 Deogyeong-daero, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi do, South Korea; [Yoo, ChangKyoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, 1732 Deogyeong-daero, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi do, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Kyung Hee University,"Yoo, CK (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, 1732 Deogyeong-daero, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi do, South Korea.",ckyoo@khu.ac.kr,,", Amir Saman/0000-0001-5153-3403; Yoo, ChangKyoo/0000-0002-9406-7649; Ifaei, Pouya/0000-0002-6898-8583","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2021R1A2C2007838]; Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as Graduate School Specialized in Climate Change, and Brain Pool Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [2019H1D3A1A02071051]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as Graduate School Specialized in Climate Change, and Brain Pool Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2021R1A2C2007838),by Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as Graduate School Specialized in Climate Change, and Brain Pool Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (2019H1D3A1A02071051).",,40,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

However, the pattern of lake changes and how it responds to climate change and revegetation have rarely been reported. We investigated the pattern of lake-area changes in the Dalinor National Nature Reserve (DNR) using Landsat imagery during 1976-2015, and examined its relationship with changes in climate and vegetation factors. The total lake-area in the DNR has decreased by 11.6% from 1976 to 2015 with a rate of -0.55 km(2) year(-1). The largest Dalinor Lake reduced the most (by 32.7 km(2)) with a rate of -0.79 km(2) year(-1). The air temperature has increased significantly since 1976, with a rate of 0.03 degrees C year(-1) (p < 0.05), while the precipitation slightly decreased during 1976-2015, with a rate of -0.86 mm year(-1). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) increased by 27.7% from 1976 to 2015, especially after 2001 when vegetation has been promoted greatly as a result of the successful ecological protection and restoration in the Dalinor basin. The decrease in lake-areas for the DNR exhibited a negative correlation with NDVI (r = -0.397, p < 0.05) during 1976-2015. It seems that decreasing precipitation drives the reduction in lake-area, while rising temperature and vegetation greenness accelerated this decreasing trend by increasing evapotranspiration. The continuous lake shrinkage increases the ecological risks to the habitat of birds, causing a challenge to the management in the DNR.","[Li, Haidong; Gao, Yuanyun; Yan, Shouguang] Nanjing Inst Environm Sci, Minist Environm Protect, Nanjing 210042, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Yingkui] Univ Tennessee, Dept Geog, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Xu, Yuyue] Nanjing Univ, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Nanjing University,"Gao, YY (corresponding author), Nanjing Inst Environm Sci, Minist Environm Protect, Nanjing 210042, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",Lihd2020@163.com; Maragao1991@outlook.com; yli32@utk.edu; ysg@nies.org; xuyy@nju.edu.cn,"XU, Yuyue/AAY-6122-2020",,National Geographic Air and Water Conservation Fund [GEFC-12-16]; National Special Public Welfare Study on Environmental Protection in China [201509027],National Geographic Air and Water Conservation Fund(National Geographic Society); National Special Public Welfare Study on Environmental Protection in China,"We thank Weishou Shen from Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Environmental Protection and Xianghua Xu from Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology for their suggestions and help.

There has been little discussion of the impacts of climate change on postharvest agriculture, and still less on these impacts in developing countries. Many studies have focused on potential crop yield and pre-harvest implications of different climatic projections, but have omitted an analysis of the need and ability to then protect this increasingly valuable harvest as a vital aspect of food security. Postharvest systems will be affected by changes in temperature, rainfall, humidity, extreme events and the natural and human responses to climate change and variability. This study describes typical grain postharvest systems in east and southern Africa and discusses the likely impacts of different climate change trends on postharvest activities, assets and human well-being outcomes. Adaptation opportunities for creating more climate resilient postharvest agricultural systems and associated livelihoods are identified. Many of these adaptation opportunities are already known and understood by postharvest service providers, highlighting the significant challenge of getting postharvest knowledge into use at a larger scale. A discussion is presented on the factors influencing attempts to strengthen the adaptive capacity of postharvest systems, such as its invisibility, its omission from training curricula, innovation system challenges, the policy bias towards pre-harvest agricultural spending, limited understanding of gender and diversity aspects of postharvest roles, and the dominance of maize in the food system. The study recognises the crucial role of postharvest agriculture in helping communities adapt and cope with change.","[Stathers, Tanya; Lamboll, Richard] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England; [Mvumi, Brighton M.] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, Harare, Zimbabwe",University of Greenwich; University of Zimbabwe,"Stathers, T (corresponding author), Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England.",t.e.stathers@gre.ac.uk,"Stathers, Tanya/AAV-7154-2020","Stathers, Tanya/0000-0002-7767-6186",University of Greenwich; DFID; EU; IDRC; UNDP,University of Greenwich; DFID; EU(European Commission); IDRC; UNDP,"This study was supported by the University of Greenwich, and builds on the authors' experiences during numerous field projects funded by a range of donors including DFID, EU, IDRC, and UNDP.

The number of people who will be affected by increasing temperatures will rise, especially those in the heat-sensitive group of elderly people. Urban planning departments have to develop adaptation strategies in order to limit negative effects of climate change on their citizens. Due to their climatic ecosystem services, urban green areas can play an important role in this process. Since the effects of climate change can vary in different urban areas, a study was conducted focusing on identification of residential areas most affected by climate change according to surface cover structure and demographic characteristics in the City of Linz, Austria by using satellite images and demographic data. Residential areas with low vegetation cover and a high number of risk group members are identified as climate-change sensitive residential areas (CCSRA). About half of the residential areas of Linz and nearly two thirds of the population of Linz live in these areas. With selected representatives of these CCSRAs, the greening potential was identified and climate adaptive strategies developed. A survey carried out in selected CCSRAs showed a high appreciation for urban green areas (83.3 to 86.7 percent) by the inhabitants but a very low trust (35.0 to 56.7 percent) in their ability to contribute to the reduction of thermal load. Most residents would support an increase of different types of urban greenery in their residential areas (e.g., 76.7 to 91.7 percent would support an increase in lawns); at the same time, there is a high rejection of unsealing measures (e.g., 38.9 to 57.5 percent reject a lower number of parking lots). Greening measures, which would not require a change of surface structures such as facade greening, are the least accepted greening measures (38.9 to 57.5 percent reject this possibility). In the opinion of most inhabitants, residents should decide on the green structure of their residential areas (69.4 and 76.7 percent), while only a minority would approve of the involvement of urban planners (40.0 to 43.3 percent) or experts and scientists (16.7 to 30.0 percent) in this process. The results show an informational and educational deficit on the subject of climate change impact at a local level. The greening potential in CCSRAs is still not sufficiently valued by decision-makers and inhabitants, and adaptation strategies in the urban development of the areas are lacking.

This study provides evidence that a heliophilic butterfly, the Glanville fritillary (Melitaea cinxia) has adapted differently to environmental variation across latitudes and elevations. 2. In cool air, basking M. cinxia orient themselves perpendicular to the sun's rays to gain heat and take off. During flight, solar heating is reduced because orientation perpendicular to the sun is no longer possible and convective cooling occurs. Consequently, M. cinxia have been shown to suffer net heat loss in flight, even in full sunshine. When flight duration is restricted in this way, the takeoff temperature becomes an important thermal adaptation. 3. Using a thermal imaging camera, takeoff temperatures were measured in experimental butterflies. Butterflies from the northern range limit in Finland took flight at slightly hotter temperatures than butterflies from the southern limit in Spain, and much hotter than butterflies from the elevational limit (1900-2300 m) in the French Alps. Butterflies from low-elevation populations in southern France also took off much hotter than did the nearby Alpine population. 4. These results suggest that the influence of elevation is different from that of latitude in more respects than ambient temperature. Values of solar irradiance in the butterflies' flight season in each region show that insects from the coolest habitats, Finland and the Alps, experienced similar solar irradiance during basking, but that Finns experienced much lower irradiance in flight. This difference may have favored Finnish butterflies evolving higher takeoff temperatures than Alpine butterflies that also flew in cool air but benefited from more intense radiant energy after takeoff.","[Advani, Nikhil K.] World Wildlife Fund, 1250 24th ST NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Advani, Nikhil K.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Parmesan, Camille; Singer, Michael C.] Univ Paul Sabatier, CNRS, UMR 5321, Stn Ecol Theor & Expt, Moulis, France; [Parmesan, Camille; Singer, Michael C.] Plymouth Univ, Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Parmesan, Camille] Univ Texas Austin, Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",World Wildlife Fund; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; University of Plymouth; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Advani, NK (corresponding author), World Wildlife Fund, 1250 24th ST NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",nkadvani@utexas.edu,"Parmesan, Camille/GVT-5674-2022","Singer, Michael/0000-0002-0277-534X; Parmesan, Camille/0000-0002-1515-274X; Advani, Nikhil/0000-0003-2332-1002","University of Texas at Austin, Section of Integrative Biology","University of Texas at Austin, Section of Integrative Biology","Saskya van Nouhuys, Jeremy Thomas and Constanti Stefanescu helped in collecting samples, and John Frederick made the calculations of solar irradiance.

To base adaptation strategies, to deal with these changing river discharges, on the best scientific and technical knowledge, it is important to understand potential climate impacts, as well as the capacity of social and natural systems to adapt. Both are characterized by large uncertainties, at different scales, that range from individual to local to regional to international. This review paper addresses three challenges. Dealing with climate change uncertainties for the development of adaptation strategies is the first challenge. We find that communication of uncertainties in support of river basin adaptation planning generally only covers a small part of the spectrum of prevailing uncertainties, e.g. by using only one model or scenario and one approach to deal with the uncertainties. The second challenge identified in this paper is to overcome the current mismatch of supply of scientific knowledge by scientists and the demand by policy makers. Early experiences with 'assess-risk-of-policy' approaches analysis of options, starting from the resilience of development plans, suggests that this approach better responds to policy makers' needs. The third challenge is to adequately capture the transnational character of the Rhine river basin in research and policy. Development and implementation of adaptation options derived from integrated analysis at the full river basin level, rather than within the boundaries of the riparian countries, can offer new opportunities, but will also meet many practical challenges.","[van Pelt, Saskia C.] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Earth Syst Sci & Climate Change Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Swart, Rob J.] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Alterra, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"van Pelt, SC (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Earth Syst Sci & Climate Change Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",saskia.vanpelt@wur.nl,,"Swart, Rob/0000-0002-1563-1150",,,,,94,30,30,0,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

After acknowledging that Urban Heat Island hugely affects building thermal-energy behavior, recent contributions deal with its effect on vulnerable population groups in terms of their exposure risk to health diseases even worsened by energy poverty. In this view, the paper investigates the role played by occupants' education and their knowledge of environmental risks and climate change-related events, by exploring the opportunity to improve their information level as trigger for improving their climate change behavioral resilience and reducing their health risk in the built environment during extreme events. To this aim, a novel widespread questionnaire was elaborated and submitted to more than 300 individuals with varying their educational background and personal characteristics, seasonal period, submission mode, temporal closeness to heat wave emergency. Key findings showed that participants' educational background represents a clear way to drive environmentally aware behaviors minimizing the consequent health risk imputable to urban overheating and other environmental hazards such as heat waves. In fact, a higher level of awareness and consciousness may lead to a better adaptation capability to such climate change related hazards since they tend to implement conscious and resilient behavioral attitudes to minimize their indoor thermal stress at home (0.8 versus 1.4 points awareness level about mitigation strategies). Therefore, this paper demonstrated that informative campaigns may represent an effective strategy for making building occupants more resilient to climate change toward dedicated environmental management solutions and policies taking advantage of educational vehicles.

Over hundreds of years, the port has provided an appropriate ground for human life as no air conditioner is needed there. Unfortunately, this valuable old texture has been destroyed inadvertently. New buildings in the port are just superficial copies of the old buildings' external surfaces, with no attention to their goal, i.e., the provision of thermal comfort for inhabitants. The new buildings are dramatically increasing without considering the historical texture and climate. As a result, the inhabitants have to use air conditioners in most months continuously; hence, there would be an increase in energy consumption and a disruption in climate balance. This study has been conducted to compare the compatibility of such architecture with the climate and its success in providing climate comfort for the inhabitants. According to the information obtained from the study, the old houses built more than 100 years ago using traditional design had better performance in adaptability with climate. Accordingly, the exploitation of traditional instructions and patterns in a new format would largely reduce energy consumption in hot seasons and eliminate the need for heating in cold seasons. In this regard, a huge amount of energy is saved, resulting in less damage to the environment.","[Mozafari, Nadiya; Alimardani, Masoud] Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training Univ, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Tehran, Iran",Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University (SRTTU),"Mozafari, N (corresponding author), Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training Univ, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Tehran, Iran.",nadiya.mozafari@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,1,1,1,2,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1336-5835,2199-6512,,CIV ENVIRON ENG,Civ.

Design/methodology/approach The study adopted the sustainable livelihoods approach. Data were collected through distribution of a structured questionnaire to 476 randomly selected households at the municipality of Inhambane. The questionnaire assessed all capital assets, covering 14 indicators and 43 sub-indicators of vulnerability, derived from published literature. Findings Results indicate that overall community vulnerability is largely derived from the vulnerability of physical, financial and social capitals, illustrated by declared food shortage, low nutrition levels, weak social networks, high level of biomass utilization and lack of financial resources due to unemployment. These aspects largely influence the noticed reduced adaptive capacity of surveyed households. Practical implications The study identified the need to improve the overall process of natural resources appropriation and utilization and the improvement of the governance capacity at the local targeting infrastructure, community structure and networks and capacity building that might enhance community livelihoods in changing scenarios. Originality/value The study is a contribution to the overall understanding of how livelihoods are exposed to climate change and variability in coastal settings.","[Zacarias, Daniel Augusta] Univ Eduardo Mondlane, Escola Super Hotelaria & Turismo Inhambane, Maputo, Mozambique",Eduardo Mondlane University,"Zacarias, DA (corresponding author), Univ Eduardo Mondlane, Escola Super Hotelaria & Turismo Inhambane, Maputo, Mozambique.",daniel.zacarias15@gmail.com,,"Zacarias, Daniel Augusta/0000-0002-9617-0535",,,,,105,12,12,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Detailed investigations on the limiting parameters of forest and steppe in different biomes provide necessary information for paleoenvironmental reconstruction and prognosis of potential landscape change. In this study, remote sensing data and gridded climate data were analyzed in order to identify main distribution patterns of forest and steppe in Mongolia and to detect environmental factors driving forest development. Forest distribution and vegetation vitality derived from the normalized differentiated vegetation index (NDVI) were investigated for the three types of boreal forest present in Mongolia (taiga, subtaiga and forest-steppe), which cover a total area of 73 818 km(2). In addition to the forest type areas, the analysis focused on subunits of forest and nonforested areas at the upper and lower treeline, which represent ecological borders between vegetation types. Climate and NDVI data were analyzed for a reference period of 15 years from 1999 to 2013. The presented approach for treeline delineation by identifying representative sites mostly bridges local forest disturbances like fire or tree cutting. Moreover, this procedure provides a valuable tool to distinguish the potential forested area. The upper treeline generally rises from 1800 m above sea level (a.s.l.) in the northeast to 2700 ma.s.l. in the south. The lower treeline locally emerges at 1000 ma.s.l. in the northern taiga and rises southward to 2500 ma.s.l. The latitudinal gradient of both treelines turns into a longitudinal one on the eastern flank of mountain ranges due to higher aridity caused by rain-shadow effects. Less productive trees in terms of NDVI were identified at both the upper and lower treeline in relation to the respective total boreal forest type area. The mean growing season temperature (MGST) of 7.9-8.9 degrees C and a minimum MGST of 6 degrees C are limiting parameters at the upper treeline but are negligible for the lower treeline. The minimum of the mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 230-290 mm yr(-1) is a limiting parameter at the lower treeline but also at the upper treeline in the forest-steppe ecotone. In general, NDVI and MAP are lower in grassland, and MGST is higher compared to the corresponding boreal forest. One exception occurs at the upper treeline of the subtaiga and taiga, where the alpine vegetation consists of mountain meadow mixed with shrubs. The relation between NDVI and climate data corroborates that more precipitation and higher temperatures generally lead to higher greenness in all ecological subunits. MGST is positively correlated with MAP of the total area of forest-steppe, but this correlation turns negative in the taiga. The limiting factor in the forest-steppe is the relative humidity and in the taiga it is the snow cover distribution. The subtaiga represents an ecological transition zone of approximately 300 mm yr(-1) precipitation, which occurs independently from the MGST. Since the treelines are mainly determined by climatic parameters, the rapid climate change in inner Asia will lead to a spatial relocation of tree communities, treelines and boreal forest types. However, a direct deduction of future tree vitality, forest composition and biomass trends from the recent relationships between NDVI and climate parameters is challenging. Besides human impact, it must consider bio-and geoecological issues like, for example, tree rejuvenation, temporal lag of climate adaptation and disappearing permafrost.","[Klinge, Michael; Erasmi, Stefan] Univ Goettingen, Inst Geog, Goldschmidtstr 5, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Dulamsuren, Choimaa; Hauck, Markus] Univ Goettingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci Plant Ecol & E, Untere Karspuele 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Karger, Dirk Nikolaus] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zuericherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Klinge, M (corresponding author), Univ Goettingen, Inst Geog, Goldschmidtstr 5, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",mklinge1@gwdg.de,"Erasmi, Stefan/AAN-7652-2020; Karger, Dirk Nikolaus/ABD-5181-2021","Erasmi, Stefan/0000-0002-6393-6071","Gottingen University; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) - Projektnummern [FR 877/32, DU 1145/4-1]",Gottingen University; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) - Projektnummern(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors would like to thank the US Geological Survey and VITO, Belgium, for making the satellite data freely available for scientific research.
