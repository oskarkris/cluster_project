The least developed countries and the small island states that lack financial resources to adapt to climate change are the most vulnerable nations to climate change. Although it would be more economical to adapt to climate change compared to the anticipated damage of not doing so, the demand for capital is estimated to range to hundreds of billions. The crucial question is how to manage investments to adapt to climate change globally. This study provides an overview of existing international provisions on climate finance for adaptation. It includes provisions through international financial institutions, United Nations agencies, bilateral and multilateral channels, and the private sector. It also explores how private sector finance can be further attracted to invest in climate change adaptation.","[Timilsina, Govinda R.] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Timilsina, GR (corresponding author), World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gtimilsina@worldbank.org,,,,,,,27,8,8,12,58,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2021,13,12,,,,,,,6515,10.3390/su13126515,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13126515,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SZ3EC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000666451800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Along the path towards an increase in climate resilience, a stimulating role is played by EU projects as well as by international climate networks such as the Covenant of Mayors Initiative on Climate Change Adaptation (Mayors Adapt), launched in 2014, and the new Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy which pledge to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and to adopt an integrated approach to tackling mitigation and adaptation to climate change. These initiatives stimulate engagement and networking among cities and raise public awareness encouraging policy makers to take action to adapt to climate change. Adaptation operates at different spatial and societal scales. Accordingly, the development of climate change adaptation strategies requires a holistic and multi-perspective approach with scale-specific studies. This paper provides an overview of adaptation initiatives undertaken in 11 South East European countries participating in the SEE OrientGate project, with reference to the policies and measures promoted by the EU and implemented at national level. In particular, a cross-sectoral policy analysis is performed and an inclusive representation of measures and policies undertaken by countries with an interdisciplinary approach is provided. The analysis of the country measures reveals that unless national governments and local communities are concerned with the impacts of climate change only few of the countries included in the analysis have developed a comprehensive National Adaptation Strategy and a National Action Plans. Nevertheless, almost all the countries have undertaken adaptation actions across sectors. Although these actions have only partially generated a full commitment towards climate adaptation, they attest an increasing awareness as well as a high involvement of national and local authorities that will boost cooperation among stakeholders to find out innovative solutions to strengthen society and protect the environment.","[Pietrapertosa, Filomena; Salvia, Monica; Cosmi, Carmelina] CNR, IMAA, Inst Methodol Environm Anal, Natl Res Council Italy, I-85050 Tito, PZ, Italy; [Khokhlov, Valeriy] Odessa State Environm Univ, Dept Meteorol & Climatol, Lvivska Str 15, UA-65016 Odessa, Ukraine",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Metodologie per l'Analisi Ambientale (IMAA-CNR); Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odessa State Environmental University,"Pietrapertosa, F (corresponding author), CNR, IMAA, Inst Methodol Environm Anal, Natl Res Council Italy, I-85050 Tito, PZ, Italy.",filomena.pietrapertosa@imaa.cnr.it,"Khokhlov, Valeriy N/C-4148-2011; Salvia, Monica/B-7549-2015; Cosmi, Carmelina/C-2884-2015; Khokhlov, Valeriy N/G-9024-2018; Pietrapertosa, Filomena/ABF-9161-2020; Pietrapertosa, Filomena/B-7555-2015","Salvia, Monica/0000-0001-8989-0377; Cosmi, Carmelina/0000-0001-9981-0684; Khokhlov, Valeriy N/0000-0001-8315-8636; Pietrapertosa, Filomena/0000-0001-6519-7105",South East Europe Transnational Cooperation Programme [SEE/C/0001/2.2/X],South East Europe Transnational Cooperation Programme,This work was supported by the South East Europe Transnational Cooperation Programme (2012-2014) [Project Code: SEE/C/0001/2.2/X.].,,48,30,30,7,49,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

In response to the continued undervaluation of such factors, scholars are adopting place identity and place attachment as a way to explore the risks of climate change in a more holistic manner. This study draws on Churchill, Manitoba's unique relationship with climate change to present an early examination of place-based climate change adaptation. Results from a community survey suggest that citizens' sensitivity to local climate impacts is associated most strongly with their connection to the social meanings that are embedded in the natural landscape. Results also indicate that this place driven sensitivity does not necessarily lead to an increase in actions to adapt to climate change. It is suggested that inaction in the face of climate change can persist, even when citizens' have a strong connection to place, particularly because dominant climate change communications fail to produce a socially salient message. By linking place-based adaptation research to an emerging value-based frame for climate adaptation, this study presents new pathways to help legitimize local values in climate change adaptation processes, and to create frames for communication that are more conducive to fostering collective action.

J,"Schneider, T",,,,"Schneider, Tina",,,Responsibility for private sector adaptation to climate change,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,adaptation to climate change; business; critical infrastructure; Germany; public responsibility,PUBLIC-GOODS; GOVERNMENT; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) indicates that vulnerable industries should adapt to the increasing likelihood of extreme weather events along with slowly shifting mean annual temperatures and precipitation patterns, to prevent major damages or periods of inoperability in the future. Most articles in the literature on business management frame organizational adaptation to climate change as a private action. This makes adaptation the sole responsibility of a company, for its sole benefit, and overlooks the fact that some companies provide critical goods and services such a food, water, electricity, and medical care, that are so vital to society that even a short-term setback in operations could put public security at risk. This raises the following questions: (1) Who is responsible for climate change adaptation by private-sector suppliers of critical infrastructure? (2) How can those who are identified to be responsible, actually be held to assume their responsibility for adapting to climate change? These questions will be addressed through a comprehensive review of the literature on business management, complemented by a review of specialized literature on public management. This review leads to several conclusions. Even though tasks that formerly belonged to the state have been taken over by private companies, the state still holds ultimate responsibility in the event of failure of private-sector owned utilities, insofar as they are critical infrastructure. Therefore, it remains the state's responsibility to foster adaptation to climate change with appropriate action. In theory, effective ways of assuming this responsibility, while enabling critical infrastructure providers the flexibility adapt to climate change, would be to delegate adaptation to an agency, or to conduct negotiations with stakeholders. In view of this theory, Germany will be used as a case study to demonstrate how private-sector critical infrastructure providers can plan and implement climate change adaptation in practice, through the regulatory modes of negotiations and enforced self-regulation.","Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Business Adm Econ & Law, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Schneider, T (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Business Adm Econ & Law, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",,,,KLIMZUG [nordwest2050]; German Federal Ministry for Education and Research,KLIMZUG; German Federal Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This paper has been supported by the research project KLIMZUG nordwest2050, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (2009-2014).",,56,16,16,2,37,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Design/methodology/approach A sample of 352 households, stratified into conventional coffee farmers 232 (66%) and specialty coffee producers 120(34%), was used. The propensity score model for participating in quality coffee production was estimated using 14 covariates, and the impact of quality coffee production on adaptation to climate change adaptation was examined. The results are augmented with qualitative data collected through focus group discussions and key informant interviews held with randomly selected smallholder farmers. A telecoupling theoretical perspective was used to understand the link between coffee farmers' adaptation practices and the demand for quality coffee, as coffee is a global commodity. Findings The PSM analysis reveals that quality coffee production positively influences climate change adaptation. This implies that conventional coffee producers would have performed better in adaptation to climate change if they had participated in quality coffee production. The results of group discussions also confirm the positive effects of quality coffee production on adaptation to climate change, which also suggests a positive spillover effects for sustainable coffee farm management. Practical implications This study suggests enhancing quality coffee production is essential if a more sustainable and climate change resilient coffee livelihood is envisioned. Originality/value Though many studies are available on adaptation to climate change in general, this study is one of the few studies focusing on the effects of quality coffee production on climate change adaptation by smallholders in one of the least developed countries, Ethiopia. This study provides a better understanding of the importance of adaptation strategies specific to coffee production, which in turn help develop a more resilient coffee sector, as coffee production is one of the most sensitive activity to climate change.","[Adane, Asnake] Wollo Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Dessie, Ethiopia; [Bewket, Woldeamlak] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Coll Social Sci, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Adane, A (corresponding author), Wollo Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Dessie, Ethiopia.",asnake.adane@wu.edu.et,"Asnake, Adane/ABF-5577-2021",,Norwegian Research Council [255664],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),The authors of this paper would like to acknowledge the Norwegian Research Council for funding the Project The role of global value chains in transition to sustainability (Project number 255664).

Regional water authorities, or water boards, are given an important role to design and implement specific adaptation policies and measures to manage these impacts. From the early 2000s onwards water boards are starting to adapt to climate change impacts, yet no systematic assessments exist to assess whether or not progress is being made and what explains similarities and differences across water boards. This paper aims to address these critical questions by analyzing the progress of all Dutch water boards for the period 2005-2016. We systematically collected and analyzed three consecutive water management plans for all 23 water boards in the Netherlands. We use content analysis methods to analyze progress by looking into their vulnerability and three levels of adaptation: recognition, groundwork and adaptation action. The results show that over time the number of reported climate change adaptation initiatives by the water boards is increasing, but most climate change adaptation is still at the recognition or groundwork level. Our findings reveal a diversity of efforts to adapt to climate change among Dutch water boards. We conclude that while (inter)national water and climate change adaptation policies have called for more adaptation action at regional levels, the unequal progress across the Netherlands suggests that existing 'soft' policy measures to push for adaptation might not be sufficient to ensure progress on adaptation across all water boards.","[Kamperman, Hans] Witteveen Bos, Environm Law & Permits PMC, Leeuwenbrug 8, NL-7411 TJ Deventer, Netherlands; [Biesbroek, Robbert] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Biesbroek, R (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",hans.kamperman@witteveenbos.com; robbert.biesbroek@wur.nl,"Biesbroek, Robbert/ABE-3686-2021; Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419",,,,,29,12,12,2,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

It builds on recent publications on climate change adaptation that suggest that the successes and failures of adaptation highly depend on the cultural and political realms of societal perceptions and the sensitivity of institutions. To capture this, the paper adopted a multi-sited ethnographic approach. Acknowledging that there is no central locus of representation that can unveil the working of disaster response in Mozambique, the paper brings together five vignettes of research in different 'sites' of concern to the rise in floods in Mozambique. These are the politics of climate change adaptation at the national institutional level, societal responses to increased flooding, local people's responses to floods, the evacuation and resettlement programme following the 2007 flood. The paper finds how adaptation to climate change becomes part of everyday politics, how actors aim to incorporate responses into the continuation of their normal behavior and how elites are better positioned to take advantage of adaptation programmes than the vulnerable people that were targeted. It argues that climate change adaptation must be made consonant with historically grown and ongoing social and institutional processes. It concludes with lessons that the analysis and methodology of the research can provide for the practice of climate change adaptation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the impact of climate change adaptations on food security among pastoralists in semi-arid parts of Kenya, who have not received due attention to date. Using an endogenous switching regression model, the current study revealed that pastoralists' food security increased significantly when they employed measures to adapt to climate change. The study results also showed that wealthier households and those with more livestock were more food-secure than comparatively poorer households or those with less livestock. Furthermore, the study uncovered a high prevalence of food security among more educated households. The paper therefore recommends that, in Kenya's semi-arid lands, where pastoralism is the primary means of livelihood, policies advocating adaptations to climate change should be strengthened.

Variation of climate change across regions and uncertainty about the magnitudes of change call for a diverse mix of adaptations to climate change across different regions and individual farms. This paper considers the institutional structure for effective climate change adaptation by Australian farms. It is argued that a rerun of the history of successful adaptation of farms to new technology, changes in output and input prices, natural climate variation, and other circumstances can be repeated for climate change adaptation. Individual farms can benefit from incentives and rewards to revise their decisions, which will combine with better individual outcomes. Complementary support by the government includes the provision of climate change and weather forecast information, support for research into new technology, help to evaluate the pros and cons of alternative choices, and provision of a social safety net for those unable to adapt.","[Freebairn, John] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Freebairn, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",j.freebairn@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,18,1,1,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,SEP,2021,9,9,,,,,,,141,10.3390/cli9090141,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9090141,,,10,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,UV1LP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000699249600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this reason, the researchers used the Sissala West District as a case study to determine factors influencing farmers' adaptation to climate change and strategies used to avert climate change impact. A total of 330 small-scale farmers were sampled for survey and 150 key informants were used in focus group discussions. Utilizing the logistic regression model, the study indicated irregular rainfall, high temperature, weather information, and high evaporation as the factors that highly influenced farmers' ability to adapt to climate change. A Weighted Average Index used to measure weather extremes revealed that drought and temperature had the highest level of occurrence. Furthermore, climate change adaptation strategies assessed in the study showed that agroforestry practices, drought-resistant crops, and mulching were the most preferred methods. The study concluded that farmers' ability to adapt to climate change can be improved if the Environmental Protection Agency and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture intensify climate adaptation campaigns, increase access to weather information, and train farmers on adaptable strategies including, but not limited to, alternative sources of livelihood.","[Fagariba, Clifford James; Baoro, Serge Kevin Gildas Soule] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Environm & Nat Resource Engn, Luoshi Rd 122, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Song, Shaoxian] Wuhan Univ Technol, Hubei Key Lab Mineral Resources Proc & Environm, Luoshi Rd 122, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology,"Fagariba, CJ (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Environm & Nat Resource Engn, Luoshi Rd 122, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Song, SX (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Hubei Key Lab Mineral Resources Proc & Environm, Luoshi Rd 122, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",cfagariba@yahoo.com; ssx851215@whut.edu.cn; soulegil@yahoo.fr,"Song, Shaoxian/AGX-4949-2022; , 宋少先/AAM-4178-2020; fagariba, clifford james/E-4032-2016","fagariba, clifford james/0000-0002-1870-0617",School of Natural Resource and Environmental Engineering of Wuhan University of Technology,School of Natural Resource and Environmental Engineering of Wuhan University of Technology,"We acknowledge the contributions of personnel of the Sissala West District Assembly, Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, Forestry Commission, Plan Ghana and Action Aid.

However, there are few examples of work that translates this approach into climate change adaptation practice, in order to demonstrate the practical utility of following a risk-based approach to adapting to climate change. The paper explores critically the differing conceptions of vulnerability and risk across the literature relating to disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. The paper also examines a selection of spatially focused climate change vulnerability and risk assessment methodologies in this context. In doing so, we identify issues with the availability of spatial data to enable spatial risk-based climate change assessments. We argue that the concept of risk is potentially favorable in helping cities to understand the challenges posed by climate change, identify adaptation options, and build resilience to the changing climate. However, we suggest that change is needed in the way that practitioners and policymakers engage with risk-based concepts if they are to be embed into climate change adaptation activities.","[Connelly, Angela; Carter, Jeremy; Handley, John] Univ Manchester, Dept Planning & Environm Management, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Hincks, Stephen] Univ Sheffield, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Manchester; University of Sheffield,"Connelly, A (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Dept Planning & Environm Management, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",angela.connelly-2@manchester.ac.uk; jeremy.carter@manchester.ac.uk; john.handley@manchester.ac.uk; s.hincks@sheffield.ac.uk,"Connelly, Angela/AAG-5127-2019; Connelly, Angela/HII-7115-2022","Connelly, Angela/0000-0003-1040-8678; Carter, Jeremy/0000-0003-1640-3747",European Union [653522],European Union(European Commission),"This research was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, grant agreement no. 653522.",,45,25,25,20,86,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2018,10,5,,,,,,,1399,10.3390/su10051399,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10051399,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ7RP,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000435587100095,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to determine whether community-based governance would increase behavioural support, in the form of donation behaviour, for a climate change adaptation trust fund. A sample of 548 Australians was randomly assigned to view one of two governance scenarios: (1) a community-based scenario in which community members were afforded a high level of autonomy in designing and allocating funding within a trust fund to help their community adapt to climate change, or (2) a government-centred scenario in which decision making regarding the trust fund remained with government officials. Path analysis revealed that the community-based scenario produced significantly higher levels of perceived autonomy support within the study's participants. High levels of perceived autonomy support predicted higher levels of autonomous motivation (indicating stronger citizenship) and lower levels of amotivation, a motivational pattern, which, in turn, predicted greater willingness to donate to the climate change adaptation trust.

There is a need to critically examine diverse climate change risks for indigenous peoples in the United States and the many structural barriers that limit their ability to adapt to climate change. This paper uses a sustainable climate adaptation framework to outline the context and the relationships of power and authority, along with different ways of knowing and meaning, to illustrate the underpinnings of some tribes' barriers to sustainable climate adaptation. The background of those structural barriers for tribes is traced, and then the case of water rights and management at the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming is used to illustrate the interplay of policy, culture, climate, justice, and limits to adaptation. Included is a discussion about how the rulings of the Big Horn general stream adjudication have hindered tribal climate change adaptation by limiting the quantity of tribal reserved water rights, tying those rights to the sole purposes of agriculture, which undermines social and cultural connections to the land and water, and failing to recognizing tribal rights to groundwater. Future climate projections suggest increasing temperatures, and changes in the amount and timing of snowpack, along with receding glaciers, all of which impact water availability downstream. Therefore, building capacity to take control of land and water resources and preparing for climate change and drought at Wind River Reservation is of critical importance.","[McNeeley, Shannon M.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, North Cent Climate Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"McNeeley, SM (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, North Cent Climate Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",shannon.mcneeley@colostate.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,Wind River Office of the Tribal Water Engineer; Wind River Water Resources Control Board; North Central Climate Science Center; U.S. Geological Survey through the North Central Climate Science Center,Wind River Office of the Tribal Water Engineer; Wind River Water Resources Control Board; North Central Climate Science Center; U.S. Geological Survey through the North Central Climate Science Center,"The author thanks the tribes at Wind River Reservation, the Wind River Office of the Tribal Water Engineer, and the Wind River Water Resources Control Board as well as the North Central Climate Science Center for supporting this research.

Yet, this new paradigm and its effects are not unproblematic, as the empirical research in Rwanda presented in this paper indicates.

Drawing on actor-network theory and its concept of translation, we provide an alternative view of adaptation to climate change by providing a critical assessment of the linkages between global climate change governance and concrete local adaptation measures, revealing that adaptation to climate change does not always have positive effects on people's livelihoods.","[Gebauer, Claudia; Doevenspeck, Martin] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Geog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Gebauer, C (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Geog, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",claudia.gebauer@uni-bayreuth.de,,,,,,,49,25,25,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-0894,1475-4762,,AREA,Area,MAR,2015,47,1,,,,,97,104,,10.1111/area.12168,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/area.12168,,,8,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,CB2MY,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000349463000014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nation states were given special responsibility to facilitate these by ensuring access to information and opportunities to participate in decision-making processes. Since then the need for public participation has featured prominently in calls to climate action. Using text analysis to produce a corpus of abstracts drawn from Web of Science, a review of literature incorporating public participation and citizen engagement in climate change adaptation since 1992 reveals lexical, temporal, and spatial distribution dynamics of research on the topic. An exponential rise in research effort since the year 2000 is demonstrated, with the focus of research action on three substantial themes-risk, flood risk, and risk assessment, perception, and communication. These are critically reviewed and three substantive issues are considered: the paradox of participation, the challenge of governance transformation, and the need to incorporate psycho-social and behavioral adaptation to climate change in policy processes. Gaps in current research include a lack of common understanding of public participation for climate adaptation across disciplines; incomplete articulation of processes involving public participation and citizen engagement; and a paucity of empirical research examining how understanding and usage of influential concepts of risk, vulnerability and adaptive capacity varies among different disciplines and stakeholders.

Five categories and 25 approaches in climate change adaptation were adopted through a thorough and detailed analysis of pertinent literature related to the National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) in the Gambia. A fuzzy analytic hierarchy process-based questionnaire survey was designed and presented to 12 experts chosen from the committee members of the Gambia's NAPA.

As acknowledged in the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, SIDS are distinct from other developing countries. They are 58 countries spread across three main geographic regions that are disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; they require special attention and support from the international community. Previous studies using a single theory to understand adaptation in SIDS were limited and unable to fully grapple with the totality, enormity and complexity of the climate challenge. This paper argues for capitalising on the value of the distinctiveness of different theories and approaches without having to integrate them into one paradigm. It further catalogues the earlier study's contributions to climate change adaptation scholarship and theory-building.

Although it becomes more urgent by the day, existing literature does not adequately touch upon the topic of climate adaptation in small municipalities. This article addresses this gap. It explores whether adaptation measures in small municipalities are overlooked in research focused on other aspects of urban environment, or whether such measures are indeed inadequate. Based on a large quantitative survey among Bavarian municipalities (n = 401), we conducted 11 qualitative case studies to answer the following two questions. First, how active are small municipalities in Bavaria, Germany, in climate change adaptation? Second, why and how do municipal adaptation frontrunners implement adaptation measures and what lessons can we learn from their experience? Our findings confirm that small municipalities rarely adapt to climate change, and when they do, their actions usually target water-related issues. Most often measures are responsive and pragmatic, instead of being preventive and transformative. The fact that the small municipality representatives that we have interviewed were not able to distinguish between adaptation and mitigation measures clearly illustrates the lack of local adaptation capacities. We conclude that national funding for municipal adaptation coordinators or networks is a promising way to improve local capacities.","[Buschmann, Daniel] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Philosophy, Environm Agcy, Bratislava, Austria; [Koziol, Karin] Munich Univ Appl Sci, Munich, Germany; [Bausch, Thomas] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Competence Ctr Tourism & Mobil, Brunico, Italy; [Reinhard, Steurer] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","Slovak Academy of Sciences; University of Munich; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Reinhard, S (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",reinhard.steurer@boku.ac.at,,,Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) [B567133],Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),"Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP), Grant/Award Number: B567133",,69,1,1,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0165-0203,1477-8947,,NAT RESOUR FORUM,Nat.

The ecosystem-based management approach can shift adaptation towards a more holistic, integrated and sustainable path. However, as countries work on strategies to adapt to climate change, the questions of if and how such agendas consider and operationalise ecosystem-based management remains. As one of the world's largest coastal countries, Brazil can have a prominent role in advancing the implementation of ecosystem-based management to coastal zones. By analysing two national Brazilian climate change adaptation institutions, this article evaluates and discusses the country's advances in promoting climate change adaptations based on ecosystem-based management principles. Our findings show that, although Brazil has incorporated many ecosystem-based management principles to climate change adaptation at the national level, greater attention should be given to operationalizing principles related to acknowledging uncertainties, sustainability, democracy and knowledge production and application. The challenges to implement these principles mirror historical challenges of Brazilian coastal management policies, such as balancing development and conservation, promoting social participation and implementing effective social-ecological assessments and monitoring programs. Policy makers, scientists and communities should be aware of the need to strengthen ecosystem-based management principles in the current adaptation agenda in order to enhance its capacity to foster adaptation and just coastal sustainability.","[Xavier, Luciana Yokoyama; Guilhon, Maila; Goncalves, Leandra Regina; Turra, Alexander] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Oceanog, BR-05508120 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Goncalves, Leandra Regina] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Inst Mar, BR-11070100 Santos, SP, Brazil; [Correa, Marina Ribeiro] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Energia & Ambiente, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Xavier, LY (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Oceanog, BR-05508120 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",lyxavier@usp.br; maguilhon@usp.br; goncalves.leandra@unifesp.br; marina.ribeiro.correa@alumni.usp.br; turra@usp.br,"Turra, Alexander/G-1352-2012; Xavier, Luciana Yokoyama/Q-9797-2017; Goncalves, Leandra Regina/H-7665-2012","Turra, Alexander/0000-0003-2225-8371; Xavier, Luciana Yokoyama/0000-0001-7074-9365; Goncalves, Leandra Regina/0000-0003-1182-418X; Ribeiro Correa, Marina/0000-0002-7522-1727","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo-FAPESP [2017/21797-5, 2019/13851-5, 2016/24677-8, 2019/14537-2, 2018/00462-8, 2019/04481-0, 2018/13238-9]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development-CNPq [309697/2015-8, 310553/2019-9]",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo-FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development-CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This research was funded by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo-FAPESP, grants number LYX: 2017/21797-5 and 2019/13851-5; MG: 2016/24677-8 and 2019/14537-2; LRG: 2018/00462-8 and 2019/04481-0; MRC: 2018/13238-9; and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development-CNPq, grant numbers AT: 309697/2015-8 and 310553/2019-9.",,78,3,3,8,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2022,14,3,,,,,,,1317,10.3390/su14031317,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14031317,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZC0DZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000757202900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A total of 330 small-scale farmers were sampled and their views were analysed using logistic regression model, weighted average index, and frequency table. Weighted average index was used to rank opinions of 150 key informants in focus group discussions. Utilizing the logistic regression model, the study indicated irregular rainfall, high temperature, weather information, and high evaporation as the factors compelling farmers to adapt to climate change. Weighted Average Index used to measure weather extremes revealed that drought and temperature had the highest level of occurrence. Furthermore, climate change adaptation strategies assessed in the study showed that agroforestry practices, drought-resistant crops, and mulching were the most preferred methods. The study concluded that farmers' ability to adapt to climate change can be improved if Environmental Protection Agency and Ministry of Food and Agriculture intensify climate adaptation campaigns, increase access to weather information, and training farmers on adaptable strategies including, but not limited to, alternative sources of livelihood.","[Fagariba, Clifford James; Soule, Serge K.

However, little is known about determinants of climate-change adaptation strategies used by these fish farmers. This study, therefore, articulates novelties on adaptation to climate change, as well ascertains determinants of adaptation strategies used by fish farmers in Epe, Lagos State, Nigeria. RESULTS Climate change adaptation strategies mostly used by fish farmers include frequent seeking for early warning information about climate change (76.7%) and avoidance of areas susceptible to flooding (60.0%). Climate-change adaptation strategies used by fish farmers were significantly influenced by access to early warning information (beta = 7.21), knowledge of farmers about climate change adaptation strategies (beta = 8.86), access to capital (beta = 28.25), and participation in workshop and conferences (beta = 37.19) but were reduced by number of fish stocking (beta = -2.06). CONCLUSION The adaptation strategies used by fish farmers were autonomous and mostly determined by the access to credit facilities and information. Development policy should focus on carbon capture and storage technology in order to reduce adverse impacts of climate change, as well as making early warning information on climate change available to fish farmers. These will enhance adaptation to climate change.

For the purpose; firstly, the effects of climate change were defined and a two-stage literature review was conducted. In the first stage, in order to understand the relationship between climate change adaptation and spatial planning the indicators by which spatial planning of adaptation to climate change can be evaluated were examined. The prominent issues for spatial adaptation to climate change have been identified as including spatial adaptation policies, governance model, implementation level, participation and the role of technology. In the second stage, literature was reviewed again on the prominent issues and the smart governance was obtained in it. Then, the scope of the smart governance approach in spatial adaptation to climate change in Turkey was discussed through spatial planning principles, participation, local level and technology. The content analysis method, which allows descriptive evaluations over the literature, was used as a research method. As a result, spatial planning principles and relevant actors were identified at the local level, but some deficiencies in the use of technology were determined. Therefore, it has been asserted that smart governance in spatial adaptation to climate change in Turkey has the potential and is open to development, but it has not yet reached sufficient scope.","[Kazanci, Gamze; Tezer, Azime] Istanbul Tech Univ, Mimarlik Fak, Sehir & Bolge Planlama Anabilim Dali, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Kazanci, G (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Mimarlik Fak, Sehir & Bolge Planlama Anabilim Dali, Istanbul, Turkey.",kazancig17@itu.edu.tr,"Kazancı, Gamze/ABS-5539-2022","Kazancı, Gamze/0000-0002-6344-523X",,,,,81,0,0,6,14,KARE PUBL,ISTANBUL,"Goztepe Mah.

SDG 13 has recommended mitigation and adaptation strategies to combat climate change, and many of these can be achieved using emerging technologies. Research has shown the efficacies of information communication technologies (ICTs) in mitigating and adapting to climate change. However, the selection and ranking of ICT tools for mitigating and adapting to climate change is a multicriteria problem. This paper presents a multicriteria framework that identifies and ranks the various ICT tools that can ensure climate change mitigation and adaptation. A fuzzy-technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution method is used as the basis of this model and tested using information obtained from an expert. The results show that the most ideal ICT alternative is social media with a closeness coefficient of 0.62, while the least preferred alternative is the intelligent system with a closeness coefficient of 0.17. The proposed model can be used in the planning of climate change adaptation strategies in developing countries where finances are usually a major constraint in implementing climate change action.","[John, Adebisi A.] Univ Namibia, Elect Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Windhoek, Namibia; [Damilola, Babatunde E.] Covenant Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Ota, Nigeria; [Olubayo, Babatunde M.] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Namibia; Covenant University; Tshwane University of Technology,"Damilola, EB (corresponding author), Covenant Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Ota, Nigeria.",damilola.babatunde@cov-enantuniversity.edu.ng,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1916,,,COGENT ENG,Cogent Eng.,DEC 31,2022,9,1,,,,,,,2119537,10.1080/23311916.2022.2119537,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311916.2022.2119537,,,26,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,6E1WD,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000883173600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

At worst, adaptation to climate change can trigger negative responses-maladaptation-in terms of raising greenhouse-gas emissions and exacerbating the vulnerability of specific groups of people, which both run counter to sustainable development principles. Thus, the integration of sustainable climate change adaptation objectives into a sustainable development framework can pave the way for planning scenarios, in which resilience intertwines with sustainability. Studies concerning this issue are quite lacking, and methods useful for assessing the relationship 'adaptation-sustainable development' are scarcely investigated. In this study, we focus on environmental sustainability and aim at proposing and applying a method for assessing the coherence between climate change adaptation objectives and sustainable development objectives (i.e., national strategic goals) included in the Italian National Adaptation Plan to Climate Change and, respectively, in the National Sustainable Development Strategy. We found that most adaptation objectives appear to be unrelated with national strategic goals, while none of them clearly hinder environmental sustainability, that is, the adaptation objectives are not inclined to promote maladaptation. There is still plenty of room to work on sustainable adaptation objectives to be consistent with sustainable development ones.","[Serra, Vittorio; Ledda, Antonio; Ruiu, Maria Grazia Gavina; De Montis, Andrea] Univ Sassari, Dept Agr Sci, Viale Italia 39A, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Calia, Giovanna; De Montis, Andrea] Univ Cagliari, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Architecture, Via Marengo 2, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",University of Sassari; University of Cagliari,"Ledda, A (corresponding author), Univ Sassari, Dept Agr Sci, Viale Italia 39A, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",v.serra12@studenti.uniss.it; antonioledda@uniss.it; m.ruiu30@studenti.uniss.it; g.calia@studenti.unica.it; andreadm@uniss.it,"Calia, Giovanna/GMW-6028-2022; Ruiu, Maria Grazia Gavina/GOH-1497-2022; De Montis, Andrea/J-6244-2013; Ledda, Antonio/J-7822-2015","Calia, Giovanna/0000-0003-0624-8528; Ruiu, Maria Grazia Gavina/0000-0003-4282-0552; De Montis, Andrea/0000-0002-3849-2595; Ledda, Antonio/0000-0003-2351-5544","Ministry of the Environment, Land and Sea; Autonomous Region of Sardinia; University of Sassari (Italy); University of Cagliari (Italy)","Ministry of the Environment, Land and Sea; Autonomous Region of Sardinia(Regione Sardegna); University of Sassari (Italy); University of Cagliari (Italy)","This research is funded by the Ministry of the Environment, Land and Sea through the project << SUSTAINADAPT-Strumenti e approcci per declinare l'integrazione fra sostenibilita e adattamento.

Preferably, the adaptation measures applied at the building level scale do not require additional energy (i.e. passive measures). Previous studies showed that passive climate change adaptation measures can have a positive effect on thermal comfort in summer and its shoulder seasons in non-air-conditioned residential buildings. In this paper, the effect of these passive climate adaptation measures - applied at building component level - on the cooling and heating energy demand of a terraced house is analyzed using building energy simulations. It is shown that for this particular case the required cooling energy can be limited to a large extent (59-74%) when external solar shading or additional natural ventilation is applied. In addition, it is shown that for a well-insulated terraced house the energy cost for heating is not strongly affected by the application of passive climate change adaptation measures.

The United States Forest Service (USFS) has conducted climate change vulnerability assessments for much of the 193 million acres of national forest lands it manages, yet little to no research exists on the degree to which management units have adopted considerations of climate change into planning or project implementation. In response to this knowledge gap, we piloted a survey instrument in USFS Region 1 (Northern region) and Region 6 (Pacific Northwest region) to determine criteria for assessing the degree to which national forests integrate climate-change considerations into their management planning and activities. Our resulting climate-change adaptation index provides an efficient quantitative approach for identifying where, how, and, potentially, why some national forests are making more progress toward incorporating climate-change adaptations into forest planning and management. Study Implications: We used a self-assessment survey of planners and managers on US National Forests in Forest Service Regions 1 and 6 to design a climate change adaptation index for measuring the degree to which national forests units have integrated considerations of climate change into their planning and management activities. Our resulting index can potentially be used to help understand how and why the USFS's decentralized climate-change adaptation strategy has led some national forests to make comparatively significant progress towards adapting to climate change while others have lagged behind.","[Coughlan, Michael R.; Huber-Stearns, Heidi] Univ Oregon, Inst Sustainable Environm, 130 Hendricks Hall,5247 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Schultz, Courtney] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, Publ Lands Policy Grp, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",University of Oregon; Colorado State University,"Coughlan, MR (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Inst Sustainable Environm, 130 Hendricks Hall,5247 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",mcoughla@uoregon.edu; hhuber@uoregon.edu; courtney.schultz@colostate.edu,,"Schultz, Courtney/0000-0002-9972-7802; Huber-Stearns, Heidi/0000-0002-8663-4471; Coughlan, Michael/0000-0001-6071-1873",USFS Office of Sustainability and Climate (OSC) [16-CS-11132000272],USFS Office of Sustainability and Climate (OSC),"This research is part of a multi-year project (Assessing the First Generation of Climate Change Vulnerability Assessments: Agreement #16-CS-11132000272) in collaboration with the USFS Office of Sustainability and Climate (OSC) staff at the Washington office to investigate how the agency is integrating considerations of climate change into their planning and actions.

Adaptation to climate risks that can no longer be avoided is an important aspect of the global response to climate change. Humans have always adapted to changing climatic conditions, and there is growing, if still patchy, evidence of widespread adaptation behavior. However, adaptation is not autonomous as sometimes claimed. It requires knowledge, planning, coordination, and foresight. There are important knowledge gaps, behavioral barriers, and market failures that hold back effective adaptation and require policy intervention. We identify the most urgent adaptation priorities, including areas where delay might lock in future vulnerability, and outline the decision-making challenges of adapting to an unknown future climate. We also highlight the strong interlinkages between adaptation and economic development, pointing out that decisions on industrial strategy, urban planning, and infrastructure investment all have a strong bearing on future vulnerability to climate change. We review the implications of these links for adaptation finance and what the literature tells us about the balance between adaptation and mitigation.","[Fankhauser, Sam] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Fankhauser, Sam] London Sch Econ, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Fankhauser, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Fankhauser, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.fankhauser@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,150,32,32,91,372,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4709-3,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

However, rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa face additional socio-political, cultural and economic challenges in addition to climate change. Decision support tools have been developed and applied to assist rural communities to cope with and adapt to climate change. However, poorly planned participatory processes and the lack of context-specific approaches in these tools are obstacles when aiming at strengthening the resilience of these rural communities. This paper uses an integrated literature review to identify best practices for involving rural communities in climate change adaptation efforts through the application of context-specific and culturally-sensitive climate change adaptation tools. These best practices include the use of a livelihoods approach to engage communities; the explicit acknowledgement of the local cultural do's and don'ts; the recognition of local champions appointed from within the local community; the identification and prioritisation of vulnerable stakeholders; and the implementation of a two-way climate change risk communication instead of a one-sided information sharing approach.","[Nkoana, Elvis Modikela] Univ Antwerp, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev IMDO, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Nkoana, Elvis Modikela] Univ South Africa, Coll Educ, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa; [Verbruggen, Aviel] Univ Antwerp, Dept Econ, Stadscampus Bldg B,Room B-216,Prinsstr 13, BE-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Huge, Jean] Univ Ghent, Ctr Sustainable Dev, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Huge, Jean] Univ Hasselt, Ctr Environm Sci, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium; [Huge, Jean] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Syst Ecol & Resources Management Unit, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",University of Antwerp; University of South Africa; University of Antwerp; Ghent University; Hasselt University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Nkoana, EM (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev IMDO, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.;Nkoana, EM (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Coll Educ, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa.",nkoana.elvis6@gmail.com; aviel.verbruggen@ua.ac.be; Jean.Huge@ulb.ac.be,,"Nkoana, Elvis Modikela/0000-0002-2235-0410; Huge, Jean/0000-0002-3695-547X",European and South Africa partnership for development (EUROSA); National Research Foundation (NRF); KLIMOS ACROPOLIS Research Platform on Climate Change & Development Cooperation - VLIR UOS; ARES,European and South Africa partnership for development (EUROSA); National Research Foundation (NRF); KLIMOS ACROPOLIS Research Platform on Climate Change & Development Cooperation - VLIR UOS; ARES,"We thank the anonymous reviewers, whose comments greatly enriched and improved the article.

While climate events are one of the many contributing drivers of conflict, feedback from conflict increases vulnerability, thereby creating conditions for a vicious cycle of conflict. In this study, we carry out a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature, taking from the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) dataset to documenting climate change adaptation occurring in 15 conflict-affected countries and compare the findings with records of climate adaptation finance flows and climate-related disasters in each country. Academic literature is sparse for most conflict-affected countries, and available studies tend to have a narrow focus, particularly on agriculture-related adaptation in rural contexts and adaptation by low-income actors. In contrast, multilateral and bilateral funding for climate change adaptation addresses a greater diversity of adaptation needs, including water systems, humanitarian programming, and urban areas. Even among the conflict-affected countries selected, we find disparity, with several countries being the focus of substantial research and funding, and others seeing little to none. Results indicate that people in conflict-affected contexts are adapting to climate change, but there is a pressing need for diverse scholarship across various sectors that documents a broader range of adaptation types and their results.","[Sitati, A.] United Nations Off Disaster Risk Reduct UNDRR, Geneva, Switzerland; [Joe, E.] World Resources Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Pentz, B.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Scarborough, ON, Canada; [Grayson, C.; Khouzam, A.] Int Comm Red Cross ICRC, Geneva, Switzerland; [Jaime, C.; van Aalst, M.; de Perez, E.

Even though climate change may have a positive effect, it is anticipated that there will be many severely negative effects on human and natural resources in the future. Therefore, in addition to the need for stronger promotion of mitigation policies, it is urgently necessary to study and implement adaptation policies over the longer term to prepare for the possible negative impact of climate change. To implement climate change adaptation measures rapidly in Japan, it would seem practical and effective to make good use of the various countermeasures already promoted by both the national and the local governments for many sectors such as disaster prevention, environmental management, food production, and protection of the nation's health. These countermeasures are considered to have potential for effecting climate change adaptation. This study, focusing on adaptation to climate change negative impacts, investigates to what extent the existing policies of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government could contribute to climate change adaptation, based on a comprehensive examination of targeted fields and indicators for which adaptation policies could be pursued. The results showed many of the existing policies could be useful for adaptation to climate change in many sectors. Furthermore, less than half of these policies need to take future climate change into account in order to contribute to climate change adaptation.

Usually, however, this concept is loosely applied in the literature. In the current study, we conducted interviews with farmers in drought-prone rice-producing provinces in the Philippines to better understand the types of stressors they face in adapting to climate change. Overall, 87 farmers, 17 key informants, and 4 experts participated in the research. A range of qualitative methods were used, including interviews, focus group discussions, and windshield surveys. The findings suggest two main types of stressors: direct and distal. Direct stressors (e.g. bureaucratic hurdles and poverty) are factors that directly affect the ability to adapt to climate change. Distal stressors (e.g. infrastructure development and national development) are stressors that do not appear to be related to climate change adaptation and yet affect climate change adaptation outcomes significantly. Recognizing and taking into account these two types of stressors will help in improving the design of interventions for farmers in dealing with the impacts of climate change.","[Manalo, Jaime Albarillo; van de Fliert, Elske; Fielding, Kelly] Univ Queensland, Ctr Commun & Social Change, Sch Commun & Arts, Brisbane, Qld 4012, Australia",University of Queensland,"Manalo, JA (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Commun & Social Change, Sch Commun & Arts, Brisbane, Qld 4012, Australia.",jaime.manalo@uqconnect.edu.au,"van de Fliert, Elske/I-9777-2016; Manalo, Jaime IV/GXZ-9641-2022","van de Fliert, Elske/0000-0002-7241-7994; Manalo, Jaime IV/0000-0003-3999-6661; FIELDING, Kelly/0000-0001-5301-0331",Philippine Rice Research Institute; University of Queensland,Philippine Rice Research Institute; University of Queensland(University of Queensland),This work was supported by Philippine Rice Research Institute [grant number Not applicable]; The University of Queensland [grant number: Not applicable].,,64,0,0,2,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Therefore, identifying knowledge gaps and enhancing climate adaptation awareness of decision makers at that level is very important. Based on this aim, we conducted a survey of climate change adaptation awareness among 85 administrative and management personnel from governmental departments responsible for climate change adaptation planning in five provinces. Study findings revealed that over half of respondents have knowledge of climate change adaptation measures, but the extent of understanding varied across different adaptation aspects and regions. Among the different aspects, understanding of measures related to human health protection was the lowest. A large majority of respondents indicated an eagerness to obtain knowledge and information about climate change adaptation, but the main barrier is a lack of training and learning material. When making adaptation plans or policies, the greatest obstacle expressed was a funding shortage. Information generated from this study can provide direction and guidance for training and educating provincial decision makers in order to improve the levels of adaptation planning and policy making.

This research note, which is part of a larger research project on climate change adaptation in Caribbean coastal communities, reviews the recent literature on human system adaptations to climate change at the local level in the Caribbean. It seeks to answer two questions: (1) How are human systems at the local level adapting to climate change in the Caribbean? (2) What challenges exist for local-level climate adaptations in human systems that seek to protect vulnerable communities in the Caribbean? The studies reviewed highlight the importance of considering the vulnerability of sub-populations, protecting their livelihoods, and pursuing institutional cooperation at the local and national levels. In interrogating whether the recommendations for community adaptations in the literature are transferrable to other geographies, this note further emphasizes that understanding the challenges that communities face in protecting human systems against climate change can help policy-makers develop more effective adaptation strategies that centre climate justice.","[Robinson, Stacy-ann; Wren, Caroline] Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Colby College,"Robinson, SA (corresponding author), Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",stacy-ann.robinson@colby.edu,,"Robinson, Stacy-ann/0000-0003-3163-8771",,,,,39,7,7,1,9,ROYAL DANISH GEOGRAPHICAL SOC,COPENHAGEN K,"OSTER VOLDGADE 10, COPENHAGEN K, DK 1350, DENMARK",0016-7223,1903-2471,,GEOGR TIDSSKR-DEN,Geogr.

After reviewing both state-centred and cosmopolitan arguments about adaptation assistance, it is argued that neither philosophical perspective justifies the statist design of existing institutions. A more just and effective international agreement on climate change adaptation must achieve a higher degree of consistency between the principles of burden sharing applied internationally and domestically.

Despite this, little research has been done to assist tourism destinations in adapting to climate change. Adaptation aims to moderate, cope with, and benefit from the consequences of climate change in order to manage risk and reduce vulnerability. Most adaptation models focus on the risks of climate change, missing the potential opportunities that may emerge due to climate change. Furthermore, the role of the tourist is largely neglected. This paper provides an analysis of existing adaptation models for tourism before proposing a conceptual framework for regional adaptation to climate change which takes into account both supply- and demand-side perspectives. Consequently, the proposed model provides a holistic approach to adaptation that aims to increase resilience and resistance to climate change by implementing appropriate adaptation strategies that reduce vulnerability, while increasing readiness to capitalise on opportunities presented by climate change.","[Jopp, Ryan; DeLacy, Terry; Mair, Judith] Victoria Univ, Ctr Tourism & Serv Res, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Mair, Judith] Victoria Univ, Sch Hospitality Tourism & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia",Victoria University; Victoria University,"Jopp, R (corresponding author), Victoria Univ, Ctr Tourism & Serv Res, POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",ryan.jopp@vu.edu.au,"Jopp, Ryan/GVS-5229-2022; Mair, Judith/P-2273-2014","Mair, Judith/0000-0002-2447-3377",,,,,42,81,84,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1368-3500,1747-7603,,CURR ISSUES TOUR,Curr.

Thus, they are affected directly through climate change impacts on their operations or indirectly by climate change impacts on the supply chain. Even if enterprises are aware of the relevance of adapting to climate change, there exist barriers that impede organizational change strategies. In order to mainstream research on barrier categorization of climate change adaptation, we want to explore a scale of organizational barriers for enterprises' climate change adaptation strategies. By developing a barrier scale, we contribute to future research by allowing conclusive causal explanations for the occurrence of barriers and how they can be overcome. As barriers are context-specific, we decided for an empirical setting in a specific context regarding organizational climate change adaptation. In this study, we focus on multinational enterprises' supply chains, especially the stakeholder group of small and medium-sized suppliers. As small and medium-sized enterprises are stakeholders of multinational enterprises, their adaptation to climate change is relevant for multinational enterprises as well. The value of our study is threefold: First, we present the first empirically explored scale of organizational barriers for enterprises' climate change strategies by factor analysis. Second, we describe what multinational' enterprises should learn for their strategic practices concerning an effective and efficient climate change adaptation in the supply chain. And third, even if we confirm that barriers are contextspecific, we would suggest our explored scale for organizational barriers for other context-specific changes strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It suggests that while scenario development is often positive for those involved, utilising scenarios to directly 'inform' adaptation decision making is more difficult. It seems that scenarios are a valuable but awkward form of evidence in the contemporary environment of evidence-based adaptation, introducing new substantive knowledge in an unfamiliar form, easily dismissed on credibility, legitimacy, and salience grounds. While scenario thinking is a good fit with climate change adaptation, it clashes with the predictive paradigm underlying the evidence-based decision-making model.

Despite this momentum, the interaction of climate change adaptation with pre-existing strategies to reduce vulnerability and build resilience in the developing world has only recently received significant attention. Using the example of disaster risk reduction, this paper explores the developing interface between climate change adaptation and existing development methodologies that have overlapping interests. While it has been established that there must be greater collaboration between these fields, many questions remain surrounding the scope of such interaction. This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and then explores some unanswered questions and developing conceptualizations. An examination of the theoretical points of convergence and divergence raises a range of questions surrounding how climate change adaptation is conceptualized in both the academic literature and the policy environment.

Spatial planning can play an important role in utilizing green infrastructure for adaptation. Yet climate change risks represent a different sort of challenge for planning institutions. This paper aims to address two issues arising from this challenge. First, it defines the concept of green infrastructure within the context of climate adaptation. Second, it identifies and puts into perspective institutional barriers to adopting green infrastructure for climate adaptation, including path dependence. We begin by arguing that there is growing confusion among planners and policy makers about what constitutes green infrastructure. Definitional ambiguity may contribute to inaction on climate change adaptation, because it muddies existing programs and initiatives that are to do with green-space more broadly, which in turn feeds path dependency. We then report empirical findings about how planners perceive the institutional challenge arising from climate change and the adoption of green infrastructure as an adaptive response. The paper concludes that spatial planners generally recognize multiple rationales associated with green infrastructure. However they are not particularly keen on institutional innovation and there is a tendency for path dependence. We propose a conceptual model that explicitly recognizes such institutional factors. This paper contributes to the literature by showing that agency and institutional dimensions are a limiting factor in advancing the concept of green infrastructure within the context of climate change adaptation.

We address three specific questions: (i) What is aquaculture adapting to? (ii) How is aquaculture adapting? and (iii) What research gaps need to be addressed? We identify, characterise and examine case studies published between 1990 and 2018 that lie at the intersection of the domains of climate change, adaptation and aquaculture. The main areas of documented climate change impacts relate to extreme events and the general impacts of climate change on the aquaculture sector. Three categories of adaptation to climate change are identified: coping mechanisms at the local level (e.g. water quality management techniques), multilevel adaptive strategies (e.g. changing culture practices) and management approaches (e.g. adaptation planning, community-based adaptation). We identify four potential areas for future research: research on inland aquaculture adaptation; studies at the household level; whether different groups of aquaculture farmers (e.g. indigenous people) face and adapt differently to climate change; and the use of GIS and remote sensing as cost-effective tools for developing adaptation strategies and responses.

Adoption of climate change adaptation strategies that increase agricultural productivity and at the same time building farmers' resilience capacity has become a top policy priority in SSA. In this study, we investigate how maize-dependent smallholders in Ethiopia adapt to climate change. Both household and plot-level data were collected, and subsequently analysed by a multivariate probit regression model. Results show that most climate change adaptation strategies implemented by maize-dependent smallholders, are complementary. Combining conservation tillage, mixed maize-legume cropping and terracing along with the use of drought-resistant maize varieties allows farmers to increase productivity while building resilience to climate change more than a subset of these strategies. Findings indicate that the likelihood of adopting soil and water conservation practices, drought-resistant maize varieties and chemical fertilizers significantly increase among young and male-headed households as well as farmers having confidence in extension agents and membership in local organisations. Hence, policies should aim at further building agricultural extension agents' capacity by providing effective and continuous education and training on climate change impacts and responses. Promoting family ties and household memberships in local organisations through facilitating mutual cooperation and communication among farming communities would help to foster adoption of climate change adaptation strategies.","[Bedeke, Sisay; Vanhove, Wouter; Van Damme, Patrick] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Lab Trop & Subtrop Agr & Ethnobot, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Gezahegn, Muluken] Haramaya Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, POB 09, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Natarajan, Kolandavel] Wolaita Sodo Univ, Coll Agr, POB 138, Sodo, Ethiopia; [Van Damme, Patrick] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Trop Agri Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Ghent University; Haramaya University; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Bedeke, S (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Lab Trop & Subtrop Agr & Ethnobot, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",belaysisay@gmail.com,", Patrick/AAI-8779-2020","Vanhove, Wouter/0000-0002-1697-2475; Bedeke, Sisay Belay/0000-0001-9452-6895; Wordofa, Muluken Gezahegn/0000-0002-5143-180X",Ghent University [Bof-W00514]; International Foundation for Science [S-5664],Ghent University(Ghent University); International Foundation for Science(International Foundation for Science),"This research was funded by Ghent University (Special Research Fund) and the International Foundation for Science under Grant No. Bof-W00514 and S-5664, respectively.

This study applies a range of participatory rural appraisal tools and key informant interviews to assess impacts of climate change when considering gender and ethnicity.

Women have limited or no participation in decision-making processes at family or community levels and this impacts their vulnerability and well-being.

While studies have focused on climatic impacts on crops and adaptation decisions, barriers to the uptake of adaptation measures by smallholder farmers remain largely unexplored. We empirically quantified the adoption of adaptation measures, as well as barriers to adoption and their determinants for smallholder agriculture in Far Western Province, Nepal, based on a survey of 327 smallholder farmers. We established relationships between barriers and adoption for three different agroecosystems: the Mountain, Hill, and Terai. We then used multiple regression to identify the determinants of barriers in the broader study area, as well as across agroecosystems. We found that adaptation measures such as crop adjustment, farm management, and fertiliser management were practised across all regions. Techno-informational, economic, and environmental barriers were strongly and inversely correlated with adoption of adaptation measures. Adoption, barriers, and determinants varied across agroecosystems. The findings indicate that agricultural development policies must consider climate change adaptation measures tailored to specific agroecosystems in order to most effectively alleviate barriers and promote smallholder resilience.","[Lamichhane, Prahlad; Hadjikakou, Michalis; Miller, Kelly K.; Bryan, Brett A.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol CIE, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Lamichhane, P (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol CIE, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",plamichh@deakin.edu.au; m.hadjikakou@deakin.edu.au; kelly.miller@deakin.edu.au; b.bryan@deakin.edu.au,"Bryan, Brett Anthony/F-8949-2010; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Hadjikakou, Michalis/F-1820-2014","Bryan, Brett Anthony/0000-0003-4834-5641; Hadjikakou, Michalis/0000-0002-3667-3982","Deakin University, Australia","Deakin University, Australia","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

It endeavors to incorporate how humans trade off values to be received in the future versus value received immediately into economic analysis. Interpreted as such, discounting neglects important spatial influences on how values are compared, thereby hindering cost-benefit analyses of climate change adaptation. In this article, we present new theory on space-time discounting and use it to analyze aspects of how humans adapt to climate change. Three climate change adaptation cases are considered. First, analysis of crop indemnity payments to farmers shows that failure to discount across space and time yields inaccurate evaluations of adaptation projects. Second, adaptation efforts of the Commonwealth of Nations show irregular patterns of international cooperation that suggest spatial discounting of adaptation which are not found in temporal discounting. Third, the nexus between climate change, migration, and conflict shows how various forms of space-time discounting can influence whether climate change and migration will lead to conflict. Collectively, these cases demonstrate the analytical power of the space-time discounting theory and also show how the complexity of climate change adaptation can challenge and strengthen this theory. Finally, this article's analysis demonstrates that proper discounting must include space as well as time.","[Baum, Seth D.; Easterling, William E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Baum, Seth D.] Penn State Univ, Rock Eth Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Baum, SD (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, 302 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",sbaum@psu.edu,,,,,,,61,13,13,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

The causes of the erosion are discussed and include anthropogenic factors, climate variability and projected climate change. Based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections for the Caribbean region, and the likely increase of anthropogenic stresses such as coastal development, it is likely that the beach erosion trend will continue and increase. Nonexclusive approaches to help beaches adapt to climate change include structural, planning or ecological measures. Two case studies illustrating climate change adaptation measures are discussed, one focuses on coastal planning measures in Anguilla and Nevis, and the second focuses on ecological measures, specifically the rehabilitation of a coastal forest in Puerto Rico.

Effective adaptation to change requires the efficient use of land, water, energy, and other vital resources, and coordinated efforts to minimize trade-offs and maximize synergies. However, as in many developing countries, the policy process in South Asia generally follows a sectoral approach that does not take into account the interconnections and interdependence among the three sectors. Although the concept of a water-energy-food nexus is gaining currency, and adaptation to climate change has become an urgent need, little effort has been made so far to understand the linkages between the nexus perspective and adaptation to climate change. Using the Hindu Kush Himalayan region as an example, this article seeks to increase understanding of the interlinkages in the water, energy, and food nexus, explains why it is important to consider this nexus in the context of adaptation responses, and argues that focusing on trade-offs and synergies using a nexus approach could facilitate greater climate change adaptation and help ensure food, water, and energy security by enhancing resource use efficiency and encouraging greater policy coherence. It concludes that a nexus-based adaption approach - which integrates a nexus perspective into climate change adaptation plans and an adaptation perspective into development plans - is crucial for effective adaptation. The article provides a conceptual framework for considering the nexus approach in relation to climate change adaptation, discusses the potential synergies, trade-offs, and offers a broader framework for making adaptation responses more effective.Policy relevanceThis article draws attention to the importance of the interlinkages in the water, energy, and food nexus, and the implications for sustainable development and adaptation. The potential synergies and complementarities among the sectors should be used to guide formulation of effective adaptation options. The issues highlight the need for a shift in policy approaches from a sectoral focus, which can result in competing and counterproductive actions, to an integrated approach with policy coherence among the sectors that uses knowledge of the interlinkages to maximize gain, optimize trade-offs, and avoid negative impacts.","[Rasul, Golam; Sharma, Bikash] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Rasul, G (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal.",golam.rasul@icimod.org,"Rasul, Golam/AAV-2646-2020","Rasul, Golam/0000-0002-5972-5036","UK's Department for International Development (DFID); Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway; Swedish International Development Agency (Sida); Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) of Australia","UK's Department for International Development (DFID); Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway; Swedish International Development Agency (Sida); Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) of Australia","This study was part of the Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) Programme of ICIMOD funded by the UK's Department for International Development (DFID) and Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Himalayan Climate Change Adaptation Programme (HICAP) implemented jointly by ICIMOD, CICERO and Grid-Arendal and funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway and Swedish International Development Agency (Sida), and Koshi Basin Programme of ICIMOD funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) of Australia.

We review the role of spatial planning as a tool for adaptation to climate change. In doing so, we describe common planning processes and tools. Six capacities of spatial planning that have the potential ability to facilitate climate change adaptation are identified and discussed. These principally relate to spatial planning's ability to: act on matters of collective concern; manage competing interests; cut across scales; reduce and act on uncertainty; act as a knowledge repository; and be oriented to the future while integrating a range of diverse systems. Methods (tools) for planning which have the capacity to address climate change adaptation are presented and discussed. In light of these capacities and acknowledged limitations in planning practice, we identify three key challenges to spatial planning for adaptation: (1) developing conviction; (2) facilitating equitable processes and outcomes; and (3) transforming planning systems from passive to proactive.

They are commonly used to support dialogue and decision-making in multistakeholder contexts. In agricultural sectors, stakeholders increasingly must contend with pressures to adapt to climatic changes and shifts in weather patterns. This study examines the potential of PVZs to engage agricultural stakeholders about climate change adaptation, specifically around best management practices (BMPs). In 2015, survey data were collected (n = 133) at six agricultural conferences Vermont. Participants were asked about their climate change knowledge, perceptions of adaptation, and their intentions to adopt or recommend one or more of the following BMPs: riparian buffers, drainage tiles with constructed wetlands, retention ponds, and silvopasture. In addition, respondents were asked about how well PVZs did or did not clarify their understanding of each BMP and its associated limiting factors. Results from five multivariate ordered logit models show an increase in interest among some agricultural stakeholders in adopting a BMP (among farmers) or recommending a BMP (among agricultural advisors) after seeing a PVZ depicting that practice. Interest in adoption or recommendation of BMPs was also more likely among respondents who believe that it is important for farms to adapt to climate change. Although PVZs are not common in agricultural outreach programs, these results suggest that PVZs are relevant to agricultural education and land-use decision-making, specifically in the domain of climate change adaptation.","[Schattman, Rachel E.] USDA, Northeast Climate Hub, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Hurley, Stephanie E.; Greenleaf, Holly L.; Caswell, Martha] Univ Vermont, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Burlington, VT USA; [Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Burlington, VT USA; [Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Food Syst Program, Burlington, VT USA; [Caswell, Martha] Univ Vermont, Agroecol & Livelihoods Collaborat, Burlington, VT USA; [Schattman, Rachel E.; Hurley, Stephanie E.; Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Schattman, RE (corresponding author), USDA, Northeast Climate Hub, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;Schattman, RE (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",rachel.schattman@maine.edu,"Schattman, Rachel/AAX-4080-2020","Schattman, Rachel/0000-0001-7177-3914; Niles, Meredith/0000-0002-8323-1351",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [231242]; USDA Northeast Climate Hub,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA Northeast Climate Hub,"This research was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project 231242 and the USDA Northeast Climate Hub.

Without institutionalised action, adapting to climatic change remains ad-hoc. Using exploratory research design and longitudinal observations, this research investigates how urban stakeholders and policy entrepreneurs negotiate institutional architecture and pathways for sustaining climate change adaptation and resilience implementation. This paper introduces hybrid institutionalism as a framework to understand how city administrators, local policy makers, and policy advocates navigate complex institutional landscapes that are characterised by volatility and uncertainties. Grounded in the experience from a recent experiment in Indonesia, this research suggests that institutionalisation of adaptation and resilience agenda involves different forms of institutionalisation and institutionalism through time. Future continuity of adaptation to climate change action depends on the dynamic nature of the institutionalism that leads to uncertainty in mainstreaming risk reduction. However, this research found that pathway-dependency theory emerges as a better predictor for institutionalising climate change adaptation and resilience in Indonesia.","[Lassa, Jonatan A.] Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Indigenous Futures Arts & Soc, Emergency & Disaster Management, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia",Charles Darwin University,"Lassa, JA (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Indigenous Futures Arts & Soc, Emergency & Disaster Management, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia.",jonatan.lassa@cdu.edu.au,"Lassa, Jonatan/D-2205-2017; Lassa, Jonatan/M-6112-2019","Lassa, Jonatan/0000-0002-8432-842X; Lassa, Jonatan/0000-0002-8432-842X",Rockefeller Foundation,Rockefeller Foundation,Initial funding was provided by Rockefeller Foundation via ACCCRN Indonesia project managed by Mercy Corps during 2012/2013.

Consequently, development efforts are gradually being replaced by climate change adaptation. In this article, I investigate how 'gender' is understood and conceptualized in climate change adaptation in Bangladesh, and what this means for how gender considerations are included in adaptation efforts. I build on qualitative interviews with representatives of what Kasia Paprocki has coined the 'climate change adaptation regime' in Dhaka, as well as participant observation at conferences, seminars, and meetings on issues relevant to gender and climate change adaptation in Bangladesh. Understanding adaptation to be political and contested, I argue that established representations of women in development and disaster thinking are now re-presented to fit with the politically negotiated consensus of what adaptation in Bangladesh should look like, and that gender mainstreaming initiatives which go beyond the understanding of adaptation as negotiated by this consensus are excluded. This may lead to increased responsibilities for women, feminizing the responsibility to adapt to climate change.","[Evertsen, Kathinka Fossum] Nord Univ, Fac Social Sci, Bodo, Norway",Nord University,"Evertsen, KF (corresponding author), Inst Samfunnsforskning, Postboks 3233 Elisenberg, N-0208 Oslo, Norway.",isf@samfunnsforskning.no,,"Evertsen, Kathinka Fossum/0000-0002-7161-9711",,,,,57,0,0,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This study focuses on the process of individual adaptation to climate change. It assesses and compares the influence of cognitive, experiential and structural factors on individuals' views and intentions regarding climate change adaptation. Data from this study comes from a survey with 836 forest owners in Sweden. Ordinal and binary logistic regression was used to test hypotheses about the different factors. Results show that cognitive factors-namely personal level of trust in climate science, belief in the salience of climate change and risk assessment-are the only statistically significant factors that can directly explain individuals' intention to adapt to climate change and their sense of urgency. Findings also suggest that structural or socio-demographic factors do not have a statistically significant influence on adaptation decision-making among Swedish forest owners.

Yet, the field of climate adaptation constantly grapples with complex ideas whose relational interplay is not always clear. Similarly, understanding how applied climate change adaptation efforts unfold through planning processes that are embedded in broader institutional settings can be difficult to apprehend. We present a review of important theory, themes, and terms evident in the literature of spatial planning and climate change adaptation to integrate them and synthesize a conceptual framework illustrating their dynamic interplay. This leads to consideration of how institutions, urban governance, and the practice of planning are involved, and evolving, in shaping climate adaptation efforts. While examining the practice of adaptation planning is useful in framing how core climate change concepts are related, the role of institutional processes in shaping and defining these concepts-and adaptation planning itself-remains complex. Our framework presents a useful tool for approaching and improving an understanding of the interactive relationships of central climate change adaptation concepts, with implications for future work focused on change within the domains of planning and institutions addressing challenges in the climate change era.","[Kauffman, Nate; Hill, Kristina] Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Environm Design, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Kauffman, N; Hill, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Environm Design, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",natekauffman@berkeley.edu; kzhill@berkeley.edu,,"Hill, Kristina/0000-0002-4601-0760",,,,,273,4,4,16,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2021,13,19,,,,,,,10708,10.3390/su131910708,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su131910708,,,28,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YZ9GL,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000755778000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we took the high-frigid ecological vulnerable areas on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau as an example. Based on household survey data, we explored the impacts of social networks, social trust and social norms on the choice of climate change adaptation strategies for farmers. Results show that more than 80% of farmers adopt the necessary climate change adaptation strategies. Early transferring/adjusting farming season, artificial grass planting and reducing livestock are their major adaptation strategies. There are significant differences in adopting climate change adaptation strategies between farmers with different social networks, social trust and social norms. The improvements of formal social networks, interpersonal trust, institutional trust, and social norms have significant impacts on the choice of climate change adaptation strategies for farmers. However, the enhancement of informal social networks has a negative impact on it.

We examine the myriad ways in which climate change adaptation policies and strategies are developed, and we systematically discuss the factors which either facilitate or hamper the involvement of all stakeholders in the development of these intervention measures. Our findings indicate that women seem to be the group of people who are mostly unaware of community initiatives, policies, and strategies for the adaptation to climate change. Thus, it is argued that, although South Africa has developed good climate change initiatives, policies, and strategies, the implementation of these policies seems to present difficulties, as those for whom they have been developed do not seem to have any knowledge of their effectiveness in helping them build resilience against extreme weather events.

It distinguishes between various leadership functions which together contribute to climate change adaptation: the political-administrative, adaptive, enabling, connective, and dissemination functions. Each function requires the execution of specific leadership tasks which can be performed by different types of leaders, such as positional leaders, ideational leaders, sponsors, boundary workers, policy entrepreneurs, or champions. The framework can be used to analyze or monitor the emergence and realization of specific leadership functions and to specify the need for strengthening particular functions in practices of climate adaptation.","[Meijerink, Sander] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Stiller, Sabina] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Wageningen University & Research,"Stiller, S (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",S.Meijerink@fm.ru.nl; Sabina.Stiller@wur.nl,"Meijerink, Sander V/D-6490-2012","Meijerink, Sander V/0000-0002-4249-6230",,,,,49,43,43,1,57,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-774X,1472-3425,,ENVIRON PLANN C,Environ.

In both countries, the national impetus for local adaptation is weak; it is largely left to local actors to take the initiative. The dynamics of the different approaches to climate-change adaptation at the local level are illuminated. Using decision-making and learning theory, we present an analytical framework to examine four cases, two in Norway and two in Denmark, which represent two different responses, i.e. anticipatory actions and obligatory actions. We find that, by bringing in knowledge and resources and engaging in persuasive communication across sectors, the presence of institutional entrepreneurs in the adaptation process plays a key role in building legitimacy for anticipatory action in the municipal organisation.","[Wejs, Anja; Larsen, Sanne Vammen] Aalborg Univ, Danish Ctr Environm Assessment, Dept Dev & Planning, Aalborg, Denmark; [Harvold, Kjell] Norwegian Inst Urban & Reg Res, Oslo, Norway; [Saglie, Inger-Lise] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, As, Norway",Aalborg University; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Harvold, K (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Urban & Reg Res, Oslo, Norway.",kjell.harvold@nibr.no,,"Wejs, Anja/0000-0002-6723-646X",,,,,48,23,23,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

Because the need to learn increases in circumstances of greater uncertainty such as the case of climate change, one of the processes that can explain different levels of anticipatory adaptation to climate change (AACC) by companies is OL. Design/methodology/approach - The research uses a case study design. Following the procedures of qualitative sampling, an exemplary case of organizational adaptation to climate change in a sector that is extremely affected by the impacts of weather events was chosen. Empirical data collection includes semi-structured interviews and the collection of private and public documents. Such data were analyzed through thematic analysis. Findings - The process of OL for anticipatory adaptation to climate change presents substantial differences from the traditional OL process presented by the specialized literature. In particular, the concepts of single-and double-loop learning were challenging to fit into the learning processes required for AACC. Originality/value - Organizations have historically been working towards the adaption to external unforeseen events, but anticipatory adaptation to climate change presents new challenges and requires new forms of learning. Previous research has examined the interplay between learning and climate change adaptation, especially at the inter-organizational level. By developing research at the organizational level, this paper addresses a gap in the literature and shows that the required learning to adapt to climate change differs from the traditional learning, described in the management literature.","[Orsato, Renato J.] FGV, Sao Paulo Sch Management, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Barakat, Simone R.; de Campos, Jose Guilherme F.] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Management & Accounting, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Barakat, SR (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Management & Accounting, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",simonebarakat@usp.br,"Barakat, Simone R./AAA-4435-2020; ORSATO, R.

Farmers have to simultaneously adapt to multiple changes. Therefore, also empirical climate change adaptation research needs a more integrative perspective on real-life climate change adaptations. This also has to consider hidden adaptations, which are not explicitly and directly motivated by CCA but actually contribute to the sector's adaptability to climate change. The aim of the present study is to develop and test an analytic framework that contributes to a broader understanding of CCA and to bridge the gap between scientific expertise and practical action. The framework distinguishes three types of CCA according to their climate related motivations: explicit adaptations, multi-purpose adaptations, and hidden adaptations. Although agriculture is among the sectors that are most affected by climate change, results from the case study of Tyrolean mountain agriculture show that climate change is ranked behind other more pressing real-life-challenges such as changing agricultural policies or market conditions. We identified numerous hidden adaptations which make a valuable contribution when dealing with climate change impacts. We conclude that these hidden adaptations have not only to be considered to get an integrative und more realistic view on CCA; they also provide a great opportunity for linking adaptation strategies to farmers' realities.","[Grueneis, Heidelinde; Penker, Marianne] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Vienna, Austria; [Grueneis, Heidelinde; Hoeferl, Karl-Michael] alpS GmbH, Innsbruck, Austria; [Hoeferl, Karl-Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innsbruck, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Innsbruck","Gruneis, H (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Vienna, Austria.;Gruneis, H (corresponding author), alpS GmbH, Innsbruck, Austria.",grueneis@alps-gmbh.com,,"Penker, Marianne/0000-0002-5185-9558",COMET program of FFG (Austrian Research Promotion Agency) within the alpS - Centre for Climate Change Adaptation Technologies,COMET program of FFG (Austrian Research Promotion Agency) within the alpS - Centre for Climate Change Adaptation Technologies,This research was funded by the COMET program of FFG (Austrian Research Promotion Agency) within the alpS - Centre for Climate Change Adaptation Technologies.,,69,14,14,5,30,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2193-1801,,,SPRINGERPLUS,SpringerPlus,OCT 22,2016,5,,,,,,,,1848,10.1186/s40064-016-3542-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-3542-1,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,EH5KG,27818886,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000391811300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Effective adaptation to climate change depends not only on whether households or communities adopt appropriate adaptation strategies but also on whether governments intervene effectively. To improve the understanding of the role of government interventions in households' climate adaptation pro-cesses, we propose a climate adaptation framework that takes government interventions into consideration at the household level. Based on a household survey in the Pumqu River Basin on the Tibetan Plateau, we discuss the impacts of government interventions on households' climate change adaptation. The results show that govern-ment interventions have: 1) buffered the risks and shocks of climate change to households' livelihoods; 2) shaped households' cognitions of climate change; 3) mediated the impact of households' livelihoods and climate change cognitions on their adaptation strategies; and 4) directly influenced households' livelihoods and their choices of climate adaptation strategies. Our findings emphasize the interfaces between government interventions and household adaptation, which not only helps governments clarify some principles when planning climate in-terventions but also has important implications for them to better guide households to adapt to climate change.","[He, Xinjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [He, Xinjun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jianzhong; Zhou, Hong; Wu, Ya; Wu, Shihai] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Yang, Liang Emlyn] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany; [Yan, Jianzhong] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, 1 Tiansheng Rd, Beibei Dist, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Mountain Hazards & Environment, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Southwest University - China; University of Munich; Southwest University - China","Yan, JZ (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.",yanjz@swu.edu.cn,"He, Xinjun/GXV-2399-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171098]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0603]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20040201],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42171098) , the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (No. 2019QZKK0603) , and the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDA20040201) .",,89,1,1,20,20,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,1873-1392,,J RURAL STUD,J.

While many studies have explored barriers that stand in the way of their implementation, the factors determining their potential to mainstream adaptation into various sectors are less clear. In the present paper, we aim to address this gap for two international, six national, and six local adaptation strategies. Based on document analyses and 35 semi-structured interviews, the 14 case studies also explore in how far the factors facilitating climate change adaptation are similar across levels of government or level-specific. Although located at three different levels of government, we find that the 14 adaptation strategies analyzed here represent one-size-fits-all governance arrangements that are characterized by voluntariness and a lack institutionalization. Since adaptation strategies are relatively weak coordination hubs that are unable to force adaptation onto sectoral policy agendas, they rely mainly on sectoral self-interest in adapting to climate change, largely determined by problem pressure. We conclude that one-size-fits-all governance arrangements are rarely adequate responses to complex challenges, such as climate change. Although climate change adaptation depends more on framework conditions such as problem pressure than on administrative or governance features, the findings presented here can help to understand under what circumstances adaptation is likely to make progress.","[Clar, Christoph; Steurer, Reinhard] BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, InFER Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Clar, C (corresponding author), BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, InFER Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",christoph.clar@boku.ac.at; reinhard.steurer@boku.ac.at,,"Clar, Christoph/0000-0003-3556-8256",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) [KR15AC8K12542]; German Environment Agency (UFOPLAN) [FKZ 3713 48 101],Austrian Climate and Energy Fund within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP); German Environment Agency (UFOPLAN),"We thank the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP; Project No KR15AC8K12542) and the German Environment Agency (UFOPLAN, FKZ 3713 48 101) for funding the research projects that led to this paper.",,74,11,11,6,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0165-0203,1477-8947,,NAT RESOUR FORUM,Nat.

The present paper analyses the role of regional adaptation partnerships in Canada and England in the multi-level governance of climate change adaptation. We describe and compare three partnerships per country with regard to their evolution, membership and governing structures, coordination across levels and societal domains, and their adaptation activities and outputs. Although both partnership schemes represent new collaborative approaches, their genesis and governance differ. While the Canadian collaboratives are a government-centred approach that originated and partly operated top-down through a national programme for the period 2009-2012, the English partnerships follow a more pluralistic stakeholder-centred approach that evolved bottom-up already in the early 2000s. Both schemes have in common that they mediate between governmental levels, foster networking between public and private actors, and eventually build adaptive capacities and inform adaptation policies. We conclude that regional adaptation partnerships represent a new governance approach that facilitates climate change adaptation, albeit with limits. Since state actors play(ed) key roles in both partnership schemes, they do not represent a new sphere of authority outside the state. Instead of blurring or destabilizing governmental levels they complement (and perhaps even stabilise) them with multi-level interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet while the risk is clear, with climate impacts occurring there more rapidly than many regions on Earth, integrated policy and planning for climate adaptation often remains a low priority for decision-makers. In an effort to extend the discussion and contribute to scholarship in this area, this paper explores climate change stressors and policy response in the coastal town Nome, Alaska. Through narratives of local government key actors and informed by strategic planning documents, this study sheds light on the decision dynamics around local climate change actions as well as preparedness for climate variability in general. In particular, this work highlights that thinning sea ice and thawing permafrost are both having an influence on life in Nome. Yet climate change adaptation remains a low priority for decision-makers, with the link to strategic policy often peripheral and not solutions orientated. As Nome is not unique in its need to adapt to climate change, findings from this work may provide communities experiencing similar climate stressors with awareness for the importance of incorporating adaptation thinking with long-term strategic policy and planning.","[Birchall, S.

In this paper, I present an in-depth case study to demonstrate how the persistence of gender-based inequality in community forestry has, or is likely to have, impacted the possibility to adapt to climate change, and then also reshape gender relations in adaptation interventions. Based on this, I argue that adaptation initiatives which rest on existing gender inequitable forest management institutions are likely to exacerbate gender-based inequality, further hampering the longer-term socio-ecological resilience. Although gender inequality is not created solely either by forestry institutions or in the institutions designed for climate adaptation, community forestry institutions are increasingly reinforcing the larger patriarchal societal structure that is deeply rooted and manifested in everyday practices. I highlight the need for both forest management and adaptation policies and practices to better recognize, appreciate and address gender inequality. In order to enhance gender-equitable adaptation to climate change, I suggest re-examining and constantly monitoring the changing gender in/equality in the existing forest management institutions and service delivery mechanisms and also adjusting adaptation planning to fully harness the potential of gender equitable forest management and climate change adaptation.","[Bhattarai, Basundhara] Inst Study & Dev Worldwide IFSD, 8-30 Hornsey Rd, Sydney, NSW 2140, Australia",,"Bhattarai, B (corresponding author), Inst Study & Dev Worldwide IFSD, 8-30 Hornsey Rd, Sydney, NSW 2140, Australia.",basu.bhattarai@ifsd.com.au,,,,,,,62,8,8,2,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Therefore, this study analyses the impact of climate change adaptation on productivity for annual crops in Central Chile using a stochastic production frontier approach. The data come from a random sample of 265 farms located in four municipalities with different agro-climatic conditions. To measure climate change adaptation, a set of 14 practices was used in three different specifications: binary variable, count and index; representing decision, intensity and quality of adaptation, respectively. The aforementioned alternative variables were used in three different stochastic production frontier models. Results suggest that the use of adaptive practices had a significant and positive effect on productivity; the practice with the highest impact on productivity was irrigation improvement. Empirical results demonstrate the relevance of climate change adaptation on farmers' productivity and enrich the discussion regarding the need to implement adaptation measures.","[Roco, Lisandro] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile; [Roco, Lisandro] Univ Catolica Norte, Inst Appl Reg Econ IDEAR, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris; Engler, Alejandra; Jara-Rojas, Roberto] Univ Talca, Dept Agr Econ, Talca 3460000, Chile; [Engler, Alejandra; Jara-Rojas, Roberto] Ctr Socioecon Impact Environm Policies CESIEP, Talca 3460000, Chile",Universidad Catolica del Norte; Universidad Catolica del Norte; University of Connecticut; Universidad de Talca,"Roco, L (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.;Roco, L (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Inst Appl Reg Econ IDEAR, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.",lisandro.roco@ucn.cl; boris.bravoureta@uconn.edu; mengler@utalca.cl; rjara@utalca.cl,"Roco, Lisandro/ABE-7011-2020; Jara-Rojas, Roberto/AAY-3810-2021","Roco, Lisandro/0000-0002-6267-8461; Engler, Alejandra/0000-0002-8154-5971; Jara-Rojas, Roberto/0000-0001-5693-0037",Latin American and Caribbean Environmental Economics Program (LACEEP),Latin American and Caribbean Environmental Economics Program (LACEEP),This work was supported by a research grant from The Latin American and Caribbean Environmental Economics Program (LACEEP).

Climate-driven impacts have resulted in distribution shifts and declines in abundance of important fisheries targets, with negative consequences to the users dependent on these resources. The sustainability of the sector depends on its readiness to adapt to climate change. The inclusion of climate change impacts and adaptation in fisheries management documents in South Africa is essential to ensure adequate climate adaptation responses are implemented at the short- and long-term. This study aims to 1) determine if the relevant fisheries national management documents address climate change and adaptation, 2) determine if the relevant national climate change documents address climate change and adaptation in the fisheries sector and 3) evaluate the extent to which fisheries management documents address climate change and adaptation. A content analysis of fisheries management and climate change documents was carried out to determine if they incorporated information on climate change impacts and adaptation and marine fisheries respectively. Fisheries management documents were then screened against nine pre-determined criteria (or themes) based on climate change adaptation to determine the level of inclusion of best practice for climate change adaptation. Results indicate that climate change impacts and adaptation are rarely incorporated in the main fisheries management documents, except for the Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Plan for the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors. However, this document is still waiting to be adopted. The only direct reference identified in all the fisheries documents that supports climate change adaptation was 'conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity'. With regards to indirect references to climate change adaptation, 'equity,' 'participatory management,' and 'capacity building' were most frequently incorporated in fisheries management documents. There is a need to explicitly incorporate information on climate change impacts and adaptation in South African fisheries management documents and increase the human and financial capacity at national institutions to ensure that the fisheries sector can adequately adapt to climate change.","[Ortega-Cisneros, Kelly] Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, Cape Town, South Africa; [Ortega-Cisneros, Kelly; Cochrane, Kevern L.; Sauer, Warwick H.

Regarding perception barriers, some authors keep highlighting the confused definition of adaptation and its various interpretations. Our research contributes to this area by exploring how adaptation to climate change is perceived through 83 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (public and municipal organizations, ENGO, private sector) from Montreal and Paris. Our results demonstrate a mirror opposition in the perception of adaptation to climate change. Indeed, while several respondents interpreted adaptation as a resignation, many interviewees perceived adaptation as an opportunity. The analysis showed that adaptation referring to resignation includes the ideas of a non-action and detrimental to mitigation; an excuse for not changing; anxiety about climate change; fatalism; and human failure. Adaptation perceived as an opportunity is divided into a source of creativity; toward sustainable development; led by the emergency; and awareness and making society of its responsibilities. Our findings confirm that terminological ambiguity of the term adaptation has to be considered in the decision-making process, which can be influenced by the perception of stakeholders.","[Simonet, Guillaume] CDC Climat Rech, Unit Subnat Climate Policies, Paris, France; [Simonet, Guillaume] Observ Midi Pyrenees, GET UMR5563, 14 Rue Edouard Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Fatoric, Sandra] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Dept Geog, Bldg B,Campus UAB,Cerdanyola Valles, Barcelona 08193, Spain",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Simonet, G (corresponding author), CDC Climat Rech, Unit Subnat Climate Policies, Paris, France.;Simonet, G (corresponding author), Observ Midi Pyrenees, GET UMR5563, 14 Rue Edouard Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France.",guillaume.simonet@cdcclimat.com; sandra.fatoric@uab.es,,"Fatoric, Sandra/0000-0002-3712-0749",,,,,54,16,18,1,39,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The lack of political science expertise and research represents an obstacle for adapting to climate change, because adaptation is fundamentally political. Technical advances in adaptations for infrastructure, agriculture, public health, coastal protection, conservation, and other fields all depend on political variables for their implementation and effectiveness. For example, adaptation raises questions about political economy (adaptation costs money), political theory (adaptation involves questions of social justice), comparative politics (some countries more aggressively pursue adaptation), urban politics (some cities more aggressively pursue adaptation), regime type (democracies and authoritarian regimes may differently pursue adaptation), federalism (different levels of government may be involved), and several other fields of study including political conflict, international development, bureaucracy, migration, media, political parties, elections, civil society, and public opinion.

Methodology: The proposed conceptual framework was developed through a literature review. Results: A generic conceptual framework that could be used to assess the impact of adopted climate change adaptation strategies on nutrition outcomes was developed. The framework consists of 5 key elements: Agro-food system, context characteristics, adaptation strategies, climatic shocks and stress, and system output. The principles used in designing the conceptual framework include systems approach, contingency theory, and system output.

Objectives: Our goal was to review the literature on evidence-based public health (EBPH), to determine whether it can be applied to climate change adaptation, and to consider how emphasizing evidence-based practice may influence research and practice decisions related to public health adaptation to climate change. Methods: We conducted a substantive review of EBPH, identified a consensus EBPH framework, and modified it to support an EBPH approach to climate change adaptation. We applied the framework to an example and considered implications for stakeholders. Discussion: A modified EBPH framework can accommodate the wide range of exposures, outcomes, and modes of inquiry associated with climate change adaptation and the variety of settings in which adaptation activities will be pursued. Several factors currently limit application of the framework, including a lack of higher-level evidence of intervention efficacy and a lack of guidelines for reporting climate change health impact projections. To enhance the evidence base, there must be increased attention to designing, evaluating, and reporting adaptation interventions; standardized health impact projection reporting; and increased attention to knowledge translation. This approach has implications for funders, researchers, journal editors, practitioners, and policy makers. Conclusions: The current approach to EBPH can, with modifications, support climate change adaptation activities, but there is little evidence regarding interventions and knowledge translation, and guidelines for projecting health impacts are lacking. Realizing the goal of an evidence-based approach will require systematic, coordinated efforts among various stakeholders.","[Hess, Jeremy J.; Luber, George] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Environm Hlth, Div Environm Hazards & Hlth Effects, Climate & Hlth Program, Atlanta, GA USA; [Hess, Jeremy J.; Tlumak, Jennifer E.] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Hess, Jeremy J.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Emergency Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Eidson, Millicent] New York State Dept Hlth, Off Publ Hlth Practice, Albany, NY USA; [Eidson, Millicent] SUNY Albany, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Raab, Kristin K.] Minnesota Dept Hlth, Div Environm Hlth, St Paul, MN USA",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; Emory University; Rollins School Public Health; Emory University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Minnesota Department of Health (MHD),"Hess, JJ (corresponding author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Environm Hlth, Div Environm Hazards & Hlth Effects, Climate & Hlth Program, 4770 Buford Highway,MS F-59, Chamblee, GA 30341 USA.",jhess@emory.edu,,,,,,,97,47,47,5,49,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

Yet fundamental questions remain unanswered including, who is responsible for planned adaptation and when, who is liable for losses and damages resulting from climate change and how is responsibility distributed in a multilevel governance system? Responsibility can be evaluated in terms of the timing of particular events, the specific societal actors involved and the rules and norms used to attribute responsibility for dealing with those events. Four types of responsibility-care, liability, accountability, and responsiveness for adaptation-are identified, based on empirical studies and examples from the literature. This review demonstrates the need to further explore the normative implications of responsibility and how they should be considered in adaptation governance and policy.

An efficient endogenous switching regression model (ESRM) was used to estimate the impact of climate change adaptation strategy on the net income of rice farmers. The MVP results show that the socio-economic factors, the institutional factors, and locational variables of some households statistically influenced the choice of climate change adaptation strategies employed. Complementarities among all the adaptation strategies used by the farmers were revealed by the positive pair-wise correlation matrix of the MVP model. The study also indicated that farmers affected by prolonged drought and incidences of flood were more likely to adopt adaptation strategies on their farmlands. The ESRM treatment effect indicated that the average net income per rice farm of those who adopted the strategies was significantly higher than that of those who did not. Thus, the government, stakeholders, and donor agencies must provide capacity-building innovations related to agricultural extension systems and climate change education through information and communication technologies. This investment in education is essential for development and would encourage farmers to adopt appropriate climate change adaptation strategies.","[Ojo, T. O.; Baiyegunhi, L. J.

Insights from a Watershed in Kenya,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,adaptation; climate change; climate variability; payments for ecosystem services; watershed,ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; POVERTY; EVOLUTION,"Climate change presents new challenges for the management of social-ecological systems and the ecosystem services they provide. Although the instrument of payments for ecosystem services (PES) has emerged as a promising tool to safeguard or enhance the provision of ecosystem services (ES), little attention has been paid to the potential role of PES in climate change adaptation. As an external stressor climate change has an impact on the social-ecological system in which PES takes place, including the various actors taking part in the PES scheme. Following a short description of the conceptual link between PES and adaptation to climate change, we provide practical insights into the relationship between PES and adaptation to climate change by presenting results from a case study of a rural watershed in Kenya. Drawing upon the results of a participatory vulnerability assessment among potential ecosystem service providers in Sasumua watershed north of Nairobi, we show that PES can play a role in enhancing adaptation to climate change by influencing certain elements of adaptive capacity and incentivizing adaptation measures. In addition, trade-offs and synergies between proposed measures under PES and adaptation to climate change are identified. Results show that although it may not be possible to establish PES schemes based on water utilities as the sole source of financing, embedding PES in a wider adaptation framework creates an opportunity for the development of watershed PES schemes in Africa and ensures their sustainability. We conclude that there is a need to embed PES in a wider institutional framework and that extra financial resources are needed to foster greater integration between PES and adaptation to climate change. This can be achieved through scaling up PES by bringing in other buyers and additional ecosystem services. PES can achieve important coadaptation benefits, but for more effective adaptation outcomes it needs to be combined with vulnerability assessments and climate scenarios to ensure that these are realized and potential trade-offs between PES measures and adaptation measures minimized.","[van de Sand, Isabel] Dept Int Dev DFID, London, England; [van de Sand, Isabel] Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany; [van de Sand, Isabel; Mwangi, John K.; Namirembe, Sara] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mwangi, John K.] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Nairobi, Kenya",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology,"van de Sand, I (corresponding author), Dept Int Dev DFID, London, England.",,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF),German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF),"An earlier version of this article was presented at the Economics of Ecosystem and Biodiversity TEEB Conference 2012 in Leipzig in March 2012 and we are grateful for the feedback received from the participants of the conference.

This study examines the perceptions and attitudes of small family farmers toward climate change and identifies adaptation strategies supporting household food security in the Middle Eastern context, Lebanon. The study uses cross-sectional, primary data of households that own small family farms in the Central Bekaa region. The results show that the majority of the households believe that climate change is occurring, has adverse impacts on livelihoods, and is attributable to human factors. They perceived an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfall patterns over the last 20 years. In response, the households used multiple agricultural practices to adapt to climate change. Based on the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) scores, only 7.5% of the households were food secure, while 89% were mild to moderately food insecure. Generally, the households had modest access to nutritious diets. All the households used two or more environmentally sustainable agricultural practices. However, the use of multiple environmentally sustainable practices did not correlate with improved food security. This latter result may be due to the limited knowledge of the farmers about trade-offs between various climate change adaptation measures. The findings suggest the need to refocus research from the question of whether small family farmers are willing to adopt (or not) climate change adaptation practices to identifying those practices that are capable of balancing economic, social, and environmental goals in a specific context.","[Al Dirani, Aliaa; Bahn, Rachel A.; Martiniello, Giuliano; Bashour, Isam] Amer Univ Beirut, Fac Agr & Food Sci, POB 11-0236 Riad El Solh, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon; [Abebe, Gumataw Kifle] Dalhousie Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Business & Social Sci, POB 550, Truro, NS, Canada; [Martiniello, Giuliano] Univ Int Rabat, Coll Law & Polit & Social Sci, Sci Po Rabat, Rabat, Morocco",American University of Beirut; Dalhousie University; Universite Internationale de Rabat,"Abebe, GK (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Business & Social Sci, POB 550, Truro, NS, Canada.",aliaa.aldirani@gmail.com; gumataw@gmail.com; rb89@aub.edu.lb; giuliano.martiniello@uir.ac.ma; iibashour@gmail.com,"Abebe, Gumataw Kifle/I-1595-2019; Bahn, Rachel/S-8248-2019; Abebe, Gumataw Kifle/AHD-8200-2022","Abebe, Gumataw Kifle/0000-0002-8045-9027; Bahn, Rachel/0000-0002-2277-6585; ",,,,,85,4,4,4,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1876-4517,1876-4525,,FOOD SECUR,Food Secur.,AUG,2021,13,4,,,SI,,1029,1047,,10.1007/s12571-021-01188-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-021-01188-2,,JUN 2021,19,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Food Science & Technology,TT0XP,34221190,"Bronze, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000666832900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Collaboration allows cities to pool resources and work across boundaries to ameliorate problems, such as climate change. However, little is known about why and how collaborative governance may lead to better outputs and outcomes. Using the case of climate change adaptation in U.S. cities, this study seeks to understand collaborative governance better and its effects on sea level rise preparedness.

This means also that the mainstreaming process needs to occur locally. This article examines the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into existing sectors in five Norwegian municipalities. Applying theories of mainstreaming and policy integration we find that policy development is slower, but perhaps more robust in the municipalities that have chosen a horizontal, cross-sectoral approach to mainstreaming than in the municipalities that have chosen a vertical sector approach to mainstreaming.","[Rauken, Trude] CICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Mydske, Per Kristen] Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Winsvold, Marte] Norwegian Inst Urban & Reg Res, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Rauken, T (corresponding author), CICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",trude.rauken@cicero.uio.no,,,,,,,48,87,87,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2015,20,4,,,SI,,408,423,,10.1080/13549839.2014.880412,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2014.880412,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,V79WX,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000212146200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many SIDS recognize that adequate and effective adaptation to climate change are important components of sustainable development and, as such, are pursuing climate change adaptation policies and programs at the national level. Chapter 29 (Small Islands) of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that more needs to be learnt about how climate change mainstreaming can be practically achieved in these countries. Working within a resilience framework and interviewing senior government and regional organization officials from Caribbean and Pacific SIDS, this paper aims to understand the drivers of, and barriers to adaptation mainstreaming at the national level. In doing this, it finds multiple drivers - the three most commonly reported are institutional/organizational, 'champions'/personalities/informal networks and risk and exposure. It also finds multiple barriers - the three most commonly reported are competing development priorities, poor planning/governance and insufficient manpower/human resources. Building on this knowledge, this paper then proposes a seven-step process towards practically achieving mainstreaming in SIDS, which can be used by national governments and regional organizations to guide their actions in this regard.","[Robinson, Stacy-ann] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Robinson, Stacy-ann] Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Australian National University; Brown University,"Robinson, SA (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;Robinson, SA (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",stacy-ann.robinson@anu.edu.au,"Robinson, Stacy-ann/R-2769-2019","Robinson, Stacy-ann/0000-0003-3163-8771",Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University,Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade(Australian Government); Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University,"This work was financially supported by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University; A/Prof Jamie Pittock and two anonymous reviewers provided helpful comments on previous drafts; senior policy-makers in the Caribbean and Pacific offered their time and perspectives; Donnie de Freitas, Dr Ian Fry, Jerome Smith and Teshia Jn Baptiste helped to organize interviews; Candice Gordon Williams, Sedonnie Brown-Richards and Qing Guan provided research assistance early in the research process; Caroline Wenger, Hannah Barrowman and Dr Tony Weir offered insights and suggestions; and Daniel Ferris did the proofreading.

However, islands also feature a high degree of resilience through resources from dense social networks, such as collective action, norms of reciprocity, and relations of trust. Therefore, we argue that these resources generally defined as social capital are particularly relevant for climate change adaptation on small islands. Current research on the role of social capital for communities covers many different aspects, such as local knowledge, economic development, and political capacity. But effective adaptation relies on understanding the role of social capital for these aspects in connection to the specific impacts of climate change a holistic approach is needed. Based on empirical case studies we developed an analytical framework that provides a step-by-step approach to help analyse the potential of social capital for the adaptation to climate change in island-specific case studies. These steps, among others, include an assessment of social capital, hazard mapping, and the analysis of political and economic capacity. Moreover, the framework suggests methods on how to analyse these steps. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Petzold, Jan; Ratter, Beate M.

Adaptation scientists are increasingly using future visioning exercises embedded in co-production and codevelopment techniques to assist stakeholders in imagining futures in a changing climate. Even if these exercises are growing in popularity, surprisingly little scrutiny has been placed on understanding the fundamental assumptions and choices in scenario approaches, timeframes, scales, or methods, and whether they result in meaningful changes in how adaptation is being thought about. Here, we unpack key insights and experiences across 62 case studies that specifically report on using future visioning exercises to engage stakeholders in climate change adaptation. We focus on three key areas: 1) Stakeholder diversity and scales; 2) Tools, methods, and data, and 3) Practical constraints, enablers, and outcomes. Our results show that most studies focus on the regional scale (n = 32; 52%), involve mainly formal decision makers and employ vast array of different methods, tools, and data. Interestingly, most exercises adopt either predictive (what will happen) and explorative (what could happen) scenarios while only a fraction use the more normative (what should happen) scenarios that could enable more transformative thinking. Reported positive outcomes include demonstrated increases in climate change literacy and support for climate change adaptation planning. Unintended and unexpected outcomes include increased anxiety in cases where introduced timeframes go beyond an individual's expected life span and decreased perceived necessity for undertaking adaptation at all. Key agreed factors that underpin co-production and equal representation, such as gender, age, and diversity, are not well reported, and most case studies do not use reflective processes to harness participant feedback that could enable more robust methodology development. This is a missed opportunity in developing a more fundamental understanding of how these exercises can effectively shift individual and collective mindsets and advance the inclusion of different viewpoints as a pathway for more equitable and just climate adaptation.","[Nalau, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Adaptat Sci Res Grp, Gold Coast Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4222, Australia; [Nalau, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4222, Australia; [Cobb, Gemma] Griffith Univ, Ctr Planetary Hlth & Food Secur, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Adaptat Sci Res Grp, Gold Coast Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4222, Australia.;Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4222, Australia.",j.nalau@griffith.edu.au,"Nalau, Johanna/V-5692-2018","Nalau, Johanna/0000-0001-6581-3967",Australian Research Council?s Discovery Early Career Research Award [DE190100940]; Australian Research Council [DE190100940] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council?s Discovery Early Career Research Award(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Funding source This research has been funded by the Australian Research Council?s Discovery Early Career Research Award (Grant number DE190100940) held by Dr. Johanna Nalau.,,123,3,3,11,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

While neither climate change nor water respects national borders, adaptation in water management should be treated as a transboundary water governance issue. However, transboundary water management is, in essence, more complex than national water management because the water management regimes usually differ more between countries than within countries. This paper provides 63 lessons learned from almost a decade of cooperation on transboundary climate adaptation in water management under the UNECE Water Convention and puts these into the context of the OECD principles on water governance. It highlights that good water governance entails a variety of activities that are intertwined and cannot be considered stand-alone elements. The paper also shows that this wide variety of actions is needed to develop a climate change adaptation strategy in water management. Each of the lessons learned can be considered concrete actions connected to one or more of the OECD principles, where a range of actions may be needed to fulfil one principle. The paper concludes that developing climate change adaptation measures needs to improve in parallel the water governance system at transboundary scale.","[Timmerman, Jos] Wageningen Environm Res, Droevendaalsesteeg 3,POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Matthews, John] AGWA, 7640 NW Hoodview Circle, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA; [Koeppel, Sonja] United Nations Econ Commiss Europe, Environm Div, Water Convent, Palais Nations 8-14,Ave Paix, CH-1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland; [Valensuela, Daniel] Int Network Basin Org, 21 Rue Madrid, F-75008 Paris, France; [Vlaanderen, Niels] Minist Infrastruct & Environm, POB 20904, NL-2500 EX The Hague, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Timmerman, J (corresponding author), Wageningen Environm Res, Droevendaalsesteeg 3,POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",jos.timmerman@wur.nl,"Timmerman, Jos/AAR-8238-2021","Timmerman, Jos/0000-0002-3421-2103",,,,,57,6,6,1,35,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1366-7017,,,WATER POLICY,Water Policy,NOV,2017,19,6,,,,,1014,1029,,10.2166/wp.2017.156,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wp.2017.156,,,16,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,FM8NI,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000415345400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their willingness and capacity to adopt improved practices and technologies, their cognitive and behavioural preferences, and the institutional response mechanisms will go a long way in determining their success in their adaptation to climate change. This study presents results of an analysis of the vulnerabilities of smallholder coffee producers in Nicaragua to climate change. I use descriptive analyses and experimental risk games to evaluate the preferences and attitudes of coffee producers in the context of their adaptation to climate change. I show that food insecure households are more risk-averse than food-secure households and that much work is needed in the sector to ensure equity and improve institutional capacity. For households in chronic poverty, conventional risk management strategies simply may not be enough. Institutional arrangements must be put in place to enable coffee-growing households to engage in practices that result in improved capacity for climate change adaptation.","[Bro, Aniseh S.] Appalachian State Univ, Living Learning Ctr, Sustainable Dev Dept, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Bro, AS (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Living Learning Ctr, Sustainable Dev Dept, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",broas@appstate.edu,,,United States Agency for International Development [RC104408],United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),This research was funded by United States Agency for International Development: RC104408.,,65,3,3,3,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,12,17,,,,,,,6946,10.3390/su12176946,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12176946,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NP7JU,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000570349600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Few studies have examined climate adaptation for livestock with even fewer looking at small animals such as poultry. Heat stress associated with climate change is a severe challenge to poultry farmers due to its negative effect on chicken growth and productivity. As poultry plays an important food security role across Africa (being a source of livelihood and an important source of animal protein), understanding how farmers deal with the realities of poultry production due to climate change is critical. This study explores the level and determinants of the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among poultry farmers in Nigeria. A multivariate probit analysis (which allows for the possibility that the decision to adopt various practices are jointly made) reveals that while poultry farmers are adapting to climate change, there is a clear heterogeneity of adaptation strategies at different production scales. Small farms tend to invest in traditional strategies such as the stocking of local breeds while medium and large farms adopt modern technologies such as air and water ventilation as well as the use of low energy bulbs that emit less heat. Our study finds that farmers who have experienced heat-related losses are more likely to adopt modern practices and more likely to adopt multiple adaptation strategies concurrently.","[Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis Saweda O.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Sanou, Awa] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Tambo, Justice A.] CABI, Rue Grillons 1, CH-2800 Delemont, Switzerland",Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Liverpool-Tasie, LSO (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",lliverp@msu.edu,,"Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis/0000-0002-2990-5888",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Nigeria's Feed the Future Nigeria Agricultural Policy Project; MSU AgBio Research; CABI,United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Nigeria's Feed the Future Nigeria Agricultural Policy Project(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); MSU AgBio Research; CABI,The authors acknowledge and appreciate financial support for this work from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Nigeria's Feed the Future Nigeria Agricultural Policy Project and MSU AgBio Research.

This paper explores the climate science-to-planning practice disconnect in the context of climate change adaptation in Southeast Asian cities generally, and Manila, Philippines specifically. We pose two simple, but important, questions: (1) what information do planning practitioners currently use to develop adaptive urban responses to climate change; and, (2) what additional knowledge and resources do planning practitioners need to effectively plan for climate change in the future? Survey and interview data collected across the Philippines suggest that planning professionals perceive access to, and sharing of, information as critical issues. Moreover, planning professionals contend that challenges with financial, technical, and staff resources, which have been perennial challenges of environmental management in Southeast Asia, persist despite significant new funding specifically earmarked for climate change adaptation. The climate science-to-practice disconnect, however, should be viewed as more than just an information/allocation deficit. Incomplete decentralization, haphazard urbanization, and the privatization of planning thwart attempts to translate climate science to planning practice in globalizing cities. As such, we argue that planning for adaptation to climate change requires more than just more and better information. It requires tackling the fundamental contradictions of planning in complex, globalizing cities.","[Mitchell, Carrie L.; Laycock, Katherine E.] Univ Waterloo, Sch Planning, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Mitchell, CL (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Sch Planning, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",carrie.mitchell@uwaterloo.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC); International Development Research Centre (IDRC) [106372-001],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); International Development Research Centre (IDRC),This work was supported through a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) [grant number 106372-001].,,74,8,8,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

To cope with climate change, many countries have employed various policies and measures to reduce damage due to climate change. For individual residents, adaptation behaviour is vital for reducing individual welfare losses. This research analysed how psychological determinants and other external factors influence residents' intention to adapt to climate change. We proposed an extended protection motivation theory (PMT) model, developed a reliable scale and conducted a nationwide field survey. We interviewed 1402 residents in 29 provinces, and 874 valid questionnaires were collected, providing data that were used in a structural equation model. The results show that our model can serve as a reliable framework for analysing the determinants of residents' intention to adapt to climate change. Policy is the most important factor for stimulating the formation of residents' adaptation intention. Risk appraisals and adaptation appraisals have positive and significant impacts on the intention of residents to adopt climate change adaptation behaviour. Information and climate perception do not directly influence residents' behavioural intentions but indirectly affect their intentions through the process of risk appraisal and adaptation appraisal.

This study looked at the success of organisations and the processes they employed for implementing policies that have implications for climate change adaptation in Malawi. This was done by assessing the linkages between different interest groups, as well as potential conflicts of interest between actors from the national to the local level. One of the major findings was that although national organisational and policy interventions seem to be well linked among various actors, community needs are mostly compromised. There is no effective communication between adaptation strategies which are proposed and the livelihood strategies in communities within the country. Local knowledge is given very little attention in formulating, communicating and implementing policies that have implications for adaptation to climate change.

It also exposes the weak links between different stakeholders and the subsequent lack of collective commitment.

Supplies of energy and water are required, and operations become hazardous during adverse weather events. Adapting to climate change takes three forms: incrementally improving the resilience of mining operations; transitioning to more inclusive governance through institutional and policy innovations; and more profound transformations that shift the balance of power, including profit-sharing, localized control or cessation of mining entirely. Clarifying adaptation pathways helps to identify priorities and inform policies for a fairer and more sustainable future for mining and the regions where it takes place. Technical summary Mining regions are strategically important in the response to climate change given advances in global governance and shifting risks at extraction sites. There are sustainability and justice considerations that offer critical lessons for the design of climate change adaptation in these regions. This article systematically reviews and evaluates the social and interdisciplinary science literature on adaptation to climate change in mining regions in order to identify the goals and scale of proposed solutions, their shortcomings and possible learning opportunities. The review employs a framework of adaptation pathways that distinguishes between incremental, transitional and transformational adaptation. In this way, it contributes to the growing literature on resource extraction and climate change adaptation by providing further understanding of how adaptation in mining regions can and does occur. The review finds a lack of clarity in how adaptive responses and behaviours are framed. Conceptual lenses need to be multi-scalar, dynamic and polycentric, with more empirical and practical work to identify how to enable adaptation in mining regions, not only through deploying technology, but also through better governance practices and more egalitarian power structures.","[Loginova, Julia] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Batterbury, Simon P.

Learning to shift towards sustainable development to successfully adapt to climate change is essential. The VACB (V garden/orchard; A fishing farm; C livestock farm; B biogas) model is considered one of the best approaches and methods to adapt to climate change in the VMD. This paper aims to explore the transformative social learning and sustainable development associated with this model in terms of agricultural transformation for sustainability to climate change adaptation in the VMD. The mixed methods approach that guided the data collection included focus group discussions, in-depth interviews with key informants and household surveys. Our findings show that there are three learning processes associated with transformative social learning linked to the VACB model: instrumental, communicative and emancipatory learning. Farmers reported increased knowledge and improved relationships and efficiency when applying the VACB model using several learning channels, both formal and informal. Farmers highlighted six factors that influenced transformative social learning during the adoption and development of the VACB model and several barriers to implementing adaptation strategies to climate change in an attempt to upscale the VACB model.","[Le Thi Hong Phuong] Hue Univ, Univ Agr & Forestry, Fac Extens & Rural Dev, Hue 530000, Vietnam; [Tran Duc Tuan] IRESD, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Tran Duc Tuan] Ctr Res & Promot Educ Sustainable Dev, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Nguyen Thi Ngoc Phuc] Can Tho Univ, Sch Educ, Can Tho 900000, Vietnam",Hue University; Nong Lam University; Can Tho University,"Phuong, LTH (corresponding author), Hue Univ, Univ Agr & Forestry, Fac Extens & Rural Dev, Hue 530000, Vietnam.",lethihongphuong@huaf.edu.vn,,,Swedish Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); National Research Foundation of South Africa [ISSC2015-TKN15031411514],Swedish Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),Swedish Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the National Research Foundation of South Africa (grant number ISSC2015-TKN15031411514).,,76,6,6,4,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2019,11,23,,,,,,,6775,10.3390/su11236775,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11236775,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KD9MV,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000508186400247,View Full Record in Web of Science

To reduce vulnerability of these regions, realizing context-specific impediments of robust adaptation to climate change is necessary. Also, it is imperative to consider anticipated transformations of agricultural systems that are required to enhance resilience of agriculture in coping with climate change. Therefore, this study aims to investigate major adaptation barriers in agriculture sector of Fars province, Iran. It also attempts to identify if any transformation from productivist agricultural systems is needed. To achieve these objectives, the group analytic hierarchy process was conducted with representatives from local government, academic institutes and farmers. The results revealed that local stakeholders prioritized barriers to adaptation, differently, and they showed various levels of concern about the importance of some barriers. However, they identified the governance and policy-related issues as the most important barriers. The results also indicated that transformational adaptation of agriculture sector from productivist to multifunctional farming system is required in order to enhance its resilience under uncertain climatic conditions. Some recommendations are offered to eliminate barriers of agricultural adaptation to climate change and also facilitate transformational adaptation of agriculture, in the developing world.","[Karimi, Vahid; Karami, Ezatollah; Karami, Shobeir] Shiraz Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Coll Agr, Shiraz, Iran; [Keshavarz, Marzieh] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Agr, POB 19395-3697, Tehran, Iran",Shiraz University; Payame Noor University,"Keshavarz, M (corresponding author), Payame Noor Univ, Dept Agr, POB 19395-3697, Tehran, Iran.",vakarimi69@gmail.com; ekarami@shirazu.ac.ir; shobeirkarami@gmail.com; keshavarzmarzieh@pnu.ac.ir,"karimi, vahid/ABF-4619-2020; Karami, Ezatollah/AAD-9535-2021","Marzieh, Keshavarz/0000-0002-0284-5635; karimi, vahid/0000-0003-0203-0652",,,,,90,4,4,4,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Our diagnostic approach moves from such analysis to focus on how the processes of adaptation and development of adaptive capacity can be structured to achieve desired outcomes. Using a well-grounded framework, the diagnostic approach moves from system description to characterization of challenges and opportunities, through two stages of analysis and validation, to the definition and embedding of adaptation options and pathways. The framework can include all contextually relevant variables and accommodate evaluation of adaptation outcomes and comparisons across scales and contexts. Such an approach can serve as a basis for enabling stakeholders to identify challenges and opportunities, and to explore and prioritize options for development and implementation of legitimate adaptation pathways.","[Leith, P.; Ogier, E.; Pecl, G.; Hoshino, E.; Davidson, J.; Haward, M.] Univ Tasmania, Adaptat Res Network Marine Biodivers & Resources, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Leith, P.] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Ogier, E.; Pecl, G.; Hoshino, E.; Haward, M.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Davidson, J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Leith, P (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Private Bag 98, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Peat.Leith@utas.edu.au,"Leith, Peat/ABB-2829-2021; Hoshino, Eriko/N-7557-2013; Haward, Marcus/G-3369-2014; Pecl, Gretta/D-7267-2011","Hoshino, Eriko/0000-0001-7110-4251; Haward, Marcus/0000-0003-4775-0864; Pecl, Gretta/0000-0003-0192-4339; Ogier, Emily/0000-0001-6157-5279",Australian Commonwealth Government,Australian Commonwealth Government(Australian Government),"The research on which this paper is based was conducted within the Adaptation Network for Marine Biodiversity and Resources, funded by the Australian Commonwealth Government.",,58,20,21,1,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

As the African continent struggles to adapt to climate change, a variety of measures are being pursued to alleviate the resultant pressures on people, properties and their livelihoods in several African cities. Collectively, they show that climate change adaptation in Africa is not as hopeless as widely claimed, and that there are some promising prospects. The literature shows a deficiency on studies which examine the extent to which climate change adaptation is being pursued in African cities. This paper addresses this need, and outlines some of the most important climate threats (e.g. increasing temperatures, droughts, sea level rise, sea and river flooding) and synergic non-climate factors, as well as recent progress made In respect of implementing climate change adaptation in African cities. Rather than adopt a general description of trends, this research focuses on concrete case studies from six major cities across the central, western, and eastern regions of the African continent (Douala, Lagos City, Dar-es-Salaam, Accra, Addis Ababa and Mombasa). The vulnerability and adaptive capacity status of the studied cities are discussed. Difficulties and challenges encountered in implementing adaptation policies in these areas are also highlighted. Furthermore, some successful examples of climate change adaptation initiatives in the surveyed cities are provided.

Results of the thematic analysis indicated that participating stakeholders were aware of the main climate risks threatening their cities (rising water levels and flooding, extreme temperatures, and air pollution). In addition, the interviewees talked about collaboration with other sectors, including the public health sector, in implementing climate change adaptation plans. However, the inclusion of the public health sector as a partner in the process was identified in only two cities, Navotas and Porto. Furthermore, the study found that there were few aspects pertaining to public health (water and sanitation, prevention of heat-related and water-borne diseases, and prevention of the consequences associated with heat waves in vulnerable groups such as children and elderly persons) in the latest climate change adaptation plans posted on each city's website. Moreover, participants pointed to different difficulties: insufficient financial resources, limited intersectoral collaboration for climate change adaptation, and lack of involvement of the public health sector in the adaptation processes, especially in one of the cities in which climate change adaptation was solely the responsibility of the urban planners. Studies using larger samples of stakeholders in larger cities are needed to better understand why the public health sector is still almost absent in efforts to adapt to climate change.","[Macassa, Gloria; Marttila, Anneli; Stal, Frida; Rashid, Mamunur] Univ Gavle, Fac Occupat & Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth & Sports Sci, Kungsbacksvagen 47, S-80176 Gavle, Sweden; [Macassa, Gloria; Ribeiro, Ana Isabel; Silva, Jose Pedro; Barros, Henrique] Univ Porto, EPI Unit Inst Saude Publ, Rua Taipas 135, P-4050600 Porto, Portugal; [Macassa, Gloria; Ribeiro, Ana Isabel; Silva, Jose Pedro; Barros, Henrique] Lab Invest & Integrat Translac Saude Populac I, Rua Taipas 135, P-4050600 Porto, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Ana Isabel; Barros, Henrique] Univ Porto, Dept Ciencias Saude Publ & Forenses & Educ Med, Fac Med, P-4200450 Porto, Portugal; [Rydback, Michelle] Univ Gavle, Dept Business & Econ Studies, Kungsbacksvagen 47, S-80176 Gavle, Sweden",University of Gavle; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; University of Gavle,"Macassa, G (corresponding author), Univ Gavle, Fac Occupat & Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth & Sports Sci, Kungsbacksvagen 47, S-80176 Gavle, Sweden.;Macassa, G (corresponding author), Univ Porto, EPI Unit Inst Saude Publ, Rua Taipas 135, P-4050600 Porto, Portugal.;Macassa, G (corresponding author), Lab Invest & Integrat Translac Saude Populac I, Rua Taipas 135, P-4050600 Porto, Portugal.",gloria.macassa@hig.se,"Ribeiro, Ana Cristina/HHN-7466-2022","Ribeiro, Ana Cristina/0000-0002-0493-8376; Rashid, Mamunur/0000-0001-7558-4168; Macassa, Gloria/0000-0003-4415-7942; Barros, Henrique/0000-0003-4699-6571; Ribeiro, Ana Isabel/0000-0001-8880-6962",,,,,95,1,1,6,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Based on a survey of 314 wheat farmers in rural China, results show that Chinese wheat farmers have a high rate of climate change awareness and adoption of climate change adaptation measures. Farmers' cultivated area, cognition level and information accessibility on climate change significantly affect their adaptation decisions. However, these farmers are given limited adaptation strategies, mainly including increasing irrigation, and using more chemical fertilizer and pesticides. Through employing a simultaneous equations model with endogenous switching, we find farmers' adaptation to climate change is maladaptive with negative effects on wheat yield. This study, therefore, suggests policymakers be mindful of farmers' maladaptive responses to climate change and provide effective adaptation measures, to help farmers cope with the risks of climate change and ensure farmer's livelihood security and sustainable agriculture development.","[Quan, Shuiping; Li, Yingming] Chinese Acad Sci CASISD, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Quan, Shuiping; Li, Yingming; Wang, Mingyue] UCAS, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Song, Jianxin] Baoshang Bank Co, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tao] Infinite Sum Modeling Inc, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Li, YM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci CASISD, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Li, YM (corresponding author), UCAS, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",quanshuiping15@mails.ucas.ac.cn; liyingming@casipm.ac.cn; sjxbj@163.com; zhang.tao@infsum.com; wangmingyue16@mails.ucas.ac.cn,,"Quan, Shuiping/0000-0002-9597-7185; wang, Mingyue/0000-0002-4342-0430",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473241],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71473241; The APC was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71473241.",,37,14,16,11,41,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR 1,2019,11,7,,,,,,,1928,10.3390/su11071928,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11071928,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HW2WV,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000466551600105,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data for this study were collected from 400 randomly-selected smallholder farmers, using a structured questionnaire, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The study used an ordered logit model to examine the factors that influence smallholder farmers' behavioural intention towards adaptation to climate change. Results from the study show that the gender of the household head, access to extension services on crop and livestock production, access to climate information, membership to social groups and experiencing a drought have a positive influence on farmers' attitude towards adaptation to climate change and variability. The study concluded that although the majority of small-holder farmers perceive that the climate is changing, they continue to habour negative attitudes towards prescribed climate change adaptation techniques.

We draw upon securitization theory to examine how security narratives affect climate change adaptation. Using primary and secondary data, we find that although securitization arguments are easily identified in climate change policies and action plans in Nigeria, the implications of securitization for adaptation policy and practice are harder to discern. We find that adaptation is not as urgent a policy as would be expected from the logic of securitization. The transformation of security framing into urgent adaptation actions appears difficult because there are no urgent adaptation measures. We also find that people's level of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change is a function of deeper socio-political dynamics and processes that defy the political theatre of securitization.","[Oramah, Chinwe Philomina; Arne Pettersen Gould, Kenneth] Univ Stavanger, Dept Safety Econ & Planning, Stavanger, Norway; [Oramah, Chinwe Philomina] Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Technol & Safety, Tromso, Norway; [Olsen, Odd Einar] Univ Stavanger, Ctr Risk Management & Societal Safety, Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Oramah, CP (corresponding author), Univ Stavanger, Dept Safety Econ & Planning, Stavanger, Norway.;Oramah, CP (corresponding author), Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Technol & Safety, Tromso, Norway.",chinwe.p.oramah@uit.no,,"Oramah, Chinwe Philomina/0000-0002-5883-6092",Universitetet i Stavanger,Universitetet i Stavanger,This work was supported by the Universitetet i Stavanger.,,61,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

We employ a simultaneous equations model to investigate the differential effects of adaptation on adapters and non-adapters. An endogenous switching mechanism is employed to account for selectivity bias. Based on a survey of 422 rice farmers in Nepal, our results show that farmers' education, access to credit and extension services, experience with climate change impacts such as drought and flood, information on climate change issues, belief in climate change and the need to adapt all variously determine their decision-making. We find that the adaptation strategies employed by farmers significantly increase rice yields. Furthermore, results indicate that both adapters and non-adapters would benefit from the adaptation of the identified strategies. This study, therefore, provides supportive evidence for policy makers to take into consideration farmers' existing knowledge and skills in adapting to climate change. The findings show that it is imperative to involve fanners in climate change adaptation planning processes if the full benefits of such policy action are to be realized.","[Khanal, Uttam; Wilson, Clevo; Viet-Ngu Hoang; Lee, Boon] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Level 8,Z Block,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Wilson, C (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Level 8,Z Block,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",clevo.wilson@qut.edu.au,"Lee, Boon/K-5178-2019","Lee, Boon/0000-0002-3594-0575; Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495; Hoang, Viet-Ngu/0000-0002-9742-2378",,,,,49,139,143,12,116,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Among the farmer respondents, drought (El Nino), typhoon, strong winds, heavy rains/excessive rainfall, flash floods and landslides are among the common evidences of climate change. Generally, most of the adaptation strategies employed is through cultural management practices like minimized usage of inorganic fertilizer and chemical pesticides from Agusan del Sur farmer respondents while some of the farmer respondents in North Cotabato employed organic farming practices to adapt to climate change. For both provinces, farmer respondents particularly identified agroforestry and diversified farming system as an effective adaptation strategy. Results proved the potential of the rubber-based agroforestry system to evolve as a resilient farming practice to adapt to climate change vis-a-vis stable biological and economic productivity, controlled occurrence of pest and diseases and minimized detrimental effects of climate change on the agroforestry farm component as a whole.","[Furoc-Paelmo, Roselyn] UPLB, Inst Crop Sci, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Laguna 4031, Philippines; [Cosico, Russel Son A.; Cabahug, Rowena Esperanza D.; Castillo, Arnold Karl A.] UPLB, Insitute Agroforestry, Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, Laguna, Philippines; [Castillo, Arturo S.

However, little information is currently available about how microeconomic actors are adapting to climate change and how best to support these adaptations. We reviewed the empirical literature to provide an overview of (1) the climate change adaptations that have been undertaken in practice by microeconomic actors (i.e. households and firms) and their determinants; and (2) the outcomes of these adaptations and the manner in which public policies have supported them. About a quarter of actors across the studies included in our review took no adaptation measures to climate change. Of those that did, the most commonly identified determinant of adaptation was assets, which were predominantly discussed as facilitating diversification within livelihoods. Few (14 out of 80) of the studies we reviewed which described empirical climate change adaptations evaluated the outcomes of these adaptations. Of those that did, evidence suggests that conflicts exist between the microeconomic outcomes of adaptations, social and environmental externalities, and long-term resilience. Different public policy interventions intended to support adaptation were discussed (57 in total); the provision of informational support was the most prevalent (33%). Our analysis suggests that microeconomic adaptation occurs as a cycle in which social and ecological feedbacks positively or negatively influence the adaptation process. Thus, efforts to facilitate adaptation are more likely to be effective if they recognize the role of feedbacks and the potential diversity of outcomes triggered by public policy incentives.","[Bartelet, Henry A.; Barnes, Michele L.; Cumming, Graeme S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University,"Bartelet, HA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",henry.bartelet@my.jcu.edu.au; michele.barnes@jcu.edu.au; graeme.cumming@jcu.edu.au,"Bartelet, Henry Antoine/GQR-1342-2022; Cumming, Graeme S./B-6551-2008","Bartelet, Henry Antoine/0000-0002-2786-2474; Cumming, Graeme S./0000-0002-3678-1326; Barnes, Michele/0000-0002-1151-4037","ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia; CAUL","ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia; CAUL","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions Research was funded by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia, 4811.",,90,1,1,2,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

However, most current research addresses resilience and climate adaptation at either the national or the household scale; very little is known about community-scale interventions. We interviewed 934 community members in six communities in southeastern Nigeria about sources of climate risk and community-based actions for climate change adaptation. We found these communities contained multiple active and engaged groups that have implemented a wide range of interventions to reduce climate risk, most of which are seen as effective by community members. Flooding was the most common form of risk in this region, but drought, windstorms, and irregular rainy seasons are also frequent, implying that effective climate adaptation will have to be sensitive to multiple types of risk. Structural interventions (constructing roads, bridges, etc.) were the most common type of intervention, suggesting that communities are capable of marshalling considerable organizational and human power for adaptation efforts, even in the absence of external assistance. Efforts to boost community resilience and adaptation to climate change would benefit from first understanding what community actions are currently underway, and working with the groups implementing these actions to support and extend them.","[Choko, Onyinye Prince] Univ Port Harcourt, Dept Forestry & Wildlife Management, Port Harcourt 500272, Nigeria; [Olabisi, Laura Schmitt] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Onyeneke, Robert Ugochukwu] Alex Ekwueme Fed Univ Ndufu Alike, Dept Agr, PMB 1010, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria; [Chiemela, Stella Nwawulu] Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Econ, Nsukka 410001, Nigeria; [Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis Saweda O.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Rivers, Louie, III] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",University of Port Harcourt; Michigan State University; University of Nigeria; Michigan State University; North Carolina State University,"Olabisi, LS (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",chokonyinye@gmail.com; schmi420@msu.edu; robert.onyeneke@funai.edu.ng; stella.chiemela@unn.edu.ng; lliverp@msu.edu; lrivers@ncsu.edu,"Onyeneke, Robert/AAS-6211-2021","Onyeneke, Robert/0000-0002-9242-901X; Rivers, Louie/0000-0001-7240-6710; Schmitt Olabisi, Laura/0000-0002-6557-9469; Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis/0000-0002-2990-5888",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative; Michigan State University AgBioResearch,United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Michigan State University AgBioResearch,This research is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative.

While these agreements have a common goal of reducing social, economic, and environmental vulnerability, they have been developed by largely independent communities of practice. This has limited cross-fertilization despite the inherent multidimensional nature of global challenges and the considerable thematic overlap. We argue that developing a transdisciplinary strategy that effectively integrates disciplines, approaches, and knowledge systems will lead to greater and more sustainable impacts, together with a more efficient use of financial resources. Hybrid approaches should be encouraged during planning of future development efforts so that risk reduction is conducted simultaneously with CCA. Transdisciplinary processes are central to generating context-sensitive knowledge to support decisions on CCA and DRR options that minimize trade-offs and maximize synergies and complementarities required to guide sustainable development trajectories. Finally, building codes together with climate and risk-smart research, education, and awareness raising, are identified as priority entry points to materialize the blending of DRR and CCA approaches and effectively reduce risk while mitigating and adapting to climate change.","[Bendito, America] Univ Los Andes, Dept Civil Engn, Merida 5101A, Venezuela; [Barrios, Edmundo] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, POB 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Los Andes Venezuela; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Bendito, A (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Dept Civil Engn, Merida 5101A, Venezuela.",americabendito@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,"CGIAR research programs on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (FTA)","CGIAR research programs on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (FTA)","We are grateful to Salvano Briceno, Stephen Twomlow, and Arnaldo Gutierrez for valuable comments that helped to improve this article.

In addition, the study points out the main responsibilities for realizing climate change adaptation in the tourism sector. The study figures that there are some differences between government authorities, businesses and tourists' perspectives on recommended approaches to adapt to climate change.

A catchment-based adaptation assessment tool for freshwater ecosystems,CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; MANAGEMENT; AUSTRALIA; WETLANDS; RIVERS; BIODIVERSITY; CONFLICTS; SYNERGIES; POLICIES; IMPACTS,"Freshwater ecosystems in many parts of the world have been severely affected by past management practices that have altered the volume, timing and quality of water flows and caused a decline in their ecological health. Some of these systems are also experiencing the negative impacts of climate change. Adaptation to climate change and the continual need to address existing ecological damage poses ongoing challenges for freshwater managers. In this paper we propose and discuss a Catchment Assessment Framework (CAF) that is used to evaluate existing and potential freshwater management actions, such as riparian revegetation and habitat connectivity, for their adaptation potential. The CAF was developed as a tool for prioritizing low risk climate change adaptation options in Australian catchment management. The CAF enables catchment managers and technical experts to assess management actions against seven inter-related criteria to provide a holistic assessment: relevance to the catchment; climate change adaptation potential, including potential for maladaptation and benefit under different climate scenarios; ecosystem service benefits; compatibility with other actions; implementation constraints; socio-economic consequences; and a risk assessment. It was developed and applied by assessing nine management options with stakeholders in three catchments within the Murray-Darling Basin in south-eastern Australia. We found that while management options are undertaken as a response to existing degradation, they can be used as building blocks for a climate change adaptation strategy that considers a range of different but complementary measures to better manage climate-related risk. The CAF enables practitioners to assess the advantages of a range of adaptation options and to subject them to their wider decision making and management planning.","[Lukasiewicz, Anna; Finlayson, C.

Based on the research and practice on climate change adaptation worldwide, this paper constructs an evaluation indicator system for climate-resilient cities with six primary indicators and 15-21 secondary indicators to assess the progress of the pilot program in a comprehensive manner. The study shows that the consciousness of climate adaptation has been strengthened, their adaptive capacity has been improved, and their climate change monitoring capacity and the basic adaptive capacity have been enhanced. Meanwhile, each pilot city has carried out unique system and mechanism innovation and international cooperation and exchange activities, but the progress is uneven, and there is still room for improvement in the overall adaptive capacity. It is recommended that a system for evaluating the progress of the climate-resilient city pilots be established as soon as possible, and that the review of the adaptation actions and highlights of the city pilots be strengthened, so as to raise the political status of the pilot areas and strengthen their consciousness of climate change adaptation.","[FU, Lin; ZHANG, Dongyu; CAO, Ying] Natl Ctr Climate Change Strategy & Int Cooperat N, F4 Environm Conventions Bldg,5 Houyingfang Hutong, Beijing 100035, Peoples R China; [YANG, Xiu] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Climate Change & Sustainable Dev ICCSD, 214 Main Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Fu, L (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Climate Change Strategy & Int Cooperat N, F4 Environm Conventions Bldg,5 Houyingfang Hutong, Beijing 100035, Peoples R China.",fulin@ncsc.org.cn,,,,,,,14,3,3,7,28,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2345-7481,2345-752X,,CHIN J URBAN ENV STU,Chin.

Climate adaptation planning requires combining spatial information with stakeholder values. This study demonstrates the potential of geodesign tools as a mean to integrate spatial analysis with stakeholder participation in adaptation planning. The tools are interactive and provide dynamic feedback on stakeholder objectives in response to the application of spatial measures. Different rationalities formed by underlying internalized values influence the reasoning of decision-making. Four tools were developed, each tailored to different rationalities varying between a collective or individual viewpoint and analytical or political arguments. The tools were evaluated in an experiment with four groups of participants that were set around an interactive mapping device: the touch table. To study how local decision-making on adaptation can be supported, this study focuses on a specific case study in the Netherlands. In this case study, multiple different stakeholders need to make spatial decisions on land use and water management planning in response to climate change. The collaborative use of four geodesign tools was evaluated in an interactive experiment. The results show that the geodesign tools were able to integrate the engagement of stakeholders and assessment of measures. The experiment showed that decision-making on adaptation to climate change can benefit from the use of geodesign tools as long as the tool is carefully matched to the rationality that applies to the adaptation issue. Although the tools were tested to support the design of adaptation plans in a Dutch setting, the tools could be used for regional adaptation planning in other countries such as the development of regional adaptation strategies (RAS) as required by the European Union or on a national scale to support developing national adaptation plans of action (NAPAs) as initiated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for least developed countries.","[Eikelboom, Tessa] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Janssen, Ron] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ, Dept Spatial Econ, Spatial Informat Lab, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Eikelboom, T (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",tessa.eikelboom@vu.nl,"Janssen, Ron/L-1346-2013","Janssen, Ron/0000-0001-6257-3507",Knowledge for Climate research program of the Netherlands,Knowledge for Climate research program of the Netherlands,This research was funded by the Knowledge for Climate research program of the Netherlands.

Three elements of social capital-social trust, institutional trust, and social networks-were considered. They were analyzed based on four questions targeting social capital during semi-structured interviews on climate change adaptation in 10 rural coastal communities located in three Canadian provinces (Quebec, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island). Results showed that these communities exhibited strong social capital, mainly because of a high level of social trust. People were ambivalent in the way they connected to institutions, especially with governments. They often felt isolated and left to themselves to deal with climate change adaptation decisions. The research conveys the difficulties and challenges of multilevel governance, where coastal communities generally ensure trust within the community first before trusting higher levels of government. Initiatives to improve public engagement and participation in decision making should be supported for further adaptation, although they would require greater accountability and transparency.","[Vasseur, Liette] Brock Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1812 Sir Isaac Brock Way, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Thornbush, Mary J.] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Plante, Steve] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Dept Soc Terr & Dev, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada",Brock University; University of Guelph; University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski,"Vasseur, L (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1812 Sir Isaac Brock Way, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",lvasseur@brocku.ca; mthornbu@uoguelph.ca; steve_plante@uqar.ca,,"Vasseur, Liette/0000-0001-7289-2675; Thornbush, Mary/0000-0001-9354-2797",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada through the Coastal Community Challenges-Community-University Research Alliance (CCC-CURA) project [833-2009-4010],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada through the Coastal Community Challenges-Community-University Research Alliance (CCC-CURA) project,"The authors would like to thank S.K.

The consequences of climate change, such as increased repair costs, can be reduced if buildings are designed and built to be adaptive to climate change risks. This research investigates the preparedness of the Australian residential building sector to adapt to such risks, with a view to informing the next review of the National Construction Code (2022), which at present does not include provisions for climate change adaptation. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with construction managers from residential building companies in Brisbane, Queensland to understand their level of preparedness to adapt with climate change risks. Three aspects of preparedness were investigated: participant's awareness of climate change risks, their company's capacity to include climate change information in planning, and actions taken to address climate change risks. Participants were also asked about climate change adaptation policies and what they thought the path towards increased preparedness in the residential construction industry to climate change risks might involve. Qualitative analysis of interview data was undertaken using NVivo software, and illustrative examples and direct quotes from this data are included in the results. The results indicate a low level of preparedness of the residential building industry to adapt with climate risks. Levels of awareness of managing the consequences of climate change risks, analytical capacity, and the actions taken to address climate change were all found to be low. Legislating climate adaptation practices and increasing the adaptation awareness of the residential constructors are some of the recommendations to enhance the preparedness of the residential construction industry in Australia to adapt with climate change risks.","[Jayasinghe, Anuradhi Dulangi; Stewart, Philip Le Compete Forsyth] Univ Queensland Brisbane, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Steele Bldg, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Stewart, Philip Le Compete Forsyth] Univ South Africa, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Appl Behav Ecol & Ecol Res Unit ABEERU, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Queensland; University of South Africa,"Jayasinghe, AD (corresponding author), Univ Queensland Brisbane, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Steele Bldg, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",dulangij@gmail.com; p.stewart3@uq.edu.au,,"Jayasinghe, Anuradhi/0000-0001-9515-929X",,,,,63,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Despite this, climate adaptation at the community level has not received adequate conceptual attention, and a limited number of analytical frameworks are available for assessing place-specific adaptations, particularly in a fisheries context. We use conceptual material from social-ecological systems (SES) resilience and human development resilience to build an integrated framework for evaluating community adaptations to climate change in a fisheries setting. The framework defines resilience as the combined result of coping, adapting, and transforming recognizing resilience as a system's capacity and as a process. This understanding of resilience integrates with the three development resilience concepts of resistance, rootedness, and resourcefulness to develop 'place-based elements' which refer to collective action, institutions, agency, and indigenous and local knowledge systems. The proposed framework can capture a local setting's place-specific attributes relating to the well-being of individuals, households, and communities, and the through integration of SES and human development conceptualizations addresses some of the key critiques of the notion of resilience. We have proposed this framework for application in context-specific environments including fisheries as a means of assessing community adaptations.","[Galappaththi, Eranga K.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ford, James D.] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Bennett, Elena M.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; University of Leeds; McGill University,"Galappaththi, EK (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",eranga.research@gmail.com,"Bennett, Elena/A-9553-2008; Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Galappaththi, Eranga/0000-0002-3926-2206; Bennett, Elena/0000-0003-3944-2925",Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada; International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada; Northern Scientific Training Program (NSTP) through McGill University,Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada(CGIAR); Northern Scientific Training Program (NSTP) through McGill University,"EKG acknowledges the financial support of the doctoral fellowship of the Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada.

In this article, we provide insight into how adaptation projects mobilize distinct imaginaries and knowledge claims that create territories for intervention (the objects) as well as targeted populations (the subjects) to sustain them. Drawing on two emblematic climate change adaptation projects in Ecuador, we show how these objects and subjects are created through a knowledge production process that (a) creates a discursive climate change rationale; (b) sidesteps uncertainty related to climate change impacts; (c) fosters a circular citational practice that (self-)reinforces the project's expert knowledge; and (d) makes complex social variables commensurable based on the project's rationality, interests, and quantifiable indicators. The emerging hydrosocial territories 'in need of intervention' require subjects that inhabit, produce and reproduce these territories, in accordance with specific climate change discourses and practices. To manufacture and align these subjects, projects employ participatory practices that are informed by recognition politics aimed at disciplining participants toward particular identities and ways of thinking and acting.

Incorporating local values into the climate change planning process in a structured way and effectively using local knowledge not only improves the identification of priority actions for climate change adaptation, but also supports successful implementation. Much of climate change adaptation planning in recent years identifies actions derived from expert-driven vulnerability assessments and adaptation actions. Yet the values of each community influence how climate change impacts are perceived, and what adaptation actions are locally acceptable and will have local buy-in for implementation. Thus, it is important that planning incorporates local values if the goal is successful adaptation to climate change. This paper provides one approach for addressing this through a participatory, values-based process for climate change adaptation planning. The approach is contextualized through a case study of the Gitga'at Nation, located in northern coastal British Columbia, Canada, where key values were found to be culturally important food sources, culture, environmental resources, self-sufficiency, health, infrastructure to enable us to live well, and Gitga'at pride and cooperation. These values were used throughout the planning process to contextualize climate change impacts on Gitga'at members' way of life and to develop and evaluate adaptation actions. It is hoped that this case study provides further proof of the utility of values-based planning in the context of adaptation planning for marginalized communities.","[Reid, Michael G.] Gitgaat First Nation, Hartley Bay, BC V0V 1A0, Canada; [Hamilton, Colleen] Ecoplan Int, Vancouver, BC V6B 4M3, Canada; [Reid, Sarah K.] Closer Look Consulting, Victoria, BC V8R 4C5, Canada",,"Reid, MG (corresponding author), Gitgaat First Nation, 445 Hayimiisaxaa Way, Hartley Bay, BC V0V 1A0, Canada.",michaelgeorgereid@gmail.com; colleen@ecoplan.ca; sarahkristenreid@gmail.com; william@ecoplan.ca; chill@sd52.bc.ca; nturner@uvic.ca; chris.r.picard@gmail.com; lamontagnecass@hotmail.com; damon.matthews@concordia.ca,/AAD-2430-2020,/0000-0003-3625-390X,Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada,Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada,"The authors wish to thank the many Gitga'at elders, chiefs, matriarchs, and community members who participated in the climate change adaptation project.

Yet, resilience and adaptation to climate change have evolved largely along parallel paths with little cross-fertilization. Conceptual vagueness around resilience makes it challenging to ascertain what elements of resilience thinking have the greatest potential to enhance climate change adaptation and contribute to broader sustainable development goals. This article distills nine principles from the resilience literature to build a framework to assess 224 climate change adaptation strategies proposed by researchers and practitioners in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Our analysis concludes that adaptation strategies in this data set emphasize initiatives that increase social and ecological diversity, strengthen learning processes, build functional redundancy, enhance connectivity between social and ecological elements, pay attention to the management of slow variables, and provide mechanisms for increasing participation and polycentric governance. At the same time, the adaptation options examined generally lacked a system's perspective, suggesting that there is still important work ahead to move toward a climate-resilient development model.","[Berbes-Blazquez, Marta; Mitchell, Carrie L.; Burch, Sarah L.; Wandel, Johanna] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Berbes-Blazquez, M (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",mberbes@gmail.com,"Berbes, Marta/AAE-9374-2020","Berbes-Blazquez, Marta/0000-0002-2685-873X","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1444755] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,46,24,24,1,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Despite the critical importance of personal barriers in shaping the adaptive response of humanity to climate change and variability, the literature on the subject is rather nascent. This study is premised on the hypothesis that place-specific characteristics (where you live) and compositional (both biosocial and sociocultural) factors may be salient to differentials in adaptation to climate change in coastal areas of developing countries. This is because adaptation to climate change is inherently local. Using cross-sectional survey data on 1,253 individuals (606 males and 647 females), barriers to adaptation to climate change were observed to vary with place, indicating that there is inequality in barriers to adaptation. In the multivariate models, the place-specific differences in barriers to adaptation were robust and remained statistically significant even when socio-demographic (compositional) variables were controlled. Observed differences in barriers to adaptation to climate change in coastal Tanzania mainly reflect strong place-specific disparities among groups indicating the need for adaptation policies that are responsive to processes of socio-institutional learning in a specific context, involving multiple people that have a stake in the present and the future of that place. These people are making complex, multifaceted choices about managing and adapting to climate-related risks and opportunities, often in the face of resource constraints and competing agendas.","[Armah, Frederick Ato] Univ Western Ontario, Environm Hlth & Hazards Lab, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Luginaah, Isaac] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Hambati, Herbert] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Geog, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Chuenpagdee, Ratana] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada; [Campbell, Gywn] Indian Ocean World Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 1X9, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Dar es Salaam; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Armah, FA (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Environm Hlth & Hazards Lab, Dept Geog, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",farmah@uwo.ca; iluginaa@uwo.ca; hhambati@udsm.ac.tz; ratanac@mun.ca; Gwyn.Campbell@mcgill.ca,"Armah, Frederick Ato/R-3906-2017; Campbell, Gwyn/AAN-1474-2021","Armah, Frederick Ato/0000-0002-9371-5683; Luginaah, Isaac/0000-0001-7858-3048",'the Indian Ocean World: The Making of the First Global Economy in the Context of Human Environment Interaction' project within Major Collaborative Research Initiative (MCRI),'the Indian Ocean World: The Making of the First Global Economy in the Context of Human Environment Interaction' project within Major Collaborative Research Initiative (MCRI),"We acknowledge research funding from 'the Indian Ocean World: The Making of the First Global Economy in the Context of Human Environment Interaction' project within the framework of Major Collaborative Research Initiative (MCRI).

We used household surveys to examine the importance of the ITKPs in terms of livelihood development and climate change adaptations, and qualitative syntheses of the FGDs information to reveal the causality of the ITKPs and development activities. Our study revealed that households perceived ITKPs to have higher economic security (64%), livelihood risk reduction (75%) and food security (62%). The majority of households (70%) in the agriculture profession perceived the higher economic potential of ITKPs, depending on the climate-adaptive co-benefits and taking into account their dependencies on climatic events. Agriculture dependent households who perceived the higher benefits of ITKPs were willing to pay 300 BDT/person/year for the improvement and restoration of those in the study areas.

In this article, we identify three distinct but overlapping policy uses. First, protecting and deploying education infrastructure, the social and material resources on which education depends, can reduce vulnerability and build resilience. Second, improving general education, measured in terms of literacy, school attendance, and overall academic attainment, can enhance adaptive capacity. Third, research-based adaptation learning support can accelerate social and policy change by maximizing learning before and during adaptive decision-making. Although all three are important, the unique and transformative contribution of education lies in adaptation learning support: curricular, pedagogical, and technological resources that prepare people for complex adaptive decision-making and help them solidify learning during that work. As human societies seek to balance the old social mechanisms that ensure stability with new ones that facilitate change, our capacity to systematically support the learning that undergirds adaptation may be the limiting factor. Key policy insights The value of education for climate change adaptation policy has been limited by vague definitions and poor cross-field communication. Education supports climate change adaptation through three distinct but overlapping pathways, each offering concrete policy options: education infrastructure, general education, and adaptation learning support. The greatest value of education lies in the transformative potential of adaptation learning support: curricular, pedagogical, and technological resources that prepare people for complex adaptive decision-making and help them solidify learning during that work.","[Feinstein, N.

In Pakistan, severe impacts of climate change have become evident in the recent past. Large-scale floods in the Indus river system have caused massive damages in the past decade. Also, frequent droughts and heatwaves are among other consequences of the changing climate in the country. Understanding the perspective of local communities regarding climate change adaptation strategies is pivotal to effective policymaking. We surveyed the rural community in the Indus Basin, in southern Punjab, Pakistan, to assess the climate change adaptations currently practiced. We found that the respondents perceive droughts, floods, and disease outbreaks (which are frequently followed by flooding events) as major climate change-induced threats. The respondents used flood and drought-resistant crop varieties, field boundaries (spate irrigation), migration to safe places, and loans as key adaptation strategies. We also assessed the socioeconomic determinants of climate change adaptation behaviour using a binary logistic regression model. Gender, occupation, and education influenced the adaptations to climate change.

This study aims to give answers, why, however, climate change issues receive very limited implementation by practitioners in day-to-day-management. Design/methodology/approach - Using a motivation model by Rheinberg (2006), a more differentiated understanding was gained why stakeholders took almost no action regarding climate change adaptation. A participatory spatial scenario method including a map exercise was used to motivate stakeholders to develop, discuss, exchange and negotiate strategies under different possible future developments and their implementation in protected area management. Findings - According to the motivation model, taking action is dependent on a number of factors and will only happen when all correlations are positive. It can be shown that for adaptation to climate change, concerning almost all of the various factors, no stimuli existed or actors expected a positive outcome when taking action. More motivation was generated for halting the loss of biodiversity and visitor management. In the participatory spatial scenario planning work, stakeholders from different sectors and decision-makers found consensus to implement integrated strategies, considering adaptation to climate change, reduction of greenhouse gases, better protection of biodiversity and different future developments in outdoor recreation activities. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates the importance of single motivation factors such as perceived competence, abilities to act and perceived positive outcomes including rewards for taking action. Using participatory spatial scenario planning methods can be powerful tools to stimulate joint action, though implementing organizations must be willing to make real use of the outcome of such work.","[Lupp, Gerd] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Heuchele, Linda; Konold, Werner] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Dept Landscape Management, Freiburg, Germany; [Renner, Christina; Syrbe, Ralf-Uwe] Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, Dresden, Germany; [Siegrist, Dominik] Hsch Tech Rapperswil, Inst Landscape & Open Space, Rapperswil Jona, Switzerland",Technical University of Munich; University of Freiburg; Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung,"Lupp, G (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",gerd.lupp@tum.de,,"Lupp, Gerd/0000-0002-1296-0303","German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation; German Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety [FKZ 3,510 87 0,100]","German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation; German Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety","The work was sponsored by the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation with funds from the German Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (FKZ 3,510 87 0,100).

However, these impacts are yet poorly defined and analysed in the existing literature. To complement this knowledge-gap, we reviewed the literature to unveil the relationship between climate change adaptation and environmental impact assessment, and the degree to which environmental impacts are included in climate change adaptation theory and practice. Our literature review showed that technical, social and economic perspectives on climate change adaptation receive much more attention than the environmental perspective. The scarce interest on the environmental impacts of adaptation may be attributed to (1) an excessive sectoral approach, with dominance of non-environmental perspectives, (2) greater interest in mitigation and direct climate change impacts rather than in adaptation impacts, (3) a tendency to consider adaptation as inherently good, and (4) subjective/preconceived notions on which measures are good or bad, without a comprehensive assessment. Environmental Assessment (EA) has a long established history as an effective tool to include environment into decision-making, although it does not yet guarantee a proper assessment of adaptation, because it is still possible to postpone or even circumvent the processes of assessing the impacts of climate adaptation. Our results suggest that there is a need to address adaptation proactively by including it in EA, to update current policy frameworks, and to demand robust and reliable evaluation of alternatives. Only through the full EA of adaptation measures can we improve our understanding of the primary and secondary impacts of adaptation to global environmental change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The synthesis shows that multiple definitions of adaptation were used across studies, resulting in a conceptual murkiness that is a barrier to generalizing the findings to inform planned adaptation policies and projects. By using a seven-category typology to classify and compare smallholder farmer adaptations across communities, the synthesis shows that in order to reduce their vulnerability smallholder farmers have mostly taken action on environmental management and diversified their livelihoods through market exchange. Some have engaged in labour migration. Very few have pursued communal pooling, storage, or mobility as risk-reducing strategies. Despite the increasing recognition that adaptation is driven by multiple stressors, less than half of the adaptation studies included discussions of multiple stressors. The synthesis points to the need for (1) improved methodological clarity in climate change adaptation research, (2) more research on labour migration and climate change interactions, (3) more research to determine the conceptual and practical significance of communal pooling and storage as risk-reducing strategies, (4) the incorporation of the assessment of multiple stressors into climate change adaptation research and policy, and (5) more empirical research on what adaptive strategies are not adopted by smallholder farmers and why.","[Burnham, Morey] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Marshall Hall 107,1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Ma, Zhao] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Ma, Z (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",zhaoma@purdue.edu,"Ma, Zhao/M-7657-2013; Ma, Zhao/P-2622-2019","Ma, Zhao/0000-0002-9103-3996; Ma, Zhao/0000-0002-9103-3996; Burnham, Morey/0000-0001-5716-9964",,,,,98,69,70,4,57,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

A Case of Rice Farmers in Ogun State, Nigeria",LAND,,,English,Article,,,,,,rice; HDDS; climate change; adaptation strategies; ESPM; AIPW,IMPACTS; SOIL,"The southwestern part of Nigeria, particularly Ogun State, is more vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change due to the high dependence on rain-fed agriculture and limited capacities to respond to climate change. In this study, factors influencing climate change adaptation strategies and its impacts on household food security of smallholder rice farmers in Ogun State were estimated. A multistage sampling technique was employed to select 120 smallholder rice farmers in the study area. The factors influencing the adoption of climate change adaptation practices and their impacts on household food security among smallholder rice farmers in Ogun State were examined using a probit model and an endogenous switching probit model (ESPM). According to the results of household dietary diversity score (HDDS), adopters of climate change adaptation techniques have higher levels of food security than non-adopters. The outcome of the ESPM shows that access to market information, access to extension agents, gender, off-farm income, and membership in cooperatives all contribute to the variations in food security experienced by both adopters and non-adopters of climate change adaptation strategies. A unit increase in adoption of climate change adaptation measures will increase household food security by about 3 units while decreasing severity in food insecurity by about 3.2 units. Therefore, it is recommended that policies that would support smallholder farmers' decisions to embrace measures for coping with climate change should be encouraged in order to stimulate their adaptive capacity. Additionally, in order to secure the inclusive sustainability of the agricultural sector, stakeholders and NGOs must collaborate with each other to enhance the circumstances under which farmers may receive climate change information, timely agricultural loans, and policy incentives.","[Ojo, Temitope Oluwaseun] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ife 220005, Nigeria; [Ojo, Temitope Oluwaseun; Ogundeji, Abiodun A.] Univ Free State, Disaster Management Training & Educ Ctr Africa, POB 339, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Emenike, Chijioke U.] Dalhousie Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Plant Food & Environm Sci, Truro, NS B2N 5E3, Canada",Obafemi Awolowo University; University of the Free State; Dalhousie University,"Ojo, TO (corresponding author), Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ife 220005, Nigeria.;Ojo, TO; Ogundeji, AA (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Disaster Management Training & Educ Ctr Africa, POB 339, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.;Emenike, CU (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Plant Food & Environm Sci, Truro, NS B2N 5E3, Canada.",ojot@oauife.edu.ng; ogundejiaa@ufs.ac.za; chijioke.emenike@dal.ca,"Ojo, Temitope Oluwaseun/HOH-6850-2023","Emenike, Chijioke/0000-0003-4306-0049; Ogundeji, Abiodun Akintunde/0000-0001-7356-5668",,,,,45,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,NOV,2022,11,11,,,,,,,1875,10.3390/land11111875,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11111875,,,16,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6B4WF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000881334200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pastoralists are engaging and embracing a range of adaptive strategies to adjust to these changes. The socioeconomic factors driving them to engage in a portfolio of multiple adaptation strategies have not been adequately addressed in the existing literature. A multivariate probit model was used to analyze them as determinants of adaptive capacity that promotes or hinders adaptation to climate change. Adaptation is represented by uptake of multiple strategies (irrigation, livestock migration, fodder production, and improved livestock breeds) by households, a demonstration of a household's ability to diversify and adapt to the effects of climate change. The household asset base, particularly social capital represented by government assistance, stands out as it positively influenced by the uptake of four out of five adaptation strategies; that is, irrigation, livestock manure, fodder production, and improved breeds. Information heavily supports the adaptation process as it influenced all the five adaptation strategies analyzed but has a heterogeneous effect, supporting households to either adopt or reject a strategy. Crop-based information positively determines uptake of yield-enhancing strategies while relevant information for livestock activities contributes to the uptake of livestock-based strategies. These findings suggest that mainstreaming agricultural innovations, building a household asset base, and facilitating access to agronomic and climatic information will enable dryland communities to better adapt to climate change.","[Ng'ang'a, Teresiah Wairimu; Gachene, Charles K.; Kironchi, Geoffrey] Univ Nairobi, Dept Land Resources Management & Agr Technol LARM, Kabete Campus,POB 29053-00625, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ng'ang'a, Teresiah Wairimu] World Agroforestry ICRAF, Landscapes Governance Theme, United Nat Ave,POB 30677-00100, Gigiri Nairobi, Kenya; [Coulibaly, Jeanne Y.] World Bank, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Crane, Todd A.] ILRI, Sustainable Livestock Syst, POB 30709-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Ng'ang'a, TW (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Dept Land Resources Management & Agr Technol LARM, Kabete Campus,POB 29053-00625, Nairobi, Kenya.;Ng'ang'a, TW (corresponding author), World Agroforestry ICRAF, Landscapes Governance Theme, United Nat Ave,POB 30677-00100, Gigiri Nairobi, Kenya.",Twnganga@gmail.com,,,USAID [3106 USAD-1133A.01AN GBL075]; Germany Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) [3106 -DAAD-1157G.03AO GBL075],USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Germany Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"This research is based on work done as a part of the Local Governance for Adaptation to Climate Change (LGACC) project, implemented by World Agroforestry together with the International Livestock Research Institute with funding from USAID (3106 USAD-1133A.01AN GBL075) in a collaborative PhD program with Germany Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) (3106 -DAAD-1157G.03AO GBL075).

We apply an endogenous switching regression to data obtained from 1440 farmers in Ghana. Our model, which accounts for endogeneity and selection bias, allows us to simultaneously determine the factors that influence maize farmers' decision to adapt to climate change and the productivity and household assets that result from both adaptation and otherwise. We estimate an inverse relationship between rainfall and the decision to adapt to climate change. As expected, we find that access to information has a positive effect on the decision to adapt. Farms that benefit from adaptation do not become less productive with increases in temperature or rainfall. Overall, we find that farmers who adapt to climate change are more productive and have more household assets than their counterfactual. Farmers who do not adapt obtain less yield and have less household assets than their counterfactual.

Drawing on a survey of 483 smallholder farmer households in the Loess Plateau region of China, we examine the factors that shape smallholder farmer perceptions of their ability to adapt to climate change and their stated intent to do so. We apply a proportional odds ordered logistic regression model to identify the role that determinants of adaptive capacity play in shaping smallholders' perceived self-efficacy and adaptation intent. Our study provides further evidence that self-efficacy beliefs are a strong, positive predictor of adaptation intent. Our study suggests that human capital, information and technology, material resources and infrastructure, wealth and financial capital, and institutions and entitlements all play an important role in shaping smallholder perceived self-efficacy, while state-society dependencies may reduce smallholder perceived self-efficacy. In addition, our study suggests that perceiving climate change risks and impacts do not necessarily lead to an intention to adapt. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of incorporating both the objective determinants of smallholders' adaptive capacity and their subjective perceptions of these objective determinants into future climate change adaptation programs and policies in order to facilitate adaptive actions. Identifying factors that cause individuals to have a low estimation of their adaptive ability may allow planned adaptation interventions to address these perceived limitations and encourage adaptive behavior.","[Burnham, Morey] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Studies, 106 Marshall Hall,1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Ma, Zhao] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Burnham, M (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Studies, 106 Marshall Hall,1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",moburnha@esf.edu,"Ma, Zhao/M-7657-2013; Ma, Zhao/P-2622-2019","Ma, Zhao/0000-0002-9103-3996; Ma, Zhao/0000-0002-9103-3996; Burnham, Morey/0000-0001-5716-9964",Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University (NWAFU) through the 111 project of Chinese Ministry of Education [B12007],Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University (NWAFU) through the 111 project of Chinese Ministry of Education,"This research was partially funded by Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University (NWAFU) through the 111 project of Chinese Ministry of Education (No. B12007).

Community-based adaptation is able to reduce the vulnerability as well as improve the resilience of the local people to climatic variability and change. Subsistence farmers have always adopted adaptive strategies to some of these changes over the years. As such, the adoption of indigenous practices will significantly help rural community members to adapt to climate change. This study employed a qualitative method and an exploratory design, and the results are derived from 30 purposively selected in-depth interviews. The study discovered that there are numerous measures used to adapt to climate change and subsequently to sustain indigenous practices. The study also found that the community no longer grows maize in large quantities, having shifted to millet and sorghum in order to adapt to climate change. The community also provided various strategies to adapt to climate change. These strategies include mulching, creating large storage houses for produce and creating temporary walls on riverbanks in order to store water when the rivers dry up. This study concludes that climate change adaptation measures employed by the community have significantly helped them to sustain their indigenous practices in many ways. Also, the use of IKS, through activities such as crop type change from maize to traditional millet and sorghum (which facilitates traditional lifestyle and activities), re-establishes the community's indigenous practices since they are made to observe the practices of yesteryear.","[Mugambiwa, Shingirai S.] Univ Limpopo, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Polokwane, South Africa",University of Limpopo,"Mugambiwa, SS (corresponding author), Univ Limpopo, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Polokwane, South Africa.",mugambiwashingirai@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,35,36,1,9,AFRICAN CENTRE DISASTER STUDIES,POTCHEFSTROOM,"INTERNAL BOX 265, NORTH-WEST UNIV, PRIVATE BAG X6001, POTCHEFSTROOM, 2520, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

The article begins by explaining its research methods and selecting a sample of Global Environment Facility-Least Developed Country Fund projects being implemented in Asia to analyze. It then describes ongoing adaptation efforts in each of these four countries. It finds that projects enhance infrastructural resilience by building relevant, robust, and flexible technologies. They build institutional resilience by creating strong, permanent, legitimate organizations in place to respond to climate change issues. They promote community resilience by enhancing local ownership, building capacity, and creating networks that help ordinary people learn and adapt to climate change. We find that all four of our case studies couple adaptive improvements in technology and infrastructure with those in governance and community welfare, underscoring the holistic or systemic aspect of resilience.

Reducing vulnerability and enabling collaborative knowledge creation through the inclusive consideration of Indigenous peoples' perspectives in government and institutional efforts can help to advance adaptation to environmental change. In Northern Canada, Indigenous communities and multiple levels of the Canadian government and its institutions, including the Canadian Armed Forces, share the commensurate task and responsibility of responding to, tracking, monitoring and adapting to rapid climatic changes and impacts associated with climate change in the Arctic. In this review paper, we explore how Canadian governments may effectively work as partners and catalysts for advancing mutually beneficial climate change adaptation efforts with Indigenous peoples and communities affected by climate change in remote Arctic regions of Northern Canada. We review knowledge and concepts related to Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge in the context of institutional adaptation planning and policy approaches in remote regions. First, we provide a geographical and contextual background that informs the efforts of institutional partners and Indigenous communities seeking to mutually address long-term challenges associated with adapting to climate change, specifically in the remote Canadian Arctic. Second, we unpack knowledge for advancing collaborative adaptation efforts between Indigenous peoples and institutions in the Arctic. We identify relevant gaps and opportunities for enhancing institutional approaches to climate change adaptation involving Indigenous peoples in remote regions like the Arctic. We conclude with a summary of policy relevant insights for future research.","[Vogel, Brennan] Western Univ, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, 2nd Floor North Campus Bldg, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Bullock, Ryan C.

We apply SD theory to climate change adaptation, focusing on a population of Colombian coffee farmers in Risaralda who are impacted by climate change. Our findings reveal a SD cycle blocking successful adaptation. Climate change impacts exacerbate farmers' pre-existing financial strain and threaten their livelihoods, yet they lack the information and political and structural support needed to take action. This impedes development and creates a downward spiral of immobilization; the farmers will continue to be unprepared for climate change and practice inconsistent adaptation efforts until structures shift to provide them with the information and resources needed for successful adaptation.","[Eise, Jessica] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Commun, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Rawat, Meghana] Utah Valley Univ, Dept Commun, Orem, UT USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Utah System of Higher Education; Utah Valley University,"Eise, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Commun, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",Jessica.eise@utsa.edu,,,Purdue University College of Liberal Arts; Purdue Climate Change Research Center,Purdue University College of Liberal Arts; Purdue Climate Change Research Center,"Funding was provided by the Purdue University College of Liberal Arts, the Purdue University Brian Lamb School of Communication and the Purdue Climate Change Research Center.

As climate change is projected to hit the poorest the hardest, it is especially important for developing countries to pay particular attention to the management of natural resources and agricultural activities. In most of these countries such as Cameroon, forest can play important role in achieving broader climate change adaptation goals. However, forest generally receives very little attention in national development programme and strategies such as policy dialogues on climate change and poverty reduction strategies. Using a qualitative approach to data collection through content analysis of relevant Cameroon policy documents, the integration of climate change adaptation was explored and the level of attention given to forests for adaptation analysed. Results indicate that, with the exception of the First National Communication to UNFCCC that focused mostly on mitigation and related issues, current policy documents in Cameroon are void of tangible reference to climate change, and hence failing in drawing the relevance of forest in sheltering populations from the many projected impacts of climate change. Policies related to forest rely on a generalized concept of sustainable forest management and do not identify the specific changes that need to be incorporated into management strategies and policies towards achieving adaptation. The strategies and recommendations made in those documents only serve to improve understanding of Cameroon natural resources and add resilience to the natural systems in coping with anthropogenic stresses. The paper draws attention to the need to address the constraints of lack of awareness and poor flow of information on the potentials of forests for climate change adaptation. It highlights the need for integrating forest for adaptation into national development programmes and strategies, and recommends a review of the existing environmental legislations and their implications on poverty reduction strategy and adaptation to climate change.","[Bele, Mekou Youssoufa; Somorin, Olufunso; Sonwa, Denis Jean] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Somorin, Olufunso] Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Nkem, Johnson Ndi] United Nations Off Nairobi Gigiri, UNDP, Nairobi, Kenya; [Locatelli, Bruno] CIRAD UPR Forest Resources, Montpellier, France; [Locatelli, Bruno] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); Wageningen University & Research; CIRAD; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Bele, MY (corresponding author), Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, POB 2008, Yaounde, Cameroon.",b.youssoufa@cgiar.org; o.somorin@cgiar.org; d.sonwa@cgiar.org; johnson.nkem@undp.org; bruno.locatelli@cirad.fr,"Locatelli, Bruno/C-9957-2009; Somorin, Olufunso/F-7143-2010","Locatelli, Bruno/0000-0003-2983-1644; Somorin, Olufunso/0000-0002-2526-5668",International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Congo Basin Forests and Climate Change Adaptation project in Central Africa (CoFCCA),International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Congo Basin Forests and Climate Change Adaptation project in Central Africa (CoFCCA),"We would like to thank all those who have provided us with documents and information necessary for this paper.

Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, however, interact with existing and new nuclear power plants, and these installations must contend with dilemmas between adaptation and mitigation. This paper develops five criteria to assess the adaptation-mitigation dilemma on two major points: (1) the ability of nuclear power to adapt to climate change and (2) the potential for nuclear power operation to hinder climate change adaptation. Sea level rise models for nine coastal sites in the United States, a review of US Nuclear Regulatory Commission documents, and reports from France's nuclear regulatory agency provided insights into issues that have arisen from sea level rise, shoreline erosion, coastal storms, floods, and heat waves. Applying the criteria to inland and coastal nuclear power plants reveals several weaknesses. Safety stands out as the primary concern at coastal locations, while inland locations encounter greater problems with interrupted operation. Adapting nuclear power to climate change entails either increased expenses for construction and operation or incurs significant costs to the environment and public health and welfare. Mere absence of greenhouse gas emissions is not sufficient to assess nuclear power as a mitigation for climate change. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Sixty households' heads involved in honey production were used. Structured interview schedule, focus group discussion and observation were used for data collection and the analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics. Production of honey across the years (2000 to 2015) showed a downward trend, while the number of hives installed increased significantly. The respondents effectively adapted to climate change through change of sites of hives ((x) over bar= 4.00), tree planting ((x) over bar= 3.33), amendment of the periods of beekeeping operations ((x) over bar= 3.00) among others. However, they experienced challenges caused by indiscriminate cutting of trees ((x) over bar =3.42), inadequate information on adaptation measures ((x) over bar= 3.30), pesticide threat ((x) over bar =3.07) among others. Extension workers should intensify tailored training and visit to beekeepers to update producers' knowledge on bee farming (modern techniques), climate change implications of some farm practices (indiscriminate cutting of tree) and provide information on innovative adaptation options. Educational outreach on climate change to rural communities to stimulate community involvement in promoting environmentally sound practices should be advocated and funded by development agencies. Also, linking farmers to relevant actors, equipment dealers, financial institution; and enacting policy that will create and foster collaborative interaction for effective adaptation to climate change should be championed by public and non - governmental organizations.","[Mabel, Dimelu Ukamaka; Eberechukwu, Nwuba Loveth] Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Extens, Nsukka, Nigeria",University of Nigeria,"Mabel, UD (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Extens, Nsukka, Nigeria.",mabel.dimelu@unn.edu.ng; nwubaloveth@yahoo.com,,,,,,,27,4,4,5,13,AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION SOC NIGERIA,KWARA STATE,"AGRICULTURAL & RURAL MANAGEMENT TRAINING INST, PMB 1343 ILORIN, KWARA STATE, 00000, NIGERIA",1119-944X,2408-6851,,J AGRIC EXT,J.

Both climatic hazards are known to produce impacts on human health such as mortality (due to heat waves) and morbidity (due to dusty weather). This work addresses possible climate adaptation policies in Tenerife assuming the increasing impact of heat waves and Saharan dust outbreaks in the island under a climate change scenario. It explores the institutional setting of climate change adaptation planning in Tenerife and evaluates the statu quo of adaptation planning in the island through the engagement of key social actors. An historical review of the local and regional press articles and legislation, an in-depth round of interviews, together with questionnaires to the main social actors allows framing the social and political context in which climate change adaptation in Tenerife is embedded. Key social actors were engaged, including international organisations, atmospheric research centres, local Universities, regional and insular governments, trade unions, and environmental NGOs, among others. The main obstacles mentioned by the social actors that hinder the development of an effective climate adaptation policy address scientific knowledge, data collection and policy making, focusing on the uncertainty of climate models, the lack of epidemiological data and contrasting opinions regarding the existing climate adaptation policies. Public participation, mainstreaming of climate policies and an integrated approach between mitigation and adaptation plans were identified as key policy issues.

Many rationales have been proposed to provide a purpose for urban forest management, some of which have been ineffective in addressing important ecological and social management themes. Among these rationales we find a values-based perspective, which sees management as a process where the desires of urban dwellers are met. Another perspective is climate change adaptation, which sees management as a process where urban forest vulnerability to climate change is reduced and resilience enhanced. Both these rationales have the advantage of complementing, enhancing, and broadening urban forest management objectives. A critical analysis of the literature on public values related to urban forests and climate change adaptation in the context of urban forests is undertaken to discuss what it means to adopt these two issues in urban forest management. The analysis suggests that by seeing urban forest management as a process by which public values are satisfied and urban-forest vulnerabilities to climate change are reduced, we can place issues such as naturalization, adaptive management, and engaging people in management at the centre of urban forest management. Focusing urban forest management on these issues may help ensure the success of programs focused on planting more trees and increasing citizen participation in urban forest management.

This study takes the case of a major cropping zone of Punjab province, Pakistan, which is reported among the climate-susceptible regions, to explore farmers' preferred ways of agricultural advisory and farmers' climate change adaptation measures. We also analyze the interrelation between different advisory services (conventional and information and communication technology (ICT)-delivered) and their adaptation behaviours. We use multivariate and ordered probit models to analyze the cross-sectional data collected from four districts of Punjab province, Pakistan. The descriptive results show that farmers have used diverse sources of farm advisory for climate change adaptation, where television and mobile agro-advisory appear to be the most used sources. Farmers have adapted to climate change by planting trees, adopting climate-smart seeds, shuffling crop cultivation schedules, using better water management practices, and diversifying cultivated crops. The empirical results reveal that farmers' socioeconomic attributes, particularly their farm and livestock herd sizes, access to irrigation water, and advisory access through face-to-face extension, television, and the internet, drive their adaptation choices and intensity. Our findings suggest that policymakers should consider improving these advisory services to expedite the adaptation of vulnerable rural communities.","[Khan, Nasir Abbas] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Risk Management & Emergency Decis Making, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Wanglin] Lincoln Univ, Fac Agribusiness andCommerce, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Owusu, Victor] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol KNUST, Dept Agr Econ Agribusiness & Extens, Kumasi, Ghana; [Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad] Hohai Univ, Res Ctr Environm & Soc, Sch Publ Adm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Khan, Nasir Abbas] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Risk Management & Emergency Decis Making, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Lincoln University - New Zealand; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Hohai University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Khan, NA (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Risk Management & Emergency Decis Making, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",nasirkhanpk@outlook.com,"Ma, Wanglin/M-7744-2019; Khan, Nasir Abbas/Z-3608-2019","Ma, Wanglin/0000-0001-7847-8459; Khan, Nasir Abbas/0000-0002-6079-715X",,,,,63,0,0,12,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This study employed the qualitative approach and revealed the farming practices of onion farmers. Onion farmers in the Philippines are between 38 to 57 years of age, male, married, and with high school level of educational attainment. The respondents described their experienced effects of climate change such as excessive coldness, excessive rainfall, inconsistent weather patterns, increased number of pests due to high humidity and excessive rainfall. Their climate change adaptation practices include adjusting the dates of planting season, constructing irrigation canals to prevent flooding, mulching, and using home-made pesticides. The finding of the study also revealed gaps in the scientific knowledge of onion farmers and it is recommended that interventions be developed to address these gaps. Further, it is recommended that the results of this study be forwarded to other academic, research units, and LGUs, in order to help them craft policies that will help onion farmers as they adapt to climate change.","[Quinones, John Rey B.; Ang, Roel S.] Nueva Ecija Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Arts & Sci, Cabanatuan City 3110, Philippines",Nueva Ecija University of Science & Techology,"Quinones, JRB (corresponding author), Nueva Ecija Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Arts & Sci, Cabanatuan City 3110, Philippines.",johnrey201334@gmail.com,,"Quinones, John Rey/0000-0002-4548-2424",,,,,20,0,0,1,3,HEALTH & ENVIRONMENT ASSOC,TIRANE,"HEALTH & ENVIRONMENT ASSOC, TIRANE, 00000, ALBANIA",2224-4980,,,INT J ECOSYST ECOL S,Int.

Adaptation to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa is different from that of developed countries, as resources are limited. This study was conducted in Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality in North West Province of South Africa. This study examined the determinants of climate change adaptation strategies among rural farmers' households in the study area. A total number of 346 questionnaires were administered to the farmers in the district using the stratified random sampling technique. Data were captured and analyzed using SPSS and EVIEWS software. Multicollinearity analysis was first performed to remove highly correlated variables from the model followed by the use of Tobit regression analysis. The results of the analysis indicated that farm size (p < 0.01), gender (p < 0.01), type of farm (p < 0.05), farm ownership (p < 0.05), land acquisition (p < 0.01), source of climate change information (p < 0.01), support received on climate change (p < 0.1), and adaptation barrier were statistically significant (p < 0.01) and influenced climate change adaptation strategies. The study concluded that to support climate change adaptation among the rural farmers in the study area, considerable attention should be paid to understanding the socio-economic characteristics of the rural households, source of information and support received on climate change.","[Oduniyi, O.

Yet, despite a move to reconceptualise adaptation as 'pathways of change and response' with a deeper temporal dimension, the past generally remains poorly integrated into adaptation studies. This is related to a disavowal of environmental determinism within the academic field of history, which has caused the past to be addressed from other disciplinary perspectives within climate change literature, leading to accusations of over-simplification and neo-determinism. Conversely, whilst a relatively small amount of research within the subdiscipline of historical climatology has engaged with theories from mainstream adaptation to understand societies in the past, there has been little influence in the other direction. Building on a comprehensive review and critique of existing approaches to historical climate-society research, we argue for three important areas where historians should engage with climate change adaptation. The first area we call particularizing adaptation; this is the development of long-term empirical studies that uncover societal relations to climate in a particular place - including climate's cultural - dimensions which can provide a baseline and contextualisation for climate change adaptation options. The second, institutional path dependency and memory, argues for a focus on the evolution of formal institutions with a responsibility for adaptation, to understand how historical events and decisions inform and constrain practices today. Our third argument is for an appreciation of the history of ideas and concepts that underpin climate change adaptation. We call for a second-order observation observation of the observers - within climate change research, to ensure that adaptation does not perpetuate historically-grown power structures.","[Adamson, George C.

While measures are being applied in federal forests and large private properties, it remains unclear how small-scale private forest owners, with a property < 20 ha, perceive the possible influence of climate change and whether they will approach required activities. While in the past, the majority of private forest owners had ties to agriculture and cultivated farmland alongside their forests, recent studies revealed new trends and significant deviations from established norms and beliefs. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the motivations for forest ownership, current management practices, and perception of and adaptability to climate change, to discuss successful approaches for information campaigns, advisory services, and monetary incentives. The study applied a questionnaire with an embedded choice experiment, which obtained a thorough understanding of the salient factors influencing decision-making by surveying 919 forest owners across Austria. Results show that small-scale private forest owners are not homogenous. Three distinct segments were identified (utility oriented, recreation oriented, and tradition conscious forest owners) which reacted differently to provided management options and incentives. However, even under a worst-case scenario setting, 84% of forest owners would select some sort of management over no procedure, indicating that forest management is not generally rejected. Information campaigns should rather focus on soft management leading to attractive, stable and highly diverse forest stands resilient to climate change than on cost efficiency and financial benefits. Therefore, advisory services need to convey, that all forest measures are performed with special care and under consideration of the remaining forest and that each stand is treated individually with adequate equipment. Increasing monetary incentives, such as funding, barely influences forest owners' decision-making and are therefore deemed unfeasible and unable to motivate the owners to undertake climate change adaptation measures. The study shows that a segmentation based on management behavior and preferences rather than on predefined characteristics has the potential to define a new state of the art. Overall, climate change adaptation through tailored forest management is highly supported by the presented findings.","[Mostegl, Nina M.; Proebstl-Haider, Ulrike] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Jandl, Robert] Austrian Res Ctr Forests, Seckendorff Gudent Weg 8, A-1131 Vienna, Austria; [Haider, Wolfgang] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Simon Fraser University","Mostegl, NM (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",nina.mostegl@boku.ac.at; ulrike.proebstl@boku.ac.at; robert.jandl@bfw.gv.at; whaider@sfu.ca,,,Austrian Climate and Energy Fund [B286281],Austrian Climate and Energy Fund,This work was supported by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (B286281) and conducted within the framework of the ACRP program.

The analysis considers the energy efficiency of different RETs as well as their socio-economic and environmental impacts. The efficient use of biomass in new technology, such as biogas and ICSs for cooking, has increased energy security and reduced the negative effects of traditional biomass usage. MH and SP systems are replacing candles and kerosene lamps, and are the most promising RET models for electricity generation in rural Nepal. The improved illumination from these technologies also produces better education, health, environments, and social harmony in rural communities. This study uses the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning model (LEAP) model to develop a plan for long-term RETs use in Nepal, and specifically focuses on household energy use in rural areas. It assesses the role of biogas and ICSs in rural communities and climate change adaptation in Nepal, along with the potential role of MH and SP technologies. According to the LEAP analysis, the planned implementation of MH for 20-year long-term will result in the reduction of 2.553 million tons of CO2 emissions. Similarly SP, biogas, and ICSs will result in a reduction in CO2 emissions of 5.214 million tons, 35.880 million tons, and 7.452 million tons, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results challenge previous assumptions that adaptation actions are not happening in Australia and describes adaptation processes that are underway. For the most part, actions can be described as preliminary or groundwork, with a particular focus on documenting stakeholder perspectives on climate change and attitudes towards adaptation, and modelling or scenario planning in the coastal zone, agriculture, and health sectors. Where concrete adaptations are reported, they are usually in the agricultural sector and are most common in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia's food basket.

However, successful implementation of climate change adaptation entails substantial financial investment. This study examines differences in Nepalese farming households' willingness to contribute to the implementation of adaptation programs across monetary and non-monetary modes of payments. To this end, we undertake discrete choice experiments with monetary payment and labor contributions as the payment vehicles. We find that farmers are interested in participating in and financially supporting the implementation of climate change adaptation initiatives that increase the availability of climate-adaptive crop varieties, improve soil quality, expand irrigation and build farmers' capacity in terms of climate-adaptive farming. Factors influencing farmers' participation in adaptation programs include age, income, access to extension services, size of land holdings, number of farm parcels, climate change perception and climate change experience. Furthermore, the findings reveal significant heterogeneity in the farmers' preferences across three agro-ecological regions in Nepal. Our findings also strengthen the methodological validity of the results of the choice experiment, which indicated that farmers are willing to pay significantly more when asked to make a payment in terms of a labor contribution compared to a monetary payment for the implementation of adaptation programs. Overall, the findings of this study justify the relevance of implementing agricultural adaptation programs in Nepal.","[Khanal, Uttam; Wilson, Clevo; Lee, Boon L.; Viet-Ngu Hoang] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Level 8,Z Block,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Fac Engn, Urban Inst,Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Kyushu University,"Managi, S (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Fac Engn, Urban Inst,Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan.",managi.s@gmail.com,"Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013; Lee, Boon/I-9858-2012","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427; Hoang, Viet-Ngu/0000-0002-9742-2378; Lee, Boon/0000-0002-3594-0575; Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495",,,,,47,4,4,3,19,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

Thus, the energy infrastructure we construct today must be capable of supplying reliable power in our future climate. This may require development of effective and financially viable climate change adaptation actions. This is challenging for energy infrastructure for a number of reasons, including, uncertainty about future climate, and lack of insight into the regional variability of adaptation feasibility. The work herein seeks to address these issues by using probabilistic and uncertainty modelling to examine the appropriateness of a single national climate adaptation strategy across five Australian regions under climate change scenarios. The feasibility of the climate adaptation strategy, which incorporates both alterations to network maintenance procedures and implementation of performance based design, was found to vary significantly across the five regions. The cost-benefit outcomes ranged from strongly positive for Brisbane and Sydney to negative for Perth. This regional variability highlights the difficulties associated with implementation of a nationwide climate adaptation strategy for energy infrastructure. The results, which represent valuable insight for asset managers and policymakers, thus highlight the need for detailed and regionally specific climate adaptation feasibility modelling to ensure cost-effective climate adaptation actions.","[Ryan, Paraic C.] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn, Discipline Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Cork, Ireland; [Ryan, Paraic C.] Univ Coll Cork, MaREI Ctr, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland; [Stewart, Mark G.] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Infrastruct Performance & Reliabil, Callaghan, NSW, Australia",University College Cork; University College Cork; University of Newcastle,"Ryan, PC (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn, Discipline Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Cork, Ireland.",paraic.ryan@ucc.ie,,"Ryan, Paraic/0000-0003-3767-8096; Stewart, Mark/0000-0001-6887-6533",Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Flagship Cluster Fund through the project Climate Adaption Engineering for Extreme Events; Sustainable Cities and Coasts Theme of the CSIRO Climate Adaption Flagship,Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Flagship Cluster Fund through the project Climate Adaption Engineering for Extreme Events; Sustainable Cities and Coasts Theme of the CSIRO Climate Adaption Flagship,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the technical input of Nathan Spencer of URI Engineering.

However, aquaculture has raised a range of environmental concerns, and further increases in aquaculture production will face widespread environmental challenges. The effects of climate change will pose a further threat to global aquaculture production. Aquaculture is often at risk from a combination of climatic variables, including cyclone, drought, flood, global warming, ocean acidification, rainfall variation, salinity, and sea level rise. For aquaculture growth to be sustainable its environmental impacts must reduce significantly. Adaptation to climate change is also needed to produce more fish without environmental impacts. Some adaptation strategies including integrated aquaculture, recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), and the expansion of seafood farming could increase aquaculture productivity, environmental sustainability, and climate change adaptability.","[Ahmed, Nesar; Thompson, Shirley] Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2M6, Canada; [Glaser, Marion] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Manitoba; Leibniz Zentrum fur Marine Tropenforschung (ZMT),"Ahmed, N (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2M6, Canada.",nesar.ahmed@umanitoba.ca,"Thompson, Shirley/ABI-6725-2020","Ahmed, Nesar/0000-0003-4133-697X","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation at the Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Research (ZMT) in Bremen, Germany","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation at the Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Research (ZMT) in Bremen, Germany","The study was supported through the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany.

This paper pushes beyond existing understandings of climate justice, which prioritise its distributive and procedural aspects. Through household surveys, interviews and participant observation, the paper presents a case study of a major adaptation project in a small island community in the Philippines, paying particular attention to its equity implications at the local level. It describes how local politics and power relations distorted the well-intentioned aims of the project and resulted in the project exacerbating, rather than alleviating, pre-existing inequality. Climate change adaptation is a deeply political process that is easily subverted by the interests of the powerful. To mitigate the influence of power and politics in future climate adaptation projects, we present an expanded multidimensional framework for assessing adaptative justice that incorporates the neglected aspects of recognition and structure.","[See, Justin; Wilmsen, Brooke] Univ Canberra, Ctr Sustainable Communities, Bruce, ACT 2617, Australia; [Wilmsen, Brooke] La Trobe Univ, Dept Social Inquiry, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",University of Canberra; La Trobe University,"See, J (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, Ctr Sustainable Communities, Bruce, ACT 2617, Australia.",justin.see@canberra.edu.au; b.wilmsen@latrobe.edu,"Wilmsen, Brooke/O-6333-2017","Wilmsen, Brooke/0000-0002-0970-7673; See, Justin/0000-0002-5934-1374","Internal Research Grant Scheme (IRGS) of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences (HUSS), La Trobe University [2018-1-HDR-0015]; CAUL","Internal Research Grant Scheme (IRGS) of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences (HUSS), La Trobe University; CAUL","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

While extensive research has focused on adaptation at the levels of communities, policies, and governance systems, there is limited understanding of adaptation at the level of individual behavioral responses. Individuals not only directly experience the adverse effects of wildfires but also shape their own exposure to wildfire through risk mitigation practices. Without knowledge of whether these behaviors are adaptive, decision makers are limited in their ability to design and assess climate change adaptation policies that improve outcomes in wildfire-prone regions. Likewise, greater understanding of the processes by which behavioral adaptation occurs can improve theories of behavior under risk, and specifically how psychological and social factors mediate the effects of hazard conditions on behavior. This paper reviews scholarship on biophysical, psychological, and social factors that shape behavioral adaptation to climate change in wildfire-prone forests. Our review highlights opportunities to improve theory and assist risk mitigation policy interventions by focusing greater attention on dynamic feedbacks involving hazards, behavior, and outcomes, as well as accounting for variation in behavior and wildfire hazard conditions.

Yet, the volume of information on adaptation is now difficult to manage given its vast scope and spread across journals, institutions, disciplines and themes. While an increasing number of researchers have used systematic literature reviews to analyse particular themes within this rapidly growing field of research, there is still missing an overall analysis of the current state of climate change adaptation science literature and its evolution. This paper fills this gap by providing a multifaceted bibliometric review of climate change adaptation science literature that is focused on the human dimensions and how it has been constructed across time, disciplines, social relationships and geographies. Our novel review, spanning from 1978 to mid-2020, identifies the underpinning foundations of climate change adaptation literature, leading authors, countries and organisations as well as dominant research themes and priorities and explores how these have changed over time. Our results show an annual average increase of 28.5% in climate change adaptation publications, with over 26,000 authors publishing on this topic, and increasing diversity in publishing sources. Priority research topics and themes have been dynamic over time, while some core concepts (vulnerability, resilience, adaptive capacity) and sectors (water, agriculture) have remained relatively stable. The key challenge going forward is how to consolidate this vast research endeavour into a more coherent adaptation theory that in turn can better guide science of adaptation and support adaptation policy and practice (science for adaptation).","[Nalau, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Adaptat Sci Res Grp, Cities Res Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Nalau, Johanna; Verrall, Brodie] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Verrall, Brodie] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Adaptat Sci Res Grp, Cities Res Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia.;Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",j.nalau@griffith.edu.au,"Verrall, Brodie/AAK-8827-2021; Verrall, Brodie/AAV-9753-2021; Nalau, Johanna/V-5692-2018","Verrall, Brodie/0000-0003-1747-3309; Nalau, Johanna/0000-0001-6581-3967",Australian Research Council's Discovery Early Career Research Award [DE190100940]; Australian Research Council [DE190100940] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council's Discovery Early Career Research Award(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Funding This research has been funded by the Australian Research Council's Discovery Early Career Research Award (Grant number DE190100940) .,,200,44,45,32,105,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

In both cases, cities are taking up the initiative to define adaptation strategies without waiting for state legislative acts. This article focuses on analysis of the ability of Urban Green Spaces to promote adaptation to climate change for both risk control and as an urban regeneration resource. With the analysis of two urban regeneration cases studied in zones affected by climate change, Red Hook in New York and Zorrotzaurre in Bilbao, the adaptation policies in the United States and Europe are studied. These cases allow a focus on how cities' capacities to establish initiatives for specific adaptation measures include Urban Green Spaces.

This is due to the increasing complexity in planning processes, which involve a multitude of stakeholders and decision-makers, whose responsibilities are not always entirely clear. Governance-oriented forms of decision making with horizontal structures are often required, but these also entail challenges. In our study, we ask how climate adaptation through urban green spaces can be integrated into planning processes. The study is based on a methodological combination, including document analysis and qualitative interviews with administrative staff. The City of Munich, a rapidly growing German city, serves as a case study. The results show different collaborative arrangements in four planning arenas and demonstrate how these structures support or hinder climate change adaptation mainstreaming. We conclude that hierarchical structures impede horizontal collaborative arrangements and shed lights on mechanisms reinforcing these structures. For large administrations, informal meetings and coordinating units are effective in fostering interdepartmental cooperation.","[Linke, Simone; Lang, Werner] Tech Univ Munich, Energy Efficient & Sustainable Design & Bldg, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Erlwein, Sabrina; van Lierop, Martina; Fakirova, Elizaveta; Pauleit, Stephan] Tech Univ Munich, Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich,"Linke, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Energy Efficient & Sustainable Design & Bldg, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",slinke@tum.de,,"Linke, Simone/0000-0003-2356-2172; Erlwein, Sabrina/0000-0002-7599-560X; Pauleit, Stephan/0000-0002-0056-6720",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LR1727A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (grant number: 01LR1727A).,,62,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,OCT,2022,11,10,,,,,,,1818,10.3390/land11101818,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11101818,,,27,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5P5CX,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000873169700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Over the past years, these discussions have been dominated by one analytical lens in examining barriers and proposing ways to overcome them: the problem solving lens. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the choice of analytical lens influences how barriers to adaptation are constructed and the intervention strategies proposed. Drawing from recent governance literature, we explore the rationale of three dominant philosophies in the study of governance: the optimist, the realist, and the pessimist philosophy. Next, we demonstrate how these philosophies are operationalized and guide scientific inquiry on barriers to adaptation through four empirically rooted analytical lenses: i) governance as problem solving, ii) governance as competing values and interests, iii) governance as institutional interaction, and iv) governance as dealing with structural constraints. We investigate the Dutch government's Spatial Adaptation to Climate Change programme through each of the four lenses. We discuss how each analytical lens frames barriers in a specific way, identifies different causes of barriers, leads to competing interpretations of key events, and presents other types of interventions to overcome barriers. We conclude that it is necessary to increase analytical variety in order to critically engage in theoretical debates about barriers and to empower policy practitioners in their search for successful intervention strategies to implement adaptation measures.","[Biesbroek, G.

Climate change adaptation and smart cities are emerging topics in the climate change and sustainability domain. Therefore, this paper aims to achieve a better understanding of policy consequences and exploring synergies of climate change adaptation and smart cities are valuable for both research and practice. Design/methodology/approach This paper systematically reviews synergies of smart city applications in urban climate change adaptation literature. A systematic literature review and content analysis are carried out to answer the research questions and a theoretically based smart cities concept matrix with synergetic coproduction theory is used to assess the empirical studies. Findings Key findings are that the model of synergetic coproduction could identify the benefits co-existing in smart city and climate change adaptation. While smart people and smart government play the fundamental roles, synergies could co-occur in other smart city dimensions. Smart city applications in climate change adaptation could increase competitiveness in cities by exploiting the opportunities as well as reducing the harmful risks. Originality/value This study combines two emerging topics in the assessment, climate change adaptation and smart cities, and represents a new way of assessing literature and possibly policy outcomes for the cities. By using the theoretical framework from smart cities and theory of coproduction, a theory-based framework is developed for assessing the empirical studies of climate adaptation in cities. The findings from the systematic literature review indicate relations among smart city dimensions in a clear manner and also identify the synergies of smart cities and climate adaptation.","[Huang-Lachmann, Jo-Ting] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Huang-Lachmann, JT (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Dresden, Germany.",jo-ting.huang-lachmann@tu-dresden.de,,"Huang-Lachmann, Jo-Ting/0000-0002-6711-2539",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) [915308999]; Graduate Academy of Travel Award; Smart City Institute HEC Liege,German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Graduate Academy of Travel Award; Smart City Institute HEC Liege,"The author would like to sincerely thank the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) for the scholarship which makes this research possible (grant number 915308999), as well as the Graduate Academy of Travel Award to support the participation in EMAN 2017 (The Environmental and Sustainability Management Accounting Network).

The purpose of this study is to provide empirical information on the challenges of cassava post-harvest adaptation to climate change. Design/methodology/approach - The study was conducted in two randomly selected states of southeast Nigeria. Data collection was done in two phases; first, there was a rapid rural appraisal and then a detailed survey using a questionnaire administered to 320 randomly selected cassava processors, 40 from each of eight randomly selected cassava farming communities. Findings - The respondents were predominantly women, who process, and grow cassava. The factors affecting their level of vulnerability were gender, household size and farm size. While women were more vulnerable than men, households with greater number of persons and/or larger farm size were less vulnerable. Women's vulnerability declined from the 25th income quantile through the 50th to the 75th while the positive effect of farm and household size increased through the same trend. Education was only positively important for the 75th income quantile. The factors constraining adaptation were scarcity of processing inputs, institutional, water and poverty constraints. Originality/value - Available literature show that most of the recent studies on climate change and agriculture have tended to concentrate on pre-harvest. Ozor et at studied barriers to climate change adaptation among farm households of southern Nigeria. Enete and Onyekuru studied empirical evidence of challenges of agricultural adaptation to climate change, also among farmers of southeast Nigeria. Enete and Amusa presented a literature survey of challenges of agricultural adaptation to climate change.

To this end, we first analyze farmers' perceptions on changes in local climatic condition, its impact and adaptations on agriculture based on information collected through a questionnaire survey of 720 farming households in six districts of Nepal. The findings reveal a widespread feeling of weather getting warmer, decreasing precipitation, and increasing weather unpredictability. It is found that climate change has adversely affected agriculture in Nepal, and farmers have adopted various adaptation practices to minimize the impacts. Second, we employ propensity score matching technique to examine the impact of CBOs on climate change adaptation. About 62% of the sampled farming households were associated with CBOs, and several socioeconomic factors influence such association. This study provides evidence supporting the argument that CBOs play important role in reducing the negative impacts of climate change by enhancing the adoption of adaptation strategies. It is also evident from the study the need of further strengthening and institutionalizing the informal farmers' groups and institutions for the successful adaptation.","[Khanal, Uttam; Wilson, Clevo; Viet-Ngu Hoang; Lee, Boon] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Level 8,Z Block,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Khanal, U (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Level 8,Z Block,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",utkhanal@gmail.com; clevo.wilson@qut.edu.au; vincent.hoang@qut.edu.au; bl.lee@qut.edu.au,"; Lee, Boon/I-9858-2012","Hoang, Viet-Ngu/0000-0002-9742-2378; Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495; Lee, Boon/0000-0002-3594-0575",,,,,50,16,16,2,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

The governing bodies of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are encouraging parties to adopt 'ecosystem-based adaptation' (EbA) approaches, which utilise biodiversity and ecosystem services to support climate change adaptation. These approaches are wide ranging and include mangrove restoration to buffer against storm surges; watershed management to protect against droughts and floods; rangeland management to prevent desertification; and sustainable management of fisheries and forests to ensure food security. This article examines the emergence of EbA in international legal frameworks for climate change and biodiversity and progress towards implementation. The EbA concept is potentially powerful in catalysing international and national commitments to act due to its key defining features of a focus on societal adaptation rather than ecocentricism, and a targeting of the immediate adaptation needs of the poorest and most vulnerable communities who are adversely affected by climate change. However, examination of national policy and practice in two least developed countries, Samoa and Cambodia, reveals that institutional and legal barriers at national level can pose significant challenges to operationalising EbA to achieve adaptation objectives.","Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Chong, J (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",joanne.chong@uts.edu.au,,"Chong, Joanne/0000-0001-9035-2277",,,,,70,51,53,1,152,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Despite the advances reported in the literature, adaptation to climate change is still considered a challenge to move from planning to the practical implementation of successful interventions. In this regard, identifying international key barriers, exchanges of experiences and lessons learned may facilitate the progress of the coasts' sustainable and resilient future. The coast of Mexico is an excellent study area. High population densities occur along the coastal zone, whose main economic activity is related to primary and tertiary sectors. Additionally, a great diversity of coastal ecosystems exists, which are threatened by anthropogenic and hydrometeorological impacts. Under these circumstances, the population is becoming aware of the urgent need to adapt to the consequences of climate change. In this sense, this paper reviews research contributions concerning population perception to climate change and adaptation strategies in Mexico's coastal zone. The findings highlight critical institutional difficulties and social barriers that have impeded the effective implementation of adaptation strategies to climate change in Mexico and consider steps to address them. However, adaptation strategies that show the prevention culture of some coastal communities have been found and also results of successful projects carried out, especially on mangrove forest and coral reef restoration, which are of essential importance to consider to progress on the path of a successful adaptation to climate change in Mexico.","[Escudero, Mireille; Mendoza, Edgar] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Mendoza, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico.",mescuderoc@iingen.unam.mx; emendozab@iingen.unam.mx,"Mendoza, Edgar/AFU-5158-2022","Mendoza, Edgar/0000-0002-1991-4721; Escudero Castillo, Mireille del Carmen/0000-0002-3832-6503",CONACYT-SENER-Sustentabilidad Energetica project: 'Centro Mexicano de Innovacion en Energia del Oceano (CEMIE-Oceano)' [FSE-2014-06-249795],CONACYT-SENER-Sustentabilidad Energetica project: 'Centro Mexicano de Innovacion en Energia del Oceano (CEMIE-Oceano)',This research was funded by the CONACYT-SENER-Sustentabilidad Energetica project: FSE-2014-06-249795 'Centro Mexicano de Innovacion en Energia del Oceano (CEMIE-Oceano)'.,,77,1,1,3,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2021,13,18,,,,,,,2483,10.3390/w13182483,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13182483,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,UZ2YI,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000702075500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unequal power relationships amongst upper and lower castes has indeed been identified has a major driver of people's vulnerability to natural hazards, including the negative effects of climate change, in Nepal and elsewhere in South Asia. However, this does not prevent the members of all these castes, including the lowest untouchables, to display significant capacities in facing these natural hazards and changes in climate patterns. It is therefore similarly important to harness those capacities and address the unequal power relationships underpinning vulnerability. Achieving these goals requires fostering dialogue amongst upper and lower castes as well as with other stakeholders of DRR and CCA, e.g. scientists, NGOs, government agencies, which often tend to work with a single caste because it is easier. P3DM provides a platform for such a dialogue as it makes the knowledge of every caste tangible and credible to others.

We argue that science-based role-play simulation exercises - a type of 'serious game' involving face-to-face mock decision-making - have considerable potential as education and engagement tools for enhancing readiness to adapt. Prior research suggests role-play simulations and other serious games can foster public learning and encourage collective action in public policy-making contexts. However, the effectiveness of such exercises in the context of climate change adaptation education and engagement has heretofore been underexplored. We share results from two research projects that demonstrate the effectiveness of role-play simulations in cultivating climate change adaptation literacy, enhancing collaborative capacity and facilitating social learning. Based on our findings, we suggest such exercises should be more widely embraced as part of adaptation professionals' education and engagement toolkits.","[Rumore, Danya] Univ Utah, SJ Quinney Coll Law, Wallace Stegner Ctr, Environm Dispute Resolut Program, 383 South Univ St, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Rumore, Danya] Univ Utah, Dept City & Metropolitan Planning, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Schenk, Todd] Virginia Tech, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Urban Affairs & Planning, 207 Architecture Annex 0113,140 Otey St NW, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Susskind, Lawrence] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, 9-332,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Rumore, D (corresponding author), Univ Utah, SJ Quinney Coll Law, Wallace Stegner Ctr, Environm Dispute Resolut Program, 383 South Univ St, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.;Rumore, D (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept City & Metropolitan Planning, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",danya.rumore@law.utah.edu,"Susskind, Lawrence E/I-3320-2013","Susskind, Lawrence E/0000-0001-9460-198X; /0000-0002-3434-1319","University of New Hampshire; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA09NOS4190153, 11.419]; Dutch Knowledge for Climate Program through TNO; Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School; Tufts-MIT Water Diplomacy Program",University of New Hampshire; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Dutch Knowledge for Climate Program through TNO; Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School; Tufts-MIT Water Diplomacy Program,"The New England Climate Adaptation Project was supported with funding from the University of New Hampshire and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under Cooperative Agreement no.

Yet, adaptation theorising and practises remain overwhelmingly situated within Euromodern ontologies, and there remains limited space, at present, for plural ontologies or alternative ways of being and knowing. In this paper, and using the Pacific as our case study, we present an argument for the inclusion of multiple ontologies within adaptation policymaking. Pacific adaptation policies and interventions frequently privilege Western scientific knowledge and focus on addressing individual climate risks through technical fixes directed by foreign experts and funding agencies. They are also rooted in a policy architecture that is an artefact of colonisation in the region. Despite these obstacles, Pacific Islander responses to climate change are dynamic, and inclusive of the multiple and competing ontologies they work within, offering insights into how Euromodern and Pacific islander world views could coalesce to builds adaptive capacity and consolidate community resilience into the future.

Culture and the resulting worldview are determinants of behaviour and eminent cultural beliefs are that of time orientation (TO) and social self-construal (SSC). To date, no research focuses on these beliefs from an indigenous South African perspective or the manner in which it may subsequently affect a community's adaptation towards climate change. Q-methodology was used to study perspectives and beliefs in three per!-urban communities in South Africa and to investigate the interrelation between themes such as TO, SSC, climate change awareness and climate change causality. It became apparent that the communities are aware of climate change, yet little to no efforts are currently being made to adapt to climatic change. This absence of motivation to adapt may be attributed to limited risk perception and cultural beliefs of TO and SSC. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of cultural beliefs and its impact on climate change adaptation behaviour in the South African context.

In doing so, the paper takes a novel perspective by going beyond the dominant emphasis in the Green IS literature on climate change mitigation to focus on climate change adaptation. To demonstrate how IS researchers and practitioners can engage with the grand challenge of sustainability, we report the findings of an investigation into the role of IS in climate change adaptation programmes of the government of New South Wales, Australia. Canonical action research, informed by activity theory, proved to be an appropriate methodology for this investigation by combining iterative collaborative engagement and rigorous scholarly reflection. Activity theory has previously been successfully used in IS research as a framework for inquiry and description but not for prediction. This raised questions, addressed in this study, about whether or not activity theory could be used to guide interventions and make sense of their impact. The findings reveal how activity theory provides an appropriate balance between scope and detail to accommodate the complex processes of planning and implementing climate change adaptation programmes. We conclude that while climate adaptation is complex, activity theory, specifically five dynamic dimensions for deep sense-making, can inform interventions in climate change adaptation projects. Most significantly, we demonstrate that IS experts can make a positive contribution to addressing one of the most important grand challenges of our time.","[Hasan, Helen] Univ Wollongong, Australian Hlth Serv Res Inst, Informat Syst, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Smith, Stephen] Macquarie Univ, Sch Comp, Informat Syst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Finnegan, Patrick] UNSW Australia, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Wollongong; Macquarie University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Hasan, H (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Australian Hlth Serv Res Inst, Informat Syst, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.",hasan@uow.edu.au; stephen.smith@mq.edu.au; p.finnegan@unsw.edu.au,"Smith, Stephen/I-8396-2018","Smith, Stephen/0000-0003-2966-5762",,,,,85,23,23,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1350-1917,1365-2575,,INFORM SYST J,Inf.

Households are an increasing focus of attention, but more in the developing world than the developed world, because of the presumed lesser vulnerabilities and stronger adaptive capacities of the latter. Critiques of such presumptions, and the quantitative, macro-scale focus of much adaptation research are emergent. How relatively affluent households, as complex social assemblages, may adapt to climate change impacts encountered in their day-to-day functioning remains unclear. There is, however, a sizeable body of research on household environmental sustainability in the developed world. That research has significant implications for climate change adaptation. This paper brings household environmental sustainability research into productive conversation with the climate change adaptation literature. The former shows that sustainability issues are refracted through social relations within households, and the demands of everyday life. This has three implications for how adaptation needs to be re-framed. First, climate change will not be experienced only via climatic stimuli and extreme weather events. It will be entwined in the complexity of everyday life. Second, knowledge of climate change is not a prerequisite for household adaptive capacity. Third, household-scale analyses show that assumed capacities and vulnerabilities may end up being quite different to those imagined or measured at a macro-scale. These insights invite consideration of how householders' adaptive capacities can be better supported.","[Toole, Stephanie; Klocker, Natascha] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Head, Lesley] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Wollongong; University of Melbourne,"Klocker, N (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.",natascha_klocker@uow.edu.au,,"Klocker, Natascha/0000-0001-7526-3292; Head, Lesley/0000-0002-5114-7614; Toole, Stephanie/0000-0002-5111-7378",,,,,36,41,42,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

This review assesses the current state of implementation of climate change adaptation into fisheries management policies and legislation across 11 national case studies, based on government documents and the primary literature. The overarching goal is to understand the key elements and gaps in existing fisheries management policies and legislation in the context of climate change. Given recent reforms of fisheries management policies and/or legislation across the nations examined, political recognition of the need to address climate change adaptation in fisheries management appears to be increasing; albeit formal mandates of climate-adaptation objectives in fisheries management are largely missing. Based on our review, recommendations for achieving climate-adaptive fisheries management regimes are developed. Overall, this study will help to inform and broaden the scope of management approaches and tools to accelerate the move towards adaptive fisheries management that accounts for climate change impacts on fish stocks, fisheries and the societies that depend upon them.","[Bryndum-Buchholz, Andrea; Tittensor, Derek P.; Lotze, Heike K.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Bryndum-Buchholz, A (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",andrea.buchholz@dal.ca,,,Hempel Foundation; Jarislowsky Foundation; NSERC CREATE Transatlantic Ocean Science and Technology Program (TOSST); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2014-04491]; Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network,Hempel Foundation; Jarislowsky Foundation; NSERC CREATE Transatlantic Ocean Science and Technology Program (TOSST); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network,"Hempel Foundation; Jarislowsky Foundation; NSERC CREATE Transatlantic Ocean Science and Technology Program (TOSST); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: RGPIN--2014--04491; Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network",,214,11,11,10,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1467-2960,1467-2979,,FISH FISH,Fish.

Despite the many unknowns about what determines farmers' adaptation, traditional knowledge on landraces (LRs) cultivation has demonstrated great potential for community-based climate change adaptation. The present study heightens our understanding of the Romanian farmers' perceptions of climate change, their actual on-farm adaptation measures, and the driving and constraint factors towards their decision to cultivate LRs. Drawing on a survey on farmers, we found that those who face an increased number of crops damaged due to extreme climatic events are more likely to cultivate LRs. Findings point to the widespread adoption of LRs as a measure of climate change adaptation. The taste, healthiness, and environmental adaptability attributes are considered the most important reasons Romanian farmers cultivate LRs. The study provides supportive evidence for decision-makers to develop appropriate strategies and institutional responses for on-farm climate adaptation strategies bringing the contribution of LRs to the fore.","[Petrescu-Mag, Ruxandra Malina; Muntean, Octavian-Liviu; Tenter, Ancuta Radu] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Environm Sci & Engn, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Petrescu-Mag, Ruxandra Malina; Petrescu, Dacinia Crina; Azadi, Hossein] Univ Liege, Unit Econ & Rural Dev, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Gembloux, Belgium; [Petrescu, Dacinia Crina] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Business, 7 Horea St, Cluj Napoca 400174, Romania; [Petrescu-Mag, Ioan Valentin] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Cluj Napoca, Fac Agr, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Petrescu-Mag, Ioan Valentin] Univ Oradea, Oradea, Romania; [Azadi, Hossein] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; University of Liege; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; University of Agricultural Sciences & Veterinary Medicine Cluj Napoca; University of Oradea; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Petrescu, DC (corresponding author), Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Business, 7 Horea St, Cluj Napoca 400174, Romania.;Petrescu, DC (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Fac Econ & Rural Dev, Passage Deportes 2, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.",crina.petrescu@ubbcluj.ro,"Azadi, Hossein/E-2361-2011; Petrescu, Dacinia Crina/A-6540-2017; Petrescu-Mag, Ruxandra Malina/Z-1391-2018","Azadi, Hossein/0000-0002-5108-1993; Petrescu, Dacinia Crina/0000-0002-5716-9793; Petrescu-Mag, Ruxandra Malina/0000-0001-7048-4598","STAR UBB, Babes-Bolyai University, Romania","STAR UBB, Babes-Bolyai University, Romania","The research was partially supported through the fellowship Inclusive economic and climate resilience through the promotion of landraces with good production capacity and ecological adaptability: developing policy recommendations; grant type Advanced Fellowships -Internal; Excellency in the Activity of Research-Development-Innovation, granted by STAR UBB, Babes-Bolyai University, Romania, developed within ISUMADECIP, Babes-Bolyai University, Romania.",,127,2,2,4,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,FEB 1,2022,27,2,,,,,229,250,,10.1080/13549839.2022.2033966,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2022.2033966,,FEB 2022,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,ZL5IM,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000753322800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While adaptation to climate change in unitary states is mainly concerned with mainstreaming or integrating respective goals and measures horizontally into a variety of sectors, federal states such as Austria or Germany add a vertical dimension to the challenge: here more than anywhere else, climate change adaptation also requires coordination between federal and provincial governments. While the literature on environmental federalism suggests that federal states are ill-equipped to protect global public goods but have advantages in solving local environmental problems, it is unclear how helpful federalism is in addressing local impacts of a global problem. We address this gap by exploring to what extent two sectors highly vulnerable to climate change but rarely subject to policy analyses flood protection and tourism embrace adaptation at and across federal, provincial and local levels of government in Austria. With regard to horizontal mainstreaming, the paper shows that both sectors struggle with adaptation issues in their own ways. With regard to vertical mainstreaming, it reveals strong coordination and support functions of the provinces (in particular in flood protection). Since municipalities are often overwhelmed by the complexities of climate change, we conclude that federal systems could prove helpful in mediating between national guidance and local adaption measures.","[Clar, Christoph] Univ Bodenkultur Wien, BOKU, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Clar, C (corresponding author), Univ Bodenkultur Wien, BOKU, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",christoph.clar@boku.ac.at; reinhard.steurer@boku.ac.at,,"Steurer, Reinhard/0000-0002-5000-7046",,,,,75,2,2,0,21,FACULTAS VERLAGS & BUCHHANDELS AG,VIENNA,"BERGGASSE 5, VIENNA, A-1090, AUSTRIA",1615-5548,,,OSTERR Z POLITWISS,Osterr.

The conventional approach to study local institutional roles focuses on how institutions can support climate change adaptation with little emphasis to other institutional dimensions. Thus, the current study deconstructs the conventional institutional roles in climate change adaptation to reframe them on broader institutional dimensions inspired by Young (2002). Data were collected from households, experts and community leaders on institutional frontiers of local public local institution. The study used mixed methods to analyse the data. The findings indicated that despite the presence of institutional set ups, most of the national policy provisions had not been implemented at local levels due to various reasons. Further, even the implemented policies had limited success because of lack of participation in policy making processes, absence of policy implementation guidelines and limited institutional capacity. The study also revealed very weak coordination among institutions working on climate change adaptation. As the result, climate adaptation policy implementation lack continuity, monitoring and evaluation system, and failed to yield transformative changes to the farmers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to participate, capacitate, and synergize local institutions, and establish policy monitoring and evaluation system so that national policy provisions can yield intended results.","[Matewos, Tafesse] Hawassa Univ, Awasa, Ethiopia; [Matewos, Tafesse] NMBU, As, Norway",Hawassa University; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Matewos, T (corresponding author), Hawassa Univ, Awasa, Ethiopia.;Matewos, T (corresponding author), NMBU, As, Norway.",tafessemk@gmail.com,,,,,,,60,6,7,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

A significant share of the Northern European housing stock is owned and maintained by large stock owners, such as housing associations. It is their responsibility to be aware of changes and risks that might challenge the quality of life of their tenants. Moreover, in order to provide housing with a good market value in the future, adaptation to climate change can no longer be overlooked. With the aim to discover the level of awareness of climate change adaptation among Dutch housing associations, a content analysis was undertaken on the policy plans and the annual reports of the 25 largest housing associations. Subsequently they were classified according to their level of awareness. The analysis returned no topics that directly referred to climate change adaptation, which implies that all housing associations are categorised as being 'unaware'. Therefore, in order to reach higher levels of awareness and to incentivize the implementation of adaptation measures, appropriate governance strategies need to be developed. Future research will define the characteristics of these strategies in relation to the level of awareness of the housing associations. Adoption of the measures could be easier if adaptation measures are combined with maintenance activities, as this has been the case with mitigation measures.","[Roders, Martin; Straub, Ad; Visscher, Henk] Delft Univ Technol, OTB Res Inst Built Environm, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Roders, M (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, OTB Res Inst Built Environm, POB 5030, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",m.j.roders@tudelft.nl,"Visscher, Henk/R-8509-2017","Visscher, Henk/0000-0003-0929-1812; Straub, Ad/0000-0003-1018-9516; Roders, Martin/0000-0002-2844-4442",,,,,47,3,3,0,9,OPEN HOUSE INT,GREAT BRITAIN,"URBAN INTERNATIONAL PRESS, PO BOX 74, GATESHEAD, TYNE & WEAR, GREAT BRITAIN, NE9 5UZ, ENGLAND",0168-2601,,,OPEN HOUSE INT,Open House Int.,DEC,2012,37,4,,,,,61,71,,,,,,11,Architecture; Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Architecture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,068SZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000313387800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three of the basins, namely the Elbe, Guadiana, and Rhine, are located in Europe, the Nile Equatorial Lakes region and the Orange basin are in Africa, and the Amudarya basin is in Central Asia. The evaluation was based mainly on the opinions of policy makers and water management experts in the river basins. The adaptation strategies were evaluated considering the following issues: expected climate change, expected climate change impacts, drivers for development of adaptation strategy, barriers for adaptation, state of the implementation of a range of water management measures, and status of adaptation strategy implementation. The analysis of responses and cross-comparison were performed with rating the responses where possible. According to the expert opinions, there is an understanding in all six regions that climate change is happening. Different climate change impacts are expected in the basins, whereas decreasing annual water availability, and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts (and to a lesser extent floods) are expected in all of them. According to the responses, the two most important drivers for development of adaptation strategy are: climate-related disasters, and national and international policies. The following most important barriers for adaptation to climate change were identified by responders: spatial and temporal uncertainties in climate projections, lack of adequate financial resources, and lack of horizontal cooperation. The evaluated water resources management measures are on a relatively high level in the Elbe and Rhine basins, followed by the Orange and Guadiana. It is lower in the Amudarya basin, and the lowest in the NEL region, where many measures are only at the planning stage. Regarding the level of adaptation strategy implementation, it can be concluded that the adaptation to climate change has started in all basins, but progresses rather slowly.","[Krysanova, Valentina] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Dickens, Chris; Pringle, Kate] Inst Nat Resources, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Timmerman, Jos] Minist Transport Publ Works & Water Management, The Hague, Netherlands; [Varela-Ortega, Consuelo; Blanco, Irene; Esteve, Paloma] Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Schlueter, Maja] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Berlin, Germany; [Roest, Koen; Jaspers, Fons] Alterra, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Huntjens, Patrick; Pahl-Wostl, Claudia] Univ Osnabruck, Osnabruck, Germany; [Buiteveld, Hendrik] Ctr Water Management, Lelystad, Netherlands; [Moreno, Edinson; Carrera, Javier de Pedraza; Kabat, Pavel] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Martinkova, Marta] T G Masaryk Water Res Inst, Prague, Czech Republic; [Slamova, Romana] Inst Hydrodynam AS CR, Prague, Czech Republic",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Wageningen University & Research; University Osnabruck; Wageningen University & Research; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Hydrodynamics of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Krysanova, V (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany.",krysanova@pik-potsdam.de,"Slamova, Romana/J-7976-2017; Kabat, Pavel/AAJ-2245-2020; Timmerman, Jos/AAR-8238-2021; Esteve, Paloma/Y-6746-2019; Blanco-Gutiérrez, Irene/A-4665-2013; Krysanova, Valentina/AAR-2324-2020; Dickens, Chris/P-7379-2019; Martinkova, Marta/AAX-8798-2020","Slamova, Romana/0000-0001-8466-7512; Timmerman, Jos/0000-0002-3421-2103; Esteve, Paloma/0000-0003-1216-9156; Blanco-Gutiérrez, Irene/0000-0002-6105-3339; Dickens, Chris/0000-0002-4251-7767; Martinkova, Marta/0000-0002-7253-0209",NeWater project: New approaches to Adaptive Water Management under Uncertainty [511179],NeWater project: New approaches to Adaptive Water Management under Uncertainty,"The study was performed in the framework of NeWater project: New approaches to Adaptive Water Management under Uncertainty, contract No. 511179.

The results show that farmers were very willing to be informed about both climate change (predictions) and documented adaptation (strategies). However, they are willing to pay more for documented climate change adaptation strategies than for climate change predictions. The Heckman probit and seemingly unrelated regression models highlighted that age, gender, level of education, experience in agriculture, access to credit, organization membership, contact with extension, perception of and adaptation to climate change, and farm size have differential effects on farmers' behaviours towards agricultural extension services related to climate change.","[Yegbemey, Rosaine Nerice; Bauer, Siegfried] Univ Giessen, Inst Project & Reg Planning, Fac Agr Nutr & Environm Management, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Heubach, Katja] Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr Frankfurt, D-60325 Giessen, Germany; [Nuppenau, Ernst-August] Univ Giessen, Inst Agr & Market Res, Fac Agr Sci Nutr Sci & Environm Management, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Yegbemey, RN (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Inst Project & Reg Planning, Fac Agr Nutr & Environm Management, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",yrosaine@hotmail.fr,"Yegbemey, Rosaine N/J-8860-2013; Yegbemey, Rosaine Nérice/AAV-1497-2020","Yegbemey, Rosaine N/0000-0003-2051-0289; Yegbemey, Rosaine Nérice/0000-0003-2051-0289",,,,,25,9,9,3,36,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Recently, the number of comparative adaptation policy cases has increased, focusing on examining, describing, and/or explaining how countries, regions, and vulnerable groups are adapting across a larger sample of contexts and over time. There are, however, critical empirical, conceptual and methodological choices and challenges for comparative adaptation research. This article systematically captures and assesses the current state of larger-n (n 20 cases) comparative adaptation policy literature. We systematically analyze 72 peer-reviewed articles to identify the key choices and challenges authors face when conducting their research. We find among others that almost all studies use nonprobability sampling methods, few existing comparative adaptation datasets exist, most studies use easy accessible data which might not be most appropriate for the research question, many struggle to disentangle rhetoric from reality in adaptation, and very few studies engage in critical reflection of their conceptual, data and methodological choices and the implications for their findings.

Design/methodology/approach A survey questionnaire was used to collect data for the study. The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) was calculated for 134 female and 239 male-headed households. Descriptive statistics were synthesized to investigate climate change adaptation from the gender perspective. Findings The results show that the LVI of female-headed households is higher than male-headed households, but the variation is negligible. In addition, female and male farmers in the study area use different methods to adapt to climate change. Female farmers have critically contributed to the family workforce and climate change adaptation. Nevertheless, female farmers have less accessibility to agricultural services such as training and credit. Research limitations/implications The study suggests that gendered interventions for improvement of livelihood to adapt to climate change should be developed for each aspect of the livelihood. Furthermore, enhancement of services for women and recognition of women's roles in responding to climate change would contribute to more active adaptation to climate change. Originality/value Studies on climate change from the gender perspective in Vietnam have been conducted on a limited scale. Particularly, there are very limited studies on climate change in association with gender issue in North Vietnam. Thus, this study will provide more insights into the gender dimension of climate change vulnerability and adaptation so that gender-based adaptation strategies can be developed.","[Nong, Ha Thi Thuy; Gan, Christopher] Lincoln Univ, Dept Business & Finance, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Hu, Baiding] Lincoln Univ, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Christchurch, New Zealand",Lincoln University - New Zealand; Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Nong, HTT (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Dept Business & Finance, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Christchurch, New Zealand.",ThiThuyHa.Nong@lincolnuni.ac.nz; Christopher.Gan@Lincoln.ac.nz; Baiding.Hu@Lincoln.ac.nz,,,New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade,New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade,"This study is part of a Ph.

Adaptation is identified as one of the options to reduce the negative impact of the change. This study identified the adaptation techniques employed by farmers and analyze factors that determine the adaptation techniques among farmers in the study area. Descriptive statistics and multinomial logit were used to analyze data obtained from a cross-sectional survey of 10 villages in two local government areas of Osun State. The analysis of perception of farmers to climate change revealed a high increase in temperature, and decrease in rainfall. The result showed that six adaptation methods were employed by the farmers. The result also showed that explanatory variables compared to the null model give better accuracy for no adaptation, early and late planting, and tree planting. Moreover, the analysis of factors affecting adaptation to climate change indicates that, access to loan and livestock ownership compared to the rest of explanatory variables has more significant impact on adaptation. It is recommended that policy makers should enlighten the farmers more on the danger of climate change to productivity of crops and livestock and provide necessary logistics to support various alternative course of action.","[Sofoluwe, N.

Climate change has been implicated in the dwindling productivity of the Ghanaian cocoa sub-sector, although deforestation for cocoa farmland expansion poses significant long-term risks to ecosystem stability and environmental conservation. This study assessed farmers' perception of climate change, their adaptation methods and the factors explaining involvement in the renovation/rehabilitation of old cocoa farms. The data were collected from 378 cocoa farmers in Ahafo Ano North District in the Ashanti region. The data were analysed with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Ordinary Least Square regression, Negative Binomial regression and Two-stage Probit regression. The results showed that the majority of the farmers were older than 50 years and attained primary education. High temperature (64.29%), too stormy rainfall (64.29%) and too much rainfall (61.90%) were largely perceived by cocoa farmers in 2015. The farmers were adapting to climate change through diversification into other crops (70.63%), planting of hybrid varieties (71.69%), commitment to spray cocoa pods regularly (74.87%) and initiation of some changes in the planting and harvesting times (71.96%). The adaptation was significantly influenced (p < 0.05) by cocoa farming experience, number of children under the age of 5 years, perception of extremely high temperature, perception too low rainfall, perception of delay in commencement of rainfall, cultivation of cocoa as the primary crop, perception of delay in rainfall stop and delay in regular farm clearing and rented farm. Cocoa rehabilitation decision was influenced by climate change adaptation indicator, monthly income, perception of extreme temperature and sharecropping. The implications of the results were that promotion of climate change perception would facilitate adaptation, and the form of cocoa farmland ownership as well as climate change adaptation indicator influenced farmers' involvement in cocoa farm rehabilitation.","[Oyekale, Abayomi Samuel] North West Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Mafikeng Campus, ZA-2735 Mmabatho, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Oyekale, AS (corresponding author), North West Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Mafikeng Campus, ZA-2735 Mmabatho, South Africa.",asoyekale@gmail.com,,,"North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, through my Institutional Research Excellence Awards (IREAs)","North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, through my Institutional Research Excellence Awards (IREAs)","The data collection activities were funded by the North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, through my Institutional Research Excellence Awards (IREAs).",,46,2,2,3,8,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",2391-9531,,,OPEN AGRIC,Open Agric.,APR 3,2021,6,1,,,,,263,275,,10.1515/opag-2020-0191,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2020-0191,,,13,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture,RL7BX,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000639124900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we present the results of a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature reporting the effects on health of climate change adaptation responses in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The review used the 'Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative' database (comprising 1682 publications related to climate change adaptation responses) that was constructed through systematic literature searches in Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar (2013-2020). For this study, further screening was performed to identify studies from LMICs reporting the effects on human health of climate change adaptation responses. Studies were categorised by study design and data were extracted on geographic region, population under investigation, type of adaptation response and reported health effects. The review identified 99 studies (1117 reported outcomes), reporting evidence from 66 LMICs. Only two studies were ex ante formal evaluations of climate change adaptation responses. Papers reported adaptation responses related to flooding, rainfall, drought and extreme heat, predominantly through behaviour change, and infrastructural and technological improvements. Reported (direct and intermediate) health outcomes included reduction in infectious disease incidence, improved access to water/sanitation and improved food security. All-cause mortality was rarely reported, and no papers were identified reporting on maternal and child health. Reported maladaptations were predominantly related to widening of inequalities and unforeseen co-harms. Reporting and publication-bias seems likely with only 3.5% of all 1117 health outcomes reported to be negative. Our review identified some evidence that climate change adaptation responses may have benefits for human health but the overall paucity of evidence is concerning and represents a major missed opportunity for learning. There is an urgent need for greater focus on the funding, design, evaluation and standardised reporting of the effects on health of climate change adaptation responses to enable evidence-based policy action.","[Scheelbeek, Pauline F.

While the importance of just and equitable climate change adaptation is well understood, the policy and politics that underlie such efforts are less well understood. This paper focuses on the development of just climate change adaptation strategies in legacy cities, particularly those in the Great Lakes region of the U.S., where the challenges and opportunities for climate change adaptation are particularly high. Detroit, Michigan and Cleveland, Ohio are used as illustrative case studies. These cities are two of the only two legacy cities of the Great Lakes region to have developed formal and explicit adaptation plans, and foregrounded justice and equity early in the process. A review of planning documents, and interviews with key stakeholders, in the two cities are used to identify the components of justice being included in climate change adaptation planning, the drivers or motivations for foregrounding justice in their adaptation planning, and the policy tools being used or developed to reach these goals. The findings reveal an awareness among stakeholders and decision makers in both cities of the importance of addressing inequality in climate change adaptation, some attention to justice principles in the adaptation plans themselves, and a diverse set of policy tools emerging to support this work. Importantly, despite relatively modest ambitions for climate change adaptation, both cities face implementation challenges that are likely to be common among legacy cities of the region.","[Hughes, Sara] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Hughes, S (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",hughessm@umich.edu,,"Hughes, Sara/0000-0002-1282-6235",,,,,58,18,19,9,56,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Considerable literature highlights that local knowledge can play an important role in climate change adaptation, particularly in small island countries. However, there is less understanding on how to practically integrate and apply local knowledge in climate change adaptation, particularly in the Cook Islands. This research investigated the role of local knowledge in climate change adaptation in the Cook Islands, aiming to understand the role of local knowledge in adaptation policies and the challenges of incorporating local knowledge into climate change adaptation policy through semistructured interviews with key informants and local participants. Key informants often recognized the important role of local knowledge in climate change adaptation while local knowledge was less recognized by local participants. Concerns over both the usefulness of the knowledge today and the loss of this knowledge were expressed. Additionally, challenges to integrating local knowledge into climate change policy were identified, including development pressure, out-migration, and a lack of understanding of local knowledge. This study offers insight into the role of local knowledge in climate change adaptation for other small island countries facing similar challenges.","[de Scally, Diamir; Doberstein, Brent] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Doberstein, B (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",bdoberst@uwaterloo.ca,,"Doberstein, Brent/0000-0001-8891-7400",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [766-2016-0861],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [grant number 766-2016-0861].,,76,0,0,5,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Besides displacing fossil fuels, in particular kerosene for lighting, microhydro electrification offers an effective way of improving community assets and bolstering social resilience (thereby enhancing the adaptive capacity of communities there). Our own survey of REDP project sites reveals how microhydro units have improved community income levels, equalized gender roles, enhanced access to education and information, and reduced migration patterns.

In an attempt to understand the underlying institutional factors that either support or contest this assumption, this paper explores the institutional factors influencing adaptation to climate change at the regional scale, where multiple public land and natural resource management jurisdictions are involved. Insights from two mid-western US case studies reveal that several challenges to collaboration persist and prevent fully integrative multi-jurisdictional adaptation planning at a regional scale. We propose that some of these challenges, such as lack of adequate time, funding and communication channels, be reframed as opportunities to build interdependence, identify issue-linkages and collaboratively explore the nature and extent of organisational trade-offs with respect to regional climate change adaptation efforts. Such a reframing can better facilitate multi-jurisdictional adaptation planning and management of shared biophysical resources generally while simultaneously enhancing organisational capacity to mitigate negative effects and take advantage of potentially favourable future conditions in an era characterised by rapid climate change.","[Lemieux, Christopher James; Slocombe, D.

At recent meetings of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the developed world agreed to rapidly increase international assistance to help the developing world respond to the impacts of climate change. In this paper, we examine the decision-making challenges facing internationally supported climate change adaptation projects, using the example of efforts to implement coastal protection measures (e.g. sea walls, mangrove planting) in Kiribati. The central equatorial Pacific country is home to the Kiribati Adaptation Project, the first national-level climate change adaptation project supported by the World Bank. Drawing on interview and document research conducted over an 8-year period, we trace the forces influencing decisions about coastal protection measures, starting from the variability and uncertainty in climate change projections, through the trade-offs between different measures, to the social, political, and economic context in which decisions are finally made. We then discuss how sub-optimal adaptation measures may be implemented despite years of planning, consultation, and technical studies. This qualitative analysis of the real-world process of climate change adaptation reveals that embracing a culturally appropriate and short-term (similar to 20 years) planning horizon, while not ignoring the longer-term future, may reduce the influence of scientific uncertainty on decisions and provide opportunities to learn from mistakes, reassess the science, and adjust suboptimal investments. The limiting element in this approach to adaptation is likely to be the availability of consistent, long-term financing.","[Donner, Simon D.; Webber, Sophie] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Donner, SD (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",simon.donner@ubc.ca,,"Webber, Sophie/0000-0002-7597-4622",NSERC Discovery Program; SSHRC graduate award; UBC Hampton Award,NSERC Discovery Program(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); SSHRC graduate award; UBC Hampton Award,"The authors thank the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resource Development and the Kiribati Adaptation Program for their assistance throughout this research.

The authors used a multivariate probit model to quantify five categories of adaptation measures against a set of household features, extension and information, resources, social network, financial assets and perception variables. Findings The most significant determinants consisted of information on early climate warnings and impending hazards, ownership to land and livestock, irrigation membership in community-based organisations, household savings, cash crop farming and perceptions of climate change and its related hazards. Adaptation strategies and policies highlighting these determinants could help to improve climate change adaptation in the region. Originality/value This study quantified the determinants of adaptive strategies and mapped important determinants for the region that will provide farmers with the appropriate resources and information to implement the best practices for adapting to climatic changes.

This study makes a first attempt to explore the determinants of adaptation to climate change and choices of adaptation strategies at a larger spatial scale of the south-west coastal areas in Bangladesh, which is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions in the world. We employ both qualitative and quantitative approaches in order to examine farmers' perception of climate risks, determinants and choices of adaptation strategies to climate change in six coastal districts of Bangladesh. Farmers are adapting to these situations using their knowledge and experience. The study reveals that a number of adaptation strategies have been taken to reduce the negative impacts of climate change. These adaptation strategies are categorized into four groups: crop management, water management, land management, and income diversification. Availability of inputs, high production cost, agricultural extension service, and proper adaptation knowledge and experiences were noted as the main non-climatic challenges, as well as different climatic factors in agricultural adaptation strategies. Statistical analysis indicates that the different socio-economic determinants of farmers significantly influence their choices of adaptation to climate change. Farmers adopt these adaptations mostly autonomously rather than on the advice of government.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the integration of issues related to climate change adaptation into the national development planning of Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research design, which depended on secondary and primary data sources, was used in this study. Data were collected from relevant documents. These were substantiated with field data gathered through key informant interviews and focus group discussions from participants identified using purposive sampling. Thematic analysis of the collected data was done by first considering the relevant documents and then comparing with the field data. During the analysis and interpretation, the results were combined to explain, confirm, refute and/or enrich the data obtained through document reviews and interviews. Findings The result of the study revealed that the general issues of environmental management have been included in the relevant documents (national plans). However, the documents do not explicitly identify climate change adaptation strategies and options that can alleviate the current impacts and the projected negative impacts associated with climate change. In fact, some documents were found to be characterized by numerous gaps. For example, the environmental policy of Ethiopia does not address climate trading, climate resilient green economy and recent development. The result from interviews shows that the constitution of the country lacks sufficiently addressing climate change adaptation. The result obtained from focus group discussion with informants indicated that the environmental policy of the country is shallow and suffers from showing clear direction regarding integration. The informants indicate that though there is an office that works on climate change at zonal level, there is no well-defined structure for climate change at zonal, district and Kebele levels and there appears to be weak integration among the different institutions working on climate change.

Although literature exists on population issues, emphasis was given to positive roles of population growth providing only incomplete picture for stakeholders and policy makers. This constrained climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, improving food security and attaining sustainable development goals. We reviewed publications on low-income countries with emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. This review will bring forth often sidelined issue of population growth for decision-makers and future research in the context of achieving sustainable development goals of the United Nations for 2015-2030. Therefore, this review was initiated to reveal the impacts of population growth on natural resources and to uncover farmers' capacity to adapt to climate change in low-income countries. Rapid population growth continues to be a major underlying force of environmental degradation and a threat to sustainable use of natural resources. It reduces the quality and quantity of natural resources through overexploitation, intensive farming and land fragmentation. Regions with high population pressure face scarcity of arable land, which leads to shortened/removed fallow period, declining soil fertility and farm income due to farm subdivision. Furthermore, landless individuals or those who operate small farms resettle or cultivate marginal lands, encroach on natural forests in search of more vacant land, which alters carbon source sink dynamics of the environment. Low farm income from small farms not only exacerbates food insecurity of farmers but also constrains their ability to adopt certain climate change adaptation technologies. All stakeholders should take swift actions to address challenges of rapid population growth and alter the dynamics between population, natural resources and climate change and its adaptation.","[Maja, Mengistu M.; Ayano, Samuel F.] Haramaya Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Sch Nat Resource Management & Environm Sci, Haramaya, Ethiopia",Haramaya University,"Maja, MM (corresponding author), Haramaya Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Sch Nat Resource Management & Environm Sci, Haramaya, Ethiopia.",mengistu.mengesha@haramaya.edu.et,,", Mengistu/0000-0003-2612-9243",,,,,156,52,53,7,37,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2509-9426,2509-9434,,EARTH SYST ENVIRON,Earth Syst.

Most of them have recognized that agronomic strategies such as shifting agricultural calendar, changing crop varieties and types, crop diversification, income diversification and improving irrigation infrastructure are the commonly used adaptive strategies to climate change. What these strategies have missed, however, is the critical role of meteorological information for farmers in coping with climate variability and change. This paper provides a synthesis of the issues raised in the literature related to the major role and importance of weather forecast and meteorological information in coping with climate change. A number of these issues were related to improving weather forecast and providing meteorological services as adaptive strategies to climate change. The findings of these studies on improving quality of weather forecast and meteorological information has shown that the strategies have been very beneficial for different stakeholders who are constantly facing risks and uncertainties from natural disasters. For decision makers, the benefits from using this information include improved risk management practices and better-targeted policies. For farmers, the use of such accurate meteorological information can result in higher output, productivity and income or lower avoided cost or losses. However, there are constraints and challenges in applying meteorological information in coping with climate change. The most challenging issue is how to ensure the accuracy of weather forecasts. A number of recommendations were proposed to ensure a more efficient and beneficial use of weather forecast and meteorological information in coping with climate change in agricultural production. These include: (1) enabling different institutions and stakeholders involved in weather forecast to ensure the accuracy of forecast results, (2) developing integrated research framework in using meteorological information, (3) strengthening and enriching farmer's meteorological knowledge, and (4) providing user-oriented features to increase the economic benefits of meteorological information to the public.","[Trinh Quang Thoai] Vietnam Natl Univ Forestry, Dept Econ, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Ranola Jr, Roberto F.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Coll Econ & Management, College Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines; [Camacho, Leni D.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Dept Social Forestry & Forest Governance, Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, College Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines",Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA); University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Thoai, TQ (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ Forestry, Dept Econ, Hanoi, Vietnam.",thoaitq@vfu.edu.vn,"Ranola, Roberto/AAK-1578-2020",,CGIAR Fund [P55],CGIAR Fund(CGIAR),"This work was implemented under project P55 Agro-Climate Information Services for women and ethnic minority (ACIS) farmers in Southeast Asia as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.",,161,0,0,3,13,UNIV PHILIPPINES LOS BANOS,LAGUNA,"COLLEGE AGRICULTURE, LAGUNA 4031, PHILIPPINES",0031-7454,,,PHILIPP AGRIC SCI,Philipp. Agric.

We postulate that this substantial land fragmentation is obstructing the adoption of sustainable land management practices as climate adaptation measures. To explore this, a mixed method study was conducted with emphasis on a multivariate probit model. The results indicate that farmers adapt to climate change and variability they perceive. According to the probit model, there is no clear answer to the question whether land fragmentation facilitates or obstructs adoption of sustainable land management practices. Yet, a qualitative analysis found that farmers perceive land fragmentation as an obstacle to land improvement as adaptation strategy. Moreover, farmers invest more in land improvement on plots close to their homestead than in remote plots. However, the higher land fragmentation also promoted crop diversification, manure application and terracing. Although exogenous to farmers, we therefore suggest that land fragmentation can be deployed in climate change adaptation planning. This can be done through voluntary assembling of small neighboring plots in clusters of different microclimates to encourage investment in remote fields and to collectively optimize the benefits of fragmentation to adaptation.","[Cholo, Tesfaye C.; Fleskens, Luuk; Sietz, Diana] Wageningen Univ & Res, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Cholo, Tesfaye C.] Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Dept Dev Econ, POB 5648, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Sietz, Diana] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Earth Syst Anal, Res Domain 1,POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Peerlings, Jack] Wageningen Univ & Res, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Wageningen University & Research,"Cholo, TC (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.;Cholo, TC (corresponding author), Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Dept Dev Econ, POB 5648, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",tesfaye.cholo@wur.nl; luuk.fleskens@wur.nl; sietz@pik-potsdam.de; jack.peerlings@wur.nl,"Fleskens, Luuk/B-4004-2009; S, D/HJB-2910-2022; Cholo, Tesfaye Chofana/Q-1339-2019","Fleskens, Luuk/0000-0001-6843-0910; S, D/0000-0002-2309-2134; Cholo, Tesfaye Chofana/0000-0001-5094-4710",Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education (Nuffic) [NICHE/ETH/020],Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education (Nuffic),"This research was financed by the Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education (Nuffic), under grant no.

The article will explore the following research question: does land use planning law in Bangladesh help facilitate the establishment and maintenance of NbS to assist in adapting to climate flood risk? This article will assess existing planning law on its ability to integrate NbS into the urban climate adaptation context while managing competing and incompatible land use and upholding strong, transparent and equitable governance. This article finds that the inability to enforce regulations and a lack of early consultation and engagement presents serious impediments to implementing NbS through planning law and development policy in Dhaka and contributes to a disconnect between high level policy documents and implementation on the ground, thereby undermining climate change adaptation interventions.","[Govind, Paul J.; Alam, Shawkat] Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Law Sch, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Govind, PJ (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Law Sch, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",paul.govind@mq.edu.au,,"Alam, Shawkat/0000-0002-5351-2478; Govind, Paul/0000-0003-3575-3910",,,,,60,0,0,5,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The main goal of the analysis was to quantify and present the financial consequences of floods and droughts for the sectors most affected by climate change. The analysis emphasised the costs and benefits of adaptation measures for agriculture, forestry and tourism. The cost-benefit analysis considered structural measures that included certain technical and technological solutions. These adaptation measures included the implementation of infrastructure and other works to reduce problems in the agriculture, forestry, tourism and other sectors. For the purposes of this analysis, the profitability index was calculated for each of the proposed measures based on the present values of the anticipated benefit, cost and investment of each measure. According to the implemented cost-benefit analysis, all of the proposed structural measures for adapting to climate change were acceptable except for one measure in the forestry sector that had a profitability index of less than one. The profitability index for the acceptable structural adaptation measures in all sectors ranged between 1.06 and 14.15, implying benefits corresponding to present values of between 1.06 and 14.15 euros per euro invested. These results should encourage state and private investors to develop the investment potential of the proposed climate change adaptation measures.","[Cupac, Raduska] UNDP Bosnia & Herzegovina, Trg Republ Srpske 1-C1, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg; [Trbic, Goran] Univ Banja Luka, Fac Sci, Mladena Stojanovica 2, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg; [Zahirovic, Edin] Ctr Dev & Support Tuzla, Turalibegova 36, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Banja Luka (UNIBL),"Zahirovic, E (corresponding author), Ctr Dev & Support Tuzla, Turalibegova 36, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",edinzahirovic@gmail.com,"Trbic, Goran/N-4003-2018","Trbic, Goran/0000-0001-6254-2495; Zahirovic, Edin/0000-0002-2075-7882",,,,,21,3,3,2,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2365-6433,2365-7448,,EURO-MEDITERR J ENVI,Euro-Mediterr.

Our study used a mixed method research based on original face-to-face interviews with 92 winemakers in three French regional wine clusters that have been affected by climate change: Bordeaux, Champagne and Languedoc. We perform a logistic model to tests how managers' personal backgrounds, wine-producing company characteristics, and innovation system components, including cleaner technological regime, might explain the adaptation decision-making process. Our results show that economic variables have little influence on climate change adaptation decision-making. On the contrary, variables expressing the relationship built by wine producing companies within the Innovation System, their involvement in organic wine production, and the manager's personal background affect the decision-making process to adapt to climate change. Furthermore, many of the adaptation strategies rely on adopting cleaner production approach. Our findings show that the decisionmaking process depends on networks and clean technological regimes embedded in an innovation system, with regional and sector dimensions.","[Boyer, James] Lille Catholic Univ, HEMiSF4iRE Design Sch, LEM Lille Econ Management, CNRS,UMR 9221, 60 Bd Vauban, F-59016 Lille, France; [Touzard, Jean-Marc] Univ Montpellier, INRAE, UMR Innovat, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); INRAE; Universite de Montpellier,"Boyer, J (corresponding author), Lille Catholic Univ, HEMiSF4iRE Design Sch, LEM Lille Econ Management, CNRS,UMR 9221, 60 Bd Vauban, F-59016 Lille, France.",James.Boyer@univ-catholille.fr; jean-marc.touzard@inrae.fr,,"Boyer, James/0000-0001-8745-781X","project Long-Term Adaptation to Climate Change in Viticulture and Enology (LACCAVE) of the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE)","project Long-Term Adaptation to Climate Change in Viticulture and Enology (LACCAVE) of the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE)","This work was supported by the project Long-Term Adaptation to Climate Change in Viticulture and Enology (LACCAVE) of the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE) We would like to thank M ' elanie Bruciamacchie for her help in conducting the survey, as well as three independent reviewers for their suggestions and guidance in this work.",,76,4,4,2,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

But to what extent does research recognize such power-adaptation linkages? Based on a systematic literature review, we enquire if and how the framing of power matters for adaptation research and what the implications may be for practice. Our enquiry is predicated on the relationship between the researcher and the research focus being itself a relationship of power. Since power is complex and a single definition is not desirable, different actor-orientated frames of power were used for the data analysis. The results show that authors are more likely to work with issues of power to (i.e., agency), power over, and empowerment, rather than resistance or disempowerment. Demonstrating the effect of such frames, these proportions change according to whether the research focuses on equity, effectiveness, or participation. For instance, power to is strongly associated with effectiveness, while disempowerment is associated more with equity. Together with other identified patterns, our review shows that researchers frame power in adaptation in ways that constitute biases and blind spots. Attention to particular frames of power can limit attention to important dynamics within adaptation processes. Both the content and context to which the identified frames are applied suggest structural trends in adaptation research that require increased attention. Since researchers' frames of power influence both research outcomes and broader adaptation-power relations, the results indicate that reflexivity is needed to improve both adaptation research and practice.

Environmental decision support systems (EDSS) have been developed to assist stakeholders in effective decision making for the management of complex natural resource problems. EDSS which combine community engagement in developing future scenarios with computer-based land use planning and modeling tools are used internationally and reported to be effective. Yet, they are often not used after the research and development phase. To gain an understanding of the effectiveness of these tools, we interviewed the end users of an EDSS used in a climate change adaptation project in Canada and another in Australia. The end users of the tool are key informants, yet their perspective is lacking in the sustainability science literature. The findings show that neither EDSS was used after the projects ended. However, the majority of the end users in both projects valued the EDSS, confirming that the tools resulted in direct adaptation activities and influenced the thinking and work habits of the end users of the EDSS. We report on lessons learned from the two case studies and make recommendations regarding the processes and structures required to increase the effectiveness of the EDSS, its long-term use, and the legacy of learning that is embodied within it.","[Reiter, Dana] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Meyer, Wayne] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Landscape Syst, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Parrott, Lael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth Environm & Geog Sci, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Parrott, Lael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Baker, Douglas] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Grace, Peter] Queensland Univ Technol, Earth Environm & Biol Sci, Environm Syst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Adelaide; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Reiter, D (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",dana.reiter@hdr.qut.edu.au; wayne.meyer@adelaide.edu.au; lael.parrott@ubc.ca; d2.baker@qut.edu.au; pr.grace@qut.edu.au,"Baker, Douglas C/J-1007-2012","Baker, Douglas C/0000-0001-8812-8567; Grace, Peter/0000-0003-4136-4129",,,,,46,7,7,1,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The evaluative extent to which these adaptation techniques have influenced agricultural productivity is inherently exiguous. Citrus production in tropical regions such as South Africa, is more vulnerable to climate change as the region already experience hot and dry climate, hence the need to implement different strategies for climate change adaption in these regions. This study was designed to assess the effect of adopting the following climate change adaptation measures: planting drought resistant varieties, rainwater harvesting, planting early maturing varieties, integrated pest management (IPM) , changing fertiliser type, and applying drip irrigation to manage climate challenges on the production efficiency of citrus farmers in the Limpopo province of South Africa. The stochastic frontier production function with Cobb Douglas production functional form was used to analyse the productivity of farmers' vis-a-vis adopted climate change strategies. A survey was conducted and data were collected through a semi-structured questionnaire administered to respondents from 235 production units in the five district municipalities of Limpopo. The likelihood ratio tests for profit models showed that farmers were profit efficient considering the identified adaptation strategies. The variables that influenced profit efficiency was price of fertiliser (p < 0.010) and water cost (p < 0.010). The inefficiency model showed that besides changing fertiliser as an adaptation measure, the other adaptation strategies including IPM, water harvesting and planting drought resistant varieties did not change the profit efficiency of farmers. Therefore, the results indicate that citrus farmers can still adapt to climate change and remain profit efficient.","[Joseph, Samuel; Antwi, Michael A.; Chagwiza, Clarietta; Rubhara, Theresa T.] Univ South Africa, Dept Agr & Anim Hlth, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Rubhara, TT (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Dept Agr & Anim Hlth, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.",theresarubhara@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,0,0,3,7,AFRICAN CENTRE DISASTER STUDIES,POTCHEFSTROOM,"INTERNAL BOX 265, NORTH-WEST UNIV, PRIVATE BAG X6001, POTCHEFSTROOM, 2520, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

As such, the objective was to document and better understand how the legacy of colonialism, coupled with the current climate change impacts is making adaptation a serious challenge for farmers in particular regions of the country. This study was conducted in Zimbabwe's Buhera Rural District (Ward 30) and Chipinge Rural District (Ward 11). Data collection involved the use of individual household interviews, with the use of a snowball sampling method, focus group discussions, key informant interviews and direct observation in the field. It was found that the lack of income diversity opportunities has further exposed several livelihoods to climate change and compromised their abilities to respond and recover under periods of climatic stress. It was ascertained that the adaptation challenges experienced by African farmers were brought about by the colonial land system that evicted them from their customary lands and allocated them land in poor agroecological regions that fail to support production. The authors argue that climate change adaptation challenges in communal areas should be understood from a colonial and historical development perspective that led to the establishment of communal farming zones. There is also a need to understand climate vulnerability in the context of post-independence development strategies that have led to the underdevelopment of peasant agriculture and reduced farmers' ability to adapt to climate change. Contribution: Climate change adaptation policies should recognise the country's colonial and historical legacy that has led to poverty and other livelihood challenges in communal areas. By acknowledging this, policymakers are better positioned to understand the structural issues making adaptation difficult, and they could intervene by proposing context-specific adaptation strategies that meet the needs of communal farmers.","[Maganga, Trymore] St Marys Univ, Dept Int Dev Studies, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Suso, Catherine Conrad] St Marys Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada; Saint Marys University - Canada,"Maganga, T (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Dept Int Dev Studies, Halifax, NS, Canada.",trymaganga@gmail.com,,"Maganga, Trymore/0000-0002-5051-3555",,,,,57,1,1,2,2,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

We also specified three intrahousehold factors that are likely to influence household adaptation outcomes: (1) gendered adaptation behaviours, (2) relational adaptation behaviours, and (3) household life cycle and adaptation behaviours. Acknowledging the potential bias of approaching just one representative per household, we then detailed conceptual frameworks and pragmatic advice for applying a household-based approach in climate change adaptation studies.

To assess the status of water resources and document farmers' perceptions of and adaptation to climate change impacts in this watershed, we invited community groups to monitor water quality and conducted 6 focus group meetings, 3 participatory rural appraisals, and spring and household surveys in 2011 and 2012. Historical precipitation data from a nearby weather station and discharge data for the Tadi Khola, the nearest major river, were also analyzed. The spring survey results confirmed farmers' perceptions and showed that 73.2% of the springs used as water sources had a decreased flow and 12.2% had dried up over the past 10 or more years, as recognized by local residents. In response to the severe decline of precipitation and the drying up of springs, local communities have implemented some climate change adaptation measures, such as constructing water tanks at water sources, using pipes to transport drinking water, diverting water from other springs, digging deeper wells, and traveling farther to wash clothes and fetch drinking water. To enhance drinking water supplies and ensure the agricultural, ecological, and environmental integrity of the watershed, initiatives such as comprehensive research on springs and groundwater hydrology, a spring rejuvenation program, and community capacity building for water sustainability and climate change adaptation are suggested.","[Poudel, Durga D.] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Environm Sci Program, Sch Geosci, POB 44650, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA; [Duex, Timothy W.] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Geol Program, Sch Geosci, POB 44650, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA",University of Louisiana Lafayette; University of Louisiana Lafayette,"Poudel, DD (corresponding author), Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Environm Sci Program, Sch Geosci, POB 44650, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.",ddpoudel@louisiana.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,United States Agency for International Development [EEM-A-00-10-00001],United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This research article was made possible by the United States Agency for International Development and the generous support of the American people through Grant No. EEM-A-00-10-00001.

A new analytical framework to examine and test how moral reasoning underpins and legitimizes governance and practice on adaptation to climate change risks is proposed. It develops a typology of eight categories of vulnerability-based and system-based moral reasoning that pertain to the dilemmas around adaptation and examines the prevalence of these moral categories in public discourse about specific adaptation issues. The framework is tested using data on climate change impact, adaptation, and societal responsibility, drawn from 14 focus groups comprising 148 participants across the UK. Participants consistently use moral reasoning to explain their views on climate adaptation; these include both vulnerability-based and system-based framings. These findings explain public responses to adaptation options and governance, and have implications for the direction of adaptation policy, including understanding which types of reasoning support politically legitimate interventions.","[Adger, W.

The shift to green economy is confirmed as the highest development aim, while establishing a balanced relationship between environmental policies, economic efficiency, technological upgrading and behavioural transition is one of main global assignments of our epoch. The importance of knowledge and innovations is also emphasised, while their availability, diffusion and exchange represent a key-reinforcement of green transition, especially in societies which are facing severe economic, social and environmental problems caused by sensitive local circumstances. The case of Serbia, which is the focus of this article, presents one of possible paths towards climate change adaptation, conditioned by more than two turbulent decades of the recent history of the country. Since democratic changes in 2000, environmental issues have become visible on institutional (governmental) level - through introduction of new environmental laws, research funding, preparation and implementation of specific documents or strategies, and on non-institutional (non-governmental) level - as different environmentally focused initiatives, usually supported by international, regional or local funds. However, on both levels information networks represent an inevitable structural ingredient, which enables a sustainable and locally adjusted approach to climate adaptation. Following global trends, information networks in Serbia are mainly used in the domain of public communication of climate changes, covering three major thematic areas of climate adaptability - human behaviour, ecological awareness and general efficiency. Considering all these specificities, the article provides a review of detected practices related to the use of information networks in climate change adaptation on both global and local level, stressing the possible benefits and limitations in the context of Serbia. The first part of the article introduces a global background of the problem of climate adaptation, summarising major environmental trends, research problems and policy responses, and emphasising the relation between climate change and urban(ised) environment. The second part is dedicated to the case of Serbia, focusing on three aspects - general condition of the environment, the legal framework and the perception/recognition of urban context and its environmental effects in recent development documents. The third part is focused on the relation between information networks, built environment/cities and climate changes, providing an overview of global trends and Serbian practice, while possible improvements of detected local weaknesses are given in the concluding part.","[Stupar, Aleksandra; Mihajlov, Vladimir] Univ Belgrade, Fac Architecture, Dept Urbanism, Belgrade 11001, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Stupar, A (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Architecture, Dept Urbanism, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.",stupar@afrodita.rcub.bg.ac.rs; mihajlovvladimir@yahoo.com,"Mihajlov, Vladimir/T-5366-2017; Stupar, Aleksandra/D-4428-2018","Mihajlov, Vladimir/0000-0003-3617-7249; Stupar, Aleksandra/0000-0001-6166-4829",,,,,64,1,1,0,13,MIDDLE EAST TECHNICAL UNIV,ANKARA,"MIDDLE EAST TECHNICAL UNIV, FAC ARCHITECTURE, INONU BULVARI, ANKARA, 06531, TURKEY",0258-5316,,,METU J FAC ARCHIT,METU J.

Adaptation, in such condition, becomes crucial to remain in farming in climate change regime. In the rural settings of the less-developed areas, farm households mostly adapt to risks posed by climate change individually. However, the benefits of private adaptation can be private and public depending on the type of adaptation strategies. The present study investigates different adaptation strategies of farmers using cross-sectional data collected from semi-arid region of Punjab province of Pakistan. The study also examines the role of socioeconomic characteristics of farmers on adaptation to climate change. Private adaptations for private and public benefits are considered in the present study. Data is collected from 190 respondents through random sampling. Logit model is employed to find out determinants of adaptation strategies adopted by the farmers. Results indicate that education, farming experience, family size and tractor ownership are significantly related with adaptation to climate change. The study concludes that policymakers should consider the potential difference in private benefits and public benefits resulting from private adaptation to climate change in relation to human capital, family assets and farm machinery when designing policy interventions for climate adaptations. The public goods related private adaptations should be encouraged through appropriate policy interventions.","[Bakhsh, Khuda] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Vehari Campus, Vehari, Pakistan; [Kamran, M.

Viet Nam has a rich biodiversity and is also one of the most vulnerable countries impacted by climate change. Climate change policies have been adopted at national and local levels as well as by sector, making Viet Nam one of the nations to most systematically fulfill their obligation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Consequently, we have used Viet Nam as a case study, to assess the integration of ecosystem-based approach to adaptation to climate change. We found that ecosystem-based adaptation is being implemented in some projects but, overall, is inadequately considered by Viet Nam's climate change policies. Instead, policies predominantly rename infrastructure projects as climate change adaptation and focus on hard solutions for disaster reduction, rather than responding to long-term climate change through ecosystem-based adaptation. Moreover, ecosystem-based adaptation projects have focused on only a few relevant types of ecosystems. Viet Nam should revise its existing climate change policies and sectoral strategies to integrate ecosystem-based adaptation across different scales of governance. As other nations develop adaptation policies at different scales, the lesson from Viet Nam is that engineering measures need to be balanced with ecosystem-based adaptation for more affordable and effective responses to climate change.","[Thu Thi Nguyen] Viet Nam Natl Univ Forestry, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Pittock, Jamie] Australian Natl Univ, 48 Linnaeus Way, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia; [Bich Huong Nguyen] Minist Nat Resources & Environm, 10 Ton That Thuyet, Hanoi, Vietnam",Vietnam National University Hanoi; Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA); Australian National University,"Nguyen, TT (corresponding author), Viet Nam Natl Univ Forestry, Hanoi, Vietnam.",thunt@vfu.edu.vn; Jamie.Pittock@anu.edu.au; nbhuong51@gmail.com,"Pittock, Jamie/N-1541-2018","Pittock, Jamie/0000-0001-6293-996X; Nguyen, Thu T/0000-0002-4301-4467",,,,,72,7,7,3,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

It builds upon the work of Ostrom on institutional design principles for local common pool resources systems. We argue that for dealing with complexities and uncertainties related to climate change impacts (e.g. increased frequency and intensity of floods or droughts) additional or adjusted institutional design propositions are necessary that facilitate learning processes. This is especially the case for dealing with complex, cross-boundary and large-scale resource systems, such as river basins and delta areas in the Netherlands and South Africa or groundwater systems in Western Australia. In this paper we provide empirical support for a set of eight refined and extended institutional design propositions for the governance of adaptation to climate change in the water sector. Together they capture structural, agency and learning dimensions of the adaptation challenge and they provide a strong initial framework to explore key institutional issues in the governance of adaptation to climate change. These institutional design propositions support a management as learning approach to dealing with complexity and uncertainty. They do not specify blueprints, but encourage adaptation tuned to the specific features of local geography, ecology, economies and cultures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Industrial ecology has robustly addressed these sectors' contributions to climate change, but not their vulnerability to climate change. Climate change vulnerability must be addressed through development of climate change adaptation and resiliency strategies. However, there is a fundamental tension between the primary objectives of industrial ecology (efficiency, cyclic flows, and pollution prevention) and what is needed for climate change adaptation and resiliency. We develop here two potential ways through which the field can overcome (or work within) this tension and combine the tools and methods of industrial ecology with the science and process of climate change adaptation. The first layers industrial ecology tools on top of climate change adaptation strategies, allowing one to, for example, compare the environmental impacts of different adaptation strategies. The other embeds climate change adaptation and resiliency within industrial ecology tools, for example, by redefining the functional unit in life cycle assessment (LCA) to include functions of resiliency. In both, industrial ecology plays a somewhat narrow role, informing climate change adaptation and resilience decision-making by providing quantitative indicators of environmental performance. This role for industrial ecology is important given the significant contributions and potential for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from food and agriculture. However, it suggests that industrial ecology's role in climate adaptation will be as an evaluator of adaptation strategies, rather than an originator.","[Kendall, Alissa] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Spang, Edward S.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Spang, Edward S.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Water Energy Efficiency, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Kendall, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",amkendall@ucdavis.edu,"Spang, Edward/H-2979-2015","Spang, Edward/0000-0001-9883-078X; Kendall, Alissa/0000-0003-1964-9080",,,,,23,6,6,5,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

Nonetheless, the diversity of potential impacts, agro-ecological contexts and regional capacity for change make understanding adaptation behaviors challenging and ensure that climate change adaptation will not be the same across all contexts. Considering this heterogeneity, this paper aims to develop a theoretical approach to connect agro-ecosystem diversity with farmer decisionmaking in the context of agricultural adaptation to climate change. We combine the ecological principle of Liebig's Law of the Minimum with the Psychological Distance Theory to suggest how adaptation behaviors vary across regional contexts. We argue with our limiting factors hypothesis that limiting factors within a farm system (water or temperature impacts) influence the adoption of adaptation practices differently across regions and farm systems. Limiting factors varied across farm systems and regions, based on historical climate changes, agro-ecological contexts, infrastructure and adaptation capacity. Using farmer survey data from New Zealand we show that limiting factors mediate the effect of past climate experiences on the adoption of adaptation strategies differently in two regions with water acting as a limiting factor in Hawke's Bay and water and temperature as a limiting factor in Marlborough. This suggests that farmers perceive and respond to climate change in part due to their personal experiences with climate change and the limiting factors within their system. Such results are relevant for the development of regional adaptation strategies, effective policies and targeted climate change communication. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The results show that the actual implementation of these adaptation programs varied vis-a-vis the original plans, in terms of the level of overall expenditure and sector-specific expenditure. The following findings were drawn from the analysis: First, in most cases, the highest adaptation priorities were disaster/infrastructure, water management, and the health sector. Second, actual expenditure on climate change adaptation programs was smaller than the planned budget in the IPCCAS. Third, the prioritized sectors matched for planning and implementation in Seoul, Daegu, Daejeon, and Incheon, but not in Busan and Ulsan.

Climate change adaptation in India and Bangladesh evolves using powering and puzzling approaches by policy actors. We seek to answer the question:how do powering and puzzling approaches influence the climate change adaptation policy design and implementation processes in Bangladesh and India?We adopted two strategies to collect and analyze data: semi-structured interviews and discourse analysis. We found that adaptation policymaking is largely top-down, amenable to techno-managerial solutions, and not inclusive of marginalized actors. In Bangladesh, power interplays among ministerial agencies impair the policy implementation process and undermine the success of puzzling. Local-scale agencies do not have enough authority or power to influence the overall implementation processes occurring at higher scales of governance. The powering of different actors in Bangladesh is visible through a duality of mandates and a lack of integration of climate adaptation strategies in different government ministries. The powering aspect of India's various adaptation policies is the lack of collective puzzling around the question of differentiated vulnerability by axes of social difference. Paradoxically, India has a puzzling approach ofhiding behind the poorin international negotiations. Moving forward, both countries should strive to have more inclusive and equitable adaptation policymaking processes that enable the participation of marginalized populations and represent their anxieties and aspirations. Identifying policy-relevant insights from South Asia using the powering and puzzling approaches can foster adaptation policy processes that facilitate empowerment, the missing piece of the adaptation policymaking puzzle.","[Stock, Ryan] Northern Michigan Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Geog Sci, 1401 Presque Isle Ave, Marquette, MI 49855 USA; [Vij, Sumit] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vij, Sumit] Vrije Univ, Earth & Climate Cluster, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ishtiaque, Asif] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Ishtiaque, Asif] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Northern Michigan University; Wageningen University & Research; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Vij, S (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Vij, S (corresponding author), Vrije Univ, Earth & Climate Cluster, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",rystock@nmu.edu; sumit.vij@wur.nl; asif.ishtiaque@asu.edu,"Vij, Sumit/AAV-6617-2021; Ishtiaque, Asif/P-2423-2019","Ishtiaque, Asif/0000-0002-2196-9764; Stock, Ryan J./0000-0002-6218-3725","UK Department for International Development (DFID, UK); International Development Research Centre (IDRC, Ottawa); Arizona State University; Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad fellowship (US Department of Education) [P022A170064]; Fulbright-Nehru Research Award (US Department of State-IIE); Critical Language Enhancement Award (American Institute of Indian Studies); Due and Ferber International Award; Barbara Yates International Award from the Women and Gender in Global Perspectives (WGGP) program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","UK Department for International Development (DFID, UK); International Development Research Centre (IDRC, Ottawa); Arizona State University; Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad fellowship (US Department of Education); Fulbright-Nehru Research Award (US Department of State-IIE); Critical Language Enhancement Award (American Institute of Indian Studies); Due and Ferber International Award; Barbara Yates International Award from the Women and Gender in Global Perspectives (WGGP) program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","Fieldwork in Bangladesh was carried out by the Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) consortium under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA).

However, an understanding of how forest growers are reducing their risks from climate change impacts is still in its infancy. This paper applies the protection motivation theory to identify socio-psychological factors influencing forest growers' adaptation to climate change. This study presents the survey results from 60 forest growers who have the combined responsibility for managing more than 70% of New Zealand's plantation forests. We investigated whether their perceived response efficacy, self-efficacy and their understanding of response costs are predictors of their protective or adaptive measures. Based on our survey, risk reduction and risk spreading are the two types of protective measure frequently reported by the respondents to deal with climate risks. Consistent with the protection motivation theory, our findings show that respondents who are more likely to implement protective or adaptive measures if they perceive the threat severity to be high have high self-efficacy and resource efficacy, and exhibit low maladaptive responses such as evading and postponing behaviours. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that there is a low self-efficacy belief with strong maladaptive behaviour among the respondents that negatively influence their motivation to implement adaptation measures. This result provides guidance to policy makers, researchers and forest companies on how to make climate change adaptation efforts effective by considering the forest growers motivation to adapt to climate change.","[Villamor, Grace B.; Wakelin, Steve J.; Dunningham, Andrew; Clinton, Peter W.] Scion New Zealand Forest Res Inst, Titokorangi Dr,Longmile Rd,Private Bag 3020, Rotorua 3046, New Zealand; [Villamor, Grace B.] Ctr Dev Res, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Villamor, GB (corresponding author), Scion New Zealand Forest Res Inst, Titokorangi Dr,Longmile Rd,Private Bag 3020, Rotorua 3046, New Zealand.;Villamor, GB (corresponding author), Ctr Dev Res, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",Grace.Villamor@scionresearch.com,,,,,,,66,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

This article summarises the findings from a multidisciplinary research project looking at climate change impacts and adaptation in the Mekong River Basin in Southeast Asia. The research highlights the central role that the hydrological cycle has in mediating climate change impacts on ecosystems and societies. The findings indicate that climate change should not be studied in isolation, as there are several other factors that are affecting the hydrological cycle. In the Mekong, the most important such factor is the on-going hydropower development that is likely to induce changes at least as radical as climate change, but with shorter timescales. The article concludes that climate change adaptation should broaden its view to consider environmental changes likely to occur due to different factors at various spatial and temporal scales. It is also important to recognise that climate change adaptation is a dynamic, development-orientated process that should consider also broader socio-political context. To enable this, we propose that an area-based adaptation approach should be used more actively to complement the dominant sector-based approaches.","[Keskinen, M.; Kummu, M.; Nuorteva, P.; Varis, O.; Vastila, K.] Aalto Univ, Water & Dev Res Grp, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Chinvanno, S.; Snidvongs, A.] Chulalongkorn Univ, SE Asia START Reg Ctr, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Aalto University; Chulalongkorn University,"Keskinen, M (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Water & Dev Res Grp, POB 15200, Aalto 00076, Finland.",keskinen@iki.fi,"Varis, Olli/G-6506-2011; Keskinen, Marko/B-2886-2012; Kummu, Matti/C-4797-2011","Varis, Olli/0000-0001-9231-4549; Keskinen, Marko/0000-0001-5236-2327; Kummu, Matti/0000-0001-5096-0163; Vastila, Kaisa/0000-0002-6034-760X",Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland; Maa-ja vesitekniikan tuki ry.; Academy of Finland [111672]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [111672] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland; Maa-ja vesitekniikan tuki ry.; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),"The research presented in this article formed a part of the research project Water and Climate Change in the Lower Mekong Basin.

Current research is focused on how Indigenous adaptation and mitigation strategies can be integrated into mainstream climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. Through a mixed-methods approach, this study explored the effects of culture and local perceptions on coping strategies and adaptations to climate change among Indigenous communities, of which knowledge is inadequate, with a specific focus on two Indigenous Tayal communities in northern Taiwan (N = 101). From our findings, we developed a typology based on a polychoric factor analysis, which includes four key aspects: commercialized response; experience and anticipation; culture, preparedness and recovery; and external support and institutions. The typology shows that cultural practices and perceptions profoundly shape how Indigenous households respond to climate-related disasters and should therefore be incorporated more comprehensively into climate change adaptation and mitigation policy. Our findings reflect a nuanced understanding of Indigenous peoples' complicated relationship with global climate change. The proposed typology could be used as a theoretical and/or policy-oriented framework to advance an agenda for strengthening Indigenous livelihood resilience to global climate change.","[Bayrak, Mucahid Mustafa; Hung, Li-San; Hsu, Yi-Ya] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan Normal University,"Hung, LS (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei, Taiwan.",lshung@ntnu.edu.tw,"Hung, Li-San/AAI-9922-2021; Bayrak, Mucahid Mustafa/P-8787-2015; Hsu, Yi-Ya/GOG-9402-2022; Bayrak, Mucahid/AAF-9935-2021","Bayrak, Mucahid Mustafa/0000-0001-7699-5575; Hsu, Yi-Ya/0000-0002-7874-4638; Bayrak, Mucahid/0000-0001-7699-5575; Hung, Li-San/0000-0002-9854-7551","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan [MOST 109-2636-H-003-007, MOST 108-2410-H-003-140]","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan (MOST 109-2636-H-003-007 and MOST 108-2410-H-003-140).

Whilst climate adaptation governance is positioned within national economic sectors, it highlights an emerging city-regional policy dimension to such governance. The spatial reconfiguration of climate change adaptation governance reflects a tension between three quite distinct processes: (1) the sector-driven territorial logic of the national competition state; (2) the emergence of city-regionalism as an adaptation governance response to increased competition; and (3) the assertion of 'national' political priorities in the implementation of climate adaptation across subnational territories.

Instituting adaptation frameworks that can assist professionals to respond to climate change, yet be tailored to specific sectoral needs is crucial. Professionals working at the coalface of the climate change challenge need to build new skills and create innovative solutions in social and political contexts. Design/methodology/approach - Using case studies, this paper reflects on the experience of developing climate change curricula at multiple levels and the obstacles to implementation of the links between curriculum and practice. This includes reflections on the necessity of interlinking political, social and economic aspects together in delivery of such a course. Findings - The paper finds that a strictly content based approach to curriculum development is inadequate. The context of an issue like climate change requires attention to the specific needs of the target audience, in addition to delivery of generic content, so as to achieve the industry uptake critical to ensuring social and political objectives are implemented on the ground.

Using the cases of Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia, this paper investigates the extent of coherence in national policies across the water and agriculture sectors and to climate change adaptation goals outlined in national development plans. A two-pronged qualitative approach is applied using Qualitative Document Analysis of relevant policies and plans, combined with expert interviews from non-government actors in each country. Findings show that sector policies have differing degrees of coherence on climate change adaptation, currently being strongest in Zambia and weakest in Tanzania. We also identify that sectoral policies remain more coherent in addressing immediate-term disaster management issues of floods and droughts rather than longer-term strategies for climate adaptation. Coherence between sector and climate policies and strategies is strongest when the latter has been more recently developed. However to date, this has largely been achieved by repackaging of existing sectoral policy statements into climate policies drafted by external consultants to meet international reporting needs and not by the establishment of new connections between national sectoral planning processes. For more effective mainstreaming of climate change adaptation, governments need to actively embrace longer-term cross-sectoral planning through cross-Ministerial structures, such as initiated through Zambia's Interim Climate Change Secretariat, to foster greater policy coherence and integrated adaptation planning.","[England, Matthew I.; Dougill, Andrew J.; Stringer, Lindsay C.; Afionis, Stavros] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Vincent, Katharine E.] Kulima Integrated Dev Solut Pty Ltd, Postnet Suite H79,Private Bag X9118, ZA-3200 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Vincent, Katharine E.] Univ Witwatersrand WITS, Sch Architecture & Planning, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Pardoe, Joanna] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst, London, England; [Kalaba, Felix K.] Copperbelt Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Kitwe, Zambia; [Mkwambisi, David D.] Lilongwe Univ Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Environm Management Sci, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Namaganda, Emilinah] Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Leeds; University of Witwatersrand; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Copperbelt University; Lilongwe University of Agriculture & Natural Resources; Wageningen University & Research,"Dougill, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",m.i.england@leeds.ac.uk; a.j.dougill@leeds.ac.uk; l.stringer@leeds.ac.uk; katharine@kulima.com; j.pardoe@lse.ac.uk; kanungwe@gmail.com; ddmkwambisi@gmail.com; emnamaganda@gmail.com; s.afionis@leeds.ac.uk,"Kalaba, Felix Kanungwe/AAE-8838-2019; Afionis, Stavros/AES-5062-2022; Vincent, Katharine/L-5669-2019","Vincent, Katharine/0000-0003-3152-1522; Namaganda, Emilinah/0000-0003-3095-5484; Afionis, Stavros/0000-0002-0434-5108","Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme as part of the UMFULA regional consortium project [NE/M020207/1]; Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC); UK Department for International Development (DFID); NERC [NE/M020010/1, NE/M020398/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme as part of the UMFULA regional consortium project; Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); UK Department for International Development (DFID); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work was funded by Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme as part of the UMFULA regional consortium project (NE/M020207/1).

Results indicated that variations in temperature and rainfall were significantly related with public expenditures. Short run and long run scenarios showed that rising temperature caused an increase in public expenditures. The effect of rainfall on total public expenditure was positive and statistically significant while rainfall and expenditure incurred on communal amenities and housing were negatively related in the long run. The study posits important policy implications.","[Bakhsh, Khuda; Latif, Aasma; Ali, Rafaqet; Yasin, Muhammad Asim] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Management Sci, Vehari Campus, Vehari, Pakistan",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),"Bakhsh, K (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Management Sci, Vehari Campus, Vehari, Pakistan.",kbakhsh@ciitvehari.edu.pk,"Khuda, Bakhsh/AFL-9812-2022; Ali, Rafaqet/AAZ-4219-2021; Yasin, Muhammad Asim/AHA-8930-2022","Ali, Rafaqet/0000-0002-3700-457X; Yasin, Muhammad Asim/0000-0001-5909-2390; Bakhsh, Khuda/0000-0001-5607-3370",,,,,50,1,1,2,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

The dilemma of spatial planning in a dynamic and complex coastal environment as well as the establishment of a coastal buffer zone as an adaptation measure for climate change are elaborated upon. In particular, this study outlines the limitations of two of the traditional approaches used for spatial planning (optimization and simulation) and the opportunities that present themselves when combining both models for coastal zone planning. As a result, this study has developed an integrated modeling framework called MOPSD (multi-Objective Programming and System Dynamic) that can be used for spatial land use planning in coastal areas. The case study is Cijin Island, located next to the Kaohsiung harbor, Taiwan; this location demonstrates that the proposed MOPSD modeling approach generates superior results when compared to each of the two traditional methods. This is mainly attributed to the consideration of deterministic and dynamic characteristics when evaluating the climate change adaptation at risk of coastal erosion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This is reflected notably in food and water crises across Africa. This work examines the readiness of Africa to climate change adaptation through a newly developed readiness index (ClimAdaptCap Index). In fact, this work shifts the readiness debate from emotional descriptions that currently flood academic scholarship to a more pragmatic evidence-based approach in assessing readiness. Readiness for climate change adaptation is driven by the intensity of climate forcing and adaptive capacity. The historical climate score data or precipitation and temperature for the period 1991-2016 were culled from the World Bank Climate Portal. The historical adaptive capacity score data included proxies such as poverty and literacy rates from 1991 to 2016 were collected from the World Bank and Macrotrends. The climate data were normalized using the normalization function to enhance interpretation, comparison, and fusion into the index. Missing poverty and literacy rate data were estimated by linear interpolation of the poverty and literacy rate data. The ClimAdaptCap Index was developed to compute readiness. This index is the first of its kind and will serve as a flagship for assessing readiness for climate change adaptation as it is highly adaptable to different contexts. This work's first-ever maps of readiness show that North and Southern Africa are the readiest for climate change adaptation under historical climate and literacy and poverty conditions. West Africa is the least ready while Middle and East Africa are in the middle. Consistent is that readiness has a positive correlation with literacy rates and an inverse one with poverty rates. In addition, with readiness scores of between 0.35 and 0.39 for all the regions with a maximum potential score of 1, this work has shown that the level of readiness in Africa is generally low, and there is a very small variation between the different regions. In addition, climate change adaptation will highly be influenced by both climatic and non-climatic indicators. The developed readiness index adequately simulates readiness to climate change adaptation in Africa and complements previous frameworks of adaptation preparedness.","[Epule, Terence Epule; Chehbouni, Abdelghani; Dhiba, Driss; Moto, Mirielle Wase] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Int Water Res Inst UM6P, Lot 660, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco; [Chehbouni, Abdelghani] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Ctr Remote Sensing & Applicat CRSA, Lot 660, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco",Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University,"Epule, TE (corresponding author), Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Int Water Res Inst UM6P, Lot 660, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco.",epule.terence@um6p.ma; abdelghani.chehbouni@um6p.ma; diba.driss@um6p.ma; mirielle.moto@yahoo.ca,"chehbouni, abdelghani/K-2096-2016","chehbouni, abdelghani/0000-0002-0270-1690; Epule, Terence Epule/0000-0002-5756-382X",Mohammed VI Polytechnic University,Mohammed VI Polytechnic University,"This research was funded by Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, startup grant to professors.",,47,5,5,2,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

However, there are significant barriers to climate change adaptation and planning institutions and professionals are at the forefront of confronting these obstacles. This research documents how planners have responded to barriers to climate change adaptation at a professional level. The focus of this research is on the conditions of uncertainty and volatility of institutional policy frameworks for climate change adaptation; and the low prioritization of climate change adaptation among competing institutional objectives. The paper investigates how planners respond to these conditions and the resulting impact of their decisions on local level climate change adaptation. We report on a case study of the experiences and perspectives of local planners across Queensland, Australia. The contribution of this research is to document how planners respond to conflicts between institutional constraints and professional responsibilities for climate change adaptation. The case study identifies strategies that were employed by planning professionals to overcome common institutional barriers to climate change adaptation. Planners responded to problematic conditions by engaging alternative authorities, identifying substitute rationales, employing existing mechanisms, altering the framing of terminology and establishing regional coordination forums. These strategies provide options for professionals to overcome the barriers to climate change adaptation within their work and political environments.","[McClure, Lachlan] Redland City Council, Cleveland, Qld, Australia; [Baker, Douglas] Queensland Univ Technol, Sci & Engn Fac, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"McClure, L (corresponding author), Redland City Council, Strateg Planning, Cleveland, Qld, Australia.",Lachlan.McClure@redland.qld.gov.au; d2.baker@qut.edu.au,"Baker, Douglas C/J-1007-2012","Baker, Douglas C/0000-0001-8812-8567",,,,,54,18,19,0,35,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-2046,1872-6062,,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

We tested the model with responses from 101 managers in the Australian energy industry. Findings of the study show that both environmental attitudes and climate change knowledge have a significantly positive effect on the perceived importance of climate change adaptation and that this relationship is mediated by risk perception.

Old-established facilities of hydropower are insufficient to handle changes in runoff under climate change. These facilities should be retrofitted and adapted to climate change. Adaptation of hydropower to climate change has two purposes: first, to fully utilize future water resources for maximizing electricity generation; and second, to generate profits in return of investment costs. Investment in the adaptation depends on issues such as climate scenarios, investment costs, and timing of implementation. Since future climate scenarios are intrinsically time-dependent, investment timing is the biggest issue. We propose the Adaptive Investment Model (AIM) to determine the timing of investment, using real options valuation. AIM comprises four steps: identification of hydropower adaptation to climate change (step 1), calculation of key variables (step 2), real options valuation (ROV) (step 3), and decision-making (step 4). This model allows investors to assess the economic feasibility and suggests optimal investment timing for adaptation to climate change.

Accordingly, in Africa, climate change adaptation has become an issue of international funding and practice. As suggested in the Introduction to this special issue, administrative traditions could play a role in how adaptation plays out. This, however, raises questions about how foreign funding regimes coincide with recipients' administrative traditions, especially on the African continent where administrative traditions are often meagerly established. To address these questions, this article takes an explorative approach. From a literature review of African state governance and development aid approaches, we take colonial legacy as the most distinctive factor responsible for African administrative traditions. In addition, we define three ways in which foreign aid programs have dealt with African administration: (1) aligning with donor administration, (2) blueprinting administration, and (3) ignoring administration. Using 34 African countries' National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs), we analyze how African governments actually frame adaptation as a governance challenge. We contrast these frames with: (1) administrative traditions based on colonial legacy and (2) the ways in which development aid programs have historically dealt with recipient African administrations. Our findings indicate that NAPAs only meagerly refer to the administrative tradition that could be expected based on colonial legacy, but extensively refer to blueprint ideas common among international donors, or ignore administration altogether. We discuss the implications for adaptation to climate change.","[Vink, Martinus] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vink, Martinus] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands; [Schouten, Greetje] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Partnerships Resource Ctr, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Vink, M (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Vink, M (corresponding author), PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands.",,,"Schouten, Greetje/0000-0002-8616-3235","INOGOV grant COST Action INOGOV (IS1309 Innovations in Climate Governance: Sources, Patterns and Effects) (2014-18)","INOGOV grant COST Action INOGOV (IS1309 Innovations in Climate Governance: Sources, Patterns and Effects) (2014-18)","This research has been financially supported by the INOGOV grant COST Action INOGOV (IS1309 Innovations in Climate Governance: Sources, Patterns and Effects) (2014-18).

Buildings are vulnerable to climate change risk and are also the source of a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change. The construction industry has significant potential to facilitate adaptation through actions that both reduce its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions across the construction and building lifecycle, and through physical adaptation of buildings and settlements to withstand present and future changes. However, there is limited evidence of significant adaptive action to date, and little is known about existing barriers to adaptation actions in the construction industry. This research explores barriers to climate change adaptation in the Australian construction industry through qualitative interviews with twenty-one key stakeholders. The barriers identified included: the use of inconsistent and unclear language, limited regulation, perceived unaffordability of initiatives, lack of awareness of climate change, and lack of client demand to implement initiatives. Recommendations to facilitate strategies for adaptation to climate change in the construction industry are provided. These focus on the need to a) address climate change through regulatory reform, and b) address the structure of the construction industry and its interrelationship with other built environment professions and processes.","[Hurlimann, Anna C.; Browne, Geoffrey R.; Warren-Myers, Georgia; Francis, Valerie] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Hurlimann, AC (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",hurac@unimelb.edu.au; geoffrey.browne@unimelb.edu.au; g.warrenmyers@unimelb.edu.au; vfrancis@unimelb.edu.au,"Warren-Myers, Georgia/ABI-1819-2020; Browne, Geoffrey/ABA-3139-2020","Warren-Myers, Georgia/0000-0002-1453-8421; Hurlimann, Anna/0000-0001-9110-9340; Browne, Geoffrey R/0000-0003-1990-3050",Brookfield Multiplex Construction Innovation Grant,Brookfield Multiplex Construction Innovation Grant,"This work was supported by a Brookfield Multiplex Construction Innovation Grant 2016-2017.

The disastrous effects of the recent tropical cyclone Idai in Zimbabwe's eastern highlands, whereby lives and livelihoods were destroyed, calls for fundamental rethinking on how knowledge sharing can be useful in reducing vulnerabilities. This study aims to examine how knowledge sharing practices among selected climate action organisations can support positive results in evidence-based climate change adaptation in Zimbabwe and recommends a strategy to enhance knowledge sharing for evidence-based climate change adaptation. Design/methodology/approach The researcher opted for a qualitative research methodology, and interviews were conducted with research participants to get in-depth information. The target population for the research is drawn from three climate change organisations in Zimbabwe. These participants were chosen because of their direct involvement in climate change adaptation and mitigation. Purposive sampling was used because it was considered an easy and informal method to reach the target population. The responses were coded and readied for analysis. Categories for analysis were also determined and described. The next section focuses on the presentation and interpretation of the responses. Findings The study found out that even though there is evidence of knowledge sharing in the selected organisations, there was a need for a strategy that integrates the efforts of all climate action organisation to realise successful climate change adaptation. Successful climate change adaptation requires an integrative force in the form of a strategy that supports knowledge sharing. The strategy breaks the silo mode of operation by bringing together all stakeholders through knowledge sharing. Research limitations/implications The research study was unique to the Zimbabwean climate change and adaptation context and only a purposive sampling of participants representing three climate change action was feasible. Social implications The proposed model will enhance knowledge sharing among climate change and adaptation organisations in Zimbabwe. It will transform knowledge management practices among climate change organisations in Zimbabwe. Originality/value The study recommends a knowledge sharing strategy that can be useful in supporting climate change adaptation. The model will support decision-making by providing access to shareable information on climate change. The proposed knowledge sharing strategy integrates the efforts of all stakeholders, including communities, government and academia, among many. The study proposes an original model for climate change adaptation for Zimbabwe.","[Chisita, Collence Takaingenhamo] Univ South Africa, Dept Informat Sci, Pretoria, South Africa; [Fombad, Madelien C.] Univ South Africa, Coll Human Sci, Dept Informat Sci, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa; University of South Africa,"Chisita, CT (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Dept Informat Sci, Pretoria, South Africa.",chisitacollence@yahoo.com; fombamc@unisa.ac.za,"Chisita, Collence Takaingenhamo/ABD-4222-2020","Chisita, Collence Takaingenhamo/0000-0002-7375-8627",Department of Information Sciences at UNISA,Department of Information Sciences at UNISA,The authors would like to acknowledge the Department of Information Sciences at UNISA for providing support for knowledge generation in support of scholarship.,,64,1,1,2,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2059-5891,1474-1032,,VINE J INF KNOWL MAN,VINE J.

This analysis of regional narratives of ice loss exposes the contested role of glacial meltwater amongst local residents, framing glaciers not just as physical features but also as nodes of discourse and imagination that influence climate change adaptation. Peru's Cordillera Blanca offers an excellent case study for this new narrative approach to shrinking glaciers. The Cordillera Blanca hosts 25 percent of Earth's tropical glaciers, has hundreds of glacial lakes and has generated some of the world's deadliest glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite decades of glacial lake management in the Cordillera Blanca, government agencies, researchers, local people and hydroelectric companies often disagree as to how to safely manage these lakes to prevent floods and maintain water security. This study helps explain why they disagree and why social conflict has repeatedly occurred around Lakes Palcacocha and Shallap. It analyzes narratives embedded in local and national newspapers and other media to understand varying views. Frequently, competing visions of glacial lake risk management stem from power structures that prioritize certain narratives over others in response to perceived political and environmental conditions. Thus, narrative analysis offers a methodology to understand local and regional experiences with glacier change and climate adaptation, including how and where environmental authority emerges, with broader implications for a global politics of ice loss.","[Moulton, Holly; Carey, Mark] Univ Oregon, Environm Studies Program, 1585 E 13th Ave, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Carey, Mark] Dept Geog, 1585 E 13th Ave, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Huggel, Christian; Motschmann, Alina] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Oregon; University of Zurich,"Moulton, H (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Environm Studies Program, 1585 E 13th Ave, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",hmoulton@uoregon.edu,,,Swiss National Science Foundation through the AguaFuturo Project [205121L_166272],Swiss National Science Foundation through the AguaFuturo Project,This project was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation through the AguaFuturo Project (project no. 205121L_166272).,,108,3,4,4,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,OCT,2021,125,,,,,,47,56,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2021.06.011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2021.06.011,,JUL 2021,10,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,TT3IZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000680245800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Co-production of knowledge has become a key, intrinsic component in both sustainability sciences and adaptation research. In this review article, we investigate if and how the SDG agenda is included in the application of participatory approaches and co-production of knowledge for climate change adaptation. We review findings from such processes in projects whose objective is to foster adaptation in the context of SDGs and to categorize the methods employed to forward co-production. We investigate 1) whether and how co-production approaches localize SDG targets and address tradeoffs and synergies, 2) whether they focus on power asymmetries and political dimensions in such participatory processes, and 3) whether and how the literature show that the SDG agenda contributes to a shift in the role of researchers towards a more interventionist approach to co-production. Our results show that there is little evidence that the SDG agenda contributes to a shift towards more interventionist or transformative approaches within climate change adaptation. Further, we have a identified a missed opportunity in the exclusion of social SDGs (SDG 5 and 10) in the discussions of adaptation and co-production and SGDs. Most importantly, we find that participatory efforts, including the co-production of knowledge, for localizing SDG goals and resolving tradeoffs and benefits, are the most salient aspects that tie the three co-production - adaptation - the SDG agenda together. Such participatory localizing processes have a great potential in facilitating long-enduring empowerment and legitimacy in adaptation efforts.","[Dannevig, Halvor; Korsbrekke, Mari Hanssen] Western Norway Res Inst, POB 163, N-6851 Sogndal, Norway; [Hovelsrud, Grete K.] Nordland Res Inst, Univ Alleen 11, N-8049 Bodo, Norway",,"Dannevig, H (corresponding author), Western Norway Res Inst, POB 163, N-6851 Sogndal, Norway.",hda@vestforsk.no,,,,,,,60,0,0,5,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

I examine how encounters between financiers and government officials might produce vulnerability to climate change. I draw throughout from field research conducted in Kiribati, an archetypical 'vulnerable-to-climate-change' place, and a preeminent site for experimentation in climate change adaptation. By discussing several instances where Government of Kiribati elites are required to enact vulnerability in order to secure climate change adaptation financing, I demonstrate that such encounters are performative. This research contributes to theories of performativity in showing that the matrix conditioning and compelling such performative enactments of vulnerability is socionatural, consisting of a collective of climate change impacts, adaptation-finance technocrats, and many others. Thus, I demonstrate that vulnerability is not a latent condition, but, rather, an emergent effect of an assemblage of facts, expert actors, and objects.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Webber, S (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",Sophie.webber@geog.ubc.ca,,"Webber, Sophie/0000-0002-7597-4622",,,,,75,41,41,3,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

We tested hypotheses based on this assumption using survey responses from 508 European forest professionals in ten countries. We used the survey results to identify communication needs and the decision strategies at play, and to develop guidelines on adequate communications about climate change adaptation. We observed polarization in the positive and negative values associated with climate change impacts accepted by survey respondents. We identified a mechanism creating the polarization that we call the 'blocked belief' effect. We found that polarized values did not correlate with decisions about climate change adaptation. Strong belief in the local impacts of climate change on the forest was, however, a prerequisite of decision-making favoring adaptation. Decision-making in favor of adaptation to climate change also correlated with net values of expected specific impacts on the forest and generally increased with the absolute value of these in the absence of 'tipping point' behavior. Tipping point behavior occurs when adaptation is not pursued in spite of the strongly negative or positive net value of expected climate change impacts. We observed negative and positive tipping point behavior, mainly in SW Europe and N-NE Europe, respectively. In addition we found that advice on effective adaptation may inhibit adaptation when the receiver is aware of effective adaptation measures unless it is balanced with information explaining how climate change leads to negative impacts. Forest professionals with weak expectations of impacts require communications on climate change and its impacts on forests before any advice on adaptation measures can be effective. We develop evidence-based guidelines on communications using a new methodology which includes Bayesian machine learning modeling of the equivalent of an expected utility function for the adaptation decision problem.","[Blennow, K.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture Planning & Management, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Persson, J.] Lund Univ, Dept Philosophy, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Goncalves, L.

While climate change adaptation has been studied at the local level and in the context of major climate organizations, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, we provide a first quantitative dataset on non-environmental IOs that can be linked to different social scientific datasets relevant for adaptation. Our new dataset contains information on the governance activities of 30 IOs from 1990 to 2017. Based on this dataset, we introduce different types of adaptation-related activities and develop a quantitative measure of IOs' climate adaptation engagement. We map the adaptation engagement of the 30 IOs across organizations, across issue areas, and over time. This dataset can be used to compare adaptation activities across and within IOs, but also as an empirical foundation for the emerging research field of global adaptation governance, for which IO climate change adaptation activities are relevant.","[Kural, Ece; Dellmuth, Lisa Maria] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ Hist & Int Relat, Stockholm, Sweden; [Gustafsson, Maria-Therese] Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; Stockholm University,"Dellmuth, LM (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ Hist & Int Relat, Stockholm, Sweden.",lisa.dellmuth@su.se,"Dellmuth, Lisa/AFR-8126-2022","Dellmuth, Lisa/0000-0002-1298-8525","Svenska Forskningsradet Formas; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (Mistra) [2016/11, 5]",Svenska Forskningsradet Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (Mistra)(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research),"LD, MTG, EK were financially supported by the Svenska Forskningsradet Formas under grant number for the Glocalizing Climate Governance (GlocalClim) project, and by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (Mistra) under grant number 2016/11 #5 for the Mistra Geopolitics project. www.formas.se www.mistra-geopolitics.se The funding agencies did not play any role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,70,2,2,4,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,,2021,16,9,,,,,,,e0257101,10.1371/journal.pone.0257101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257101,,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,XM9EM,34506547,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000729120700090,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mitigation possibilities are mainly focused on producing energy from renewable resources, reducing CO, emissions from fossil fuels and using biomass specifically produced or different types of wastes. Other mitigation strategies are contrasting or governing land use changes or sequestring C into the soil. Adaptation to climate change will need anthropic intervention, to help the adapting capability of different environments.

In this article, we systematically review academic literature to identify where adaptation in SIDS is documented; what type of adaptation strategies are taken, and in response to which climate change impacts; and the extent to which this adaptation has been judged as successful. Our analysis indicates that much adaptation research is concentrated on the Pacific, on independent island states, and on core areas within SIDS. Research documents a wide array of adaptation strategies across SIDS, notably structural or physical and behavioral changes. Yet, evaluation of concrete adaptation interventions is lacking; it thus remains unclear to what extent documented adaptation effectively and sustainably reduces SIDS' vulnerability and increases their resilience.","[Klock, Carola] Sci Po Paris, Ctr Int Res, Paris, France; [Nunn, Patrick D.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast,"Klock, C (corresponding author), Sci Po Paris, Ctr Int Res, Paris, France.",carola.kloeck@sciencespo.fr,"Nunn, Patrick/ABA-2943-2021; Nunn, Patrick D./C-7864-2011","Nunn, Patrick/0000-0001-9295-5741; Nunn, Patrick D./0000-0001-9295-5741; Klock, Carola/0000-0003-2987-7570",Australian Research Council [LP160100941]; Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research [CRRP2015-FP02]; Australian Research Council [LP160100941] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors originally presented this work at Adapting to Climate Change: Actions, Implementations and Outcomes, University of Notre Dame, South Bend, April-May 2017'' and C.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear which design properties of international arrangements match with specific problems in local adaptation processes. This paper analyses conditions and institutional design options under which international cooperation can facilitate climate adaptation in urban areas in developing countries. We conduct a qualitative meta-analysis of empirical evidence from 23 cases. Using the archetype approach, we identify re-appearing barriers and change factors in urban squatter settlements and municipal public sectors in developing countries. We characterise five generic modes of international cooperation for climate adaptation based on UNFCCC documents, process observation, and literature review. Combining these analyses, we develop testable propositions that explain how specific design options of international arrangements can alleviate barriers and make use of change factors for urban adaptation in developing countries. We find, first, that international cooperation has the most potential to tackle adaptation barriers in squatter settlements if its institutional mechanisms support improvements of procedures and rights in localised state society interactions. Second, national or regional centres of competence may foster endogenous dynamics in municipal public sectors. Third, national adaptation policies can enable and incentivise municipal adaptation. Fourth, flexible indicators of adaptation benefits are instruments to tailor international decision making and monitoring systems to local needs. We conclude that these insights, the archetypes approach, and a multi-level study design can be used to advance research on international cooperation, barriers, and success factors for climate change adaptation.

Thus, an important challenge for climate change communicators is how to most effectively engage different types of audiences. This study aimed to identify distinct audience segments that vary in terms of their values, beliefs, and responses to climate change and determine for each segment which specific message attributes increased motivation to engage in climate adaptation. A sample of 1031 Australian residents (aged 18-66 years) completed an online survey assessing their values, beliefs, and behaviors related to climate change, and recording their responses to a broad range of climate change adaptation messages. Latent profile analysis identified three distinct audience segments: alarmed (34.4%), uncommitted (45.2%), and dismissive (20.3%). Sixty climate change adaptation messages were coded in terms of the presence/absence of six attributes: explicit reference to climate change, providing specific adaptation advice, strong negative emotive content, emphasis on collective responsibility, highlighting local impacts, and underscoring financial impacts. Participants viewed a random sample of six messages and rated the extent to which each message motivated them to seek out more information and immediately respond to the climate change threat portrayed in the message. Multilevel modeling indicated messages that included strong negative emotive content or provided specific adaptation advice increased adaptation intentions in all three audience segments. Omitting any mention of climate change and emphasizing local impacts increased adaptation intentions in dismissive audiences. Implications for tailoring and targeting climate change adaptation messages are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The case study shows the application of two methods: scenario workshops and adaptation pathways in the context of a participatory action research methodological design. Participatory action research and qualitative scenario methods are highlighted as accelerators of climate change adaptation processes by calling to action, facilitating and connecting diverse social groups with a stake in a long-term plan towards a more adapted society. The experience leads to the conclusion that planning climate change adaptation has to go far beyond the technical dimension and take into account those affected (in the present and the future) by decisions made.

However, the extent to which health impacts are being prioritized and acted on is not well understood. Methods We investigated the role of public health in adapting to climate change through: (i) a content analysis of local authority climate change adaptation strategies in South West England and (ii) semi-structured telephone interviews with local authority public health consultants and sustainability officers and a regional Public Health England representative (n = 11). Results Adaptation strategies/plans varied in existence and scope. Public health consultants did not have an explicit remit for climate change adaptation, although related action often aligned with public health's emergency planning functions. Key barriers to health-related adaptation were financial constraints, lack of leadership and limited public and professional awareness about health impacts. Conclusions Local authorities in South West England have differing approaches to tackling health impacts of climate change, and the prominence of public health arguments for adaptation varies. Improved public health intelligence, concise communications, targeted support, visible local and national leadership and clarity on economic costs and benefits of adaptation would be useful for local authorities in preparing for the health impacts of climate change.","[Woodhall, Sarah C.] South Gloucestershire Council, Publ Hlth & Wellbeing Div, Bristol BS37 5AF, Avon, England; [Woodhall, Sarah C.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Landeg, Owen] Publ Hlth England, Extreme Events & Hlth Protect, London SE1 8UG, England; [Kovats, Sari] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, NIHR Hlth Protect Res Unit NIHR HPRU Environm Cha, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Kovats, Sari] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth Environm & Soc, London WC1H 9SH, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Public Health England; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Woodhall, SC (corresponding author), South Gloucestershire Council, Publ Hlth & Wellbeing Div, Bristol BS37 5AF, Avon, England.;Woodhall, SC (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1H 9SH, England.",s.woodhall@nhs.net,,"Kovats, Sari/0000-0002-4823-8099",National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Public Health England (PHE); University of Exeter; University College London; Met Office; Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Public Health England (PHE); University of Exeter; University College London(General Electric); Met Office; Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,"This work was supported by the National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in partnership with Public Health England (PHE) and in collaboration with the University of Exeter, University College London and the Met Office.

Climate change adaptation strategies can reduce the production risk relating to unforeseen climatic shocks and increase farmers' food, income, and livelihood security. This paper investigates rice farmers' adaptive capacities to adapt climate change strategies to reduce the rice production risk. The study collected 400 farm-level micro-data of rice farmers with the direct cooperation of Rajshahi District. The survey was conducted during periods between June and July of 2020. Rice farmers' adaptive capacities were estimated quantitatively by categorizing the farmers as high, moderate, and low level adapters to climate change adaptation strategies. In this study, a Cobb-Douglas production function was used to measure the effects of farmers' adaptive capacities on rice production. The obtained results show that farmers are moderately adaptive in terms of adaptation strategies on climate change and the degree of adaptation capacities. Agronomic practices such as the quantity of fertilizer used, the amount of labor, the farm's size, and extension contacts have a substantial impact on rice production. This study recommends that a farmer more significantly adjusts to adaptation strategies on climate change to reduce rice production. These strategies will help farmers to reduce the risk and produce higher quality rice. Consequently, rice farmers should facilitate better extension services and change the present agronomic practice to attain a higher adaptation status. It can be very clearly seen that low adaptability results in lower rice yields.","[Ali, Shahjahan] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Doctoral Sch Econ & Reg Sci, Pater Karoly St 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Ghosh, Bikash Chandra] Pabna Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Pabna 6600, Bangladesh; [Osmani, Ataul Gani] Varendra Univ, Dept Econ, Rajshahi 6204, Bangladesh; [Hossain, Elias] Rajshahi Univ, Dept Econ, Rajshahi 6205, Bangladesh; [Fogarassy, Csaba] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Dev & Farming, Pater Karoly St 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; University of Rajshahi; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Ali, S (corresponding author), Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Doctoral Sch Econ & Reg Sci, Pater Karoly St 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.;Fogarassy, C (corresponding author), Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Dev & Farming, Pater Karoly St 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.",ali.shahjahan@hallgato.uni-szie.hu; bikasheco_pust@yamil.com; ataul@vu.edu.bd; eliaseco@ru.ac.bd; fogarassy.csaba@uni-mate.hu,"Ali, Shahjahan/ACI-6728-2022; Fogarassy, Csaba/J-3000-2019; Osmani, Md.

Conventional approaches to risk management are summarized, the manner in which they are being advanced as a tool for climate change adaptation is described, and emerging themes in risk management and climate change adaption are documented. It is argued that conventional risk management for climate change adaptation can benefit from the insights and experiences of adaptive co-management. A hybrid approach termed adaptive collaborative risk management is thus envisaged that enriches conventional risk management with the critical features of adaptive co-management, i.e., collaboration and adaptation. Adaptive Collaborative Risk Management overcomes some of the challenges with conventional risk management, builds upon and complements other approaches to community climate change adaptation, and innovatively addresses both technical and governance concerns in a single integrated process.","[May, Bradley] Environm Canada, Adaptat & Impacts Res Sect, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [Plummer, Ryan] Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Plummer, Ryan] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Brock University; Stockholm University,"May, B (corresponding author), Environm Canada, Adaptat & Impacts Res Sect, Gatineau, PQ, Canada.",,,"May, Bradley/0000-0002-3863-8240",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Chancellor's Chair for Research Excellence at Brock University,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Chancellor's Chair for Research Excellence at Brock University,"The authors would like to express their gratitude to the ESRC, NERC, DEFRA and University of East Anglia, as well as the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change for the opportunities to present preliminary thoughts at their respective international expert workshop and conference.

Knowing factors that determine people respond to climate change challenges is essential to explaining their perceptions of climate change adaptation. We have conducted astudy in North-Eastern Romania applying the Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change. The aim was to identify private forest owners' perceptions about climate change and forest management threats and constraints and to analyse what variables differentiate private forest owners' adaptation behavior. The PFOs with higher education were aware of the forest regime regarding private management. They knew how to assess climate change risk, while those with secondary education were the only interest was obtaining wood. The PFOs' risk experience played an important role in adaptation. The perceptions and beliefs of PFOs were strongly influenced by socio-economic status, and they believe in climate change effects on forests but not on theirs. Adaption has become less urgent because forest management problems blur climate change beliefs. Assuming that the Romanian PFOs' perceptions and beliefs about climate change will follow the European trend, they will want to improve their knowledge about climate change impacts and adaptive measures. Therefore, aggregating the interested PFOs, creating suitable communication channels, and organizing trainings on forest management adaptation to climate change will be needed to prevent this need.","[Cosofret, Cosmin; Bouriaud, Laura] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Forestry Fac, Univ St 13, RO-720229 Suceava, Romania; [Cosofret, Cosmin] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Geomat Lab, Univ St 13, RO-720229 Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava; Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Cosofret, C (corresponding author), Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Forestry Fac, Univ St 13, RO-720229 Suceava, Romania.;Cosofret, C (corresponding author), Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Geomat Lab, Univ St 13, RO-720229 Suceava, Romania.",cosmin.cosofret@usm.ro,"Cosofret, Cosmin/ABJ-2037-2022","Cosofret, Cosmin/0000-0002-1858-349X",European H2020 [817903 EFFECT]; Fem4Forest - Forests in Women's Hands - European Union [DTP3-500-1.2],European H2020; Fem4Forest - Forests in Women's Hands - European Union,"This research was funded from European H2020, Grant 817903 EFFECT and by Fem4Forest - Forests in Women's Hands, project ID: DTP3-500-1.2 funded by European Union through Interreg Danube Transnational Programme.",,48,0,0,5,5,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",2454-034X,2454-0358,,CENT EURO FOR J,Cent.

Although Norway, as other Nordic countries, potentially benefits from higher temperatures in terms of agricultural production, adaptation will be necessary. Employing resilience as a theoretical lens, this study investigates Norwegian farmers' handling of the dry summer of 2018, a summer that comprehensively challenged agricultural production throughout Europe. In-depth interviews revealed that farmers' main strategy was to improve their buffer capacity to be able to 'bounce back' (i.e., to get 'through' the summer to return to a 'normal' situation). Informal and formal networks, access to outfield resources and governmental support played key roles in enhancing the buffer capacity. Structural changes in the agricultural sector seem to challenge future access to the resources needed to improve the buffer capacity in times of crisis. Within the current environmental, social and political framework, farms are considered resilient, and strengthening buffer capacity is reasonable. However, a higher frequency of extreme weather events may require that other capacities, such as adaptive or transformative, be improved. Thus, resilience is not a given state and independent of values but strongly context dependent. To achieve long-term resilience, climate change adaptation needs to be politically encouraged and economically supported. Farmers need flexibility to use local resources. Worries about structural changes may draw farmers' attention away from making potentially important adaptations to climate change.","[Beitnes, Synnove Stoverud] Univ Bergen, Dept Geog, POB 7802, NO-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Beitnes, Synnove Stoverud] Western Norway Res Inst, POB 163, NO-6851 Sogndal, Norway; [Kopainsky, Birgit] Univ Bergen, Syst Dynam Grp, POB 7802, NO-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Potthoff, Kerstin] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Landscape Architecture, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway",University of Bergen; University of Bergen; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Potthoff, K (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Landscape Architecture, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",sbe@vestforsk.no; Birgit.Kopainsky@uib.no; Kerstin.Potthoff@nmbu.no,,"Beitnes, Synnove Stoverud/0000-0001-5511-6199",,,,,55,1,1,5,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Focusing on the impact of high temperature, low temperature, drought, and flooding, we established multi-dimensional assessment systems covering natural, economic, and social elements for cities' climate change adaptations. Based on the assessment systems, studies on adaptation to climate change were conducted in 248 cities in China using the entropy weight method, coefficient of variation method, and exploratory spatial data analysis; with the help of geographically weighted regression (GWR), the relationships between four types of urbanization and cities' adaptation to climate events were explored. The results showed the following: (1) High-administrative-level cities had higher adaptation than ordinary prefecture-level cities. (2) The differences in adaptation to the four types of climate events between cities within each of the seven regions in China presented significantly different spatial patterns. (3) Under the four types of climate events, the global spatial correlations of cities' adaptations in China were positive. The agglomeration characteristics of adaptation were mainly H-H and L-L agglomerations. (4) When analyzing the impacts of four types of urbanization on cities' adaptation to climate events, the fitting effects of GWR models were far better than those of OLS models. Population urbanization, economic urbanization, land urbanization, and industrial urbanization had different impacts on adaptation.

The term 'stakeholder' is broad and researchers and practitioners may have interrelated and contrasting views on who is a stakeholder or who is (or should be) responsible for adaptation to climate change.

Through a case study approach, based on studies of two Swedish urban regions, Stockholm and Gothenburg, this paper proposes a systematic method to analyse and identify roles and responsibilities in the stakeholder landscape. The initial mapping exercise was complemented by participatory studies of local and regional stakeholders' perceptions of who is, or should be, involved in adaptation and their significance for climate change adaptation in the respective regions. The results indicate the value of careful stakeholder analysis for sustainable, effective, planned adaptation that is flexible, but also systematic enough to fulfil practical and scientific requirements for the study and advancement of ongoing adaptation processes and implementation.","[Andre, Karin; Linner, Bjorn-Ola] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Andre, Karin; Linner, Bjorn-Ola] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Water & Environm Studies, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Simonsson, Louise] Swedish Def Res Agcy FOI, SE-90182 Umea, Sweden; [Swartling, Asa Gerger] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Swartling, Asa Gerger] Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Linner, Bjorn-Ola] Univ Oxford, Inst Sci, Oxford, England",Linkoping University; Linkoping University; FOI - Swedish Defence Research Agency; Stockholm Environment Institute; Stockholm University; University of Oxford,"Andre, K (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden.",karin.andre@liu.se,"Linnér, Björn-Ola/AAL-2040-2020; Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/J-1420-2018","Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/0000-0003-3616-7323; Andre, Karin/0000-0002-0373-0143",,,,,67,25,25,1,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1523-908X,,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

Environmental Health Practitioners (EHPs) can play an important role in helping communities adapt to climate change health impacts, however, effective coordination of this requires further understanding of their roles in implementing climate change-related adaptation actions in communities.MethodsA cross-sectional survey using convenience sampling was undertaken at the January 2017 conference for EHPs hosted by the South African Institute of Environmental Health in Cape Town. All EHPs who attended the conference were invited to complete a study questionnaire that requested information on participant demographics, as well as climate change related-knowledge, practices and perceptions.ResultsMajority of participating EHPs (n=48; 72.8%) had received formal or informal training on climate change and health. Thirty-nine percent of EHPs indicated that they had a climate change and health-related committee / working group in their department, a policy or strategy (41.0%) and budget allocated for climate change and health-related work (51.5%).

Embedding climate adaptation in responses to multiple threats and stresses helps us to understand climate change impacts, themselves often products of multiple stresses, to achieve community acceptance of needed adaptations as cobenefits of addressing multiple threats, and to mainstream the process of climate adaptation through the larger envelope of social relationships, communication channels, and broad-based awareness of needs for risk management that accompany community resilience.","[Wilbanks, Thomas J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Wilbanks, TJ (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, POB 2008,MS 6038, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",wilbankstj@ornl.gov; rwkates@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,74,75,1,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

This article contributes to the study of transnational climate adaptation through an investigation of international connectivity on climate adaptation between regional policy-makers. We examine the RegionsAdapt initiative, the first global commitment to promote and track the progress of regional adaptation. While adapting to climate change at the regional level is crucial, we suggest that transnational adaptation governance not only helps to promote adaptation measures, but also improves the process of tracking the progress of such action, its visibility and its aggregation. Technical summary Adaptation to climate change has traditionally been framed as a local problem. However, in recent years, and particularly since the 2015 Paris Agreement established a global goal on adaptation, adaptation has risen on the global policy agenda. This article investigates the transnationalization of climate adaptation by regional governments. In contrast to the transnational dimension of climate mitigation, the transnationalization of adaptation governance is incipient and has received scarce academic attention. We examine the RegionsAdapt initiative, the first global commitment to support and report on adaptation efforts at the state and regional level. The initiative aims to promote regional climate adaptation, as well as to improve reporting of adaptation action. Drawing upon the three key elements that characterize the transnationalization of adaptation governance, we explore the scope, institutionalization and structure of this initiative. While the implementation of adaptation measures is largely the responsibility of regional and local governments and communities, we argue that transnational adaptation governance not only helps to promote adaptation measures, but also improves the process of tracking the progress of such action, its visibility and its aggregation. We suggest that incorporating adaptation into platforms such as the Global Climate Action portal would motivate further mobilization and accountability of adaptation action.","[Setzer, Joana; de Murieta, Elisa Sainz] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst GRI, London WC2A 2AZ, England; [de Murieta, Elisa Sainz; Galarraga, Ibon] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Leioa 48940, Basque Country, Spain; [Rei, Fernando; Lomba Pinho, Mariangela Mendes] Univ Catolica Santos, Fac Law, Santos, SP, Brazil",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Universidade Catolica de Santos,"Setzer, J (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst GRI, London WC2A 2AZ, England.",j.setzer@lse.ac.uk,"; Sainz de Murieta, Elisa/D-4946-2012","Setzer, Joana/0000-0002-7705-7684; Sainz de Murieta, Elisa/0000-0001-8120-3392","British Academy; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) via the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Basque Government [BERC 2018-2021, POS_2018_2_0027]; Research Council of Norway under the project Strategic Challenges in International Climate and Energy Policy (CICEP); Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 programme and of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation [MDM-2017-0714]",British Academy; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) via the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Basque Government(Basque Government); Research Council of Norway under the project Strategic Challenges in International Climate and Energy Policy (CICEP)(Research Council of Norway); Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 programme and of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation,"Joana Setzer acknowledges financial support from the British Academy through a Postdoctoral Fellowship, as well as the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) via the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy.

Empirical research in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) and the Netherlands proves that there are substantive differences in the organization of governance processes regarding flood management in response to climate change. This article answers the question of how Flanders and the Netherlands, confronted with universal challenges and dilemmas in the governance of adaptation to climate change - integration versus differentiation (multi-sector versus sector-based governance), the problem of scaling (multilevel governance) and the division of public and private responsibilities (multi-actor governance) - are designing and structuring their approaches. More specifically, we look at how differences in the framing of climate adaptation can explain why organizational practices differ. For this purpose, a distinction is made between diagnostic framing (what is the problem?), prognostic framing (what could be possible solutions?) and action framing (how to act?). By referring to existing policy frames, the article explains recent policy choices on climate change adaptation in flood management.","[Crabbe, Ann] Univ Antwerp, Res Grp Soc & Environm, Fac Polit & Social Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Wiering, Mark; Liefferink, Duncan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Polit Sci Environm, Nijmegen Sch Management, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",University of Antwerp; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Crabbe, A (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Res Grp Soc & Environm, Fac Polit & Social Sci, St Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",ann.crabbe@uantwerpen.be,"Wiering, Mark/AAD-8358-2022","Crabbe, Ann/0000-0001-5179-2544",State of the Environment Reporting team of the Flemish Environment Agency; Consortium 'Governance of Climate Adaptation' of the Dutch Knowledge for Climate Programme,State of the Environment Reporting team of the Flemish Environment Agency; Consortium 'Governance of Climate Adaptation' of the Dutch Knowledge for Climate Programme,The empirical information in this paper stems from two research projects on climate adaptation.

However, there are few insights into how smallholder climate-smart adaptation practices influence their technical (in)efficiency. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of smallholders' climate-smart adaptation practices on their crop production technical efficiency (TE) in the Lemo district of southern Ethiopia. We used focus group discussion, experts' consultations and household survey to collect data from 600 smallholder crop producers across six rural kebeles. We computed smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation indices based on experts' consultations and estimated the TE of the smallholder farmers using Stochastic Frontier Analysis. The smallholder farmers in the Lemo district have adopted climate-smart agricultural practices such as terracing, crop diversification, improved soil amendment practices, varying planting or harvesting schedules, and crop rotation. The smallholder farm households practicing more adaptation strategies on a larger scale were more technically efficient than their counterparts with their TE averaging 11.31, 8.62, and 6.71% for major crops, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and teff [Eragrostis tef) (Zucc.) Trotter] production, respectively. Our model also revealed that adaptation to climate change has a positive and significant contribution to the technical efficiency of major crops, wheat, and teff production. Other key determinants of TE are farming experience, education, access to extension services, livestock holdings, and farm household income. Overall, our study suggests a policy shift to promote smallholder farmers adaptation to climate change using climate-smart practices for an effective response to climate change impact while enhancing TE.","[Sedebo, Dessalegn Anshiso; Li, Gu-Cheng; Ouattara, N'Banan; Olounlade, Ambaliou] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Abebe, Kidane Assefa; Etea, Bekele Gebisa] Ambo Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Ambo, Ethiopia; [Ahiapka, John Kojo] Res Desk Consulting Ltd, Proton St, Kwabenya Accra 2918, Ghana; [Frimpong, Stephen] Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",Huazhong Agricultural University; Ambo University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Li, GC (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",lgcabc@mail.hzau.edu.cn,"FRIMPONG, STEPHEN/AID-5349-2022","Sedebo, Dessalegn Anshiso/0000-0002-3122-0511",National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (NSFC) [71873050],National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The work was financially supported by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (NSFC No. 71873050).

While climate change is global, impacts are local and regional, and vulnerability varies widely across communities, countries, and regions. Climate change awareness has been related to how willingly communities adapt to climate change; thus, identifying communities' awareness could help to gain insights into communities' willingness to adopt climate change policy. In this study, we use culturomics to analyze big data from Google search queries to group countries based on their awareness, potential willingness, and potential capacity to deal with climate change. We demonstrate that culturomics can be used to allocate countries along a typology gradient, ranging from high-risk and high awareness to low-risk and low awareness, to climate change. Furthermore, we identify a positive correlation between countries' climate vulnerability and awareness of climate change. As the Paris Agreement establishes a global goal to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, identifying countries' potential adaptive capacity to climate impacts is critical. Pairing culturomics insights with climate vulnerability is a novel approach to facilitate international climate change adaptation.","[Archibald, Carla L.] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Archibald, Carla L.; Butt, Nathalie] Univ Queensland, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Butt, Nathalie] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Archibald, CL (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.;Archibald, CL (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.archibald@uq.edu.au,"; Butt, Nathalie/B-3558-2014","Archibald, Carla/0000-0003-1640-8396; Butt, Nathalie/0000-0003-1517-6191",Australian Postgraduate Award; ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions; ARC [DE150101552]; Australian Research Council [DE150101552] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Postgraduate Award(Australian Government); ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions(Australian Research Council); ARC(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"CA is supported through an Australian Postgraduate Award and a top-up scholarship through the ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions.

Despite the growing global awareness, developing flood resilient cities has proven to be a major challenge. This paper investigates the application of an event-based scalable Flood Resilience Index (FRI) for assessing climate change adaptation. Flood resilience is represented by three dimensions: physical, social and economic. A household climate adaptation is adopted consisting of a combination of a flood-proof gate with an indoor tank and a submersible pump system implemented in all houses. The climate related impact under a high-emission scenario (RCP8.5) is analysed for Munich with the CRCM5 Large-Ensemble. Results show that for Munich extreme heavy rainfall events are increasing. The FRI can successfully identify households and districts which: a) are mostly affected by heavy rainfall, b) benefit the most from the climate adaptation, and c) are the most resilient. For the most severe future scenario investigated the climate adaptation measure was able to improve 57% of all affected buildings within Maxvorstadt to an FRI equal to 1.0 during the event and recovery phase.

This paper explores changing state-society relationships through the reconstitution of community collectives and advocacy organisations for advancing climate change adaptation in the Indian city of Indore. The paper shows that communities are indeed recognising the need for adaptation but are, at the same time, integrating adaptation actions with existing strategies for advocating development rights. Communities are also rebuilding alliances between municipal and local institutions for public service and infrastructure provision, which point to the centrality of community politics in urban climate adaptation processes. However, such mobilisations are often dependent on existing political networks and a legacy of advocacy around poverty alleviation needs, which sideline more transformative agendas around inclusiveness, equity, and resilient urban futures.","[Chu, Eric K.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Chu, EK (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, Postbus 15629, NL-1001 NC Amsterdam, Netherlands.",e.k.chu@uva.nl,"Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615",Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; David L Boren Fellowship of the US National Security Education Program,Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; David L Boren Fellowship of the US National Security Education Program,This research was partially funded by the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and by the David L Boren Fellowship of the US National Security Education Program.,,93,23,24,6,47,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,JUN,2018,55,8,,,,,1766,1782,,10.1177/0042098016686509,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0042098016686509,,,17,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,GF9EE,,Green Published,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000432278100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The review was followed by office and field visits for verification. The office visit helped crosscheck the findings, and the field observations carried out between December 2020 and April 2021 asked 24 key informants and collected supplementary information appraisal and indicator development. Of the CCA projects studied, the most (n = 48, 32%) were community-based initiatives, while the least (n = 12, 8%) were ecosystem-based interventions. The main environment-centered projects were Ecosystem-based Adaptations and Ecosystems Protecting Infrastructure and Communities (EPIC) while Enhanced Action of Inclusive CSOs for Participation in Climate Resilient Economic Growth (UTHAN), Initiative for CCA (ICCA), Support to Rural Livelihoods and Climate Change Adaptation in the Himalayas (HIMALICA), etc., adaptation projects were community-based. Capacity building and awareness-raising were the major thrust of the CbA projects, while the abatement of climate vulnerabilities and risks through nature-based solutions were priorities of EbA. Payment for Ecosystem services is a nature-based solution that can play a role in enhancing adaptation to climate change at a local scale by adopting community-based and culturally appropriate methods and enhancing and incentivizing adaptation measures and capacities. A set of 11 criteria and 40 indicators comprised the institutional and behavioral responses and the use of technologies, and the design of climate-resilient plans and climate-smart practices were proposed as appraisal measures to evaluate the success of CCA interventions. The importance of criteria and indicators lies in the fact that such a comprehensive assessment would lead to effective and efficient adaptation projects, which could help benefit beyond the borders. It also furthers ongoing adaptation interventions and is set to be an integral part of associated studies and monitoring and review of new adaptation interventions.","[Karki, Gyanendra; Bhatta, Balram] Agr & Forestry Univ, Fac Forestry, Rampur 44200, Nepal; [Devkota, Naba R.] Gandaki Univ, Vice Chancellor Off, Pokhara 33700, Nepal; [Acharya, Ram P.] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Sustainable Agr Syst, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Kunwar, Ripu M.] Ethnobot Soc, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal",University of Southern Queensland,"Acharya, RP (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Sustainable Agr Syst, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",gyanendra.karki@gmail.com; deanforestry@afu.edu.np; nabadevkota.aafu@gmail.com; ram.pacharya@gmail.com; ripukunwar@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Acharya, Ram Prasad/0000-0001-5224-7759","Forestry and Agriculture University (AFU),Nepal","Forestry and Agriculture University (AFU),Nepal","The authors would like to thank the Forestry and Agriculture University (AFU),Nepal, for supporting the research work.

This in turn will seriously impact on the welfare of the people, particularly the rural farmers whose main livelihood depends on rain-fed agriculture. The level of impacts will mainly depend on the awareness and the level of adaptation in response to the changing climate. It is thus important to understand the role of the different factors that influence farmers' adaptation to ensure the development of appropriate policy measures and the design of successful development projects. This study examines farmers' perception of change in climatic attributes and the factors that influence farmers' choice of adaptation measures to climate change and variability. The estimated results from the climate change adaptation models indicate that level of education, age and wealth of the head of the household; access to credit and agricultural services; information on climate, and temperature all influence farmers' choices of adaptation. Moreover, lack of information on adaptation measures and lack of finance are seen as the main factors inhibiting adaptation to climate change.

However, they have not remained passive victims to these impacts. In light of this, rural people are on record of employing a plethora of adaptation strategies to cushion their livelihoods from climate change impacts. In this vew, the role of social capital as a determinant of climate change adaptation is underexplored. Little attention has been paid to how social capital fostered through trust and cooperation amongst rural households and communities is essential for climate change adaptation. This study explored how people in Mazungunye communal lands are embracing social capital to adapt to climate change impacts. The researchers adopted a qualitative research approach guided by the descriptive research design. The population of the study was gathered through simple random and purposive sampling techniques. Accordingly, the population sample consisted of 25 research participants drawn from members of the community following the simple random and purposive sampling techniques. In-depth individual interviews and focus group discussions were used to collect data. Data were analysed through the Thematic Content Analysis. This study established that different forms of social capital are being embraced by the community members to withstand the effects of climate change. These include village savings clubs (fushai), chief's granary (Zunde raMambo), collective field work (nhimbe), and destocking of livestock (kuronzera) strategies. These strategies illustrate community reliance on indigenous knowledge adaptation strategies as a community response to impacts of climate change on their livelihoods.","[Nyahunda, Louis; Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew] Univ Limpopo, Dept Res Adm & Dev, Pbag X1106, ZA-0727 Mankweng, South Africa",University of Limpopo,"Tirivangasi, HM (corresponding author), Univ Limpopo, Dept Res Adm & Dev, Pbag X1106, ZA-0727 Mankweng, South Africa.",happy.tirivangasi@ul.ac.za,"Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew/W-7695-2019; Nyahunda, Louis F/W-4577-2018","Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew/0000-0002-1353-6635; Nyahunda, Louis/0000-0002-9352-4115",,,,,39,1,1,3,6,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",2090-908X,,,SCIENTIFICA,Scientifica,APR 19,2021,2021,,,,,,,,8416410,10.1155/2021/8416410,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/8416410,,,9,Biology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,SF2CA,33959405,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000652567800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Peer-reviewed literature, governmental communiqu,s and reports are increasingly reporting formulated and implemented climate change adaptation policies, strategies and plans of action. A large part of this literature describes general policy strategies, while there is limited published work on adaptation interventions at the local scale. The generality of adaptation is not only limited to strategies but also in terms of coverage of regions believed to be highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Among such climate change hotspots where understanding on adaptation is limited are river deltas. Herein, this paper synthesizes selected literature on adaptation policy and practice in river deltas located in Africa and South Asia. A systematic review methodology was used to scan online knowledge portals for published papers and also unpublished government documents.

Adaptation measures for natural ecosystems are scientifically grounded for the Arctic region: the prevention of permafrost surface cover disturbances, the minimization of other types of anthropogenic impact and pollution, the maintenance and increase in surface albedo in winter. The examples of development of a dual indicator system are given: for monitoring the implementation of measures and adaptation efficiency (the quantitative markers of climate-caused damage). The analysis of all indicators in the adaptation efficiency monitoring system, as well as the projections of indicators for 5-10 years ahead help to make reasoned management decisions to correct the applied adaptation measures.

In Southern Africa, rainfall is expected to decline by almost 10% by the year 2050 and the largest increase in temperature can be experienced. Despite the potential risks of climate change on agricultural productivity, Botswana does not have a dedicated policy to respond to climate change. Furthermore, there is a dearth of research done in Botswana to provide an understanding of factors that shape farmers' adaptation to climate change and institutional link to the adaptive capacity of farming households. Therefore, the aim of this article is to analyse institutions that influence farmers' adaptation strategies of farmers in Botswana, using Ngamiland East as a case study. The paper relies on empirical data collected from purposively selected key informants and 300 households. The results show that the majority of farmers who have climate variability adaptation strategies in place are largely influenced by indigenous knowledge. Women and low-income earners are less likely to employ climate change adaptation strategies in order to improve their agricultural productivity. This article gives a better perspective of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats facing institutions designed to enable agricultural productivity. It recommends that macro-level and local government institutions should acknowledge the indigenous knowledge, community-level institutions and farmers' adaptive capacity in policy formulation processes.","[Mogomotsi, Patricia K.; Mogomotsi, Goemeone E.

At first sight, the issues around integration within science and beyond the science of climate change adaptation in cities resemble those generally observed in science-policy integration. However, the relative newness of urban adaptation to climate change poses specific challenges for both the scientists and the stakeholders involved in the process.

An integrated stepwise planning approach is a critical requirement for effective climate change adaptation in the context of small island developing states and coastal communities. To address this need, this paper reports on a systematic review of 116 research papers from an initial set of around 650 academic peer-reviewed papers. These papers were assessed and categorised based on their planning framework or the approach utilised, measured climate change impacts, employed methods and tools, and recommended adaptation strategies or options. This study identified three important dimensions of a fully integrated climate change adaptation planning process, namely, integration in assessment, integration in modelling, and integration in adaptive responses. Moreover, it resulted in the formulation of a novel multi-layered integrative climate change adaptation planning approach. Adopting this holistic and integrative approach is more likely to yield better climate change adaptation in planning outcomes over the long term.","[Hafezi, Mehdi; Sahin, Oz; Stewart, Rodney A.] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Hafezi, Mehdi; Sahin, Oz; Stewart, Rodney A.] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Sahin, Oz; Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Stewart, RA (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.;Stewart, RA (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",mehdi.hafezi@griffithuni.edu.au; o.sahin@griffith.edu.au; r.stewart@griffith.edu.au; b.mackey@griffith.edu.au,"Mackey, Brendan/ABE-3805-2020; Stewart, Rodney A/H-5561-2018; Sahin, Oz/HLG-7805-2023","Stewart, Rodney A/0000-0002-6013-3505; Hafezi, Mehdi/0000-0002-2239-8676; Sahin, Oz/0000-0002-1914-5379; Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064",Australian Government Research Training Program Award (APA),Australian Government Research Training Program Award (APA)(Australian Government),This research was supported by a grant from a private charitable trust and the Australian Government Research Training Program Award (APA).,,180,16,16,14,35,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2018,10,11,,,,,,,4100,10.3390/su10114100,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10114100,,,30,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HC1AQ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000451531700274,View Full Record in Web of Science

The framework targets the process of planned adaptation and focuses on potentially challenging but malleable barriers. Three key sets of components create the architecture for the framework. First, a staged depiction of an idealized, rational approach to adaptation decision-making makes up the process component. Second, a set of interconnected structural elements includes the actors, the larger context in which they function (e. g., governance), and the object on which they act (the system of concern that is exposed to climate change). At each of these stages, we ask (i) what could impede the adaptation process and (ii) how do the actors, context, and system of concern contribute to the barrier. To facilitate the identification of barriers, we provide a series of diagnostic questions. Third, the framework is completed by a simple matrix to help locate points of intervention to overcome a given barrier. It provides a systematic starting point for answering critical questions about how to support climate change adaptation at all levels of decision-making.","[Moser, Susanne C.] Susanne Moser Res & Consulting, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Moser, Susanne C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Ekstrom, Julia A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Climate & Energy Policy Inst, Berkeley, CA 94705 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Moser, SC (corresponding author), Susanne Moser Res & Consulting, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",promundi@susannemoser.com,,"Ekstrom, Julia/0000-0003-1060-5276",California Energy Commission through CEC [500-07-043],California Energy Commission through CEC,"We thank Margaret Torn for comments on a longer version of this paper, Oran Young and two anonymous reviewers for criticism of an earlier draft of this paper, and the California Energy Commission for financial support (to J.A.E.) through CEC Contract 500-07-043.",,64,901,911,6,224,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Using a mixed-methods approach (content analysis of local government planning documents and semi structured interviews with key informants), results demonstrate the level of integration of coastal management, disaster management and climate change adaptation in local development planning; and assess the state of implementation of ICM and climate change adaptation by selected local governments in the two countries. The paper makes recommendations on how to improve ICM development and implementation for coastal adaptation. The results suggest the need for closer integration between coastal management, disaster management and climate adaptation frameworks; highlight the need for enhanced support for local governments from provincial and national government; and greater clarity with regards to the coastal management mandate of local government (especially in Mozambique).","[Rosendo, S.] Univ Nova Lisboa, FCSH, Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci CICS NOVA, Av Berna 26 C, P-1069061 Lisbon, Portugal; [Celliers, L.] CSIR Nat Resources & Environm, POB 17001, ZA-4013 Congella, South Africa; [Mechisso, M.] AQUA Agencia Nacl Control Qualidade Ambiental, POB 66, Praia Do Xai Xai, Gaza, Mozambique",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - South Africa,"Rosendo, S (corresponding author), Univ Nova Lisboa, FCSH, Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci CICS NOVA, Av Berna 26 C, P-1069061 Lisbon, Portugal.",sergiorosendo@yahoo.co.uk,"Celliers, Louis/GRO-6282-2022; Celliers, Louis/AAP-7650-2021","Celliers, Louis/0000-0001-5096-1713; Celliers, Louis/0000-0001-5096-1713; Rosendo, Sergio/0000-0002-3095-9824",Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) through its Marine Science for Management (MASMA) program [MASMA/CC/2010/09],Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) through its Marine Science for Management (MASMA) program,"The authors wish to acknowledge the support of the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) which funded this work through its Marine Science for Management (MASMA) program, research Grant No: MASMA/CC/2010/09.",,79,27,27,0,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

Although there is a rapidly growing body of literature on the topic of climate change adaptation and wildlife management, the literature is weighted towards a narrow range of adaptation actions and administrative or policy recommendations that are typically beyond the decision space and influence of wildlife professionals. We developed a menu of tiered adaptation actions for terrestrial wildlife management to translate broad concepts into actionable approaches to help managers respond to climate change risks and meet desired management goals. The menu includes actions related to managing wildlife populations as well as managing wildlife habitat. We designed this resource to be used with the Adaptation Workbook, a structured decision-support tool for climate adaptation. We describe real-world examples in which managers have used the Wildlife Adaptation Menu to integrate climate adaptation considerations into wildlife management and conservation projects. Our examples illustrate how a comprehensive and structured menu of adaptation approaches can help managers brainstorm specific actions and more easily and clearly communicate the intent of their climate adaptation efforts.","[Handler, Stephen D.; Swanston, Christopher W.] US Forest Serv, USDA, 410 Maclnnes Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Handler, Stephen D.; Swanston, Christopher W.] Northern Inst Appl Climate Sci, 410 Maclnnes Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Ledee, Olivia E.] US Geol Survey, Midwest Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, 1992 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55116 USA; [Hoving, Christopher L.] Michigan Dept Nat Resources, 525 West Allegan St, Lansing, MI 48909 USA; [Zuckerberg, Benjamin] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1620 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53705 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Handler, SD (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, 410 Maclnnes Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.;Handler, SD (corresponding author), Northern Inst Appl Climate Sci, 410 Maclnnes Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",slephen.handler@usda.gov,,"Handler, Stephen/0000-0002-9618-1330",U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service; Department of the Interior Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center,U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Department of the Interior Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center,"The development of the Wildlife Adaptation Menu would not have been possible without the significant contributions of over 80 wildlife management professionals who participated in our testing workshops.

This study applies John Kingdon's theory of agenda setting through a multi-level approach to explain the ways in which the climate change adaptation issue has recently developed in four European countries: the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland and Italy. The study illustrates that a multi-level adaptation policy window has been opened in the context of the UK, whereas adaptation has mainly developed on the national and in specific local cases in Finland and Sweden, while in Italy the issue remains off the agenda. The study thus shows that policy windows may be supported through the interaction of streams at both national and sub-national levels, particularly buttressed by focusing climate events and media reporting.

Numerous documents and guidelines are available that provide advice on how to incorporate climate hazards and risks into spatial policies on the global, European and national scale. The experiences of less developed countries have shown that, rather than simply cascading uniform procedures, methods and techniques of adaptation down from higher to lower levels of governance, a realistic approach calls for innovative procedures, tailored to specific circumstances. The authors argue that the climate change adaptation (CCA) process in developing countries, especially post-socialist transition countries with underdeveloped institutions and procedures, differs from that seen in developed nations, which calls for taking these diverse (multiple) experiences into account when adaptation responses to particular local impacts are formulated. In that sense, adaptation is not necessarily guided by effective strategies that take into consideration overall economic, social and environmental goals, but is, rather, primarily intertwined with local spatial planning in an effort to reduce vulnerability to climate change and variability. This is mainly a reactive endeavour, as it lacks an anticipatory approach, but there are nonetheless some innovative qualities in each case that deserve to be closely inspected. This argument is illustrated by an example from Belgrade, Serbia. The Heron Island Project on the Danube River, developed between 2006 and 2009, aimed to reduce vulnerability to flooding. In the absence of climate change adaptation policies and strategies in Serbia, the project sought to balance nature preservation with construction and CCA action. This demonstrative project can be analysed as an illustration of how climate change can be integrated into the planning system, as well as what different opportunities are available to incorporate adaptation into new and existing developments.","[Bajec, Nada Lazarevic; Maruna, Marija] Univ Belgrade, Fac Architecture, Dept Town & Spatial Planning, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Maruna, M (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Architecture, Dept Town & Spatial Planning, 73-2 Kralja Aleksandra Blvd, Belgrade, Serbia.",m.ma@sezampro.rs,"Maruna, Marija/Q-9349-2019","Maruna, Marija/0000-0001-9015-0683",Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia [43007],"Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","This paper was realised as part of the project Studying climate change and its influence on the environment: impacts, adaptation and mitigation (43007) financed by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia within the framework of integrated and interdisciplinary research for 2011-2014.",,33,2,2,1,16,GH ASACHI TECHNICAL UNIV IASI,IASI,"71 MANGERON BLVD, IASI, 700050, ROMANIA",1582-9596,1843-3707,,ENVIRON ENG MANAG J,Environ.

This interest has seen a flurry of activity in Pacific communities to develop and implement on-ground activities in the hope of enhancing adaptive capacity. This article draws on the results of a questionnaire completed by 31 agencies that have implemented climate-change adaptation projects in various communities throughout the Pacific region. The impetus for this research is to better understand the types of projects that have been implemented, and assess their levels of success in safeguarding communities in the face of climate change. While there has been limited overall progress made across the region to address climate change impacts at the community level, four broad-brush lessons that relate to the process of project development and implementation are drawn from this research. These lessons include the need to: provide locally and culturally appropriate community awareness and education; integrate local environmental knowledge throughout the project cycle; ensure that community ownership is involved in all project stages; and enhance sustainable livelihood resources more broadly.","[McNamara, Karen Elizabeth] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [McNamara, Karen Elizabeth] Univ S Pacific, Pacific Ctr Environm & Sustainable Dev, Suva, Fiji",University of Queensland; University of the South Pacific,"McNamara, KE (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",karen.mcnamara@uq.edu.au,"McNamara, Karen/D-7322-2013","McNamara, Karen/0000-0002-4511-8403",,,,,29,43,44,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1360-7456,1467-8373,,ASIA PAC VIEWP,Asia Pac.

Addressing water-related problems is central to climate change adaptation, and civil society, marginalized populations and women, in particular, must be involved. This is for both moral and pragmatic reasons: not only are the marginalized the first and worst affected by extreme weather events, but they also possess local ecological, social and political knowledge which can inform and contribute significantly to climate change adaptation strategies. Because of their social roles and position worldwide, women are greatly affected by water scarcity and flooding, and tend to be gravely impacted by poor water management, yet they face great difficulties in participating effectively in governance bodies. Sustainable long-term management of water resources in the face of climate change requires the participation of women, who possess knowledge of effective social technologies for coping with and adapting to climate change. Community-based environmental education is therefore required in order to expand the equitable involvement of women in water-related climate change adaptation activities and policy development. Environmental non-governmental organizations worldwide, working on shoestring budgets at the local level, are developing a range of methods to organize, raise consciousness and confidence, and help local activists create successful climate defense programs. This paper discusses South North initiatives and models for community-based environmental and climate change education which are using the democratic opening provided by watershed-based governance structures to broaden grassroots participation, especially of women, in political processes. We outline the activities and results of two international projects: the Sister Watersheds project, with Brazilian and Canadian partners (2002-2008); and a Climate Change Adaptation in Africa project with partners in Canada, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa (2010-2012).

The article acknowledges the limits to these strategies and the gaps likely to remain in adaptation assistance. The article considers the Native Village of Newtok, Alaska, which is relocating to another site as an adaptation to climate change, as a case study in navigating adaptation assistance. While each community is different, several factors that have helped Newtok may benefit other communities: strong leadership; unified community vision and policy; a local coordinator serving as a continued point of contact; strong capacity for grantwriting; trusted, reasonably priced consultants; professional accounting services; and a housing policy to ensure fairness.","[Ristroph, Elizaveta Barrett] Ristroph Law Planning & Res, 410 Burgin Ave, Baton Rouge, LA 70808 USA",,"Ristroph, EB (corresponding author), Ristroph Law Planning & Res, 410 Burgin Ave, Baton Rouge, LA 70808 USA.",ebristroph@gmail.com,,"Ristroph, Elizaveta Barrett/0000-0003-1598-472X",,,,,86,5,5,2,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

The limited nature of physical, financial, human and natural resources means that governments, as managers of natural resources, must make careful decisions regarding trade-offs and the potential future value of investments in climate change adaptation. This paper presents cost-benefit analysis of scenarios to characterise economic benefits of adaptation from the perspective of a public institution (the provincial government) and private agents (forest licensees). The example provided is the context of assisted migration strategies for regenerating forests that are currently being implemented in British Columbia to reduce future impacts of climate change on forests. The analysis revealed positive net present value of public investment in assisted migration across all scenarios under a range of conditions; however, private sector agents face disincentives to adopt these strategies. Uncertainty about how the costs, benefits and risks associated with climate change impacts will be distributed among public institutions and private actors influences incentives to adapt to climate change (the principal-agent problem) and further complicates adaptation. Absent development of risk-sharing mechanisms or re-alignment of incentives, uptake of assisted migration strategies by private agents is likely to be limited, creating longer-term risks for public institutions. Analyzing incentives and disincentives facing principals and agents using a well-known tool (cost-benefit analysis) can help decision-makers to identify and address underlying barriers to climate change adaptation in the context of public lands management.

Furthermore, the advances made in Cyprus up to this point with respect to mainstreaming European policy on adaptation in its national policy, strategies, plans and legislation are assessed. The analysis begins with the overall framework on adaptation and continues with the sectors of water resources, biodiversity and agriculture. The study revealed that a solid framework for promoting and enhancing climate change adaptation action is being systematically built during the last decade in the EU. Action on adaptation has been promoted in the EU through a number of policy-making tools (preparatory acts), such as green papers, white papers, communications, working documents, guidelines and legislative proposals. These tools, although not binding in nature, set the pathway for the integration of climate change adaptation into existing and new legislation. With respect to the actual mainstreaming of adaptation into sectoral policies, this has started to take place during the last 1-2years. However, the framework has not yet been sufficiently transformed into legally binding goals. As for the progress made so far in Cyprus for integrating adaptation into its policies, plans and strategies, it is recognized that several such documents have been developed and proposed, but until now, none of them have actually been put into practice.","[Papadaskalopoulou, Christina; Kasidoni, Maria; Panaretou, Vasiliki; Moustakas, Konstantinos; Loizidou, Maria] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Unit Environm Sci & Technol, Sch Chem Engn, Athens 15780, Greece; [Mesimeris, Theodoulos] Minist Agr Nat Resources & Environm, Dept Environm, Nicosia, Cyprus",National Technical University of Athens,"Papadaskalopoulou, C (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Unit Environm Sci & Technol, Sch Chem Engn, 9 Iroon Polytechniou Str,Zographou Campus, Athens 15780, Greece.",chpapad@chemeng.ntua.gr,,"Moustakas, Konstantinos/0000-0003-1301-2484",CYPADAPT project [LIFE10 ENV / CY/ 000723],CYPADAPT project,"The authors acknowledge the European financial instrument for the Environment LIFE+, for part financing this work in the framework of the CYPADAPT project LIFE10 ENV / CY/ 000723.",,51,1,1,0,24,DESALINATION PUBL,HOPKINTON,"36 WALCOTT VALLEY DRIVE,, HOPKINTON, MA 01748 USA",1944-3994,1944-3986,,DESALIN WATER TREAT,Desalin.

The study also investigates the effect of the socio-economic and institutional factors on the on-farm adaptation strategies to climate change of smallholder farmers. The study employs descriptive statistics to analyse the barriers and adaptation techniques of a sample of 125 smallholder farmers in the NDR zone of Ghana. The binary logit model was employed to analyse the effect of the socio-economic and institutional factors on the on-farm adaptation strategies to climate change. The results show that households face considerable availability and liquidity constraints in adapting to climate change. The lack of capacity building program is the major availability constraint, while the lack of funds to purchase fertiliser is the major liquidity constraint. Most farmers do not apply any adaptation technique, while the few farmers who adapt to the changing climate frequently use soil and water conservation and grow different crop varieties and diversification of the crop produced. A number of socio-economic characteristics and institutional factors (particularly governmental extension services), and the longitudinal temperature and rainfall significantly affect the on-farm adaptation strategies of households. Though smallholder farmers in the NDR zone of Ghana apply a multiplicity of on-farm and non-farm adaptation strategies, this research is limited to on-farm adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers. The study recommends that policies aimed at helping smallholder farmers adapt to climate change should greatly emphasise on capacity-building programs. Also, investment in extension services to support rural farm households is highly recommended due to the great impact it has on adapting to climate change. This paper contributes to the empirical literature by first using the farm-level survey data from wider geographical areas in the NDR zone of Ghana to analyse the climate change adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers. This paper also focusses on only the on-farm climate change adaptation strategies of households in the NDR zone of Ghana.","[Asravor, Richard Kofi] Ghana Commun Technol Univ, Fac IT Business, Dept Econ, Tesano Accra, Ghana",,"Asravor, RK (corresponding author), Ghana Commun Technol Univ, Fac IT Business, Dept Econ, Tesano Accra, Ghana.",rkasravor@yahoo.com,"Asravor, Richard Kofi/D-7484-2017","Asravor, Richard Kofi/0000-0003-1652-9948",,,,,29,3,3,2,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Farmers' perceptions and responses to climate change are key factors in coping with climate change to promote sustainable agricultural development. The Northern Agro-pastoral Ecotone, an ecologically fragile transition zone, has experienced a warm-drought trend, which has affected agricultural production greatly in recent decades. Using semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey about the farmers' perceptions on warm-drought climate change and their adaptation measures in the central part of the Northern Agro-pastoral Ecotone, we found that almost 100% of the farmers perceived the warm drought and its impacts, not only on agricultural production, but also on rural labor. Farmers adapted to the warm drought mainly by adjusting crop varieties and planting dates, utilizing water conservation and irrigation technologies. Delaying sowing time, introducing drought-resistant seeds, mulching, and irrigating were the most effective ways in which farmers adapted to the changing climate. In accordance with these findings, some strategies for adaptation are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It then analyzes whether these characteristics are appropriately considered in existing guidelines for climate impact and adaptation assessment and in pertinent conceptual models from environmental epidemiology. The review finds three assessment guidelines based on a generalized risk management framework to be most useful for guiding adaptation assessments of human health. Since none of them adequately addresses all key challenges of the adaptation decision problem, actual adaptation assessments need to combine elements from different guidelines. Established conceptual models from environmental epidemiology are found to be of limited relevance for assessing and planning adaptation to climate change since the prevailing toxicological model of environmental health is not applicable to many climate-sensitive health risks.","Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Fussel, HM (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany.",fuessel@pik-potsdam.de,"Füssel, Hans-Martin/AAF-6067-2020",,,,,,63,27,27,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0960-3123,1369-1619,,INT J ENVIRON HEAL R,Int.

Particularly in developing and dynamic cities like Istanbul, the pressure of rapid urbanisation, institutional and legislative uncertainties are expected to create new vulnerabilities in ecosystems and their services. Climate change can cause new vulnerabilities in ecosystem services (ESs) through events such as floods, heat-waves, and droughts brought on by rises in temperatures and changes in precipitation. These vulnerabilities may affect the well-being of inhabitants and interfere with the reaching of sustainable development goals in the future. Istanbul has a unique geographical location for biological diversity when compared with other settlements in the region, and the urban development dynamics of the region play a significant role in the well-being of ecological units and biological diversity of the Istanbul Metropolitan Area (Ozhatay, Byfield, & Atay, 2003; Tezer, 2005; Tezer et al., 2008). This paper aims to define which ESs are vulnerable due to both LCLU change caused by urbanisation and potential impacts of climate change. Particular importance is given to the result of the survey done with related stakeholders as it is used to define and to verify the existing and future vulnerabilities of ESs in Istanbul. Regarding the close relationship between ESs and LCLU, the impact of changes in LCLU on key ESs are evaluated by developing LCLU scenarios. Climate change scenarios are used in this paper to understand the possible future climatic conditions of Istanbul and their impact on LCLU and ESs. These two sub-results are prepared according to scenario analyses and are evaluated together to address the future vulnerabilities of ESs. Integration of ESs and climate change adaptation strategies into spatial planning (EEA, 2010) seems to be both necessary and urgent. Therefore, a spatial planning framework that is climate change adapted and ESs oriented is proposed as a key tool to achieve a climate resilient, sustainable development in Istanbul. The framework used in this paper can be used to develop relevant strategies and planning tools by considering climate change adaptive policies for other rapidly developing settlements. In brief, this paper aims to integrate ecosystems and their services into spatial planning by using relevant mapping of ESs, which will be utilised for the climate adaptive spatial policy development process for the Istanbul case.

Given the size of city economies, the economic losses caused by climate-induced extreme weather can be quite significant. Together, the cities of Guangzhou, Mumbai, Shenzen, Tianjin, Ho Chi Minh City, Kolkata, and Jakarta incurred $1520 million (USD) in annual losses due to coastal flooding in 2005 alone. By 2050, the annual loss incurred as a result of coastal flooding in these cities is projected to increase to $32,079 million. In the light of the projected increase in climate-induced extreme weather events and associated loss, it is important to understand where Asian cities are in terms of climate change adaptation planning and governance. I use publicly available data and information published between 2004 and 2014 to capture urban climate change adaptation activities implemented in Asian cities, their sectoral distribution, and nature. This research finds that Asian cities are at a very early stage of climate change adaptation planning and governance. Countries with a larger number of cities implementing urban adaptation activities are the ones where central governments provide policy directives and support required for urban climate change adaptation planning and governance. There are two major flaws in the way urban climate change adaptation planning and governance is being carried out in Asian cities. First, the majority of urban climate change adaptation activities are concentrated in only one sector-disaster risk management. Second, approximately two thirds of urban climate change adaptation activities are reactive in nature. What cities in Asia need is an optimal mix of proactive and reactive adaptation. Without proactive adaptation actions, cities in Asia will not be able to address the full range of climate change hazards in strategic and cost-effective manner.","[Dulal, Hari Bansha] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, 79 John F Kennedy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Dulal, HB (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, 79 John F Kennedy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hbdulal@gmail.com,,,,,,,111,12,12,4,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

The severity of climate change impacts and the realization that, by now, some adverse effects are inevitable, has intensified the urgency to devise effective adaptation strategies. Genetically engineered climate-resilient crops are presented as one possible means to adapt to the predicted adverse impacts of climate change on agriculture and crop yields. Despite increased attention on the research and development of climate-resilient crops, particularly by private sector seed corporations, there are many controversies surrounding this proposed adaptation strategy. The key contentions relate to apprehensions about genetically engineered crops more generally, the effectiveness of climate-resilient crops, and the involvement of the private sector in international climate change adaptation initiatives. The main argument in this article is that the emerging field of international climate change adaptation law contributes to promoting genetically engineered climate-resilient crops as a possible means of adaptation. Moreover, international adaptation law creates an enabling environment for the active engagement of private sector corporations in devising adaptation strategies. Notwithstanding controversies over genetically engineered crops and the role of the private sector, there has been little consideration so far of the influence of the growing international legal regime on climate change on the types of adaptation strategies that are devised and promoted.",,,,anne.saab@graduateinstitute.ch,,"Saab, Anne/0000-0002-6686-5408",,,,,93,9,10,5,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0922-1565,1478-9698,,LEIDEN J INT LAW,Leiden J.

Face-to-face contact, although it involves time-consuming procedures with a limited audience, has often been considered the most effective participatory approach. In recent years, however, there has been an increase in the visibility of different citizens' initiatives in the online world, which strengthens the possibility of greater citizen agency. This paper investigates whether the Internet can ensure efficient public participation with meaningful engagement in climate change adaptation. In elucidating issues regarding climate change adaptation, we developed an eParticipation framework to explore adaptation capacity of agriculture to climate change in Northern Italy. Farmers were mobilised using a pre-existing online network. First they took part in an online questionnaire for revealing their perceptions of and reactions to the impacts of ongoing changes in agriculture. We used these results to suggest a portfolio of policy measures and to set evaluation criteria. Farmers then evaluated these policy options, using a multi criteria analysis tool with a simple user-friendly interface. Our results showed that eParticipation is efficient; it supports a rapid data collection, while involving high number of participants. Moreover, we demonstrated that the digital divide is decreasingly an obstacle for using online spaces for public engagement. This research does not present eParticipation as a panacea. Rather, eParticipation was implemented with well-established participatory approaches to both validate the results and, consequently, communicate meaningful messages on local agricultural adaptation practices to regional decision-makers. Feedbacks from the regional decision-makers showed their interest in using eParticipation to improve communication with farmers in the future. We expect that, with further Internet proliferation, eParticipation may allow the inclusion of more representative samples, which would contribute to an informed and legitimate decision-making process.

However, there is slight empirical evidence that has been established to indicate whether the stakeholders are significantly involved in developing various adaptations plans.

In-depth, semi-structured interview was the major approach and most interviews were conducted between June and August 2020. Here, 20 stakeholders were involved in this kind of participatory process. To make results more rigorous, the data from interviews were enriched with data from documentary reviews. Generally, the data were analyzed through theme content analysis. Findings The results exhibit that there has been little engagement of stakeholders in undertaking various researches especially in marginalized areas. In some instances, several stakeholders have been included; however, the most important ones have been excluded in the process, thus affecting the provision of data. The inconsistences affect the whole adaptation process and bring numerous controversies with the existing realities which recognize stakeholders as important entity in the adaptation process. Subsequently, this has widely affected even the set ups of decision-making organs and the policy formulation processes at large. Originality/value Explicitly, the results of this study are essential to climate scientists and practitioners, as the results reveal the real situation in the field. Similarly, the results inform how various sustainable projects, plans and policies related to climate change adaptations can be developed. Conclusions are therefore drawn to strengthen sustainable adaptation to climate change impacts through increased stakeholder involvement.","[Mkonda, Msafiri Yusuph] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Coll Nat & Appl Sci, Morogoro, Tanzania",Sokoine University of Agriculture,"Mkonda, MY (corresponding author), Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Coll Nat & Appl Sci, Morogoro, Tanzania.",msamkonda81@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,47,3,3,2,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1477-7835,1758-6119,,MANAG ENVIRON QUAL,Manag.

Local and global economic and socio-cultural influence are also driving city redevelopment. This, fundamentally political, development highlights issues of who pays and who gains, who decides and how, and who/what is to be valued. Climate change adaptation has primarily been informed by science, but the adaptation discourse has widened to include the social sciences, subjecting adaptation practices to political analysis and critique. In this article, we critically discuss the just city concept in a climate adaptation context. We develop the just city concept by describing and discussing key theoretical themes in a politically and justice-oriented analysis of climate change adaptation in cities. We illustrate our arguments by looking at recent case studies of climate change adaptation in three very different city contexts: Port Vila, Baltimore City, and Karlstad. We conclude that the social context with its power asymmetries must be given a central position in understanding the distribution of climate risks and vulnerabilities when studying climate change adaptation in cities from a climate justice perspective.","[Granberg, Mikael; Glover, Leigh] Karlstad Univ, Ctr Societal Risk Res & Polit Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Granberg, Mikael] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Granberg, Mikael] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Karlstad University; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Uppsala University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Granberg, M (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Ctr Societal Risk Res & Polit Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.;Granberg, M (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.;Granberg, M (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",mikael.granberg@kau.se; leigh.glover@kau.se,"Granberg, Mikael/B-5399-2013","Granberg, Mikael/0000-0002-5356-4112",Swedish Civil Contingency Agency [MSB/2016-6855],Swedish Civil Contingency Agency,"This research was funded by the research fund of the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency, MSB/2016-6855.",,123,7,7,9,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,3,,,,,,,1201,10.3390/su13031201,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13031201,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QD6LB,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000615626000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this vein, subjectivity has been problematized by climate change adaptation scholars as a concept that needs further attention to understand the political nature of climate change adaptation. Extending frameworks of environmentality to cases of climate change adaptation, we engage the term adaptation subjects to distinguish individuals whose interests and desires align with broader understandings and goals of climate change adaptation. In this research, we situate the co-production of livelihoods and climate change adaptation interventions as projects of rule to understand subject-formation. Such an analysis allows for a move beyond econocentric framings of livelihoods that privilege material outcomes to also engage with the socio-political realities of these livelihoods and climate change adaptation more broadly. We apply the Livelihoods as Intimate Government approach to a case study of the Ada Sea Defense System in the Ada East District of the Volta River Delta of Ghana as a climate change adaptation project of rule, in order to illustrate the ways this adaptation technology discursively constructs (or not) different residents as adaptation subjects. Understanding the Ada Sea Defense System as a technology of adaptation constituted through socio-political practices has the potential to promote justice and equity when designing, implementing and evaluating such technologies in the future.","[Owusu-Daaku, Kwame N.] Univ West Florida, Pensacola, FL USA; [Rosko, Helen] Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",State University System of Florida; University of West Florida; Clark University,"Owusu-Daaku, KN (corresponding author), Univ West Florida, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 11000 Univ Pkwy, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA.",kowusudaaku@uwf.edu,,,"University of South Carolina Office of the Vice President for Research; Norman E.

While the literature highlights the need for involving both public and private actors, little is still known of how citizens perceive their own and others' responsibility, let alone the moral groundings for such perceptions. In this paper, we report the results of a survey regarding people's attitudes towards different ways of distributing responsibility for climate change adaptation. The survey was distributed to citizens in six Swedish municipalities and completed by 510 respondents. A large number of respondents wanted to assign responsibility for making decisions about and implementing adaptation measures to local governments, but also to property owners, whereas the national government was raised as responsible for setting decision boundaries and for financial support. The most preferred principles for a fair distribution of responsibility among the respondents were desert, ability, efficiency and need, while the principle of equal shares found less support. All principles received some support, indicating that it is necessary to consider several principles when distributing responsibility for climate change adaptation. Compared to earlier studies, this study shows more nuanced perceptions on who should be responsible and on what moral grounds.","[Persson, Erik] Lund Univ, Dept Philosophy, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Knaggard, Asa] Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Knaggard, Asa] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Sci, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Eriksson, Kerstin] RISE Res Inst Sweden, Div Safety & Transport, SE-22370 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; RISE Research Institutes of Sweden,"Persson, E (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Philosophy, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",erik.persson@fil.lu.se; asa.knaggard@svet.lu.se; kerstin.eriksson@ri.se,,"Persson, Erik/0000-0002-5000-948X; Eriksson, Kerstin/0000-0002-0494-0089",FORMAS (Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development),FORMAS (Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development),"This research was funded by FORMAS (Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development), grant number FR-2018/0006.",,44,1,1,5,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2021,13,22,,,,,,,12552,10.3390/su132212552,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132212552,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XG6TU,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000724883800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper investigates how farmers' participation in social capital networks influenced climate change adaptation strategies adoption in Nigeria. This study was carried out in the South-western Nigeria. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, binary probit regression, multinomial logit regression, endogenous switching regression and multinomial endogenous switching regression models. The results suggest that significant differences exist in the years of membership in the social capital networks, access to weather information and market between farm managers who adopted climate change adaptation strategies and those who did not. Plot managers who adopted climate change adaptation strategies are found to have obtained much mean yield and farm revenue than their counterparts. The results further show that participation in the social capital networks does not only significantly influence plot manager's decision to adopt but also influences the choice of climate change adaptation strategies adopted by farmers. The study concludes that a farmer who chooses to participate in social capital networks has a higher level of adopting climate change adaptation strategies than what a random farmer would have had in Nigeria. We recommend that policies aimed at increasing the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among farmers should be channelled through locally organised farmers-based social capital networks.","[Ogunleye, Ayodeji; Kehinde, Ayodeji] Obafemi Awolowo Univ OAU, Ile Ile, Osun State, Nigeria; [Mishra, Ashok] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Tempe, AZ USA; [Ogundeji, Abiodun] Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa",Obafemi Awolowo University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of the Free State,"Ogunleye, A (corresponding author), Obafemi Awolowo Univ OAU, Ile Ile, Osun State, Nigeria.",ogunleyedeji@oauife.edu.ng,,"Ogundeji, Abiodun Akintunde/0000-0001-7356-5668",Federal government of Nigeria through TETFund Institutional Based Research (IBR),Federal government of Nigeria through TETFund Institutional Based Research (IBR),This work was supported by the Federal government of Nigeria through TETFund Institutional Based Research (IBR).,,82,8,8,7,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,DEC,2021,7,12,,,,,,,e08624,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08624,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08624,,DEC 2021,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,YD9IK,35005276,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000740746800026,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach The findings are based on 12 qualitative interviews taken from two case studies, and the results are explained in relation to the multilevel network framework and environmental psychology. Findings Multilevel networks can promote learning and identification of specific actions in connection with climate change adaptation. The aim should be to establish interdisciplinarity, with participants from at least two authority levels. Representatives should be in positions that enable them to introduce acquired knowledge to the organization and influence its application. A network requires organizational commitment, during the initial phase and throughout the follow-up process. Municipal leaders (mayors) must be aware of the network, act as signatories to relevant documents, and be familiar with participating representatives. Commitment to knowledge application within the organization also requires that participants understand where and how to work strategically to convert new ideas into action. Practical implications This paper presents practical and research-based guidelines for the management of climate change adaptation networks at municipal, county and national authority levels.

Using a systematic review of the literature on applications of AI for climate change adaptation and a questionnaire survey of a multinational and interdisciplinary team of climate change researchers, this paper shows the various means via which AI can support research on climate change in diverse regions, and contribute to efforts towards climate change adaptation. The surveyed articles are classified under nine areas, e.g., Global/Earth Related; Water-related Issues and agriculture, 95% of which are related to adaptation. The areas that have attracted the most studies about AI applications are water-related management issues (38%). In terms of the survey results, the most robust agreements were noted concerning the capacity of digitisation and AI to strengthen governance practices and afford policy coherence in climate change. Evidence gathered in the study suggests that, provided that due care is taken, the use of AI can provide a welcome support to global efforts to better understand and handle the many challenges associated with a changing climate.","[Filho, Walter Leal] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, All St Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [Filho, Walter Leal; Kovaleva, Marina] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chan, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Wall, Tony] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool L3 5UG, Merseyside, England; [Mucova, Serafino Afonso Rui] Lurio Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Pemba 958, Mozambique; [Nagy, Gustavo J.] Univ Republica, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Ecol, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay; [Balogun, Abdul-Lateef] Esri Australia, Serv Dept Resources, 613 King St, West Melbourne, Vic 3003, Australia; [Balogun, Abdul-Lateef] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Geospatial Anal & Modelling GAM Res Lab, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Luetz, Johannes M.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Social Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Luetz, Johannes M.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Law & Soc, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Luetz, Johannes M.] Alphacrucis Univ Coll, Grad Res Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia; [Ng, Artie W.] Int Business Univ, Toronto, ON M5S 2V1, Canada; [Ng, Artie W.] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo Inst Sustainable Energy, 200 Univ Ave, West Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Azam, Fardous Mohammad Safiul] Neijiang Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dongtong Rd, Neijiang, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Alves, Fatima] Univ Aberta, Rua Escola Politecn 147, P-1269001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Alves, Fatima] Univ Coimbra, TERRA Associated Lab, Rua Escola Politecn 147, P-1269001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Alves, Fatima] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Funct Ecol, Rua Escola Politecn 147, P-1269001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Guevara, Zeus] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Govt & Publ Transformat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Guevara, Zeus] Escuela Gobierno & Transformac Publ, Av Revoluc 756,Piso 2, Mexico City 03700, DF, Mexico; [Matandirotya, Newton R.] Kgotso Dev Trust, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat & Resilience, POB 5, Beitbridge, Zimbabwe; [Matandirotya, Newton R.] North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Private Bag X6001, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Skouloudis, Antonis] Univ Aegean, Dept Environm, Univ Hill, GR-81132 Mitilini, Lesvos, Greece; [Tzachor, Asaf] Reichman Univ, Sch Sustainabil, HaUniv 8, IL-4610101 Herzliyya, Israel; [Malakar, Krishna] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Gandhi, Odhiambo] Univ Nairobi, Inst Climate Change & Adaptat ICCA, POB 30197-00100, Nairobi, Kenya","Manchester Metropolitan University; Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; Liverpool John Moores University; University of Liverpool; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universiti Teknologi Petronas; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of the Sunshine Coast; University of Waterloo; Neijiang Normal University; Universidade Aberta; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Tecnologico de Monterrey; North West University - South Africa; University of Aegean; Reichman University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; University of Nairobi","Kovaleva, M (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chan, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany.",Marina.Kovaleva@haw-hamburg.de,"Safiul Azam, Fardous Mohammad/HGA-0098-2022; Guevara, Zeus/F-1628-2016; Luetz, Johannes M./AAH-5131-2019; Alves, Fatima/P-2895-2019; Ng, Artie/B-4386-2010","Safiul Azam, Fardous Mohammad/0000-0002-9337-273X; Guevara, Zeus/0000-0002-1254-8423; Luetz, Johannes M./0000-0002-9017-4471; Alves, Fatima/0000-0003-2600-8652; Leal Filho, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Ng, Artie/0000-0002-1388-5835",,,,,129,9,9,34,51,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0040-1625,1873-5509,,TECHNOL FORECAST SOC,Technol.

Global framings are seen as producing a universalizing, technocratic domain, and an increasing body of literature de-frames these, highlighting their inherent assumptions and biases and arguing for better situating adaptation within particular historical and power dynamics. This article takes the logical next step, proposing a reframing of climate change adaptation as a political arena, and finds that particular framings determine the scope, targets and tools of adaptation. It uses a problematics of government approach, illustrated through the case of mandatory sedentarization of boat dwellers in Vietnam, which government officials present as climate change adaptation. This reframing historicizes and politicizes current adaptation, demonstrates how vulnerability is produced by political interventions and identifies how emit, rather than global, political rationalities heavily frame current adaptation initiatives. By contrasting it with accounts of the same sedentarizations that cleave more closely to dominant adaptation framings, the article illustrates how reframing adaptation as a political arena provides a more accurate basis upon which to engage with adaptation as an impetus and as intervention. These findings caution against drawing uncritically on dominant framings of climate change adaptation.","[Lindegaard, Lily Salloum] Danish Inst Int Studies, Ostbanegade 117, DK-2100 Kbh O, Denmark; [Lindegaard, Lily Salloum] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies; University of Copenhagen,"Lindegaard, LS (corresponding author), Danish Inst Int Studies, Ostbanegade 117, DK-2100 Kbh O, Denmark.;Lindegaard, LS (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",lili@diis.dk,,,Danish Institute for International Studies; University of Copenhagen,Danish Institute for International Studies; University of Copenhagen,"I would like to thank Mikkel Funder and Christian Lund for their comments on an earlier draft of this article, as well as the feedback from anonymous reviewers.

A comparison of barriers and enablers across the cases revealed several key themes. Municipalities struggle to implement climate change adaptation within contexts of significant social, economic and ecological challenges. These contextual barriers, when combined with certain cognitive barriers, led to reactive responses. Existing municipal systems and structures make it difficult to enable climate change adaptation, which is inherently cross-sectoral and messy. Lack of locally applicable knowledge, funding and human resources were found to be significant resource barriers, and were often underlain by social barriers relating to perceptions, beliefs and governance challenges. Enablers of engaged officials, operating within conducive organizational environments and drawing on partnerships and networks, were able to circumvent these barriers to some extent. When enablers coincided with windows of opportunity that increased prioritization of climate change, projects with ancillary benefits were implemented. The implications of these results are discussed and suggestions made for how pro-poor municipal planned climate change adaptation that responds to the needs of vulnerable communities can be further understood and enabled in the future.","[Spires, Meggan] ICLEI Local Govt Sustainabil Africa Secretariat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Spires, Meggan; Shackleton, Sheona E.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Spires, M (corresponding author), ICLEI Local Govt Sustainabil Africa Secretariat, Cape Town, South Africa.;Spires, M (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Grahamstown, South Africa.",meggan.spires@iclei.org,,,,,,,78,12,12,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Hydrological alteration is a type of climate change adaptation technique that can be used to combat the effects of sea level rise within salt marshes. Runnels (shallow channels) are a type of climate adaptation strategy used to enhance drainage in drowning marshes. In this study, we investigated the impacts of runnel installations, 3-5 years post-implementation, on soil properties, vegetation composition, and greenhouse gas fluxes. We studied two runnel treatments (Low Elevation Runnel and High Elevation Runnel) and found that in the Low Elevation Runnel areas Spartina alterniflora stem density significantly increased in the three growing seasons after runnels were installed, and the high marsh plant, Spartina patens, persisted in the High Elevation Runnel areas. There was a significant difference in carbon dioxide uptake rates among treatments, with the unmanipulated (Reference) areas having the highest uptake rates and an increase in CO2 uptake over time seen in the Low Elevation Runnel treatment. These findings highlight the potential use of a climate change adaptation strategy to combat sea level rise impacts and provide insights for future adaptation efforts.","[Perry, Danielle C.; Thornber, Carol S.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Perry, Danielle C.] Massachusetts Audubon Soc, Conservat Sci Dept, Lincoln, MA 02451 USA; [Ferguson, Wenley] Save Bay, Advocacy & Restorat, Providence, RI 02881 USA",University of Rhode Island,"Perry, DC (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.;Perry, DC (corresponding author), Massachusetts Audubon Soc, Conservat Sci Dept, Lincoln, MA 02451 USA.",dperry@massaudubon.org,"Thornber, Carol/B-5786-2014","Thornber, Carol/0000-0003-0034-1035; Perry, Danielle/0000-0003-2030-6130",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1747454]; University of Rhode Island (URI)'s Enhancement of Graduate Research Award; Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography Presentation and Travel Award,National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Rhode Island (URI)'s Enhancement of Graduate Research Award; Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography Presentation and Travel Award,"National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (grant number DGE-1747454); University of Rhode Island (URI)'s Enhancement of Graduate Research Award; and the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography Presentation and Travel Award (awarded to Danielle Perry).

It is particularly challenging in relation to climate change adaptation at the local level. In response, this article presents the design steps taken to create a serious game for young people (aged 15-17) as a means to increase engagement in planning for climate change adaptation in Dublin. The iAdapt game acts as the capstone component of the audio and visual teaching and learning resources for adaptation education on the Climate Smart platform and uses open data, interactive in-browser 2.5D mapping and spatial analysis, and exemplar socio-technical adaptation interventions. Its primary aim is to empower young people to understand and engage with the complexities, uncertainties, and processes of climate adaptation planning by using scientifically validated flood data predictions, grounded in a place-based setting and with diverse examples of diverse adaptation interventions. Participants experience the difficulties of decision-making under conditions of democratic governance and uncertainty in order to educate, increase awareness, and stimulate discussions around the multiple possible pathways to planning for climate adaptation. Initial testing results with a cohort of young people in Dublin are presented. We conclude by reflecting upon the challenges of creating a game that has broad appeal yet remains enjoyable to play and the value of integrating real-world flood data with gamified elements. We also discuss the value question regarding the impact of games on expanding public engagement. Finally, the article sets out a plan for further development and dissemination of the platform and game.","[Hugel, Stephan; Davies, Anna R.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog & Nat Sci, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Hugel, S (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog & Nat Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",shugel@tcd.ie,"Davies, Anna/F-3812-2014","Davies, Anna/0000-0002-3045-8552; Hugel, Stephan/0000-0003-4379-2450","European Union [713567]; Science Foundation Ireland [13/RC/2077, 16/SP/3804]",European Union(European Commission); Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland),"This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 713567, and financial support from the Science Foundation Ireland, under Grants No. 13/RC/2077 and 16/SP/3804.",,48,0,0,5,6,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-7635,,,URBAN PLAN,Urban Plan.,,2022,7,2,,,,,306,320,,10.17645/up.v7i2.5113,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v7i2.5113,,,15,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,2R2ZD,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000820979800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Building on governance literature about long-term and complex policy problems, we develop a conceptual matrix based on the dimensions knowledge and power to systematically study the peer-reviewed literature on climate adaptation governance. We find that about a quarter of the reviewed journal articles do not address the knowledge or power dimension of the governance of climate change adaptation, about half of the articles discuss either the knowledge or the power dimension, and another quarter discuss both knowledge and power. The articles that do address both knowledge and power (1) conceptualize the governance of climate adaptation mainly as a complex system of regulatory frameworks and technical knowledge, (2) assume that regulatory systems can be easily adapted to new knowledge, (3) pay little attention to fluid or unorganized forms of power, e. g., negotiation, and knowledge, e. g., learning, and (4) largely neglect the interplay between the two. We argue that more research on this interplay is needed, and we discuss how puzzling and powering are a promising pair of concepts to study this.","[Vink, Martinus J.; Dewulf, Art; Termeer, Catrien] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Vink, MJ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",,"Dewulf, Art/ABA-7434-2020; Dewulf, Art/C-1271-2010; Termeer, Katrien/C-6057-2015","Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; ",,,,,77,64,64,1,70,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

By developing the Framework for Assessing Regional Organisations Coordinating Climate Change Adaptation, it qualitatively assesses the adaptation-related inputs, projects/programmes and outputs of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme. This assessment is enriched by data gathered through interviews with national and regional climate change and development officials in the Caribbean and Pacific. It finds that regional organisations are more effective with respect to their adaptation-related inputs and outputs, but are less effective in coordinating adaptation projects/programmes. It recommends that, in addition to differentiating organisational mandates, regional organisations should focus on resolving the major climate-related information deficit issues, helping countries to develop ready to finance investment projects, building national-level capacities to adapt and supporting the creation of an enabling environment for climate change adaptation.","[Robinson, Stacy-Ann; Gilfillan, Daniel] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 48 Linnaeus Way, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Gilfillan, D (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 48 Linnaeus Way, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",stacy-ann.robinson@anu.edu.au; daniel.gilfillan@anu.edu.au,"Robinson, Stacy-ann/R-2769-2019","Robinson, Stacy-ann/0000-0003-3163-8771",Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University,Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade(Australian Government); Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University,"The authors contributed equally to this paper.

Systematic review approaches, and more recently realist review methods, have been used within the health sciences for decades to guide research synthesis. Despite this, penetration of these approaches into the social and environmental sciences has been limited. Here, we present an analysis of approaches for systematic review and research synthesis and examine their applicability in an adaptation context. Customized review frameworks informed by systematic approaches to research synthesis provide a conceptually appropriate and practical opportunity for increasing methodological transparency and rigor in synthesizing and tracking adaptation research. This review highlights innovative applications of systematic approaches, with a focus on the unique challenges of integrating multiple data sources and formats in reviewing climate change adaptation policy and practice.

This diversity is healthy, and yet it is possible to define some key characteristics and tools that can promote practical outcomes. In this paper, some methodologies that have proved successful are reviewed. These include a mapping of contextual circumstances, an appreciation for multiple perspectives, and the importance of a boundary object in forging strong interactions among project participants. Further, a toolkit of approaches for natural scientists is presented. This toolkit can be used to organize work in collaboration with stakeholders and other participants and can help overcome barriers to a meaningful contribution to the policy process.

Along the coast of British Columbia, Canada, Indigenous peoples developed a tightly coupled social-ecological system that was interrupted by the arrival of settler colonialism in the 1800s. Although both climate change adaptation and the impacts of colonization have been well studied, little research has examined how these themes interact, and the conditions that may support or prevent people's ability to adapt to the social-ecological changes that emerge. Through a collaborative partnership with four First Nations and their umbrella organization for technical support, we examined people's perceptions of social and ecological aspects of adaptation to climate change. Using semistructured interviews (n = 50), four key strategies emerged as critical for climate change adaptation: (1) strengthening Indigenous governance autonomy and authority, (2) promoting knowledge sharing for adaptation practices within and among communities, (3) promoting adaptive comanagement among governance scales, and (4) developing learning platforms for climate impacts and adaptive strategies. Actions typically proposed by non-Indigenous government, including marine protected areas and ecosystem-based management were not prioritized. We found diverse attitudes toward climate change impacts, indicating that people's perceptions of adaptation strategies are strongly influenced by exposure to observable impacts, the social-ecological context in which they live, and perceptions of governance and self-determination. Our study suggests that supporting Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to climate change will require transforming the current governance model into one that acknowledges Indigenous social, cultural, and food needs and how these relate to marine resources and territorial management rights.","[Whitney, Charlotte K.; Frid, Alejandro] Univ Victoria, Cent Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Whitney, Charlotte K.; Frid, Alejandro; Ban, Natalie C.] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Edgar, Barry K.] Kitasoo Xaixais First Nation, Klemtu, BC, Canada; [Walkus, Jennifer] Wuikinuxv Nation, Wuikinuxv Resource Stewardship, Wuikinuxv, BC, Canada; [Siwallace, Peter; Siwallace, Iris L.] Nuxalk Nation, Nuxalk Stewardship Off, Bella Coola, BC, Canada",University of Victoria; University of Victoria,"Whitney, CK (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Cent Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance, Victoria, BC, Canada.;Whitney, CK (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, Victoria, BC, Canada.",,,,NSERC Canadian Healthy Oceans Network and its Partners: Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada; INREST; National Science and Engineering Research Council through a Canada Graduate Scholarship; Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada through the Ocean Canada; University of Victoria Human Research Ethics Board [17-252],NSERC Canadian Healthy Oceans Network and its Partners: Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada; INREST; National Science and Engineering Research Council through a Canada Graduate Scholarship; Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada through the Ocean Canada; University of Victoria Human Research Ethics Board,"We are grateful to the members of the Heiltsuk, KitasoolXatxais, Nuxalk, and Wuikinuxv Nations who generously shared their time and knowledge with us for this project.

However, Swedish forest management practices have so far involved relatively little consideration of adaptation to climate change. This study examined resistance and alternatives to business as usual forest management, drawing upon material obtained in interviews with individual forest owners who spontaneously identified and discussed storm and wind throw as a risk to their forest. They thereby expressed a logic differing from that of the forest industry in Sweden, which has largely normalised storm risk rather than considering it in climate change adaptation work. The present analysis illustrates the broad and largely concerned position of individual forest owners, in contrast with a more established industry position on storm as an accepted and existing risk. Overall, the study highlights the diversity, agency and power relations within Swedish forestry and the forested landscape - aspects that are vital to better understanding processes relevant to forest and climate change adaptation.","[Andersson, Elias] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Resource Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Keskitalo, E.

The interface between climate and tourism is multifaceted and complex, with broad significance for tourist decision-making and expenditures, as well as industry marketing and operations worldwide. With the close relationship of tourism to the environment and climate, the integrated effects of climate change are anticipated to markedly affect tourism businesses and destinations, as well as the destination choices and mobility of individual tourists in the decades ahead. As recent major natural, political, and economic shocks have demonstrated, the tourism sector has relatively high adaptive capacity. Improved climate services will be vital for travelers and tourism businesses and destinations to adapt to climate change in an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner.

Damages to coastal archeological sites, loss of access to historical sites, and the alteration of cultural landscapes will force changes in the way researchers can study sites, tourists can enjoy places, and descendant communities who have lived in particular areas for time immemorial, and local community members can utilize and relate to landscapes. In the USA, the National Park Service is a primary coastal cultural resource management organization. The National Park Service has been working on climate change adaptation for cultural resources for over a decade; however, there are few examples of parks in which long range climate change adaptation plans for cultural resources have been implemented. Building from 20 semi-structured interviews with cultural resource managers in three parks, we found that institutional structures within the National Park Service, as well as historical conceptual framings specific to the research, recreational, and interpretive values of cultural resources act as barriers to managers' ability to design and implement climate change adaptation plans. Institutional barriers managers discussed include the dependence of climate change adaptation decisions partnership projects and the leveraging of budgetary and staff resources within NPS that may affect climate change adaptation capacity. We found that park managers often saw impacts in parks that may be associated with climate change, but found it difficult to separate normal maintenance from climate change affected deterioration, which may lead to status quo management actions rather than revised planning for a changing future regime. Conceptual barriers managers discussed revealed a conflict between preservation needs of research versus interpretive uses and while NPS guidance recommends prioritization of cultural resources for preservation at the park level, regional managers were more focused on this topic than park managers. As NPS moves forward with climate change adaptation planning, opportunities to develop and improve cultural resource preservation with new technologies, improved prioritization schemes, and include public input in resource preservation may help coastal managers overcome these barriers.","[Casey, Alanna; Becker, Austin] Univ Rhode Isl, Kingston Coastal Inst, Dept Marine Affairs, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",University of Rhode Island,"Casey, A (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Kingston Coastal Inst, Dept Marine Affairs, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",alannacasey@uri.edu,,,,,,,63,15,15,3,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0892-0753,1521-0421,,COAST MANAGE,Coast.

The case of Santiago de Chile, where the creation of a Regional Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the Metropolitan Region was undertaken in collaboration with the Regional Government and the Regional Ministerial Secretariat of the Environment, provides the experience of such a participatory process being part of a larger inter- and transdisciplinary project. The article highlights the complexities involved in this process and knowledge transfer in the context of collaborative governance. The principal challenges identified are: to 'make the case' with respect to climate change adaptation planning; to be able to communicate scientific data effectively and to be clear about methodologies and uncertainties; and to ensure an integrated, coordinated response rather than sectoral fragmentation. The paper concludes that despite the complexities involved, participatory planning processes are preferable for urban climate change adaptation, as such processes are more legitimate and generate the social capacity building and inter-sectoral cooperation needed in the context of the current governance models in large Latin American cities, as exemplified by the case of Santiago.","[Richard Barton, Jonathan; Michael Harris, Jordan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable, Providencia, Chile; [Krellenberg, Kerstin] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Leipzig, Germany; [Michael Harris, Jordan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Estudios Urbanos & Terr, Providencia, Chile; [Michael Harris, Jordan] Univ Diego Port, Escuela Sociol, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; University Diego Portales,"Harris, JM (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable, Providencia, Chile.",jordan.harris28@gmail.com,"Krellenberg, Kerstin/B-7722-2017; Barton, Jonathan/E-8512-2011","Krellenberg, Kerstin/0000-0003-4645-5775; Barton, Jonathan/0000-0001-6250-8684",,,,,52,25,25,1,66,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

False adaptation can lead to adverse impacts on natural and societal dynamics. Therefore, an interdisciplinary perspective on the interaction of natural dynamics, societal demands, and political decisions is crucial. In this sense, this study scrutinizes coastal processes and socio-political dimensions of erosion on the reef island Fuvahmulah, the Maldives. The national government and Fuvahmulah's population have an opposed perception and attribution of the drivers and processes behind Fuvahmulah's most pressing coastal issue - coastal erosion. To review these perceptions, natural dynamics are recreated with process-based methods and discussed regarding present and projected marine pressures. Population surveys and interviews with actors in coastal development complement the physical insights into erosion on Fuvahmulah and describe the socio-political dimension of climate change adaptation on small islands. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates how small-islands' adaptive capacities are typically impaired and disclose the potential of local knowledge to overcome maldevelopment. Climate change adaptation and sea level rise pose challenges for both natural and societal dynamics. Here the authors analyse coastal processes and socio-political dimensions of erosion, leading to maldevelopment on Fuvahmulah in the Maldives.","[David, C.

Therefore, adaptation measures are required to sustain agricultural productivity, to reduce vulnerability, and to enhance the resilience of the agricultural system to climate change. There are many adaptation practices in the production systems that have been proposed and tested for minimizing the effects of climate change. Some socioeconomic and political setup contributes to adaptation, while others may inhibit it. This paper presents a systematic review of the impacts of climate change on crop production and also the major options in the agricultural sector that are available for adaptation to climate change. One of the key conclusions is that agricultural practices that help climate change adaptation in agriculture are available, while the institutional setup to implement and disseminate those technical solutions is yet to be strengthened. Thus, it is important to examine how to bring the required institutional change, generate fund to invest on these changes, and design dynamic policies for long-term climate change adaptation in agriculture rather than a mere focus on agricultural technology. This is one of the areas where South Asian climate policies require reconsidering to avoid possible maladaptation in the long run.","[Aryal, Jeetendra Prakash; Rahut, Dil Bahadur] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Carretera Mex Veracruz,Km 45, El Batan 56237, Texcoco, Mexico; [Sapkota, Tek B.; Jat, M.

In addition, a large share of current development assistance is spent on climate-sensitive projects. With the potential for funding of climate change adaptation to fall short of what is needed and for development funding to continue funding many climate-sensitive activities, coordination of the two funding streams may enable more effective support for both sustainable development and climate change adaptation. Preliminary steps to facilitate such coordination are part of the Cancun Agreements and initiatives by other organizations.","[Smith, Joel B.] Stratus Consulting, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Dickinson, Thea] Burton Dickinson Consulting Ltd, Toronto, ON M4E 1R1, Canada; [Donahue, Joseph D.

Existing technologies allow farmers to cool down plants by a few degrees during critical periods, reducing the damage from excess heat. With nonlinear effects of high temperatures on yields, slight cooling can bring significant gains in many crops. We call this approach microclimate engineering (MCE) and note that it could be useful as a climate change adaptation concept. Our case study deals with California pistachios, threatened by warming daytime temperatures in the winter. A new solution for sunlight reflection, based on products already used in other contexts and crops, could potentially help deal with this challenge. We develop a model to analyze grower choice and market outcomes with MCE for California pistachios. The expected increase in welfare for the period of 2020-2040 is assessed at 0.49-1.42 billion dollars under several scenarios. Simulation results show increases in consumer surplus and total welfare when MCE is available but decreases in aggregate grower profits. We also introduce market power to test its potential effects on the gains from MCE, finding mixed effects.","[Trilnick, Itai; Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Trilnick, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",itai.trilnick@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,55,0,0,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This research targeted to construct an integrated picture of the farm level adaptation to climate change in north China. We performed a field survey in Hebei province, and uncover which farmer behaviours in reality constitute an adaptation and analyses the characteristics and heterogeneity of these behaviours. The results show that farmer adaptation is mostly limited to spontaneous behavioural adjustment. The most widely adopted adaptation strategy remains the use of fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation techniques that were widely used, whilst the adoption of advanced adaptation technologies is not yet sufficient. Farming experience and involvement into off-farm work probably restrict farmers' involvement in adaptation. Farmers' perception of climate change risks and recognition of the effectiveness of adaptation would drive the adoption of adaptation strategies, however, obstacles remain with regards to the availability of policy, technology, and infrastructure support at government level. The study recommends that governments need to provide more adaptation support while also focus on the dissemination of information on adaptation provision, as well as strengthen people's perceptions of climate risks and the effectiveness of adaptation.","[Liu, Wenling; Du, Chenyi; Yang, Tingru] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wenling; Du, Chenyi] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wenling] Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Jin, Shuqin] Minist Agr & Rural Affairs China, Res Ctr Rural Econ, Beijing 100810, Peoples R China; [Jin, Shuqin] Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, NL-6700 Wageningen, Netherlands",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Wageningen University & Research,"Liu, WL (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Liu, WL (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Liu, WL (corresponding author), Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",liu_wenling@126.com,,"Liu, Wenling/0000-0001-8577-2525",Natural Science Foundation of China; Beijing Natural Science Foundation; China's National Key RD Program; Special Fund for Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education;  [71974013];  [9192019];  [2016YFA0602603],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); China's National Key RD Program; Special Fund for Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education; ; ; ,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71974013].,,63,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2325-1042,,,ENVIRON SOCIOL,Envir.

This paper reports on the results of a qualitative cross-cultural research collaboration about climate change adaptation for the Arabana, an Indigenous people from South Australia. We find that the Arabana people have a corpus of observed historical knowledge of climate change, forged through a sustained period of colonial invasion, that offers fine level detail about likely climate impacts that is not captured by regional scientific projections. This knowledge includes actual observations about recent climate variability, as well as changes to flora, fauna, land and cultural sites. This historical knowledge about and observation of the environment is as important to the Arabana people as ancestral traditional knowledge for informing the contemporary climate change policy that affects them and their surroundings. Arabana knowledge sets about climate change and its impacts were also found to be intimately interconnected with other regional socio-economic activities (such as pastoralism and mining) which are the legacy of colonisation, and cannot be divorced from cultural perceptions and discussions about climate impacts. We conclude that in order to forge appropriate responses to the impacts of climate change, dialogues between policy makers and the Arabana needs to acknowledge the legitimacy of all Arabana knowledge, particularly historical knowledge that has been grafted through colonial dispossession.","[Nursey-Bray, Melissa; Palmer, Robert] Univ Adelaide, Fac Arts, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Stuart, Aaron; Arbon, Veronica] Arabana Aboriginal Corp, Port Augusta, SA, Australia; [Rigney, Lester-Irabinna] Univ South Australia, Sch Educ, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide; University of South Australia,"Nursey-Bray, M (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Fac Arts, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",Melissa.Nursey-Bray@adelaide.edu.au,"Rigney, Lester/AAS-1357-2020","Rigney, Lester/0000-0002-4756-2399; Nursey-Bray, Melissa/0000-0002-4121-5177","National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Griffith University, Queensland, Australia","National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Griffith University, Queensland, Australia","We acknowledge the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Griffith University, Queensland, Australia for the grant that enabled this project to occur.

Therefore, research interest in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in land use and management has been growing. However, the adaptation and mitigation strategies have been handled separately at different dimensions and spatial levels. In this study, we presented a modeling framework for land use optimization that integrates climate change adaptation and mitigation, developed the model, and then applied it to Huailai County, wherein environmental and socioeconomic conditions are sensitive to climate change. The regional land use optimization model was combined with a linear programming model and a modified cellular automata model. Subsequently, the climate change adaptation and mitigation constraints, including ecological water demand, spatial suitability, and carbon sequestration, were incorporated into the model. The results indicate that most regions in the study area could adapt to and mitigate climate change with a constant land use pattern, and the land use conversion region under different climate change scenarios was primarily located in the topography transition region. The optimization results also reveal trade-offs between climate change adaptation and mitigation that were manifested with an increase in carbon sequestration and ecological water demand accompanied by decreases in the net income of agricultural production. Thus, it is necessary to simultaneously incorporate climate change adaptation and mitigation into land use optimization and management, and the proposed model provides a feasible method to incorporate them and balance their trade-offs in land use pattern optimization at a regional scale.","[Xu, Ying] Shandong Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Jinan 250023, Peoples R China; [Yao, Lei] Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China",Shandong Jiaotong University; Shandong Normal University,"Yao, L (corresponding author), Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China.",xuy_1986@126.com; alex_yaolei@126.com,"Yao, Lei/ABF-8947-2021","Yao, Lei/0000-0001-7920-4871",,,,,58,3,3,5,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,DEC,2021,10,12,,,,,,,1297,10.3390/land10121297,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10121297,,,19,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YA0GP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000738022600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using novel public opinion data on support for a range of adaptation policies, coupled with high re solution geographic data on extreme weather events, we find that individuals experiencing recent extreme weather activity are more likely to support climate change adaptation policy in general, but that the relationship is modest, inconsistent across specific adaptation policies, and diminishes with time.

Using qualitative methodology, this study explores the relationships between gender, caste and ethnicity in shaping women's participation in climate change adaptation programs in the southern plains of Nepal. We conclude that women's gender identities generally facilitated their participation and that affirmative action for marginalized groups, to some extent, gave women from these groups spaces to participate in climate change adaptation programs.

As climate change adaptation gains increasing prominence in global environmental policies and development strategies, there is a tendency to conceptualize adaptation as a technical process, disconnected from the everyday reality of how adaptation is practised by people facing negative climate change impacts. We present evidence from a small-scale case study of a flood-prone informal settlement in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to provide a contextually grounded contribution to a growing body of literature on gender, climate change and cities. We argue that the way climate change impacts are perceived, experienced and adapted to on an everyday level is characterized by gendered differences (among others). We demonstrate that a greater understanding of these gendered nuances highlights the disconnect between everyday gendered realities and a high-level technical notion of adaptation deployed at strategic and policy levels.","[Schofield, Daniela] Ecorys UK Int Dev Unit, 5th Floor,Queen Elizabeth House, London EC3R 8AD, England; [Gubbels, Femke] 100 Resilient Cities Pioneered Rockefeller Fdn, London, England",,"Schofield, D (corresponding author), Ecorys UK Int Dev Unit, 5th Floor,Queen Elizabeth House, London EC3R 8AD, England.",daniela.schofield@ecroys.com; fgubbels@100resilientcities.org,,"Schofield, Daniela/0000-0002-0950-6310",Royal Geographic Society,Royal Geographic Society,Fieldwork was partially supported by the Royal Geographic Society (with Institute of British Geographers) in the form of a Graduate Fieldwork Grant made in 2016 to the Everyday Dar team.,,101,12,12,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

It looks particularly at the influence of domestic versus global rationalities in adaptation programs through a novel joint governance and political ecology framework. It does this in the setting of water management in Vietnam. Based on a historical view, semi-structured interviews and document and policy reviews, I examine historical water management in Vietnam and current water management programs identified as climate change adaptation. By analyzing how historical, scaled political rationalities inform the framing of current adaptation programs, I find that program formulation reflects domestic(ated) rationalities rather than novel global adaptation agendas. This suggests that universalizing accounts of climate change adaptation overlook the significance of situated, historical factors in the formulation of adaptation programs. Furthermore, the article illustrates how political rationalities can be rescaled, gaining traction within new institutional scales and the programs enacted from them. Finally, the article underlines the inherent power implications of the struggle to determine whose rationalities prevail in program formulation.","[Lindegaard, Lily] Danish Inst Int Studies, Nat Resources & Dev Unit, Ostbanegade 117, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies,"Lindegaard, L (corresponding author), Danish Inst Int Studies, Nat Resources & Dev Unit, Ostbanegade 117, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",lili@diis.dk,,,,,,,88,3,3,2,2,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.

From this and similar observations, many of the papers conclude that there is a need for shifting to a new approach on how climate policy makers may relate to climate change uncertainties. The article proposes such a shift by presenting a road map on how to address uncertainties in climate change adaptation. It consists of three major elements: first, to accept that in many cases we will not be able to reduce climate change uncertainties; second, to diversify the way in which we describe climate change uncertainties, moving from a one-dimensional technical perspective to a multidimensional perspective that applies uncertainties also to social and political processes and systems; and third, to change the way we address climate change uncertainties by moving from a predict-then-act to a reflect-then-act approach, implying that we must adapt to climate change even under high and varied forms of uncertainties. Embedded in this last point is to accept that, unlike for climate change mitigation, the precautionary principle will apply in many situations of climate change adaptation. In the last part of the article the usability of the proposed road map is demonstrated post ante on four Norwegian cases of climate-related natural hazard events.","[Aall, Carlo; Groven, Kyrre] Western Norway Res Inst, Sogndal, Norway",,"Aall, C (corresponding author), Western Norway Res Inst, Sogndal, Norway.",caa@vestforsk.no,,,"Norwegian Research Center on Sustainable Climate Change Adaptation (Noradapt); project Unpacking climate impact CHAINs.

Social science climate adaptation research thus falls significantly short of the reflective power of various feminist research regarding the role of gender in adaptation to climate change. Many of the available studies on adaptation are gender blind or reproduce an essentialist discourse of female vulnerability and victimization. This article seeks to narrow the gap by broadening the perspectives for a relational analysis of gender, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change. It therefore draws on classical sociologist approaches to gender relations on the inter-sectionality debate, such as perspectives of Feminist Political Ecology. On the one hand, there is an argument for the identification of structural political economic mechanisms of hierarchization that lead to differing climate adaptation options among women and men. This includes both international and national political and economic state and civil societal mechanisms of regulation, which shape the individual and collective scope of action through their gender-, race-and class-specific effects. On the other hand, we argue for a stronger analytical focus at the subject level in order to capture the identity of political dynamics that contribute to unequal options for climate adaptation among men and women.","[Hackfort, Sarah] Kassel Univ, Doctoral Programme Global Social Policies & Gover, Kassel, Germany; [Burchardt, Hans-Juergen] Kassel Univ, Dept Int & Intersocietal Relat, Kassel, Germany; [Hackfort, Sarah] IZT Inst Future Studies & Technol Assessment, Berlin, Germany",Universitat Kassel; Universitat Kassel,"Hackfort, S (corresponding author), Kassel Univ, Doctoral Programme Global Social Policies & Gover, Kassel, Germany.;Hackfort, S (corresponding author), IZT Inst Future Studies & Technol Assessment, Berlin, Germany.",s.hackfort@izt.de,,"Hackfort, Sarah/0000-0001-6678-8759",,,,,78,7,7,3,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1946-0171,1946-018X,,CRIT POLICY STUD,Crit.

Legal scholars have in turn begun to explore how the many different fields of law will and should respond. During this nascent period, one overarching question has gone unexamined: How will the legal system as a whole organize around climate change adaptation? Will a new, distinct field of climate adaptation law and policy emerge, or will legal institutions simply work away at the problem through unrelated, self-contained fields, as in the famous Law of the Horse? This Article is the first to examine that question comprehensively, to move beyond thinking about the law and climate change adaptation to consider the law of climate change adaptation. Part I of the Article lays out our methodological premises and approach. Using a model we call Stationarity Assessment, Part I explores how legal fields are structured and sustained based on assumptions about the variability of natural, social, and economic conditions, and how disruptions to that regime of variability can lead to the emergence of new fields of law and policy. Case studies of environmental law and environmental justice demonstrate the model's predictive power for the formation of new, distinct legal regimes. Part II applies the Stationarity Assessment model to the topic of climate change adaptation, using a case study of a hypothetical coastal region to demonstrate the potential for climate change impacts to disrupt relevant legal doctrines and institutions. We find that most fields of law appear to be capable of adapting effectively to climate change. In other words, without some active intervention, we expect the law and policy of climate change adaptation to follow the path of the Law of the Horse a collection of fields independently adapting to climate change rather than organically coalescing into a new and distinct field. Part III explores why, notwithstanding this conclusion, it may still be desirable to seek a different trajectory. Focusing on the likelihood of systemic adaptation decisions with perverse and harmful results, we identify the potential benefits offered by intervening to shape a new and distinct field of climate adaptation law and policy. Part IV then identifies the contours of such a field, exploring the distinct purposes of reducing vulnerability, ensuring resiliency, and safeguarding equity. These features provide the normative policy components for a law of climate change adaptation that would be more than just a Law of the Horse. This new field would not replace or supplant any existing field, however, as environmental law did with regard to nuisance law, and it would not be dominated by substantive doctrine. Rather, like the field of environmental justice, this new legal regime would serve as a holistic overlay across other fields to ensure more efficient, effective, and just climate adaptation solutions.","[Ruhl, J.

This paper explores two research questions: How can the acceptance among corporate decision-makers towards climate adaptation measures for their transport operations be explained? Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Diffusion of Innovations we develop a theoretical framework for dealing with climate adaptation measures for transport operations (step 1). We support the use of this framework through a literature review (1989-2020) (step 2) and semi-structured interviews with German companies that have implemented best practice measures (step 3). The results show that the handling of climate adaptation measures for transport operations can be described in three acceptance phases: acceptance of attitude, action, and use. We conclude that these phases determine the approaches required for promoting climate change adaptation.","[Griese, Kai-Michael; Busch, Jan Niklas; Isensee, Carmen] Univ Appl Sci Osnabruck, Sch Business Management & Social Sci, Osnabruck, Germany; [Franz, Martin] Osnabruck Univ, Inst Geog, Osnabruck, Germany",University Osnabruck,"Griese, KM (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Osnabruck, Sch Business Management & Social Sci, Osnabruck, Germany.",k-m.griese@hs-osnabrueck.de,,,,,,,89,3,3,3,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1361-9209,1879-2340,,TRANSPORT RES D-TR E,Transport.

In this contribution, we utilize Pierre Bourdieu?s sociological concepts of field, habitus and capital, and in-depth interviews with public health practitioners to document and describe the emerging field of public health adaptation to climate change Ontario, Canada. In doing so, we identify and explain three types of climate change action and associated practices ? ?wait and see?, repackaging existing actions and championing new actions ? that practitioners relate to climate change adaptation in Ontario (i.e. business as usual, repackaging existing actions and championing climate new actions). We discuss the typology in relation to the dominant and emerging logics that practitioners ascribe to promoting practical action on this sub-field of environmental health practice to promote a discussion of how social change occurs within a well-established field of professional practice. Findings suggest, that change and innovation can result from exogenous shocks that force practitioners to adopt new practices (e.g. the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related impacts on health), how the ?rules? of a given field are interpreted by practitioners and made actionable, and through the negotiation of new rules by practitioners with a ?radical habitus? who champion particular issues, albeit resulting in significant professional risk. We discuss these findings in relation to Bourdieu?s theory, concluding there is significant room for practitioner agency to cultivate normative dispositions and influence the adoption of policy and practice-change.","[Buse, Chris G.] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Environm Assessment Res, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Poland, Blake] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wong, Josephine] Ryerson Univ, Daphne Cockwell Sch Nursing, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Haluza-Delay, Randolph] Kings Univ, Dept Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of Toronto; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Buse, CG (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Ctr Environm Assessment Res, Kelowna, BC, Canada.",chris.buse@ubc.ca,,/0000-0003-1163-2305,Lupina Comparative Program on Health and Society; CIHR Strategic Training Program in Public Health Policy,Lupina Comparative Program on Health and Society; CIHR Strategic Training Program in Public Health Policy(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"This work was funded in part by two fellowship awards held by the lead author, the Lupina Comparative Program on Health and Society and the CIHR Strategic Training Program in Public Health Policy.",,48,4,4,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0958-1596,1469-3682,,CRIT PUBLIC HEALTH,Crit.

Our argument builds upon a body of literature in social studies of science to cull insights about knowledge co-production, social learning, and the ecology of team science, particularly as it relates to climate change adaptation. Couched in this transdisciplinary literature, we demonstrate, is the assumption that integration necessarily can and should be a regulative ideal. We critique this assumption by examining the 'messy' politics of achieving consensus among radically different, and sometimes irreconcilable, ways of knowing. We argue that the integration imperative conceals the friction, antagonism, and power inherent in knowledge co-production, which in turn can exclude innovative and experimental ways of understanding and adapting to climate change. By way of conclusion, the final section explores three alternative models of knowledge co-production triangulation, the multiple evidence-based approach, and scenario building - and illustrates their application in the context of transdisciplinary research in climate change adaptation in the arctic, focusing on alternative means of cross-boundary engagement with indigenous ways of knowing.

However, there presently exists little research especially on the integration of the private sector in adaptation. In particular, recently developed state programs for adaptation have so far been focused on the public sector. Insurance providers may have much to contribute as they offer other parts of society services to appropriately identify, assess and reduce the financial impacts of climate change-induced risks. This study aims to explore how the institutional distribution of responsibility for flood risk is being renegotiated within the UK, Germany and Netherlands. Examining how the insurance industry and the public sector can coordinate their actions to promote climate change adaptation, the study discusses how layered natural hazard insurance systems may result from attempts to deal with increasing risks due to increasing incidences of extreme events and climate change. It illustrates that concerns over the risks from extreme natural events have prompted re-assessments of the current systems, with insurance requiring long-term legislative frameworks that defines the objectives and responsibilities of insurers and the different political authorities.","[Keskitalo, E.

Consequently, governance models that integrate collaboration among diverse stakeholders are seen as crucial in increasing adaptation efforts around the world. However, at present, there is little insight into the mechanics of collaborative adaptation governance (CAG) at the local, regional, national or global levels. Drawing on collaborative governance theory and literature on climate change adaptation, we use multiple qualitative research methods to identify and explore CAG in Northern Ghana. We examine the conceptualization and implementation of CAG projects as well as the motivation behind them and their ensuing benefits. Results show that perceived climatic changes, diminishing agricultural livelihoods, adaptation resource needs and opportunities largely drive CAG. Local state actors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) provide leadership in CAG, bridging gaps in access to adaptation resources through the provision of agricultural inputs, climate services, infrastructure and human capacity development. However, in parallel to these, there exist interwoven governance challenges that include questions of trust, commitment, transparency, accountability and the representation of diverse interests. We demonstrate how powerful state actors and NGOs set the agenda, frame problems, and implement rules and incentives that are contrary to the normative tenets of collaborative governance theory. Ultimately, the results of this study shows that CAG is attempted but the challenges of CAG in Northern Ghana are large, while also providing insight into the extent to which CAG approaches can facilitate adaptation to climate change globally.","[Dapilah, Frederick] SD Dombo Univ Business & Integrated Dev Studies, Dept Community Dev, Accra, Wa Upper West R, Ghana; [Dapilah, Frederick; Nielsen, Jonas ostergaard; Lebek, Karen] Humboldt Univ, IRI THESys, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Dapilah, Frederick; Nielsen, Jonas ostergaard; Lebek, Karen] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [D'haen, Sarah Ann Lise] TMG Res gGmbH, EUREF, Campus 6-9,4 OG, D-10829 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Dapilah, F (corresponding author), SD Dombo Univ Business & Integrated Dev Studies, Dept Community Dev, Accra, Wa Upper West R, Ghana.",dapilafr@hu-berlin.de,,"Nielsen, Jonas/0000-0002-9518-7511",Government of Ghana; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Doctoral Scholarship Programme [91616271],Government of Ghana; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Doctoral Scholarship Programme(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"We would like to thank the Chief and People of Bagri for their time, patience, and granting us the opportunity to learn about how they are adapting to climate change.

Although there is a large body of adaptation policy literature emerging, our comprehensive understanding of policy instruments is limited nor do we know much about how scholarship on adaptation is addressing critical questions about policy instrument choice and effectiveness to support policy practice. In this article we map academic scholarship on climate change adaptation policy instruments in Europe. Using systematic approaches, we identify 184 relevant articles published 2014-2019. Our findings show that research is heavily concentrated on a limited number of western-European countries, with hardly any insights from eastern Europe and smaller countries. Most studies do not connect climate change impacts and risks with policy instruments, making assessment of policy effectiveness difficult, if not impossible. We argue that expanding the geographical scope of future research and enhancing the diversity of study types across Europe is critical for advancing theories on climate change adaptation policy, as well as providing useful recommendations for policy makers to strengthen the solution space and accelerate climate change adaptation.","[Biesbroek, Robbert; Delaney, Aogan] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Biesbroek, R (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",Robbert.biesbroek@wur.nl,"Biesbroek, Robbert/ABE-3686-2021; Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419",Dutch Research Council (NWO-VENI) [451-17-0064140],Dutch Research Council (NWO-VENI),RB's contribution was funded through the Dutch Research Council (NWO-VENI grant 451-17-0064140).

Increasing numbers of cities are creating climate adaptation plans and strategies, and a wide range of international organizations are developing tools and programs to promote and support further planning, despite the fact that the few studies to date that have evaluated adaptation planning have found it to be ineffective: focused more on broad visions than specific actions. To understand why cities continue to engage in adaptation planning, what benefits planners anticipate, and whether these benefits can be achieved through vision-oriented strategies as well as action-based plans, this study reports on a qualitative case study of the creation and adoption of the 2011 London, United Kingdom, Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. Results from interviews with participants and stakeholders indicate the London Strategy was consciously developed as a vision-setting strategy and was successful in: raising awareness of cross-sectoral risks, coordinating pre-existing adaptation efforts, validating stakeholder engagement, providing political authorization for use of resources and personnel, and creating continuity of purpose across changing political administrations. To accurately capture these benefits in other urban adaptation planning efforts will require a new evaluation approach. Based on the London case, this paper proposes future adaptation strategies be evaluated according to how well they build the adaptive capacity of city institutions to enable ongoing adaptation.","[Siders, Anne R.] Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, 473 Via Ortega,Y2E2 Bldg,Suite 226, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Siders, AR (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, 473 Via Ortega,Y2E2 Bldg,Suite 226, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",siders@stanford.edu,"Siders, A.R./R-8672-2018","Siders, A.R./0000-0001-6788-8313",David and Lucille Packard Foundation; McGee Research Grant; Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (E-IPER) at Stanford University,David and Lucille Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); McGee Research Grant; Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (E-IPER) at Stanford University,"This research was supported by a David and Lucille Packard Foundation Stanford Graduate Fellowship, a McGee Research Grant, and the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (E-IPER) at Stanford University.

Climate change vulnerability is a function not only of hydro-meteorological changes, specific geographic contexts, ecosystem integrity, and economic poverty, but also of the social and political institutions of a given local or regional context. The uncertainty, complexity, and inherent politics of climate change adaptation in particular places mean that adaptive institutions, if they are to be more than just disaster prediction and response mechanisms, must be flexible, dynamic and capable themselves of adapting quickly to changing environmental, economic, and social conditions. Certain approaches to adaptation have moved away from rigid orthodox development models. Nonetheless, they are often so general as to be impractical, or in effect comprise repackaged concepts and methods borrowed from climate change mitigation efforts and international development institutions. This study discusses the epistemic dimension of democracy at the level of international environmental institutions and at the level of local, contextually unique adaptation projects. Development and adaptation practices that involve democratic participation do so largely in accordance with norms of fairness and justice, which are unquestionably important. Attaching democracy exclusively to transcendent norms of justice, however, belies concrete possibilities for democratic approaches to climate adaptation. These possibilities reside in the epistemic dimension of democracy, a pragmatic notion developed. The account suggests that an epistemic democratic conceptual framework can inform adaptation institutions that are better able to cope with complexity and uncertainty, even ultimately directing these lessons towards the international sphere's institutional focus on mitigation.","Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Hilde, TC (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",thilde@umd.edu,,,,,,,57,4,4,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1351-0347,1743-890X,,DEMOCRATIZATION,Democratization,,2012,19,5,,,SI,,889,911,,10.1080/13510347.2012.709687,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2012.709687,,,23,Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,026WA,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000310312600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

An exact prediction of how the climate will change in the coming years, and how it will affect land use, is not possible. There is thus a perceived need to identify ways via which uncertainties can be addressed. Based on the need to address the research gap in this area, this paper reports the findings of a study on uncertainty in a climate change adaptation context, and how it is perceived. It consists of a multi-stakeholder survey among climate change professionals, including academic staff at universities, representatives from international agencies, members of NGOs, policymakers, and representatives of industry from 50 countries, including a balanced representation of industrialized and developing nations. The results obtained suggest that uncertainties are often a hindrance to engagement in climate change adaptation efforts, and to land management. Furthermore, there is a range of tools to reduce climate change adaptation uncertainties, whose deployment may help to address them. The paper concludes by providing a list of lessons learned and suggestions as to how uncertainty can be better communicated, and by doing so, how a reduction in the levels of climate change vulnerability may be achieved, and how land management may be fostered.","[Leal Filho, Walter; Wolf, Franziska; AL-Ahdal, Tareq Mohammed Ali] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chang, Int Climate Change Informat & Res Programme, D-20257 Hamburg, Germany; [Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Chester St, Manchester M1 5GD, England; [Stojanov, Robert] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Informat, Spatial Hub, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Matandirotya, Newton R.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geosci, ZA-6000 Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Matandirotya, Newton R.] Kgotso Dev Trust, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat & Resilience, POB 5, Beitbridge, Zimbabwe; [Ploberger, Christian] Thammasat Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Bangkok 10200, Thailand; [Ayal, Desalegn Y.] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Food Secur Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Azam, Fardous Mohammad Safiul] Univ Dev Alternat UODA, Dept Biotechnol & Genet Engn, Dhaka 1209, Bangladesh; [AL-Ahdal, Tareq Mohammed Ali] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Med, Publ Hlth Dept, Ar Ramtha 3030, Jordan; [Sarku, Rebecca] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, England; [Tchouaffe Tchiadje, Norbert Francois] Univ Dschang, Dept Agr Engn, POB\x 110, Dschang, Cameroon; [Manolas, Evangelos] Democritus Univ Thrace, Sch Agr & Forestry Sci, Dept Forestry & Management Environm & Nat Resource, 193 Pantazidou Str, Orestiada 68200, Greece; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Inst Global Innovat & Dev, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunlan] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Ctr Geopolit & Strateg Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; Manchester Metropolitan University; Mendel University in Brno; Nelson Mandela University; Thammasat University; Addis Ababa University; Jordan University of Science & Technology; University of Leeds; Democritus University of Thrace; East China Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; East China Normal University; East China Normal University,"Li, CL (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Inst Global Innovat & Dev, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Li, CL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.;Li, CL (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Ctr Geopolit & Strateg Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Li, CL (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",clli@geo.ecnu.edu.cn,"Stojanov, Robert/F-4280-2012","Stojanov, Robert/0000-0002-0471-7055; Safiul Azam, Fardous Mohammad/0000-0002-9337-273X; Wolf, Franziska/0000-0002-9724-5586; TCHOUAFFE TCHIADJE, Norbert Francois/0000-0003-3646-8943; Al-Ahdal, Tareq/0000-0001-6693-4525",,,,,78,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,DEC,2022,11,12,,,,,,,2226,10.3390/land11122226,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11122226,,,15,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7E5WY,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000901239100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Much water management research has focused on technical innovation with a range of new solutions developed to achieve a 'more sustainable and integrated urban water management cycle'. But Danish municipalities and utility companies are struggling to bring such solutions into practice. 'Green infrastructure', for example, requires the consideration of a larger range of aspects related to the urban context than the traditional urban water system optimization. There is the need for standardized methods and guidelines to organize transdisciplinary processes where different types of knowledge and perspectives are taken into account. On the basis of the macro-meso-micro pattern inspired by complexity science and transition theory, we developed a conceptual framework to organize processes addressing the complexity characterizing urban water management in the context of climate change. In this paper the framework is used to organize a research process aiming at understanding and unfolding urban dynamics for sustainable transition. The final goal is to enable local authorities and utilities to create the basis for managing and catalysing the technical and organizational innovation necessary for a sustainable transition towards climate change adaptation in urban areas.","[Fratini, C.

This study explores connections between local government's efforts to uphold and maintain the public trust and their considerations about climate change adaptation associated with water management. Document analysis and 24 interviews with local public officials are used to shed light on these considerations in three small municipalities in central Pennsylvania: Chambersburg, Carlisle, and Gettysburg. The analysis provides indications that a paradox of public trust leads to public officials pursuing actions and considerations that are consistent with climate change adaptation, but not recognizing that they are doing so. The implications of this governing mindset for climate change outreach and policy are explored. Suggestions for countering the logic of inaction expressed by public officials that justified a lack of adaptation are identified, and the potential for state and federal interventions to stimulate climate adaptation in contexts like these local governments is explored.","[Termini, Olivia] Deloitte Consulting LLP, Govt & Publ Serv, Washington, DC 20004 USA; [Kalafatis, Scott E.] Chatham Univ, Falk Sch Sustainabil & Environm, Gibsonia, PA 15664 USA",Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited,"Kalafatis, SE (corresponding author), Chatham Univ, Falk Sch Sustainabil & Environm, Gibsonia, PA 15664 USA.",terminio@dickinson.edu; S.Kalafatis@chatham.edu,,"Termini, Olivia/0000-0002-8370-9167",,,,,72,2,2,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,FEB,2021,12,2,,,,,,,241,10.3390/atmos12020241,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12020241,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,QN0EC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000622143400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Difficulties are intensified because policy interventions can involve high costs, foregone opportunity and changes to people's way of life. Factors such as these can spur an uncritical, or reflexive, negativity regarding efforts to address the projected impacts of climate change. Such reflexive negativity is often trivialised in pejorative terms, such as 'Nimbyism'. However, stakeholder reluctance to accept the need for adaptation planning may be strongly influenced by self-perceptions that are resistant to change. People's sense of self and sense of place may contribute to an 'imaginative intangibility' with respect to climate adaptation, blocking thoughtful reflection and deliberation regarding alternative approaches and providing rationales for cheating the system once implemented. If acknowledged and addressed in a sensitive manner, it may be possible to manage these self-perceptions to elevate public discourse about climate change and help create situationally appropriate adaptation policy regimes.","[Herrick, Charles N.] NYU, Washington Ctr, 1307 L St,NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA",New York University,"Herrick, CN (corresponding author), NYU, Washington Ctr, 1307 L St,NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",ch133@nyu.edu,,,,,,,82,10,10,4,14,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0963-2719,1752-7015,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

Scholars and policymakers argue that the private sector could be more efficient than the public authorities in implementing adaptation measures and argue for the need to engage citizens to ensure legitimacy of adaptation and inclusion of locally relevant knowledge. To what extent do cities address the private sector and citizens in their adaptation initiatives? What modes of governance do they use to do this? What kinds of cities are the most likely to address the private sector and citizens? Going beyond the existing case study approaches, this paper answers these questions using a large N data set covering 402 cities around the world. We find that a majority of adaptation initiatives focus exclusively on the public sector and do not address the private sector or citizens. In the cases where they do, the private sector is more often governed through partnerships and participation, whereas citizen participation is relatively rare. Initiatives involving citizens rely more often on a provision of information that encourages citizens to adapt. We find that the more advanced a city is in its adaptation process, the more likely it is to address the private sector than citizens in its initiatives to adapt to climate change. Whereas with partnerships and participation the private sector can influence urban adaptation arrangements at a broader scale, the provision of information allows citizens only to implement individual adaptation measures according to their capacities.","[Klein, Johannes] Geol Survey Finland, Espoo, Finland; [Araos, Malcolm] NYU, NYC, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Karimo, Aasa; Yla-Anttila, Tuomas] Fac Social Sci, Dept Social Res, Res Grp Polit Sociol, Helsinki, Finland; [Karimo, Aasa; Yla-Anttila, Tuomas] Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, Helsinki, Finland; [Heikkinen, Milja; Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Ecol & Environm Res Programme, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65,Viikinkaari 2C, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Heikkinen, Milja; Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, Helsinki, Finland",Geological Survey of Finland (GTK); New York University; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Juhola, S (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Ecol & Environm Res Programme, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65,Viikinkaari 2C, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",sirkku.juhola@helsinki.fi,"Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Klein, Johannes/0000-0003-0721-4063; Yla-Anttila, Tuomas/0000-0002-6908-3495; Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282; Heikkinen, Milja Elina/0000-0003-2673-3897",le Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies; NordForsk through the Short-term Quebec/Nordic Research Missions program,le Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies; NordForsk through the Short-term Quebec/Nordic Research Missions program,The preparation of this publication has been supported by le Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies and NordForsk through the Short-term Quebec/Nordic Research Missions program.,,78,36,36,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

The present study uses a three-phase adaptation framework to propose adaptation strategies aimed at overcoming socioecological barriers of the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus. Cradle-to-farm-gate land, greenhouse gas (GHG), and water impacts-that derive from food consumption in the United States-are analyzed and differentiated by major demographic groups (Black, Latinx, and White). Results indicate that the White demographic yields the highest per capita GHG (680 kg of CO2 eq.year(-1)) and water impacts (328,600 L.year(-1)) from food consumption, whereas the Black demographic yields the highest per capita land impacts (1,770 m(2).year(-1)) from food consumption. Our findings suggest that obtaining data with the intention of building consensus across sociodemographic lines overcomes barriers in the understanding phase, leading to increased social receptivity for many planning and managing phase processes. Specifically, we find that identifying and developing leaders who possess the cognitive and interpersonal capacity to manage many variables and stakeholders is key to assessing and selecting adaptation options in the planning phase. We also propose using government programming to encourage environmentally friendly food purchasing behavior. Then, we discuss how our proposals could be used in adaptation feasibility and evaluation activities in the managing phase. In all, these findings facilitate the development of improved climate change adaptation and policy by satisfying the understanding phase of the climate change adaptation framework, establishing a cross-disciplinary methodological approach to addressing socioecological problems, and providing useful FEW impact data for FEW nexus and climate change researchers.","[Bozeman, Joe F., III; Theis, Thomas L.] Univ Illinois, Inst Environm Sci & Policy, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Bozeman, Rayne] Chicago State Univ, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Chicago State University,"Bozeman, JF (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Inst Environm Sci & Policy, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",jbozem2@uic.edu,"Bozeman, Joe/ABC-2920-2020","Bozeman III, Joe/0000-0001-9791-1043",,,,,117,13,14,2,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

The purpose of this study is to examine the perception and determinants of agricultural technology adaptation of teff producers to climate change in North Shewa zone, Ethiopia. Data were collected from 378 farming households through a multistage and simple proportional sampling procedure. Both descriptive and econometric analyses were used in this study. A Heckman probit model and a multinomial logit (MNL) model are used to examine the determinants of perception and adaptation to climate change, respectively. The results of the Heckman probit model revealed that gender, farm experience, access to extension services and information access were found to have a significant influence on the probability of farmers to perceive and/or adapt to climate change. The multinomial logit models showed that education, gender of the household head being male, marital status, farming experience, income, access to information, livestock ownership, tenure status, and access to extension are the main factors that increase adaptive capacity. However, distance to the nearest market and family size negatively and significantly affect the decision to adopt various agricultural technologies.

This literature seeks to explain how individuals' relationships with the places in which they live influence current and potential future responses to climate change at the local scale. Nevertheless, critical limitations are evident in the conceptualisation of place and people-place relationships within this literature. In particular, differences between individual place constructions and their possible implications for landscape management are given insufficient attention. To address these shortcomings, we mobilise research on the societal construction of landscapes to uncover how actors in landscape management perceive their' places and changes to them.

However, adaptation and mitigation are done by different people operating at different spatial and temporal scales. This hampers analysis of the trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation.

Alternative governance approaches that facilitate participation and learning across scales are gaining attention for their ability to bring together diverse actors across sectors and to foster adaptive capacity and resilience. We have described the method and outcomes from the application of a social-ecological inventory to prime, i.e., hasten the development of, a regional climate change adaptation network. The social-ecological inventory tool draws on the social-ecological systems approach in which social and ecological systems are considered linked. The tool bridges the gap between conventional stakeholder analysis and biological inventories, drawing on a social-ecological systems approach, and incorporates local knowledge as an explicit component. The process, which is dynamic and iterative, includes six phases: preparations, preliminary identification, identification of key individuals, interviewing, reviewing and enriching the inventory, and engagement. By considering the social and ecological aspects of a system, a more comprehensive inventory is achieved that provides a foundational platform to facilitate or support climate change adaptation processes that are participatory and learning oriented. Although social-ecological inventories have been used for ecosystem management, the intent of this research was to understand the potential of the tool for climate change adaptation. A social-ecological inventory was undertaken in the Niagara Region of Canada to assemble and facilitate a regional governance group to champion climate change adaptation. Moreover, the social-ecological inventory was purposefully undertaken as the initial step in priming the governance system and led into an adaptive comanagement process for climate change adaptation. Early indicators suggest that the social-ecological inventory has been instrumental in facilitating a multisectoral adaptive comanagement governance approach to climate change in the Niagara Region.","[Baird, Julia; Plummer, Ryan; Pickering, Kerrie] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Plummer, Ryan] Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden",Brock University; Stockholm University,"Baird, J (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",,,,Environment Canada; Brock University,Environment Canada(CGIAR); Brock University,"The authors thank all the participants in the research project associated with this paper.

Mountain agriculture is especially vulnerable to climate change, and adaptation seems crucial. Thus, certain adaptation activities, such as installing irrigation technology, switching to drought-resistant crop varieties or shifting planting dates, can already be observed. Despite these efforts, the barriers for climate change adaptation are still manifold and lead to adaptation gaps. One problem is that many approaches ignore non-climatic drivers, such as economic conditions or cultural aspects, which have a strong influence on farmers' decisions. In the literature, the focus is mostly on planned, top-down induced adaptations, where climate change is considered the most important driver. Within this study, we focus on local, bottom-up adaptation actions in Tyrolean mountain agriculture that may be triggered by climatic as well as by non-climatic drivers. We identify 27 adaptation practices and cluster them into six types of climate change adaptation: 'Resilience-raising products and production', 'Hidden actions by farmer organizations', 'CC motivated agronomic actions', 'CCA scientific knowledge production', 'Risk-driven adaptations' and 'Hidden governmental actions'. These types are helpful to show the broad range of local practices contributing to climate change adaptation. Several adaptation actions from practice are not motivated by climate change and thus are termed hidden adaptations, as they do not fit into common adaptation concepts. Hidden climate change adaptation practices, although not considered to date in official CCA policy documents, constitute low-hanging fruit for decision makers as they have already proved their feasibility and gained legitimacy by actors on the ground.

This article provides an introduction to a collection of studies that seeks to explore the link between climate change adaptation and public bureaucracies, and to distill lessons for the scholarship on adaptation as well as the persistent debates on the role of administrative traditions in public policy. The articles in the special issue demonstrate that how state and social actors are organized, the ways in which scientific advice enters bureaucracies, and uniformity in the making and implementing of policy matter for adaptation policy. We conclude that the concept of administrative traditions is still necessary for understanding the choices made by public actors, but contend that other factors such as economic motives and political willingness should be considered more critically in the literature on administrative traditions.","[Biesbroek, Robbert] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Peters, B.

Although little research has been done on human competences so far, this research shows that some appear to facilitate the adaptation process. The purpose of this multiple-case study is to identify adaptive competences demonstrated by two groups of Canadian citizens: municipal employees in a coastal community and farmers. Design/methodology/approach - As part of workshops based on a problem solving process, the two groups analyzed the impacts of climate change in their field of work and geographical area, chose a problem related to these impacts, suggested and then implemented adaptation measures. The municipal employees worked on sea level rise, whereas the farmers focused on poor soil quality, which makes it vulnerable to bad weather. Findings - By thematically analyzing the verbatim transcripts of the workshops and by building narratives, the authors were able to identify similar adaptive competences in both groups: local knowledge, futures thinking, hindsight, risk prediction, critical thinking, decision-making, and problem solving (highlighting key problem components, suggesting solutions, and identifying constraints). However, two competences were chiefly found in the group composed of farmers: optimism and openness to novelty. Originality/value - This study is one of the first to lead to recommendations regarding the pedagogical support of citizens during an adaptation process to climate change. These recommendations might be helpful in many communities where adaptation to climate change is a pressing issue.","[Kerry, Jackie; Blain, Sylvie; Lang, Mathieu] Univ Moncton, Fac Educ, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada; [Deguire, Paul] Univ Moncton, Dept Math & Stat, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada",University of Moncton; University of Moncton,"Kerry, J (corresponding author), Univ Moncton, Fac Educ, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada.",kerry@umoncton.ca,,,,,,,32,8,8,0,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

This study has examined the context in which climate policy is formulated in Colombia from an actor-oriented perspective. Using a traveling model approach,we analyzed the role of actors at international and national levels in raising climate issues and shaping climate policies. The results showed that the translation chains from several governmental and non-governmental actors increase the visibility of climate issues in Colombia and how such consultations help defining and addressing these issues. The analysis arising from the climate traveling model exposes power struggles between competing agencies: the National Planning Department (DNP), which promoted climate-change adaptation, and the National Disaster Risk Management Unit (UNGRD), which favored disaster risk management. At the end of the translation chains, governmental actors reappropriated the international consultants' interpretations of the issues and solutions within an economic perspective. Hence, adaptation to climate change came to be seen as an economic opportunity or as a way to avoid economic loss. International dominance in the elaboration of climate policies combined with scant involvement of local actors could constitute a challenge for policy implementation and potentially inhibit achieving successful outcomes.","[Howland, Fanny; Le Coq, Jean Francois] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira,Apartado Aereo 6713, Cali, Colombia; [Howland, Fanny; Le Coq, Jean Francois] Int Ctr Trop Agr, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Cali, Colombia; [Le Coq, Jean Francois] French Agr Res Ctr Int Dev CIRAD, UMR ART DEV, Campus Lavalette TA 85-15-73,Rue JF Breton, Montpellier 5, France",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier,"Howland, F (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira,Apartado Aereo 6713, Cali, Colombia.",f.c.howland@cgiar.org,,"Howland, Fanny/0000-0002-0778-2741","ANR [anr-17-ce03-0005]; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Fund Donors","ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR)","This work was funded by ANR (anr-17-ce03-0005) and the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) , the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) , which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

This paper reviews the type of actors that are supplying adaptation services and their motivations. We then focus on a specific, under-explored case of adaptation: that of privately provided adaptation public goods and services, the realization of which is contingent on the individual management of private goods and private risks. Following the work of Olson (1965) we find that the benefits of the privately provided adaptation public good do not necessarily accrue back to the (same) individuals who are the providers. The characteristics of this particular form of public good pose specific institutional challenges. In this paper we: 1) explore the characteristics and defining features of these privately provided adaptation public goods; 2) argue that this form of adaptation provisioning is increasingly recognised as a feature in climate change adaptation (and/or social transformation) problems; 3) review existing cases of effective/ineffective management of these public goods; and 4) outline the institutions that may be required to facilitate the management of these public goods for adaptation.

This paper studies the strategies adopted by urban water professionals in the tropical region of Queensland, Australia to minimise the impacts of climate change on the regional urban water supply network. In the recent past, the dry tropical urban region of Queensland has faced a climate-induced water crisis (2014-2018). This article investigates the urban water distribution authorities' planning and operational practices as part of climate change adaptation in the study region. Water professionals from the local urban water authorities were interviewed using a comprehensive range of questionnaires. Although the impacts of climate change on different water supply sources have been investigated in many parts of Queensland, the adaptation measures taken by the local authorities appear to be random and unplanned. Holistic implementation of climate change adaptation is rare and at its infancy stage due to the lack of quantifiable implementation frameworks or an audit process. The result shows resource constraints and lack of government support are the two major barriers to climate change adaptation in the water sector. Some water practitioners believe that the local urban water authorities have done a reasonable job on climate change adaptations in bits and pieces considering a wide range of local challenges such as lack of support from stakeholders, limited resources, and technology. Some other participants believe that too much attention on climate change will cause a noticeable problem in economic activities unless concerns from all stakeholders receive equal attention and are addressed. This is an important point and deserves proper acknowledgement to overcome relevant political and community barriers to climate change adaptation. The study concludes with a critical discussion on various strands of climate change adaptation to address the long-term regional urban water supply security challenges.","[Biswas, Rahul Ray] Cent Queensland Univ, Sch Engn & Technol, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Sharma, Raj] Cent Queensland Univ, Sch Engn & Technol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Gyasi-Agyei, Yeboah] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Nathan, Qld, Australia",Central Queensland University; Central Queensland University; Griffith University,"Biswas, RR (corresponding author), Cent Queensland Univ, Sch Engn & Technol, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",rahul.raybiswas@cqumail.com,,,"Department of Education, Skills and Employment, Australia","Department of Education, Skills and Employment, Australia","This research work was supported by the Research Training Program (RTP) tuition fee scholarship funding provided by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment, Australia.

An application is implemented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in this study. The results show that the problems and objectives which concern the governance level and stakeholders can be clearly identified by the proposed algorithm. The relationship between climate-related hazards, exposure, and vulnerability of the protected target can also be precisely investigated. Furthermore, the climate adaptation strategies able to mitigate the impact of hazards on the protected target are further discussed in this study.

This paper explores this issue, reporting on the application of a scenario-based land use modelling case study focused on Greater Manchester in North West England. It highlights that the interplay between varied drivers of change has the potential to generate contrasting land cover futures for the city-region, which will in turn influence climate change adaptation prospects. The case study pays specific attention to green infrastructure cover, as this can enhance the capacity of urban areas to adapt to climate change by providing functions such as evaporative cooling and rainwater infiltration. The two scenarios analysed within this paper connect, broadly, to the contrasting processes of expansion and shrinkage that are shaping cities worldwide. Where cities are expanding, stimulated by economic growth and increase in population, the danger is that associated land use change will pressure existing green infrastructure resources with a detrimental impact on adaptive capacity. Cities that are shrinking, or experiencing relative decline in comparison to other cities, face a different set of issues. Here, the emergence of vacant land provides an opportunity to secure adaptive capacity benefits associated with green infrastructure. With the processes of expansion and shrinkage projected to continue to influence the global landscape of cities, this research highlights that strategies are needed to protect and enhance green infrastructure in both contexts in order to maintain and build adaptive capacity and moderate climate related risks.","[Carter, Jeremy G.] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Carter, JG (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",jeremy.carter@manchester.ac.uk,,"Carter, Jeremy/0000-0003-1640-3747",Bruntwood Ltd.; Oglesby Charitable Trust,Bruntwood Ltd.; Oglesby Charitable Trust,"My thanks go to Gina Cavan, Aleksandra Kazmierczak and Chris Kenny for their support in developing the spatial data layers used during this research.

However, many local government units (LGUs) and the people themselves are not aware of the climate change phenomenon and do not have the capacity to undertake appropriate climate change adaptation measures. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the climate change adaptation strategies of communities and LGUs and the barriers and recommendations to enhance their adaptive capacity. Design/methodology/approach - The study covered five communities vulnerable to climate change impacts. Information on extreme climatic events and their impacts and adaptation strategies undertaken were gathered through focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews. LGU staff members were assisted in the preparation of their climate change adaptation plan (CCAP). Findings - The LGUs and communities have low adaptive capacity and employed temporary adaptation strategies.

Research has already documented some of the challenges of making climate information usable in decision-making but has not yet sufficiently reflected on the role of the wider institutional and regulatory context. This article examines the impact of the external institutional context on the use and usability of climate projections in local government through an analysis of 44 planning and climate change (adaptation) documents and 54 semi-structured interviews with planners in England and Germany conducted between July 2013 and May 2014. We show that there is little demand for climate projections in local adaptation planning in either country due to existing policy, legal and regulatory frameworks. Local government in England has not only experienced a decline in use of climate projections, but also the waning of the climate change adaptation agenda more widely, amidst changes in the planning and regulatory framework and severe budget cuts. In Germany, spatial planning makes substantial use of past and present climate data, but the strictly regulated nature of planning prevents the use of climate projections, due to their inherent uncertainties. Findings from the two countries highlight that if we are to better understand the usability of climate projections, we need to be more aware of the institutional context within which planning decisions are made. Otherwise we run the risk of continuing to provide tools and information that are of limited use within their intended context.","[Lorenz, Susanne; Dessai, Suraje; Forster, Piers M.; Paavola, Jouni] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Lorenz, Susanne; Dessai, Suraje; Forster, Piers M.; Paavola, Jouni] Univ Leeds, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Leeds,"Lorenz, S (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Lorenz, S (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",S.Lorenz@leeds.ac.uk; S.Dessai@leeds.ac.uk; P.M.Forster@leeds.ac.uk; J.Paavola@leeds.ac.uk,"Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009; Forster, Piers/F-9829-2010; Lorenz, Susanne/AAH-3755-2020; Paavola, Jouni/A-5413-2010","Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364; Forster, Piers/0000-0002-6078-0171; Lorenz, Susanne/0000-0002-9124-9690; Paavola, Jouni/0000-0001-5720-466X",UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NERC-NE/J50001X/1]; European Research Council under the European Union/ERC [284369]; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) for the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Research Council under the European Union/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) for the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Susanne Lorenz has been funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) (Grant Number NERC-NE/J50001X/1).

These models assume that people work to maximise profit, subject to financial and technological limitations. In effect, these models simulate adaptive potential. In reality, adaptation falls short of this potential. This shortfall is conceptualised as the adaptation deficit, and it has been causing increasing concern. This study demonstrates the impacts of the ways by which people's real-world adaptive behaviours depart from those assumed under pure optimisation. These departures, known as adaptation constraints, are formalised as numerical preference functions based on an empirical case study in New Zealand, and they are used to constrain an agent-based model of climate change adaptation. We show that these empirically-specified adaptation constraints reduce profits relative to an optimised specification by roughly one third. This demonstrates that unconstrained economic models are likely to significantly underestimate the costs of adaptation to climate change, the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the residual loss and damage that climate change will cause.","[Gawith, David; Hodge, Ian] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 16-21 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Morgan, Fraser] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, 231 Morrin Rd, Auckland 1072, New Zealand; [Morgan, Fraser] Univ Auckland, Te Punaha Matatini, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1011, New Zealand; [Daigneault, Adam] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, Old Town, ME 04468 USA",University of Cambridge; Landcare Research - New Zealand; University of Auckland; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Gawith, D (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 16-21 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",gawith@gmail.com,,"Daigneault, Adam/0000-0002-8287-8727; Morgan, Fraser/0000-0002-7964-3361","Woolf Fisher Trust; Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust through a Woolf Fisher Scholarship","Woolf Fisher Trust; Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust through a Woolf Fisher Scholarship","This work was supported by the Woolf Fisher Trust and the Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust through a Woolf Fisher Scholarship (2014).",,81,12,12,1,35,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

To reduce the damage caused by climate change, adaptation activities are being initiated, such as expanding the capacity of social infrastructures, and each stakeholder wants these adaptations to work in his or her favor. Therefore, a methodology is needed to determine adaptation measures that are most beneficial to all members of society. In this paper, a framework is proposed for producing an adaptation strategy that minimizes conflict between stakeholders. This framework casts the process of organizing climate change adaptations as a game and defines each community member as a stakeholder, each adaptation measure as a strategy, and the minimization of loss from future climate change as a payoff. In a case study involving sea level rise in Suncheon Bay, Korea, this framework is used to generate an optimal plan for minimizing conflicts while considering the losses of the central government, local governments, and local communities. The game theoretic results from the proposed framework enable a balanced distribution of responsibilities among stakeholders to achieve infrastructure adaptation to climate change.","[Jeong, Hoyoung; Seo, Hojung; Kim, Hyoungkwan] Yonsei Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 03277, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, H (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 03277, South Korea.",jhy0@yonsei.ac.kr; hojungseo@yonsei.ac.kr; hyoungkwan@yonsei.ac.kr,,,"Infrastructure and Transportation Technology Promotion Research Program - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) of the Korean government; Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) [17CTAP-C133290-01]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIP) [2011-0030040]; Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) [133290] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS); National Research Foundation of Korea [2011-0030040] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)","Infrastructure and Transportation Technology Promotion Research Program - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) of the Korean government(Ministry of Land, Infrastructure & Transport (MOLIT), Republic of Korea); Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA)(Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA)); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIP)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA)(Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA)); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This research was supported by grants from the Infrastructure and Transportation Technology Promotion Research Program funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) of the Korean government and the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA; 17CTAP-C133290-01), and by a grant from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Korean government (MSIP; 2011-0030040).",,37,7,7,1,36,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

The Headline Climate Change Adaptation Strategy launched by the municipality in 2006 did not catalyze the development of sectoral plans or significantly influence the Integrated Development Plan, the key document through which the municipal government sets and implements development priorities. Possible causal factors for this include limited human and financial resources and more immediate and urgent development needs. To address the situation, the municipality's Environmental Planning and Climate Protection Department encouraged and supported three pilot sectors to develop their own municipal adaptation plans. This more sectoral approach encouraged greater interaction among the sectors and provided each with a clearer understanding of their needs and roles from an adaptation perspective. It also highlighted how climate change adaptation could be used as a tool to address development priorities. This work will be extended through research into the cost-benefits of Durban being an early adapter. Work has also begun on community-based adaptation (including support for reforestation projects that provide green jobs) and on responses to slow onset disasters, food security and water constraints.","eThekwini Municipal, Environm Planning & Climate Protect Dept, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa",,"Roberts, D (corresponding author), eThekwini Municipal, Environm Planning & Climate Protect Dept, POB 680, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa.",robertsd@durban.gov.za,,,,,,,12,121,123,1,52,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

It describes impediments to the process of adaptation that could in principle be overcome but often are not. Many adaptation constraints have been identified and described in the literature across a wide range of contexts, and the importance of their influence on climate change adaptation is clear. However most studies have focussed on describing constraints rather than exploring their origins, processes, and possible impacts. As a consequence, it has been difficult to operationalise the concept to provide information meaningful to decision makers. This study demonstrates an approach to estimating empirically the processes and the impacts of adaptation constraints, based on a case-study of farmers in New Zealand. It combines established social scientific methods to explore the processes underlying a range of adaptation constraints and estimate the impacts that these constraints may have. The approach can be used to explore further the social and economic impacts of adaptation constraints. This information can then be used to consider sub-optimal adaptation to climate change more fully, and paves the way for policy responses that are more conscious of the human elements of climate change adaptation.","[Gawith, David; Hodge, Ian] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 21 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",University of Cambridge,"Hodge, I (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 21 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",gawith@gmail.com; idh3@cam.ac.uk,,"Gawith, David/0000-0002-7877-428X","Woolf Fisher Trust; Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust","Woolf Fisher Trust; Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust","This work was supported by the Woolf Fisher Trust and the Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust, in the form of a Woolf Fisher Scholarship (2014).

Comparing four case studies in Swiss mountain regions, three located in the Upper Rhone region and one case from western Switzerland, we investigate how sustainability is put into practice. We argue that collaboration networks and sustainability perceptions matter when assessing the implementation of sustainability in local climate change adaptation. In other words, we suggest that adaptation is successful where sustainability perceptions translate into cross-sectoral integration and collaboration on the ground.

This contribution proposes a structured approach for designing climate adaptation policies based on the concepts of Adaptation Pathways, Adaptive Policy Making, and Real Options Analysis. Such an approach results in incorporation of flexibility that allows change over time in response to how the future unfolds, what is learned about the system, and changes in societal preferences.

This paper provides a better understanding of the governance of adaptation to climate change in Switzerland, an example of a federal system with a strong focus on subnational levels and multilevel governance. We conceptualize governance as a network of policies, measures, actors and knowledge, and visualize their interactions using D3.js, a data-driven JavaScript library. The findings illustrate the typical division of labour in federal multilevel governance systems. The national level provides a strategic framework and funding and conducts coordinating measures at subnational levels, especially the local-level implementation of concrete measures.

However, the policy context in which it is implemented is very often complex and fragmented, characterised by interacting climate and non-climate strategies. An understanding of multilevel decision-making and governance is particularly important, if desired adaptation outcomes are to be achieved. This paper examines how climate change adaptation takes place in a complex multilevel system of governance, in the context of Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) region. It examines over one hundred adaptation strategies at federal, state, regional and local levels in terms of type, manifestation, purposefulness, drivers and triggers, and geographic and temporal scope. Interactions between strategies are investigated both at the same level of governance and across governance levels. This study demonstrates that multilevel approach is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition in responding to complex multiscale and multisector issues, such as climate change adaptation. Short-term adaptation measures; a predominant incremental, sectoral, top-down approach to adaptation; and the lack of a framework for managing interactions are major threats to effective climate adaptation in the GBR region. Coping with such threats will require long-term transformative action, establishing enabling conditions to support local adaptation, and, most important, creating and maintaining strategic interactions among adaptation strategies. Coordinating and integrating climate and non-climate strategies across jurisdictions and policy sectors are the most significant and challenging tasks for multilevel governance in the GBR region and elsewhere.

The aim of this study is to answer the question on how urbanites of Pakistan are coping with climate change and which part of the society required support to cope with changing climate? To answer this questions, this study conducted survey through a structured questionnaire, from the urban residents of Islamabad, to explore their coping mechanisms towards climate change. Survey collected information on demographic, social, economic, and physical aspects, using Hackman's Treatment effect model. The sample selection equation is conditional on the adaptations to climate change in the outcome equation. Main independent variables are income, age, education, and occupation. Selection equation is based on perceptions of individuals about climate change which contains dependent variables of changes in temperature of summers and winters, changes in rain fall pattern, fog, hailstorm, and information received from social media and peer groups. With the result of 57.55, the Wald test shows that overall, there exists goodness of fit at the 99 percent confidence level. The value of rho in the Heckman model is 0.40 which implies the Heckman model provides more consistent and more efficient estimates. The results are suggesting that increasing age enhances the likelihood of adaptations as the positive and significant coefficient of age implies that age has probability to adapt to climate change. The positive and significant coefficient of income, education, and occupation implies that urbanites have higher probability to adapt to climate change. Perception is the essential foundation of adaptation, and differences in perception can be transferred to the adapted strategies. Households that experience a greater variation in annual mean temperature are more likely to adopt any adaptation strategy to cope with climate change. Essentially, poverty encompasses the majority of the characteristics that reduce respondents' adaptation capacity and increase their susceptibility to climate change. The major contextual disparities were discovered across union councils in the form of financial, personal, social, physical, and natural capitals of families. Therefore, obligation is on government to offer greater support for individuals who are less affluent in terms of these assets. For this city, officials must offer subsidy schemes to less privileged and marginalized people of urban dwellers to enhance their adaptive capacity.","[Ahmed, Naeem] Natl Univ Modern Languages NUML Islamabad, Dept Econ, Sect H 91, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Padda, Ihtsham Ul Haq; Khan, Azra] Fed Urdu Univ Arts, Dept Econ Sci & Technol, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Otil, Maria Daniela; Cismas, Laura Mariana; Miculescu, Andra] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara 300006, Romania; [Rehman, Abdul] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China",West University of Timisoara; Henan Agricultural University,"Rehman, A (corresponding author), Henan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.",abdrehman@henau.edu.cn,,"Ahmed, Malik Naeem/0000-0001-7476-3332",,,,,59,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Given the growing interest in this climate change adaptation solution, we assess how well weather early warnings perform for extreme events in different parts of the world. First, we carry out a forecast verification for weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for 95th percentile extreme heat and extreme precipitation globally at 0.5 degrees resolution, with three days of lead time. We present the results alongside similar verification results from ECMWF forecasts and a CHIRPS-GEFS forecast, to identify regions of the world with consistent forecast skill. We then overlay the skill of these short-term weather forecasts on top of climate change projections for the increasing frequency of the extreme events themselves. Based on these results, we offer policy implications for EWS investments in different regions. We find that in much of the tropics, weather forecasts have relatively poor skill in forecasting extreme temperature and precipitation events, calling for further investments in predictability. In the extra-tropics, most extreme heat and extreme precipitation events can be correctly forecasted, with better results for multi-day events and shorter lead-times. While there is room to improve predictability, end-to-end investments in EWS in these regions can focus on the use of existing skillful forecasts. Finally, most of the world's land area is projected to see an increase in the magnitude of extreme heat and precipitation events with climate change, and EWS investments in these regions should prepare for unprecedented extremes and changing vulnerabilities. These results provide a foundation for localized research on EWS in different parts of the world as well as evidence for policy and donors on how best to invest in EWS in different regions.","[de Perez, Erin Coughlan; Easton-Calabria, Evan] Tufts Univ, Feinstein Int Ctr, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Medford, MA USA; [de Perez, Erin Coughlan] Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, The Hague, Netherlands; [Harrison, Laura] Univ Calif St Barbara, Climate Hazards Ctr CHC, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Berse, Kristoffer] Univ Philippines, Resilience Inst, Quezon City, Philippines; [Berse, Kristoffer] Univ Philippines, Natl Coll Publ Adm & Governance, Quezon City, Philippines; [Marunye, Joalane; Marake, Makoala] Natl Univ Lesotho, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Roma, Lesotho; Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol BUET, Inst Water & Flood Management IWFM, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Zauisomue, Erlich -Honest] Univ Namibia UNAM, Multidisciplinary Res MR, Windhoek, Namibia; [de Perez, Erin Coughlan] 150 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA",Tufts University; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET),"de Perez, EC (corresponding author), 150 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",erin.coughlan@tufts.edu,", Shampa/A-1567-2015",", Shampa/0000-0001-9650-960X; Coughlan de Perez, Erin/0000-0001-7645-5720; Marunye, Joalane/0000-0003-1283-2683",,,,,56,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0947,,,WEATHER CLIM EXTREME,Weather Clim.

The results indicate: (1) adoption of all the three climate change adaptation practices are complementary to each other; (2) all three institutional factors enhance the likelihood of the adoption of variety, access to Extension and training enhances the likelihood of the adoption of improved irrigation, and information enhances the likelihood of the adoption of DSR and (3) access to Extension and training enhance the complementarities among all three pairs of adaptation practices (variety and irrigation; variety and DSR and irrigation and DSR), while information enhances the complementarity between variety and DSR only.

African traditional worldviews encourage harmony between humans and the environment through a complex metaphysical belief system transmitted through folklore, taboos, and traditional knowledge. However, African traditional worldviews hold a belief in traditional gods that was shown to have a low connectedness to nature and a low willingness to change. In Makueni District, Kenya, 45% of agropastoralists surveyed believed drought was god's plan and could not be changed. In contrast, traditional knowledge, which is shaped by African traditional worldviews, is often used to frame adaptive strategies such as migration, changing modes of production, and planting different crop varieties. Furthermore, traditional knowledge has been used as a complement to science in areas where meteorological data was unavailable. However, the role of African traditional worldviews on climate change adaption remains understudied. Hence, there is a need to systematically establish the influence of African traditional worldviews on climate change risk perception, development of adaptive strategies, and policy formulation and implementation. In this commentary, we discuss the potential impacts of African traditional worldviews on climate change adaptation.

This paper reviews the im-plications of climate change for current emergency planning, and for emergency planning as an adaptation to climate change, using the UK as an example. There are seven key implications for current operational emergency planning: risk assessment needs to consider a broader range of events and changing likelihoods, a long-term perspective is necessary, response capabilities may need to be enhanced, some types of events will become less frequent but will not be eliminated, training and exercises need to consider novel events, public engagement and messaging needs to be revised to reflect increased severity of events, and improving resilience is necessary to reduce the need for emergency response. Many organisations include emergency planning as part of their climate change adaptation toolkit. However, relying on current or enhanced emergency planning procedures is unlikely to be a sufficient adaptation to a changing climate. Improved re-silience in some sectors will reduce the need for emergency planning and response, but it will not be feasible to improve resilience everywhere: the focus for emergency planning is therefore likely to evolve to reflect diverging impacts of climate change in and between communities. Achieving a balance between measures to increase resilience and measures to manage events requires a dis-cussion on appropriate standards for resilience and definitions of 'emergency'. Improving the co-ordination between emergency planning and climate change adaptation is essential to reduce current and future risks.","[Arnell, Nigel W.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, POB 217, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Arnell, NW (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, POB 217, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England.",n.w.arnell@reading.ac.uk,,, [NE/S002618/1];  [NE/S016481/1],; ,"Acknowledgements This paper builds on experiences gained as a NERC Senior Knowledge Exchange Fellow (NE/S002618/1) within the Civil Contin- gencies Secretariat of the Cabinet Office, and on research conducted in the Climate Risk Indicators project in the UKRI Climate Re- silience Programme (Grant NE/S016481/1) .

Semi-structured interviews and observations were used to solicit information from respondents. The study found out that the CCAPs are implemented in various forms including public education, land management, and water delivery. Moreover, about half of the Climate Change Adaptation Programs outlined from 2013-to-date were not implemented at all and more than 70% have not been completely successful. Also, the implementation of the CCAPs was mainly hindered by inadequate funding. It is recommended that there should be an improvement in CCAPs financing. Also, the Ejisu Municipal Assembly should include all Climate Change Adaptation Programs in the Districts' Medium-Term Development Plan under various thematic areas. Likewise, as a result of inadequate finance at the Local Governments level, the Assemblies should reduce the number of adaptation programs implemented within each planning period.","[Oduro-Ofori, Eric; Isahaka, Fatimatu; Opoku-Antwi, Gabriel] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol KNUST, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Opoku-Antwi, G (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol KNUST, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana.",odurooforieric@yahoo.com; fisahaka@gmail.com; gabbyantwi4@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,2,2,1,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0343-2521,1572-9893,,GEOJOURNAL,GeoJournal,DEC,2022,87,6,,,,,4653,4669,,10.1007/s10708-021-10522-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10522-2,,OCT 2021,17,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,5Z2SK,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000705807600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This takes into account the existing urban form, the lack of resources and the availability of the spatial planning tools within the Greek spatial planning system. he main purpose of this article is to highlight the fact that, even in urban areas where the potential for intervention seems to be marginal, because of their existing form, the complexities of the local planning system and resource limitations, improvements to the UHI effect and adaptation to climate change can be achieved by better land use planning and urban design.","[Yiannakou, Athena; Salata, Konstantina-Dimitra] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Yiannakou, A (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",adgianna@plandevel.auth.gr; salatadg@plandevel.auth.gr,"Salata, Konstantina-Dimitra/L-7749-2019","Salata, Konstantina-Dimitra/0000-0003-0306-0554; Yiannakou, Athena/0000-0003-3674-1401",,,,,52,22,22,2,42,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2017,9,2,,,,,,,271,10.3390/su9020271,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9020271,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EM8VZ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000395590500113,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hitherto adaptation studies have failed to comprehensively integrate non-cognitive behavioural factors (e.g. psychological capital), and there is also no common framework for measuring non-cognitive abilities of smallholder farmers. Hence, this study is the first attempt to assess how psychological capital affects climate change adaptation amongst smallholder farmers. The study estimated the multivariate probit regression model using data collected from 328 smallholder farmers in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. The results show an association between some psychological capital indicators and smallholder adaptation decisions. Social networks, having multiple farming objectives, access to credit and the type of farmer (irrigators vs. non-irrigators) were also significant in determining smallholders' adaptation decisions. In conclusion, the study recommends the need for practical ways for enhancing smallholders' endowment with key non-cognitive abilities. There is also a need for researchers to develop a comprehensive framework for assessing non-cognitive factors critical for climate change adaptation. This will improve the use of positive psychology theories to advance the literature on climate change adaptation. Support should also be provided to communities facing higher risks of climate change adaptation. More focus should also be given to improve smallholder farmers' ability to adapt, including access to affordable credit. The role of social networks in information sharing remains critical, and hence their promotion should be prioritised. The findings on multiple objectives in farming were unique to climate change adaptation research, and hence the indicator should be considered in future similar studies.","[Chipfupa, Unity; Tagwi, Aluwani] Univ South Africa, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr & Anim Hlth, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Wale, Edilegnaw] Univ Free State, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of South Africa; University of the Free State,"Chipfupa, U (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr & Anim Hlth, Johannesburg, South Africa.",chipfu@unisa.ac.za,"Tagwi, Aluwani/AHD-4284-2022; Chipfupa, Unity/ABD-9878-2020; Zegeye, Edilegnaw Wale/N-5292-2013","Chipfupa, Unity/0000-0001-9759-9301; Zegeye, Edilegnaw Wale/0000-0003-4705-7971",Water Research Commission of South Africa [K5/2278/4],Water Research Commission of South Africa,"This work was supported by the Water Research Commission of South Africa under Grant (K5/2278/4) , 2014-2017.",,60,1,1,2,10,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

The adaptation literature suggests that coordination of these efforts promises comprehensive climate change adaptation, because it allows making use of synergies and avoiding maladaptation. Nonetheless, we lack evidence about the coordination of multiple levels and its potential to actually facilitate climate change adaptation. Based on an examination of 14 integrated ASPs, the author asks how they interact with each other, if they reconcile the priorities of other levels, and if they are an adequate tool for coordinating climate change adaptation. The study reveals a considerable gap between theory and practice. It demonstrates that the call for coordination is not reflected in current adaptation policy and questions whether (more) coordination is what we need to be better prepared for the impacts of climate change.","[Clar, Christoph] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Clar, C (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Vienna, Austria.",christoph.clar@boku.ac.at,,"Clar, Christoph/0000-0003-3556-8256",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) - 8th Call [KR15AC8K12542],Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) - 8th Call,This work was supported by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) - 8th Call [grant number: KR15AC8K12542].,,51,14,14,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Adaptive comanagement is one process being advanced to make governance operational as it emphasizes collaboration among diverse actors, functions across scales and levels, and fosters learning though iterative feedback. Although extensive experience with adaptive comanagement has been gained in relation to other environmental and resource issues, its potential contribution to the governance of adaption is largely unexplored. This paper probes how adaptive comanagement might offer support to climate change adaptation and identifies gaps in knowledge requiring attention. In drawing upon existing literature and applied experiences, it is argued that adaptive comanagement may contribute to climate change adaptation by building generalized adaptive capacity as well as providing a novel institutional arrangement to generate adaptive responses. At the same time, several questions emerge about adaptive comanagement in this context. Considerations are thus discussed for adaptive comanagement scholarship and application in addressing the challenge of climate change adaptation.","[Plummer, Ryan] Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Plummer, Ryan] Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden",Brock University; Stockholm University,"Plummer, R (corresponding author), Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,67,42,42,1,23,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Risk preferences then shape the way individuals or groups adapt to these settings, dependent or independent of public policy. With the aim of shedding light on these preferences and aid policy efficiency, we develop a set of Climate Change Adaptation Applications based on oTree (CAT). The set consists of eight discrete apps that correspond to different risk perception biases and corrective treatments. From a scientific perspective CAT can be used to better understand adaptation decision constraints at the individual and community level, while from a policy perspective it can help policy makers plan or improve existing adaptation strategies. A pilot experiment with 75 subjects was conducted to evaluate CAT functionality and the decision-making process. The experiment examined adaptation decisions under different risk levels in a home flood context. It successfully explored the impact of unknown risks, various time horizons, framing conditions, and group dynamics. The results show that adaptation decisions are strongly correlated with risk levels, and adaptation rate increases when uncertainty is introduced. Collective adaptation increases in group dynamics, although polarization is observed, and uncertainty reinforces this through collective inaction. In addition, typical subject characteristics, including age, gender and home ownership, have a significant impact on adaptation.","[von Bulow, Catharina Wolff; Liu, Xiufeng] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Liu, XF (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",xiuli@dtu.dk,"Tomm, He/E-5457-2013","Liu, Xiufeng/0000-0001-5133-6688; von Bulow, Catharina Wolff/0000-0003-2536-6968", [82230],,"This research was supported by the co-financed PhD project (No. 82230).

This paper analyses the extent to which climate change adaptation is integrated into the policies and regulatory frameworks that guide urban risk reduction in Nicaragua, and discusses related progress. The results reveal significant progress in integrating climate change adaptation into the policy and regulatory frameworks of the three relatively new fields of (a) disaster risk reduction, (b) environmental management and (c) urban planning. They show that differences in the degree of integration relate to the development and updates to policy instruments in each field, and the extent to which they are related to the implementation of international climate change agreements. Although initially climate change adaptation integration was focused on the protection of natural resources in general, and food production in particular, since 2008 authorities have shown increasing interest in a more comprehensive and integrated approach. Nevertheless, the integration of climate change adaptation into disaster risk reduction and urban planning still lags behind the advances made in the environmental management field, It is concluded that in order to achieve greater and more coherent integration of CCA and, ultimately, improve the way climate-related risks is dealt with, urban authorities need to systematically review current policies and regulations to assess the synergies and gaps. This requires inter-sectoral and participative work with the actors concerned at national and local level, as well as the establishment of related monitoring and learning mechanisms.

The analysis reveals a fairly uniform network with organizational links gravitating around two poles: one focused on local action and the other on policy design. The density of relationships is weak overall, and there is medium centralization around the City of Montreal. While centralization is beneficial for coordination, a structure involving more distinct sub-networks linked to central actors by boundary (broker) organizations would improve prospects for innovation and efficiency. Analysis of the quality of relationships highlights important differences between what fosters good relations in each of the poles, reducing the chances that policies developed in the policy-oriented pole will be implemented in the action-oriented pole.

In this review, we bring together climate adaptation, decolonising and intersectional scholarship to chart the progress that has been made in better analysing and responding to climate change in Indigenous contexts. We identify a wealth of literature helping to decolonise climate adaptation scholarship and praxis by attending to colonial and neo-colonial injustices implicated in Indigenous peoples' climate vulnerability, taking seriously Indigenous peoples' relational ontologies, and promoting adaptation that draws on Indigenous capacities and aspirations for self-determination and cultural continuity. Despite calls to interrogate heterogenous experiences of climate change within Indigenous communities, the decolonising climate and adaptation scholarship has made limited advances in this area. We examine the small body of research that takes an intersectional approach to climate adaptation and explores how the multiple subjectivities and identities that Indigenous peoples occupy produce unique vulnerabilities, capacities and encounters with adaptation policy. We suggest the field might be expanded by drawing on related studies from Indigenous development, natural resource management, conservation, feminism, health and food sovereignty. Greater engagement with intersectionality works to drive innovation in decolonising climate adaptation scholarship and practice. It can mitigate the risk of maladaptation, avoid entrenchment of inequitable power dynamics, and ensures that even the most marginal groups within Indigenous communities benefit from adaptation policies and programmes.","[Johnson, Danielle Emma; Parsons, Meg; Fisher, Karen] Univ Auckland, City Campus,Sci Ctr Bldg 302-449, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Johnson, DE (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, City Campus,Sci Ctr Bldg 302-449, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",djoh422@aucklanduni.ac.nz,"Fisher, Karen/HJH-3615-2023; Parsons, Meg/C-2405-2019","Johnson, Danielle/0000-0001-5402-9229; Parsons, Meg/0000-0001-8721-659X",,,,,391,3,3,9,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2514-8486,2514-8494,,ENVIRON PLAN E-NAT,Environ.

Climate change has only recently been incorporated into decision-making processes and spatial planning. In order to facilitate communication of potential impacts of climate change, and to determine strategies and measures to adapt to those, in October 2009 the RIGS Commission on Geoscience for Environmental Management (GEM) established a Working Group on Climate Change Adaptation (http://climate.iugsgem.org/).

However, participation is not neutral, and current climate change adaptation research is tailored toward those with sufficient resources to adapt, as opposed to those most in need of adaptation. These are commonly marginalized stakeholder groups who remain on the social, economic, and political periphery, driving their vulnerability to climate change impacts. This paper presents the concept of autonomy in the context of multilevel governance for climate change adaptation before examining past participatory modeling approaches, illustrating the lack of application as an emancipatory tool for increasing the autonomy of marginalized stakeholder groups. Therefore, a list of 10 necessary conditions is presented for conducting participatory modeling for increasing the autonomy of marginalized stakeholder groups, strengthening multilevel governance for climate change adaptation.

This is exemplified in portrayals of conservative cultural norms as stifling positive change. A growing body of research across the world indicates that the reality is seldom as simple as this-culture works in complex and variable ways, and, most importantly, is inherently dynamic. Drawing especially from research work on vulnerability and adaptation conducted in semi-arid regions, we illustrate this argument by briefly exploring three themes-multiple knowledge systems for farming in Botswana, the dynamics of pastoralist values and livelihoods in Kenya, and the interplay of caste and livelihood choices in India. Understanding how different facets of culture such as these operate in context helps move away from viewing culture statically as a barrier or enabler, and toward a more plural and dynamic appreciation of the role of culture in adaptation. This includes recognizing the potential for factors that may be construed as barriers to become enablers. Critical, balanced engagement with cultural dimensions in both research and practice, understanding and working with these dynamic social structures, is essential if adaptation is to create meaningful and lasting change for those who need it most.

Any conceptual model should be developed based on theoretical reasoning and practical relevance of the topic. However, for most instances, climate change adaptation studies do not ground on such rationale and relevance. A relatively lower R-2 value of such studies further indicates a lack of care for developing the conceptual modelling of the study. Thus, the current study attempted to propose a conceptual model for assessing the determinants of farmers' adaptation to climate change in Bangladesh. A three-stage approach was used in constructing the model. First, relevant literatures were collected and analysed. Second, a list of factors compiled from the first stage (i.e., analysis of literature review) was refined using the Delphi method. Finally, the result of the Delphi method was cross-evaluated by Focus Group Discussion (FGD). Based on this, the present study proposes a multi-dimensional conceptual model that includes personal, economic, institutional and environmental determinants and might influence farmers' adaptation decision to climate change. This finding is expected to be suitable, in particular, for Bangladesh and other developing countries in general. Most importantly, it is expected to guide future research in assessing the factors influencing farmers' adaptation strategies to climate change effect and other similar events such as adopting agricultural technologies.","[Kabir, Muhammad Humayun; Alam, Md Mahbubul] Sher E Bangla Agr Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Informat Syst, Dhaka, Bangladesh",Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU),"Kabir, MH (corresponding author), Sher E Bangla Agr Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Informat Syst, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",mhumayunsau@gmail.com,,,,,,,54,3,3,4,8,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2395-7611,2395-7697,,J CLIM CHANG,J.

We use survey data collected from 359 smallholder rice producers in the Chitwan district of Nepal in 2019. The results indicate that: (1) access to institutional resources significantly enhance the likelihood of adoption of more climate change adaptation practices; (2) high intensity climate change adaptation practice measured by the adoption of three, four, and five practices significantly increases with access to institutional resources; (3) intensity of adoption of climate change adaptation practices is reduced with greater adaptation alternatives available to rice producers; and (4) lack of information and technical knowledge are the most important reasons for non-adoption of climate change adaptation practices by smallholder rice producers.

Hence in contemporary climate change research the science-policy interface takes centre stage, generating response capacity and exchanging 'usable' information with decision-makers within the framework of a transdisciplinary approach.

Local observations confirmed altered climate patterns noticeable from the changes in the planting, weeding and harvesting periods in agriculture, in tree growth, and in wind directions. Farmers still observe the intensity of East-West blowing winds, colour of the clouds in the East, and plant traits for rainfall prediction. In addition, they also rely on the meteorological information disseminated through the local radio stations. Low mastery of indigenous knowledge practices by younger community members and persistently changing weather patterns have challenged community reliance on indigenous knowledge for climate change adaptation.

These are now seen as increasingly important with the renewed focus on public health since the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reviews literature focused on the health co-benefits of urban climate change adaptation measures. Health co-benefits of seven different categories of adaptation measures are discussed. Results showed that existing evidence is mainly related to some categories such as critical infrastructure, nature-based solutions, and urban planning and design measures. Other adaptation categories like early warning systems; policy, management & governance, including local adaptation policies; and measures and strategies related to 'knowledge, perceptions & behavior' that mainly involve people's understanding and individual responses to climate change, are relatively underexplored. Moreover, it was discussed that some adaptation measures may result in health trade-offs and these needs to be further studied. Overall, through identifying health co-benefits, results of this review can make a strong case for further promotion of climate change adaptation in cities.","[Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Hiroshima, Japan; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Network Educ & Res Peace & Sustainabil NERPS, Hiroshima, Japan; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Adv Sci & Engn, Hiroshima, Japan; [Pathak, Minal; Joshi, Chaitali] Ahmedabad Univ, Global Ctr Environm & Energy, Commerce Six Rd, Ahmadabad 380009, Gujarat, India; [Joshi, Chaitali] Maharaja Sayajirao Univ Baroda, Dept Architecture, Vadodara 390002, Gujarat, India; [He, Bao-Jie] Chongqing Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [He, Bao-Jie] Chongqing Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab New Technol Construct Cities Mt Area, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China",Hiroshima University; Hiroshima University; Hiroshima University; Ahmedabad University; Maharaja Sayajirao University Baroda; Chongqing University; Chongqing University,"Pathak, M (corresponding author), Ahmedabad Univ, Global Ctr Energy & Environm, GICT Bldg,Cent Campus, Ahmadabad 380009, Gujarat, India.",sharifi@hiroshima-u.ac.jp; minal.pathak@ahduni.edu.in,"He, Bao-jie/ABC-5621-2020; He, Baojie/J-4430-2019; Sharifi, Ayyoob/M-7584-2013","He, Bao-jie/0000-0002-8841-0711; He, Baojie/0000-0002-8841-0711; Sharifi, Ayyoob/0000-0002-8983-8613; Pathak, Minal/0000-0002-9474-0485",,,,,160,24,24,34,84,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

This paper takes stock of respective institutional innovations at the national level in 10 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It first introduces four challenges that are key in the context of climate adaptation policy-making, that is, (i) how to better integrate adaptation policies horizontally across policy sectors and (ii) vertically across jurisdictional levels, (iii) how to integrate knowledge, and (iv) how to involve non-state stakeholders in adaptation policy-making. Based on a desk research and semi-structured interviews, this paper then highlights a variety of institutional innovations (here referred to as governance approaches) that the selected governments employ to address these four challenges. Overall, it is shown that most of these approaches are restricted to soft, voluntary ways of coordination and steering that often address more than one of the four challenges at a time and that national adaptation strategies usually mark the centrepiece of adaptation governance around which other governance approaches emerge.","[Bauer, Anja; Feichtinger, Judith; Steurer, Reinhard] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy InFER, Dept Econ & Social Sci, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Steurer, R (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy InFER, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",reinhard.steurer@boku.ac.at,"Bauer, Anja/X-5362-2019","Feichtinger, Judith/0000-0002-5860-5155; Steurer, Reinhard/0000-0002-5000-7046; Bauer, Anja/0000-0003-2197-1925",,,,,68,106,104,2,67,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-908X,1522-7200,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

Interdisciplinary growth has the potential to introduce new methods and insights, but it could also cause fragmentation and hamper methodological development or limit transfer of academic insights to climate change adaptation practice. This article uses qualitative content, bibliometric, and citation network analyses to systematically review the scope, methods, and findings of 276 studies on adaptive capacity of social and social-ecological systems. The review demonstrates that adaptive capacity research is highly interdisciplinary; covers a wide range of sectors, geographic locations, and scales of analysis; and is highly fragmented. The majority of empirical studies are isolated by lack of comparative work and cross-field citation. Forty-six percent of studies reviewed do not cite prior works on adaptive capacity: even those on similar topics in the same geographic location. Methods to assess adaptive capacity have proliferated to include more than 64 indicator-based indices or frameworks and 37 proxy outcome measures. The article argues that lack of either consensus or debate across the literature raises concerns that scientific progress in the field may be constrained and the ability of adaptive capacity research to inform adaptation practice may be limited. To promote consistency and transparency in future work, 158 determinants of adaptive capacity are defined and illustrated with common assessment indicators and examples. Additional opportunities for progress are noted with suggestions for future research.

Ongoing population growth and development in highly urbanised coastal areas will exacerbate the predicted impacts on coastal settlements. Improving the adaptation potential of highly vulnerable coastal communities will require greater levels of planning and policy integration across sectors and scales. However, to date, there is little evidence in the literature which demonstrates how climate policy integration is being achieved. This paper contributes to this gap in knowledge by drawing on the example provided by the process of developing cross-sectoral climate change adaptation policies and programmes generated for three coastal settlement types as part of the South East Queensland Climate Adaptation Research Initiative (SEQCARI), a 3-year multi-sectoral study of climate change adaptation options for human settlements in South East Queensland, Australia. In doing so, we first investigate the benefits and challenges to cross-sectoral adaptation to address climate change broadly and in coastal areas. We then describe how cross-sectoral adaptation policies and programmes were generated and appraised involving the sectors of urban planning and management, coastal management, emergency management, human health and physical infrastructure as part of SEQCARI. The paper concludes by discussing key considerations that can inform the development and assessment of cross-sectoral climate change adaptation policies and programmes in highly urbanised coastal areas.","[Serrao-Neumann, S.; Crick, F.; Sano, M.; Sahin, O.; van Staden, R.; Schuch, G.; Baum, S.; Low Choy, D.] Griffith Univ, Sci Environm Engn & Technol Grp, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Harman, B.] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Griffith University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Serrao-Neumann, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sci Environm Engn & Technol Grp, Nathan Campus, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",s.serrao-neumann@griffith.edu.au,"Harman, Ben P/C-7171-2011; Sahin, Oz/HLG-7805-2023","Serrao-Neumann, Silvia/0000-0001-9601-4914; van Staden, Rudi/0000-0002-7339-7702; Baum, Scott/0000-0003-1711-2087; Sahin, Oz/0000-0002-1914-5379",,,,,53,31,32,2,46,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

However, climate change has a distinct local reality-since the way such change is perceived and addressed is linked with the local people and their practices. Although climate change largely affects the lives of the local poor, certain positive effects may also occur for those marginalized people. In other words, many of the indigenous peoples have an adaptive capacity to deal with climate change. Therefore, climate change adaptation has now increasingly gained prominence. In this context, this paper will investigate the impact of climate change at the local level and explain how an indigenous and vulnerable population, the Konda Reddis, respond to such change through cultural adaptation. The paper will focus on the cultural significance of the jeelugu (fishtail palm, Caryota urens) and Konda Reddis' shift from the jeelugu to the tati (palmyra palm, Borassus flabellifera). I will argue that such a shift is an indication of an adaptation to climate change. I will also maintain that though climate change plays a dominant role in stimulating such adaptation, certain other factors also interact with climatic factors in the adaptation.","[Kodirekkala, Koteswara Rao] Univ Hyderabad, Dept Anthropol, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",University of Hyderabad,"Kodirekkala, KR (corresponding author), Univ Hyderabad, Dept Anthropol, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.",kkorao@gmail.com,,"Kodirekkala, Koteswara Rao/0000-0002-7899-731X","University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi","University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India)","This article is a revised version of the paper, Cultural Adaptations to Climate Change: A Case study of the Konda Reddi of Andhra Pradesh, presented at the International Seminar on Anthropology and Global Climate Change: Local Knowledge, Cultural Adaptation and Resilience among the Indigenous Peoples, held at the Department of Anthropology, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India during 15th - 16th February, 2016.

Based on transaction costs economics, this paper explores the role of so-called integrative and segregative institutions in the way local administrations adapt - whether their different functional branches respond to climate change collectively rather than independently. Through a comparative analysis of 19 climate-sensitive local administrations in Germany, the paper shows that variation in the way local administrations structure their internal coordination determines the way they approach climate adaptation. Under integrative institutions, local administrations adjust prior coordination structures to accommodate adaptation. Under segregative institutions, administrations move towards integrative institutions in order to adapt, provided they already feel' climate change.","[Roggero, Matteo] Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Berlin, Germany; [Thiel, Andreas] Univ Kassel, Int Agr Policy & Environm Governance, Kassel, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Universitat Kassel,"Roggero, M (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Berlin, Germany.",matteo.mancini.roggero@gmail.com; thiel@uni-kassel.de,,,German Ministry for Education and Research within the econCCadapt project [FKZ 01LA1137B],German Ministry for Education and Research within the econCCadapt project,This research was funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research within the econCCadapt project (grant number FKZ 01LA1137B).

Yet for cities in low-income countries, the value of these urban landscapes in climate change response strategies is often disregarded and remains largely unexploited and unaccounted for. This paper discusses the potential role of urban green landscapes as a soft engineering climate change response strategy, and calls for the pursuance of management practices that preserve and promote the use of these urban spaces. It does so by combining theoretical arguments with an empirical example based on an innovative and novel approach to landscape rehabilitation, the Lafarge Ecosystems Programme, in the coastal city of Mombasa, Kenya. The paper finds that a well-managed system of green landscapes in resource-poor urban areas can generate net social benefits under a range of future scenarios. It further finds that climate change adaptation and mitigation responses can be initiated by a range of stakeholders operating at all scales.","[Kithiia, Justus] Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Lyth, Anna] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",Macquarie University; University of Tasmania,"Kithiia, J (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",justus.kithiia@mq.edu.au; anna.lyth@utas.edu.au,,,,,,,57,42,45,4,67,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

Understanding and using climate change information to advance the implementation of climate-friendly policies further compounds this challenge. A rich scholarly literature focusing on climate change adaptation endorses that investing in mechanisms that narrow the gap between climate change information production and its use is crucial to increase adaptive capacity. Based on this assumption, this paper investigates the extent to which two collaborative projects that functioned as boundary organisations in Brazil (CiAdapta project) and Australia (Climate Change Adaptation for Natural Resource Management in East Coast Australia) increased access to information, and enabled the continual and continuous usefulness of produced knowledge for climate change adaptation. Considering the distinction between usable and useful information, we applied six criteria to guide the data analysis and extract key lessons from each project. Our findings confirm that face-to-face interactions are more likely to result in research having the societal impact that is being increasingly required by research and funding bodies. Our findings also indicate that two key systemic changes are critical for the long-term influence of boundary organisations for advancing climate change adaptation.

The BRI can be seen as a system for supplying global public goods, including sustainable development within which issues related to climate change sit. A great many small island states and territories are participating in the BRI, particularly in its constituent 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road. However, the BRI has not yet placed sufficient focus on climate change adaptation or issues specific to small islands. Furthermore, the BRI's conceptual basis in rhetoric of mutual dependence and a community of common destiny have not always been evident in the individual activities that have been carried out within the BRI. If the BRI's goals are to be taken seriously, it must do more to focus on the needs and perspectives of island communities, particularly with regard to climate change adaptation.

Local actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change are essential for stabilization of the global climate and can also help to address other urban ecological problems such as pollution, decreasing biodiversity, etc. Companies are important urban actors in the development of low-carbon cities because they provide a multitude of goods and services to city populations and directly influence urban carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This is a new area of research. While studies on corporate sustainability are numerous, there is little, if any, existing research that examines the role of companies in climate change adaptation and mitigation within specific urban areas. Urban ecologists also have not examined how corporate activity affects urban systems. Taking a multi-disciplinary systems approach, we present a conceptual model of the role of companies in managing urban interactions with the climate system.

Therefore, it is widely recommended businesses respond to climate change and implement climate change adaptation. Worldwide, businesses make efforts towards climate change adaptation, but investigation on such efforts is still required. To partially fill this research gap, the paper explores businesses adaptation efforts in the Hunter Valley, Australia. The paper collects primary data from open-ended interviews to 10 representatives of local businesses and supporting organizations. The paper reveals that businesses interpret climate change in different ways. While some businesses are sceptical about climate change, others are aware of it and its impacts on everyday operations. Businesses therefore implement adaptation by integrating climate change into everyday operations and continuity planning. The paper also shows diverse interactions occurring between businesses and other local stakeholders such as governments and communities. Usually, higher government levels offer vague and limited support to businesses and inhibit their adaptive efforts. Meanwhile, interactions between businesses and City Councils can be both collaborative and fragmented. Some businesses also interact with local communities by disclosing information about their operations and response to climate change. The paper discusses these findings and provides conclusions under the form of recommendations for policy and research on Australian businesses and climate change adaptation.","[Forino, Giuseppe] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Forino, Giuseppe] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [von Meding, Jason] Florida Inst Built Environm Resilience FIBER, ME Rinker Sr Sch Construct Management, 1480 Inner Rd, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",University of East Anglia; University of Newcastle,"Forino, G (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;Forino, G (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",g.forino@gmail.com,,,University of Newcastle,University of Newcastle,"The Authors would like to thank research participants for their time and availability, and the reviewers for their comments that contributed to improve the quality of the paper.

Mdantsane case study as one of the largest townships in South Africa was assessed as a unique landscape with reminiscent of apartheid legacies to improve the people's climate change adaptation under urban poverty, lack of basic facilities and other environmental challenges. In keeping with a case study design, we collected data making use of pretested open and close-ended survey forms with an interplay of GIS and remote sensing techniques. This study reveals that Mdantsane is extremely susceptible to the impacts of climate change due to their built-up and natural environment set up as well as the existing interrelations. Thus, comprehensive integration of spatial planning is essential for proofing, health, wellbeing and resilience. Consequently, recommendations to seek strategic intervention and planning were made to sustain adaptation of residents to climate change in the future with specific focus to reduce climate and environmental risks in Mdantsane Township.","[Busayo, Emmanuel Tolulope; Kalumba, Ahmed Mukalazi; Orimoloye, Israel Ropo] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Private Bag X1314, ZA-5700 Alice, Eastern Cape Pr, South Africa",University of Fort Hare,"Busayo, ET (corresponding author), Univ Ft Hare, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Private Bag X1314, ZA-5700 Alice, Eastern Cape Pr, South Africa.",etobusayo@yahoo.com; amkalumba@gmail.com; orimoloyeisrael@gmail.com,"Orimoloye, Israel R./AAW-1778-2020","Orimoloye, Israel R./0000-0001-5058-2799; Busayo, Emmanuel Tolulope/0000-0002-9274-2145; Kalumba, Ahmed Mukalazi/0000-0001-7593-9096",,,,,53,20,21,2,21,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0197-3975,1873-5428,,HABITAT INT,Habitat Int.,AUG,2019,90,,,,,,,,101978,10.1016/j.habitatint.2019.04.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2019.04.005,,,9,Development Studies; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Development Studies; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration; Urban Studies,IQ3RM,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000480668800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Investing proactively in climate adaptation of transport infrastructure is paramount to providing resilience and sustainable transport systems that may promote social and economic growth. Despite the importance of such investments, the financial resources of many road administrations are constrained, creating an urgent need to allocate these resources efficiently to capture the highest social, environmental, and economic benefits. This paper aims to tackle this issue by presenting a methodology to prioritize climate change adaptation interventions based on a set of economic, social, and risk reduction criteria. This method uses a network-wide approach to the road system in order to capture co-benefits, redundancies, and costs of disruption of road segments due to flood events. All underlying data in each of the criteria is part of a geospatial database that includes the location of agriculture, fishery production areas, high poverty, and flood maps.

We do this through a qualitative case study in Copenhagen with interconnected research rounds, including 32 semi structured interviews, to strengthen the interpretation and analysis of qualitative data. We find that the term climate change adaptation currently has no clearly agreed definition in Copenhagen; instead, different actors use different conceptualizations of climate change adaptation according to the characteristics of their specific innovation and implementation projects. However, there is convergence among actors towards a new cognitive paradigm, whereby economic goals and multifunctionality are linked with cost-benefit analyses for adapting to extreme rain events on a surface water catchment scale. Differences in definitions can lead to both successful innovation and to conflict, and thus they affect the city's capacity for change. Our empirical work suggests that climate change adaptation can be characterized according to three attributes: event magnitudes (everyday, design, and extreme), spatial scales (small/local, medium/urban, and large/national-international), and (a wide range of) goals, thereby resulting in different technology choices.

While this goal responds to calls to strengthen global governance of adaptation, it has not yet been operationalized. Further, few studies take stock of current global adaptation governance to inform the implementation of the goal. Against this background this review asks: To what extent is there global governance of climate change adaptation? Can it be characterized as a strong domain of global governance? In what ways is it contested? Global adaptation governance is defined here as occurring when state and non-state actors in the global (including transnational) sphere authoritatively and intentionally shape the actions of constituents towards climate change adaptation as a public goal. Although empirical evidence is scant, it is proposed here that global adaptation governance is indeed emerging. Yet, its further strengthening appears contested. First, measurement of progress towards adaptation as a public goal at the global level is severely challenged by the ambiguity of adaptation and the lack of distinct metrics. Second, the lack of a clear global-level problem-framing, or recognition of adaptation as a global public good, has meant limited legitimacy of global governance initiatives. A consequence of contestation is that governance forms and functions used so far have not been authoritative in how they seek to shape actions. The review concludes by identifying research needs for advancing science and policy on adaptation.

This framing of gender persists in spite of established bodies of knowledge that show how roles and responsibilities that influence a person's ability to deal with climate-induced and other stressors emerge at the intersection of diverse identity categories, including but not limited to gender, age, seniority, ethnicity, marital status, and livelihoods.

It is, therefore, crucial to understand whether there exists a gender gap in climate change adaptation and investigate the factors explaining the gap to reduce the vulnerability of the farming households to surging climatic risks. Using data from 2279 farm households in Ethiopia and applying a multivariate probit model and exogenous switching treatment effect regression method, this study examines the existing gender gap in climate change adaptations among farmers in Ethiopia and factors contributing to this relationship. The results show a significant gender gap in climate change adaptation in farming households due to the differences in both observable and unobservable characteristics of male- and female-headed households. It indicates that reducing the gap can enhance climate change adaptation by female-headed households by almost 19%. Women's workload in household chores significantly reduces their likelihood to adopt climate change adaptation measures. Therefore, unless policies proposed target institutional factors, including social and cultural barriers, traditional gender norms and division of labor, and other intrinsic behavioral issues, addressing only observed characteristics may not fully address the gender gap. To bring about transformational changes in the existing gender norms and social attitudes, long-term gender-informed policies are essential, along with short-term projects, to address the gender gap in climate change adaptation through the provision of equitable opportunities for all.","[Aryal, Jeetendra Prakash; Rahut, Dil Bahadur] Asian Dev Bank Inst ADBI, Tokyo, Japan; [Aryal, Jeetendra Prakash; Sapkota, Tek Bahadur] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Texcoco, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Gartaula, Hom Nath] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, New Delhi, India; [Stirling, Clare] Mondelez Int, Cocoa Life, London, England",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Mondelez International,"Aryal, JP; Rahut, DB (corresponding author), Asian Dev Bank Inst ADBI, Tokyo, Japan.;Aryal, JP; Sapkota, TB (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Texcoco, Estado De Mexic, Mexico.",jeetenaryal@gmail.com; t.sapkota@cgiar.org; drahut@adbi.org,,"Aryal, Jeetendra/0000-0002-9128-5739; Rahut, Dil Bahadur/0000-0002-7505-5271; Gartaula, Hom Nath/0000-0002-9851-6421",CCAFS,CCAFS,CCAFS,,93,0,0,9,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0165-0203,1477-8947,,NAT RESOUR FORUM,Nat.

Sweden is one of Europe's most densely-forested countries, with this sector playing a major role economically. However adaptation has, to a large extent, been limited to the provision of recommendations to forest managers, most of which have only been partially implemented. This paper summarizes research with direct implications for adaptation to climate change within the forestry sector in Sweden. The focus is based in particular on providing examples of adaptations that illustrate the specific Swedish orientation to adaptation, in line with its relatively intensive forest management system. The paper thus illustrates a specific Swedish orientation to adaptation through active management, which can be contrasted with approaches to adaptation in other forestry systems, in particular those with limited management or management based on maintaining natural forests in particular.","[Keskitalo, E.

Past research on climate change adaptation in Vietnam has highlighted that climatic stresses and challenges faced by populations vary across the country. In this study, we are interested to know if autonomous responses also vary, depending on which stress individuals are responding to. To answer this question, we use primary-collected data of 1,306 individuals from the Mekong River Delta, Central Vietnam, and the Red River Delta. Adaptation choices of these individuals are analyzed at two levels: the household-level and the agricultural-level. We estimate multivariate probit models by Geweke-Hajivassilou-Keane (GHK) simulated maximum likelihood methods. Our results show that climate change adaptations vary depending on which stresses individuals are responding to. At the household level, droughts and floods have the strongest effect on climate change adaptation. However, adaptations at the agricultural level depend more on the impacts of the stress and less so on the climatic strss itself. Understanding what climatic stresses are already eliciting a response, and what adaptations are being used by individuals, is invaluable for designing successful climate change policies. This understanding can also help policymakers identify where gaps exist in individual climate change adaptations and fill these gaps with a public response.","[McKinley, Justin D.; LaFrance, Jeffrey T.] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [McKinley, Justin D.] Univ Melbourne, Nossal Inst Global Hlth, Hlth Unit 1, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Pede, Valerien O.] Int Rice Res Inst, Impact Evaluat Policy & Foresight Unit, Los Banos, Philippines",Monash University; University of Melbourne; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"McKinley, JD (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.;McKinley, JD (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Nossal Inst Global Hlth, Hlth Unit 1, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",justin.mckinley@unimelb.edu.au,,"McKinley, Justin/0000-0003-3637-2597",CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements,CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements(CGIAR),"This research was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Programs Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS), and RICE which are carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

In policy debates about climate change adaptation, framing the adaptation issue is a challenge with potentially far-reaching implications for the shape and success of adaptation projects. From the available literature on how the meaning of climate change adaptation is constructed and debated, three key dimensions of frame differences were identified: (1) the tension between adaptation and mitigation as two contrasting but interrelated perspectives on climate change; (2) the contrast between framing climate change adaptation as a tame technical problem, and framing climate change as a wicked problem of governance; and (3) the framing of climate change adaptation as a security issue, contrasting state security frames with human security frames. It is argued that the study of how climate change adaptation gets framed could be enriched by connecting these dimensions more closely with the following themes in framing research: (1) how decision-making biases that to framing issues as structured technical problems; (2) the process of scale framing by which issues are situated at a particular scale level; and (3) the challenge of dealing with the variety of frames in adaptation processes.

The commercial port sector is a highly relevant study focus with its pivotal roles in supply chains and international trade. Hence, it is important to investigate whether the port planning system and practice is appropriate in tackling climate change impacts. But beforehand, we must thoroughly understand the attitude and behaviors of port planners and operators on ports' climate adaptation planning. Through a survey towards 21 ports (seaports and dry ports) in Canada, the paper investigates the attitude and behaviors of port planners and operators on ports' climate adaptation planning. Towards the end, we propose a new approach so as to enable port stakeholders to carry out climate adaptation planning effectively. The paper offers important insight to researchers to investigate the ways in developing effective climate adaptation plans and practice for ports and other business sectors.","[Ng, Adolf K.

The water-supply system depending on the Aidoghmoush reservoir is simulated using the climate-change projections. The water-supply system simulations are ranked with two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods according to their suitability for satisfying agricultural water demands and sustain cropping patterns. These are the multi-criteria optimization and compromise resolution (VIKOR) and the Fuzzy Order Weighted Average (FOWA) MCDM methods.

This paper makes policy recommendations to address climate change and sea level rise challenges in small island developing states. Using Barbados as a case study, the paper found that innovations in policies and projects have offset the past ills of mass tourism and fortuitously now serve as pre-emptive measures in adapting to climate change. The array of methods for combating these changes includes physical planning policies, integrated coastal zone management, and infrastructure projects. Among the key areas for policy innovation are the adoption of protection, accommodation, and retreat strategies, which are informed by rigorous cost-benefit analysis and stakeholder consultation. Ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change is also necessary, especially for islands where coral reef protection is urgent. Moreover, policy adjustments are required on building construction, water resources management, sewage treatment, coastal zone management, physical planning, and land management. Institutional constraints, including the lack of capacity to implement, monitor, and enforce measures, must also be addressed if progress is to be made in adapting to climate change. A major conclusion is that the severity of coastal damage, the importance of tourism to sustainable development, and the country's adaptive capacity play a key part in the selection and implementation of climate change adaptation measures.","Univ W Indies, Dept Geomat Engn & Land Management, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine,"Mycoo, M (corresponding author), Univ W Indies, Dept Geomat Engn & Land Management, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",michelle.mycoo@sta.uwi.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,36,34,34,4,105,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0165-0203,1477-8947,,NAT RESOUR FORUM,Nat.

The results shed light on how adaptation measures and investments influence housing values and local real estate markets with respect to their place-based and local forms of implementation. Numerous quantitative approaches, with the use of geospatial data, panel-data hedonic regressions, and difference-in-differences analyses, are used to examine changes in property values associated with climate adaptation measures and the dynamics of risk perception. The results also signal how risk perception and hurricane characteristics are reflected in housing markets, thereby shedding light on the effects of anticipatory and reactive adaptation strategies on property values in these coastal communities.

Mauritius, as a Small Island State, is disproportionately affected by climate change, primarily due to its exposure to impacts, as well as various constraints in size and resources. Identifying and integrating local capacity needs into recommendations for policy measures is therefore urgently required to support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its National Adaptation Plan process. This study carries out a local governance assessment based on evaluative criteria to identify local capacity needs for implementing climate change adaptation in Mauritius. Results from the assessment indicate that local governance suffers from issues inherent to Small Island States, such as lack of technical know-how, financial and human resources, stringent legislation and effective monitoring mechanisms, preventing effective climate change adaptation. Through participatory, bottom-up stakeholder engagement with local and national government representatives, eight recommendations for policy formulation were then co-developed to address the identified capacity needs, and to improve cooperation between local and national institutions for more effective implementation of climate change adaptation. Key policy insights Local climate change adaptation needs have to be integrated into policy formulation for an effective response to climate change impacts. Roles and responsibilities of government levels for climate change adaptation in Mauritius are currently in need of clarification. Capacity building measures at the local level for implementing climate change actions from national government are urgently required. Stringent legislation and effective monitoring mechanisms need to be implemented to ensure planning regulations are adhered to. Increased collaboration between local and national levels of government in Mauritius is necessary for synthesizing a common approach to climate change adaptation.","[Williams, David Samuel; Celliers, Louis] HZG, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany; [Rosendo, Sergio] Nova Univ Lisbon NOVA FCSH, Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci CICS NOVA, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Lisbon, Portugal; [Sadasing, Oocheetsing] MOI, Albion, Mauritius",,"Williams, DS (corresponding author), HZG, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany.",david.williams@hzg.de,"Celliers, Louis/GRO-6282-2022; Williams, David Samuel/ABD-7998-2020; Celliers, Louis/AAP-7650-2021","Celliers, Louis/0000-0001-5096-1713; Celliers, Louis/0000-0001-5096-1713; Rosendo, Sergio/0000-0002-3095-9824; /0000-0002-1418-589X",Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association's (WIOMSA) Marine Science for Management (MASMA) [MASMA/OP/2013/01],Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association's (WIOMSA) Marine Science for Management (MASMA),This research was funded by the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association's (WIOMSA) Marine Science for Management (MASMA) grant MASMA/OP/2013/01.,,74,16,16,9,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Federal agencies have continued to implement these and other climate-related executive orders. This article examines recent legal developments to summarize the United States' current policy approach to climate change adaptation, especially as such developments affect marine sector. Despite the natural tendency to focus on the federal government-and there have indeed been improvements in federal adaptation policy since the Biden Administration took office-this article also argues that focusing solely on the federal government reveals only one facet of important developments in the United States' climate adaptation policy. Instead, this article acknowledges and illuminates the pluralistic and federalistic structure of United States governance, concluding that much climate adaptation work occurs within tribes and through state and local governments, regardless of who sits in the Oval Office.","[Craig, Robin Kundis] Univ Southern Calif, Gould Sch Law, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",University of Southern California,"Craig, RK (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Gould Sch Law, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",rcraig@law.usc.edu,,,,,,,34,0,0,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Design/methodology/approach The metropolis was stratified into low, medium and high residential densities. Across the residential densities, questionnaires were administered on 384 residents. The questionnaire addressed issues on resident's socio-economic and demographic attributes, awareness of climate change and factors influencing residents' adaptation to climate change. Data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings Result indicated that the adaptation strategies adopted by residents in the different residential areas were similar but varied in magnitude as denoted by the resident response index RRI (RRIh = 3.32, RRIm = 3.39 and RRIl = 3.41). The multiple regression analysis computed indicated the residential characteristics such as education, average monthly income, age, house type and house ownership (p < 0.05) were significant factors influencing resident's level of climate change adaptation strategies adopted. Research limitations/implications The study could be strengthened by looking at specific climate change effects such as floods or drought in major cities of Nigeria. Hence, the view presented in this paper may not be considered generalizable to the impacts of climate change in the study area. Originality/value In recent years, research studies on human adaptation and coping strategies to climate change have generated considerable development interest.

Past efforts to build local capacity, however, have often been unsuccessful. Building municipal capacity to formulate and implement climate adaptation plans will, in our view, require a new approach. Special attention will need to be paid to (1) contingent financial arrangements; (2) widespread and continuous stakeholder engagement; and (3) a commitment to experimental problem-solving. Most important, to respond to the scientific and technical uncertainties surrounding climate risks, local governments will have to enhance their 'adaptive governance' capabilities. Key policy insights Building local capacity to adapt to climate change is likely to require moving beyond traditional forms of financial and technical assistance so that the uncertainties and complexities of climate change can be addressed. We suggest a new three-pronged approach to municipal capacity building. The first element of this new approach will require structuring financial investments in a more adaptable (i.e. contingent) fashion. The second will involve widespread and continuous stakeholder engagement, both for coalition building and for public learning. The third encourages an experimental approach to problem-solving so that communities can learn-by-doing.","[Susskind, Lawrence; Kim, Amber] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Kim, A (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",susskind@mit.edu,,,,,,,74,9,9,6,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

We answer three primary research questions: First, how are states planning for climate change? Second, who are states targeting for climate adaptation? Third, what tools are states using to motivate climate adaptation efforts? We develop and implement a coding scheme using Schneider and Ingram's Social Construction Framework (SCF) to characterize variation in 2033 individual adaptation goals mentioned in all 14 American states with explicit adaptation plans. We use these data to understand the types of tools used to motivate different actors (governmental, private, nonprofit) to adapt to climate change. We find that the most frequent target of state adaptation planning is the state itself, which provides an opportunity to extend the SCF to a target group often not mentioned in public policy. Specifically, we find that states target themselves with mandates or tools designed to acquire information. Other stakeholders in adaptation are more likely to be the targets of capacity building tools. Private actors are the only population more likely to be targeted by incentives. The project expands the Social Construction Framework to include targets and tools of planning efforts. Practically, our article offers a methodology by which to compare the vastly heterogeneous efforts to adapt to climate change at the subnational level.","[Koski, Chris] Reed Coll, Environm Studies & Polit Sci, Portland, OR 97202 USA; [Keating, Megan] Reed Coll, Portland, OR 97202 USA",Reed College - Oregon; Reed College - Oregon,"Koski, C (corresponding author), Reed Coll, Environm Studies & Polit Sci, Portland, OR 97202 USA.",,,,Bernard Goldhammer Summer Collaborative Research Grant Program at Reed College,Bernard Goldhammer Summer Collaborative Research Grant Program at Reed College,This work was partially supported by the Bernard Goldhammer Summer Collaborative Research Grant Program at Reed College.,,75,9,9,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1541-132X,1541-1338,,REV POLICY RES,Rev.

The importance of expediting these climate change-related adaptation measures was highlighted by a string of geo-meteorological-related disasters, specifically triggered by landslides and floods consequent to Typhoon Parma that hit the country in 2009. We present the geologic conditions that rendered the affected areas, especially in northwestern Luzon, extremely vulnerable to the existent hazards, the meteorological-conditions-that set off the-disaster and the different initiatives that the government and local communities have taken to further prepare the people for possible future disasters. Recognition of the pertinent issues and the extant challenges points to the urgent need for mainstreaming both geo-meteorological-related disaster risk management and climate change adaptation measures in the light of changing climate conditions.","[Faustino-Eslava, Decibel V.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Sch Environm Sci & Management, College Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines; [Dimalanta, Carla B.] Univ Philippines, Natl Inst Geol Sci, Rushurgent Working Grp, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Yumul, Graciano P., Jr.] Monte Oro Resources & Energy Inc, Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines; [Servando, Nathaniel T.] Philippine Atmospher, Geophys & Astron Serv Adm, Dept Sci & Technol, Quezon City, Philippines; [Cruz, Nathaniel A.] GMA Network Ctr, GMA Network News, Quezon City, Philippines","University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; Department of Science & Technology (DOST), Philippines","Faustino-Eslava, DV (corresponding author), Univ Philippines Los Banos, Sch Environm Sci & Management, College Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines.",dei_faustino@yahoo.com,"Dimalanta, Carla/AAB-8566-2021",,,,,,55,7,8,2,51,"UNIV PHILIPPINES LOS BANOS, COLLEGE",LAGUNA,"SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & MANAGEMENT, LAGUNA, 4031, PHILIPPINES",0119-1144,,,J ENVIRON SCI MANAG,J.

Political capital is studied through power distribution, voice, and connection in three rural villages in Java, Indonesia. This study finds that rural communities with a more distributed power structure are more likely to take the initiative to mobilize efforts by using their own resources to cope and adapt to climate change. Analysis with binary-logistic regression shows that social capital is a better predictor in the exercise of political capital than human capital. While the act of giving gifts to neighbors is associated with more community activism, receiving gifts from neighbors and membership in community groups tend to lower the activism.","[Utami, Arini Wahyu] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Socioecon, Jalan Flora 1 Bulaksumur, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia; [Cramer, Lori A.] Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Corvallis, OR USA",Gadjah Mada University; Oregon State University,"Utami, AW (corresponding author), Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Socioecon, Jalan Flora 1 Bulaksumur, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia.",ariniwu@ugm.ac.id,"Utami, Arini/AAF-3208-2021","Utami, Arini/0000-0001-6379-8492",Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research through Sasakawa Young Leader Fellowship Fund,Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research through Sasakawa Young Leader Fellowship Fund,We are grateful for the funding support from The Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research through Sasakawa Young Leader Fellowship Fund that made the research in Indonesia possible.,,56,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1557-5330,1944-7485,,COMMUNITY DEV,Community Dev.,,2020,51,5,,,,,556,574,,10.1080/15575330.2020.1804956,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15575330.2020.1804956,,,19,Development Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Development Studies,RO4SH,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000641034300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given the rapid and widespread urbanization occurring throughout sub-Saharan Africa, in particular Malawi, these challenges will be increasingly concentrated in cities. However, climate change and sustainable development policies in Malawi focus largely on rural areas. As a consequence, the new environmental and demographic challenges facing cities and the clear and immediate need for spatial planning are not addressed. This paper draws on current literature to make the linkages between climate change adaptation and spatial planning and to investigate the potential of densification and disaster risk management as adaptation measures. However, policy gaps, the acute shortages of trained land professionals and arrested political decentralization remain significant challenges for policy implementation. The recommendations outlined in this paper are intended to inform more appropriate adaptations over the long term by identifying where further research is required and by identifying specific actions that can be taken by policymakers to improve Malawi's planned adaptation in urban areas. Due to the lack of research that exists on climate change adaptation from an urban perspective in Malawi, this paper is intended to provoke wider discussions of this subject across the planning, development and environmental management community.

However, how private companies build resilience and reduce damage to their private goods remains underexplored. Since climate change involves high levels of uncertainty and complexity, companies seeking to proactively adapt to climate change are required to search for specific and nontraditional knowledge. In order to contribute to this discussion, we investigated how a community of practice promotes social learning for AACC. We access the social learning emerging from the community of practice by developing a framework that can also be applied to other complex problems faced by companies. We found evidence of the centrality of social learning for the development of strategies and practices addressing grand corporate challenges, such as AACC.

This paper illustrates a systematic analysis of climate change adaptation in the Guadiana irrigation farming region. The study applies a solution-oriented diagnostic framework structured along a series of sequential analytical steps. An initial stage integrates economic and hydrologic modeling to evaluate the effects of climate change on the agriculture and water sectors. Next, adaptation measures are identified and prioritized through a stakeholder-based multi-criteria analysis. Finally, a social network analysis identifies key actors and their relationships in climate change adaptation. The study shows that under a severe climate change scenario, water availability could be substantially decreased and drought occurrence will augment. In consequence, farmers will adapt their crops to a lesser amount of water and income gains will diminish, particularly for smallholder farms. Among the various adaptation measures considered, those related to private farming (new crop varieties and modern irrigation technologies) are ranked highest, whereas public-funded hard measures (reservoirs) are lowest and public soft measures (insurance) are ranked middle. In addition, stakeholders highlighted that the most relevant criteria for selecting adaptation plans are environmental protection, financial feasibility and employment creation. Nonetheless, the social network analysis evidenced the need to strengthen the links among the different stakeholder groups to facilitate the implementation of adaptation processes. In sum, the diagnostic framework applied in this research can be considered a valuable tool for guiding and supporting decision making in climate change adaptation and communicating scientific results.","[Varela-Ortega, Consuelo; Blanco-Gutierrez, Irene; Esteve, Paloma] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ Stat & Management, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Bharwani, Sukaina] Stockholm Environm Inst, Oxford OX2 7JT, England; [Fronzek, Stefan] Finnish Environm Inst, Helsinki 00251, Finland; [Downing, Thomas E.] Oxford Ctr Innovat, Global Climate Adaptat Partnership, Oxford OX1 1BY, England",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Finnish Environment Institute,"Varela-Ortega, C (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ Stat & Management, Av Complutense S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",consuelo.varela@upm.es; irene.blanco@upm.es; paloma.esteve@upm.es; sukaina.bharwani@sei-international.org; stefan.fronzek@ymparisto.fi; TDowning@climateadaptation.cc,"Blanco-Gutiérrez, Irene/A-4665-2013; Fronzek, Stefan/W-5724-2019; Esteve, Paloma/Y-6746-2019","Blanco-Gutiérrez, Irene/0000-0002-6105-3339; Fronzek, Stefan/0000-0003-2478-8050; Esteve, Paloma/0000-0003-1216-9156","EU project Mediation (Methodology for Effective Decision-making on Impacts and AdaptaTION, from the EC) [244012]","EU project Mediation (Methodology for Effective Decision-making on Impacts and AdaptaTION, from the EC)","The authors wish to acknowledge the EU project Mediation (Methodology for Effective Decision-making on Impacts and AdaptaTION, from the EC FP7, No. 244012) for funding this research.

As agriculture is the only source of income for most of them, agricultural adaptation with respect to climate change is vital for their sustenance and to ensure food security. In order to develop appropriate strategies and institutional responses, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the farmers' perception of climate change, actual adaptations at farm-level and what factors drive and constrain their decision to adapt. Thus, this study investigates the farm-level adaptation to climate change based on the case of a farming community in Sri Lanka. The findings revealed that farmers' perceived the ongoing climate change based on their experiences. Majority of them adopted measures to address climate change and variability. These adaptation measures can be categorised into five groups, such as crop management, land management, irrigation management, income diversification, and rituals. The results showed that management of non-climatic factors was an important strategy to enhance farmers' adaptation, particularly in a resource-constrained smallholder farming context. The results of regression analysis indicated that human cognition was an important determinant of climate change adaptation. Social networks were also found to significantly influence adaptation. The study also revealed that social barriers, such as cognitive and normative factors, are equally important as other economic barriers to adaptation. While formulating and implementing the adaptation strategies, this study underscored the importance of understanding socio-economic, cognitive and normative aspects of the local communities.","[Esham, Mohamed] Sabaragamuwa Univ Sri Lanka, Fac Agr Sci, Belihuloya, Sri Lanka; [Garforth, Chris] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England",Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka; University of Reading,"Esham, M (corresponding author), Sabaragamuwa Univ Sri Lanka, Fac Agr Sci, POB 02, Belihuloya, Sri Lanka.",mesham20021@yahoo.com; c.j.garforth@reading.ac.uk,"Esham, Mohamed/M-7169-2019; Esham, Mohamed/D-1171-2012","Esham, Mohamed/0000-0002-4498-9274; Esham, Mohamed/0000-0002-4498-9274",Commonwealth Scholarship Commission,Commonwealth Scholarship Commission,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in providing a fellowship to the first author for postdoctoral research at the University of Reading, UK.",,69,122,124,2,105,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

In Mediterranean regions, such as that in southwestern Oregon, USA, changes will likely be driven mainly by wildfire and drought. To minimize the negative effects of climate change, resource managers require tools and information to assess climate change vulnerabilities and to develop and implement adaptation actions. We developed an approach to facilitate development and implementation of climate change adaptation options in forest management. This approach, applied in a southwestern Oregon study region, involved establishment of a science-manager partnership, a science-based assessment of forest and woodland vulnerabilities to climate change, climate change education in multiple formats, hands-on development of adaptation options, and application of tools to incorporate climate change in planned projects. Through this approach, we improved local manager understanding of the potential effects of climate change in southwestern Oregon, and enabled evaluation of proposed management activities in the context of climatic stressors. Engaging managers throughout the project increased ownership of the process and outcomes, as well as the applicability of the adaptation options toe-ground actions.

Climate change is expected to compound many pressing issues affecting fisheries management. Good governance of fisheries, which is critical to building their adaptive capacity and social-ecological resilience, is seen as ever more important in the context of climate change. A range of fisheries management approaches have been developed and, to varying degrees, applied. Each has been described in the literature as a promising way to manage marine resources. Through literature reviews and a survey of practitioners, this study explores how theoretical properties of selected major management approaches (i.e., ecosystem-based management, adaptive management, co-management, adaptive co-management, and active adaptive management) enable climate change adaptation, and how such properties are perceived by practitioners to manifest in practice using an Australian marine fisheries context. Overall, the selected management approaches have the potential to enable climate change adaptation to varying degrees. Ecosystem-based management, in combination with adaptive management and co-management as nested management approaches, possesses the full array of adaptation capacities and attributes required for adaptation in fisheries. Distinctions between theory and practice observed in this study highlight the importance of practitioner perceptions and enabling institutional arrangements in adapting management to climate change.

Today, many countries, regions, and cities around the world are implementing policies and strategies to adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects. A scoping review was performed to identify tools and methods that help integrate health into climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and strategies. The literature search includes scientific and grey literature. The scientific literature was conducted using PubMed, Elsevier Embase, and Web of Science databases. A grey literature web search was performed to complement the results. A total of 35 studies (28 from the scientific literature and 7 from the grey literature) were finally included. A large majority of research articles (24/28) and almost all reports (6/7) from the grey literature were published after 2010. Results show that the tools that were found most frequently are the nested models (12/35), health impact assessment (6/35), vulnerability and adaptation assessment (3/35), conceptual frameworks (3/35), and mixed methods (3/35). This review shows an increasing interest in the topic of developing tools to better manage health issues in adaptation and mitigation strategies, with a recent increase in the number of publications.

To understand whether adaptation is progressing and is successful, some form of longitudinal tracking is required. The six adaptation conferences organised by the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility between 2010 and 2018 provide a unique and novel opportunity to track adaptation progress in Australia. Each conference was accompanied by a call for abstracts for oral or poster presentation. The submitted abstracts form the basis of the analysis in this paper. We show that, over time, the balance of attendees shifted away from researchers and towards government employees, and the proportion of attendees submitting abstracts declined. The proportion of abstracts submitted by government employees and consultants has increased at more recent conferences. When abstract content is analysed, the results show that, over time, there has been a change in the focus of abstracts with respect to the sector, type and stage of adaptation. These trends indicate maturation of adaptation in Australia, but also suggest that lack of finance for research and action is having an impact. There is evidence that adaptation in Australia is moving from being largely planning based and towards implementation. This is encouraging, given that studies throughout the world have remarked on the barriers that exist in moving from planning to action.","[Palutikof, Jean P.; Boulter, Sarah L.; Stadler, Frank; Vidaurre, Ana C.

For the purpose, the multinomial logit model has used to categories the farmer's choice adaptation strategies to climate change. Results of the study present that the number of adaptation practices has a positive association with education, family size, marital status, cultivated farm size, credit, extension service, relatives in Government, farmer to farmer extension, temperature, precipitation, insurance, information on climate and floods. Additionally, the age of the household, non-farm income, and distance to the market had a negative effect on adaptations to climate. Furthermore, results identify that respondents of the climate change adaptation practices faced some main barriers and limitations. These include lack of money, lack of information, and lack of Government support.

This paper analyses the need to adapt to climate change impacts for power generation technologies in Europe until 2100. Europe is broadly divided into four geographic climate zones, for which regional climate change impacts are quantified with the help of the ENSEMBLES RT2b data. The European future technology mix is based on two Eurelectric energy scenarios: 'Baseline 2009' and 'Power Choices'. A Risk Assessment Model is formulated which assesses the cost to power plants for adapting to climate change. The analysis shows that thermal generation units most urgently need adaptation measures against floods, whereas off-shore wind power plants would need to take adaptation investments against sea level rise. Furthermore, electricity grids need to adapt to the increased incidence of storms. Finally, hydro generation in the Mediterranean regions needs to adapt to lower levels of precipitation.

This not-yet-documented analysis serves to highlight a shifting legal landscape and the politics of coastal climate change adaptation. It also illustrates how private property rights have been used as both a sword and a shield to advance dominant interests.

Understanding how climate science can be translated into public health practice is an essential first step in enabling robust adaptation and improving resiliency to climate change.Recent FindingsRecent research highlights the importance of iterative approaches to public health adaptation to climate change, enabling uncertainties of health impacts and barriers to adaptation to be accounted for. There are still significant barriers to adaptation, which are context-specific and thus present unique challenges to public health practice. The implementation of flexible adaptation approaches, using frameworks targeted for public health, is key to ensuring robust adaptation to climate change in public health practice.SummaryThe BRACE framework provides an excellent approach for health adaptation to climate change. Combining this with the insights provided and by the adaptation pathways approach allows for more deliberate accounting of long-term uncertainties. The mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into public health practice and planning is important in facilitating this approach and overcoming the significant barriers to effective adaptation. Yet, the immediate and future limits to adaptation provide clear justification for urgent and accelerated efforts to mitigate climate change.","[Wheeler, Nicola; Watts, Nick] UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Wheeler, N (corresponding author), UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",nicola.wheeler@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,13,13,6,20,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2196-5412,,CURR ENV HLTH REP,Curr..

This means that there are multiple perspectives on adaptation; often with differing visions resulting in disconnected responses and outcomes. Combining singular perspectives into coherent, combined perspectives that include multiple needs and visions can help to deepen the understanding of various aspects of adaptation and provide more effective responses. Such combinations of perspectives can help to increase the range and variety of adaptation measures available for implementation or avoid maladaptation compared with adaptations derived from a singular perspective. The objective of this paper is to present and demonstrate a framework for structuring the local adaptation responses using the inputs from multiple perspectives. The adaptation response framing has been done by: (i) contextualizing climate change adaptation needs; (ii) analyzing drivers of change; (iii) characterizing measures of adaptation; and (iv) establishing links between the measures with a particular emphasis on taking account of multiple perspectives. This framework was demonstrated with reference to the management of flood risks in a case study Can Tho, Vietnam. The results from the case study show that framing of adaptation responses from multiple perspectives can enhance the understanding of adaptation measures, thereby helping to bring about more flexible implementation practices.","[Radhakrishnan, Mohanasundar; Pathirana, Assela; Ashley, Richard; Zevenbergen, Chris] UNESCO IHE Inst Water Educ, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands; [Radhakrishnan, Mohanasundar; Pathirana, Assela; Ashley, Richard] Cooperat Res Ctr Water Sensit Cities, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education,"Radhakrishnan, M (corresponding author), UNESCO IHE Inst Water Educ, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands.;Radhakrishnan, M (corresponding author), Cooperat Res Ctr Water Sensit Cities, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",m.radhakrishnan@unesco-ihe.org; a.pathirana@unesco-ihe.org; r.ashley@sheffield.ac.uk; c.zevenbergen@unesco-ihe.org,,"Radhakrishnan, Mohanasundar/0000-0003-3785-7713","Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities (CRC), an initiative of the Australian government; PRoACC (Post-doctoral Programme on Climate Change Adaptation in the Mekong River Basin) by The Netherlands Ministry of Development Cooperation (DGIS) through the UNESCO-IHE Partnership Research Fund; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/I029346/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/I029346/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities (CRC), an initiative of the Australian government(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); PRoACC (Post-doctoral Programme on Climate Change Adaptation in the Mekong River Basin) by The Netherlands Ministry of Development Cooperation (DGIS) through the UNESCO-IHE Partnership Research Fund; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This research was supported by two projects (1) Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities (CRC), an initiative of the Australian government.

In the European Union (EU) alone, nine countries have national plans for adaptation (with more in preparation), there are some 30 sub-national plans, and every Member State has policies to address adaptation. Given the recent attention given toward this subject a question that arises is: can climate change adaptation be considered a policy field? As a unit of analysis, policy fields are widely studied in the social sciences. However, the definition of policy fields such as environmental policy or agricultural policy is taken for granted. Oddly for such a common concept, very little attention is paid to what policy fields are in and of themselves or how they can be identified. Given these shortcomings, this article first attempts to fill this gap by theoretically defining what a policy field is by identifying and assigning their characteristics and dynamics. Based upon a literature review, it shows that policy fields are three-dimensional entities comprised of substantive authority, institutional order, and substantive expertise. The second task of this article is to apply this definition to adaptation policy activity in England and determine whether adaptation can be considered a policy field there.","[Massey, Eric; Huitema, Dave] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Massey, E (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Eric.massey@ivm.vu.nl,"Massey, Eric/L-3009-2013; Huitema, Dave/L-1343-2013","Huitema, Dave/0000-0001-8565-3200; Huitema, D./0000-0002-0139-3913",,,,,54,55,55,1,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The intertwined, complex relationship between the sector and climate change is among the unprecedented challenges now facing the European Union (EU). The complexity of the relationship calls for the establishment of a sustainable, future climate-proof, adapted and resilient sector with strong adaptive capacity. This paper argues that over the past decades, strong emphasis has been placed on how to mitigate the negative effects of climate change across the sector, causing it to fall behind in terms of adaptation. Although adaptation is now part of the sector's development agenda, sectoral adaptation performance across member states remains low. In order to justify an accelerated adaptation process across the sector, the paper develops a Relative Climate Change Adaption Index (RCCAI) for the sector based on Eurostat data. The analysis shows that there is no single member state across the EU whose agricultural sector can be considered as fully climate-adapted (resilient), and thus validates the hypothesis that adaption efforts must be stepped up across the sector. To ensure continued sectoral adaptive capacity improvement, the paper recommends coherent integration and accelerated implementation of adaptation practices and policies alongside the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for the sake of both private and public interests.","[Ndue, Kennedy Mutua; Goda, Pal] Inst Agr Econ, Zsil Utca 3-5, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",,"Ndue, KM (corresponding author), Inst Agr Econ, Zsil Utca 3-5, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",kennedy.mutua@aki.gov.hu,,"NDUE, Kennedy/0000-0003-0406-9606",,,,,111,1,1,3,14,AGRARGAZDASAGI KUTATO & INFORMATIKAI INTEZET,BUDAPEST,"ZSIL UTCA 3-5, PO BOX 5, BUDAPEST, 1355, HUNGARY",1418-2106,2063-0476,,STUD AGRIC ECON,Stud.

The recently released EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change, and Forest Strategy - all representing key pillars of the ambitious European Green Deal (EGD) - rely on NBS to both preserve and restore ecosystem integrity and increase climate resilience. Although research and policy in Europe have advanced the conceptualization and operationalization of NBS, a much wider adoption is needed to reach the ambitious goals of the EGD and fulfil its vision of transforming into a sustainable, climate-neutral, climate resilient, fair, and prosperous EU by 2050. In this paper, we review recent EU-supported research, policy, and practices to identify critical dimensions that still need to be addressed for greater uptake of NBS. While recognising the multiple societal challenges NBS can target, we build on the key messages from the '5th European Climate Change Adaptation conference ECCA 2021' and focus our analysis on NBS for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. We screen a wide range of NBS cases across the EU and identify-three core challenges to implementation: the lack of a comprehensive evidence base on the effectiveness of NBS to address targeted challenges; the need for a greater involvement of the private sector in financing NBS; and opportunities for enhancing stakeholder engagement in the successful design and implementation of NBS. We take these challenges as the starting point for a broader reflection and critical discussion on the role of i) knowledge, i) finance, including investments in NBS and divestments from nature-negative projects, and iii) governance and policy frameworks to enable the uptake of NBS. We conclude by identifying options for the EU to foster the uptake of NBS in research, policy and practice.","[Calliari, Elisa] UCL, Sch Publ Policy, Dept Polit Sci, 29-30 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H, England; [Calliari, Elisa; Mysiak, Jaroslav] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Edificio Porta Innovaz Piano 2,Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venice, Italy; [Castellari, Sergio] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Via Franceschini 31, I-40100 Bologna, Italy; [Davis, McKenna] Ecol Inst, Pfalzburger Str 43-44, D-10717 Berlin, Germany; [Linnerooth-Bayer, Joanne; Martin, Juliette] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Pastor, Teresa] EUROPARC Federat, Carretera Esglesia 92, Barcelona 08017, Spain; [Ramieri, Emiliano] Natl Res Council CNR ISMAR, Inst Marine Sci, Venice, Italy; [Scolobig, Anna] Univ Geneva, Blvd Carl Vogt 66, Geneva, Switzerland; [Sterk, Marjolein] Wageningen Environm Res, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Veerkamp, Clara] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, POB 30314, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands; [Wendling, Laura] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland Ltd, Espoo, Finland; [Zandersen, Marianne] Aarhus Univ, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Zandersen, Marianne] Aarhus Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Climate Change iClimate, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",University of London; University College London; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV); International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR-CNR); University of Geneva; Wageningen University & Research; VTT Technical Research Center Finland; Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Calliari, E (corresponding author), UCL, Sch Publ Policy, Dept Polit Sci, 29-30 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H, England.",e.calliari@ucl.ac.uk,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Wendling, Laura/A-2745-2014","Wendling, Laura/0000-0002-5728-3684","European Community [776681]; Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Security; European Environment Agency","European Community(European Commission); Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Security; European Environment Agency","This work was supported by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme through the grant to the budget of the PHUSICOS Project (https://phusicos.eu/) [grant agreement No. 776681], the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Security through support to the Wageningen University & Research Programme on `Food Security and Valuing Water' and `Circular and Climate neutral' and the European Environment Agency through support to the European Topic Centre on Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation (ETC/CCA).",,138,1,1,13,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

This paper summarizes the urban risks and vulnerabilities highlighted by the literature, and reviews central and local government responses. It then assesses policy response, including how this considers vulnerability and future risks, formulates an adaptation strategy, engages stakeholders and assesses adaptive capacity. This shows how the Chinese system limits the influence on climate change adaptation of residents and small businesses, and of social scientists. The reasons for this include the tendency to use climate change as an economic growth engine (and GDP growth remains the most important factor for assessing local government officials' performance), little provision for participation in policy-making, and weak post-implementation evaluation once a policy has been scaled up at national level. These have affected the quality of evidence-based policy-making and make it difficult to draw lessons from unsuccessful practice.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Li, BQ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Bldg 132, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",bingqin.li@anu.edu.au,"Li, Bingqin/C-5058-2017","Li, Bingqin/0000-0003-2240-0876",,,,,64,24,25,0,48,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

Although Tanzania lacks a stand alone climate policy, Tanzania's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) and National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) provide the most comprehensive statements of the central government's framing of adaptation and its priorities with regard to adaptation. In assessing discursive framings of adaptation, we find that the dominant policy discourse constructs an anti-politics of adaptation through its framing of climate change as an urgent and generalized threat to development while failing sufficiently to address the complex governance and social equity dimensions of climate change adaptation. The technocratic prescriptions of Tanzania's NAPA and NCSS converge with similar prescriptions found in Tanzania's national development policies, such as the major agricultural development initiative Kilimo Kwanza. Adaptation challenges identified by communities in Mwanga District demonstrate complex local institutional and resource tenure questions that are not addressed in climate policy but which require policy attention if social equity in climate change adaptation is to be achieved.

Using material from a qualitative study in the Australian local government sector, this research shows that stakeholders involved in local adaptation policy formulation often do not have a shared view about the meaning and purposes of adaptation, although such shared understanding is commonly assumed in adaptation processes. Drawing on the frame-research literature and current conceptualisations of climate change adaptation, we argue that subconscious frame divergence can present a major challenge for effective organisational-level adaptation. Conversely, making frames and framing processes explicit is a first step towards clarifying adaptation goals and generating shared ownership of adaptation processes. While frames have been shown to be intrinsically subjective, we discuss three dominant frames that emerged from the study: avoiding disasters, community resilience, and averting organisational risk. We evaluate these in light of their theoretical origin and recent application towards climate change adaptation. Our research suggest that the 'averting organisational risks' frame is by far the most commonly activated frame. Individuals working in the community services sector frequently referred to the 'community resilience' frame, while the 'avoiding disasters frame' was used in public and policy discourse to circumvent the arguments of those sceptical about the existence and causes of climate change. We suggest that, by incorporating frame reflexivity into existing adaptation planning processes, a more diverse range of policy options can be explored, delivering more effective adaptation policies.","[Fuenfgeld, Hartmut] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [McEvoy, Darryn] RMIT Univ, Global Cities Res Inst, Climate Change Adaptat Program, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Funfgeld, H (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",hartmut.fuenfgeld@rmit.edu.au; darryn.mcevoy@rmit.edu.au,"Fünfgeld, Hartmut/C-5962-2011; Fünfgeld, Hartmut/X-8504-2019; McEvoy, Darryn/K-8015-2017","Fünfgeld, Hartmut/0000-0003-0359-8207; Fünfgeld, Hartmut/0000-0003-0359-8207; McEvoy, Darryn/0000-0003-4144-4137",,,,,128,41,42,1,52,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-774X,1472-3425,,ENVIRON PLANN C,Environ.

Decentralisation, which transfers authority and responsibility to lower levels of organisation, serves a similar purpose and has been in place for a number of decades. Based on four case studies in semi-arid regions in Africa and India, this paper argues that vertical integration for climate change adaptation should reflect on lessons from decentralisation related to governing natural resources, particularly in the water sector. The paper focuses on participation and flexibility, two central components of climate change adaptation, and considers how decentralisation has enhanced or undermined these. The findings suggest that vertical integration for adaptation will be strengthened if a number of lessons are considered, namely (i) actively seek equitable representation from marginal and diverse local groups drawing on both formal and informal participation structures, (ii) assess and address capacity deficits that undermine flexibility and adaptive responses, especially within lower levels of government, and (iii) use hybrid modes of governance that include government, intermediaries and diverse local actors through both formal and informal institutions to improve bottom-up engagement.","[Ziervogel, Gina] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Private Bag X3, Cape Town, South Africa; [Ziervogel, Gina; Hegga, Salma] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Private Bag X3, Cape Town, South Africa; [Satyal, Poshendra] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Basu, Ritwika; Singh, Chandni] Indian Inst Human Settlements, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Bangalore City Campus 197-36,2nd Main Rd, Bangalore 560080, Karnataka, India; [Mensah, Adelina; Abu, Thelma Zulfawu] Univ Ghana, Inst Environm & Sanitat Studies, LG 209, Legon Accra, Ghana",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; University of East Anglia; Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS); University of Ghana,"Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Private Bag X3, Cape Town, South Africa.;Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Private Bag X3, Cape Town, South Africa.",gina@csag.uct.ac.za,"Basu, Ritwika/AAC-4307-2022; Ziervogel, Gina/AAG-2945-2019; Singh, Chandni/H-8384-2019","Ziervogel, Gina/0000-0003-4219-6809; Singh, Chandni/0000-0001-6842-6735",Adaptation at Scale in Semi-Arid Regions (ASSAR) under the CARIAA programme of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC); UK Department for International Development (DFID),Adaptation at Scale in Semi-Arid Regions (ASSAR) under the CARIAA programme of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC); UK Department for International Development (DFID),"This work was supported by the Adaptation at Scale in Semi-Arid Regions (ASSAR), which is a consortium under the CARIAA programme of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the UK Department for International Development (DFID).

To develop a set of indicators to guide and monitor climate change adaptation in US state and local health departments. Methods. We performed a narrative review of literature on indicators of climate change adaptation and public health service capacity, mapped the findings onto activities grouped by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Ten Essential Services, and drafted potential indicators to discuss with practitioners. We then refined the indicators after key informant interviews with 17 health department officials in the US Pacific Northwest in fall 2018. Results. Informants identified a need for clarity regarding state and local public health's role in climate change adaptation, integration of adaptation into existing programs, and strengthening of communication, partnerships, and response capacity to increase resilience. We propose a set of climate change indicators applicable for state and local health departments. Conclusions. With additional context-specific refinement, the proposed indicators can aid agencies in tracking adaptation efforts. The generalizability, robustness, and relevance of the proposed indicators should be explored in other settings with a broader set of stakeholders.","[Doubleday, Annie; Errett, Nicole A.; Ebi, Kristie L.; Hess, Jeremy J.] Univ Washington, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Doubleday, Annie; Errett, Nicole A.; Ebi, Kristie L.; Hess, Jeremy J.] Univ Washington, Ctr Hlth & Global Environm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Errett, Nicole A.] Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ebi, Kristie L.; Hess, Jeremy J.] Univ Washington, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Hess, JJ (corresponding author), 4225 Roosevelt Way NE, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",jjhess@uw.edu,,"Doubleday, Annie/0000-0002-6600-8668","Ren Che Founda-tion; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington School of Public Health","Ren Che Founda-tion; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington School of Public Health","This work was supported by the Ren Che Founda-tion and the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington School of Public Health.",,32,5,5,0,5,AMER PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOC INC,WASHINGTON,"800 I STREET, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20001-3710 USA",0090-0036,1541-0048,,AM J PUBLIC HEALTH,Am.

Imbued with notions of resilience and reflection, reflexivity is assumed to contribute to pro-environmental change. However, as the need to manage climate impacts becomes more immediate, political struggles over climate adaptation have become increasingly apparent. These impacts occur most often within local communities, in the context of competing economic interests and differing interpretations of climate science. Thus while it is increasingly difficult to deny climate change, conflicting priorities can lead to ignorance. In these circumstances, how communities build and share knowledge, and negotiate responses is central. Based on a study of a vulnerable region in Australia, we identify three processes through which the local community mobilized to disrupt local climate change adaptation. These included emphasizing uncertainty about the science of climate change, encouraging fear about property prices, and repositioning property owners as victims of climate adaptation policy. We argue that this response to climate adaptation constitutes the production of reflexive ignorance, which reinforces skepticism around scientific authority and defends particular economic interests.","[Bowden, Vanessa; Nyberg, Daniel] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle, NSW, Australia; [Wright, Christopher] Univ Sydney, Sydney Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Newcastle; University of Sydney,"Bowden, V (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW 2300, Australia.",vanessa.bowden@newcastle.edu.au,"Nyberg, Daniel/ABE-2371-2021","Nyberg, Daniel/0000-0002-7144-1343; Wright, Christopher/0000-0001-8624-9605; Bowden, Vanessa/0000-0002-6642-2826",,,,,45,6,6,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-1315,1468-4446,,BRIT J SOCIOL,Br.

The poultry sector is an important component of the African food system, but national climate change adaptation plans in many countries fail to take into account the specific contextual challenges faced by poultry producers. We developed a participatory system dynamics modelling tool to involve stakeholders from the poultry sector in Nigeria in analyzing how climate impacts would affect the sector, with the goal of generating insights for state (sub-national) and national scale policy makers. A second goal of the exercise was to facilitate social learning and knowledge sharing on adaptation strategies among the stakeholders. Given the high uncertainty of the conditions surrounding the Nigerian poultry sector, the model's use is primarily as a discussion tool for poultry sector stakeholders, including policy makers, to share concerns and develop adaptation strategies. It served this purpose, as evidenced by the creation of a manual for poultry producers from the exercise. Similar stakeholder engagement efforts can stimulate knowledge sharing around climate change adaptation for problems around which limited data and high uncertainty exist. Key policy insights Participatory system dynamics modelling is shown to be a useful tool for integrating national and community-level priorities for policy and management under climate change in the Nigerian poultry sector. Effective climate change adaptation will require building resilience to large-scale external drivers such as global trade dynamics, which are highly influential in the system. In order to effectively move from planning to implementation, climate change adaptation processes must facilitate social learning and knowledge sharing around the long-term consequences of policy and management choices.","[Olabisi, Laura Schmitt] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Osuntade, Olubukola] Babcock Univ, Dept Agr & Ind Technol, Ilishan Remo, Nigeria; [Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis Saweda O.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Adebiyi, Jelili] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Adebiyi, Jelili] Michigan State Univ, Dept Food Sci & Human Nutr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Olabisi, LS (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",schmi420@msu.edu,,"Schmitt Olabisi, Laura/0000-0002-6557-9469",Alliance for African Partnership at Michigan State University; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative,Alliance for African Partnership at Michigan State University; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),This work was supported by the Alliance for African Partnership at Michigan State University.

This decade-long struggle culminated in 2008 when a coalition of local groups (stakeholders) from the Cruz de Mayo and Caraz communities in the Callejon de Huaylas seized control of the Lake Paron reservoir from a private multinational corporation, Duke Energy. This clash over Paron's water in the Llullan and Santa River watersheds emerged much earlier than climatic-hydrologic models had predicted, and it occurred, this paper argues, largely because of previously successful climate adaptation measures. The drainage tunnel and floodgates originally installed at Paron in the 1980s to prevent a climate-related outburst flood led to unintended or perverse outcomes because these technological artifacts subsequently allowed a diversity of stakeholders including rural subsistence farmers, urban residents, national park officials, tourism promoters, the state energy company Electroperu, and Duke Energy to manage water differently depending on their priorities and the existing governance structures. Neoliberal reforms that altered state-society-environment relations in Peru played a key role in these changing stakeholder power dynamics that were reflected in the management of water infrastructure at Paron. Examining this water conflict that emerged from the unintended effects of climate adaptation demonstrates not only how technology and society are mutually constitutive, but also why the politics of technologies must be considered more carefully in the analysis of social-ecological systems, hydro-social cycles, and climate change adaptation.

Climate policies are shaped by the underlying CPPs that refer to a dominant set of prevailing and institutionalized ideas and strategies to reduce the impacts of climate change. We focus the analysis on the timeframe between 1997 and 2016, using policy documents (n = 46) and semi-structured interviews (n = 43) with key policy actors. We find that in both countries several CPPs have emerged: disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, mainstreaming, and localized action for adaptation. In Bangladesh, specific policy goals and instruments for each CPP have emerged, whereas in Nepal the government has been struggling to develop specific policy instruments to implement the paradigms. We conclude that competing CPPs currently exist which creates diversified policy responses to climate change impacts in both countries. This 'layering' of different CPPs can be attributed to drivers such as unstable political situation, lack of financial support, influence of national and international non-governmental organizations and global policy frameworks. The findings in our study are relevant to further discussions on how to design future climate policy responses to adapt to climate change.","[Vij, Sumit; Biesbroek, Robbert; Termeer, Katrien] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Groot, Annemarie] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Environm Res, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Vij, S (corresponding author), POB 8130,Hollandseweg 1, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",sumit.vij@wur.nl,"Biesbroek, Robbert/ABE-3686-2021; Vij, Sumit/AAV-6617-2021; Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419","UK Government's Department for International Development; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada","UK Government's Department for International Development; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada","This work was carried out by the Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) consortium under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) with financial support from the UK Government's Department for International Development and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada.",,41,41,41,0,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

This paper systematically makes these connections to empirically explore the role of law in climate change adaptation. In doing so, the paper posits a 'Coastal Lawscape' as a useful frame through which to both theorise and to empirically explore coastal climate change adaptation. After detailing the concept of Coastal Lawscape, the paper explores how Coastal Lawscape manifests and influences climate change adaptation trajectories via a case study of four sites within one state jurisdiction. The empirical evidence shows that Coastal Lawscape comprises legal, political and cultural normative systems, and argues that un-derstanding the interconnectedness of these systems is critical for advancing coastal climate change adaptation literature and policy.","[O'Donnell, Tayanah] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"O'Donnell, T (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",tayanah.odonnell@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,115,6,6,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

The article explores how the CBACC-CA builds various types of adaptive capacity in Bangladesh and the extent its design and implementation offers lessons for other adaptation programs around the world. The first part of the study begins by describing its research methods consisting of research interviews, site visits, and a literature review. It then summarizes six primary sectors vulnerable to climate change in Bangladesh: water resources and coastal zones, infrastructure and human settlements, agriculture and food security, forestry and biodiversity, fisheries, and human health. The article next describes the genesis and background behind the CBACC-CA, with an emphasis on components that promote capacity development, demonstration projects, risk reduction, and knowledge management. The article concludes that technology by itself is only a partial component of successful adaptation efforts, and that multiple and integrated adaptation measures that cut across sectors and social, institutional, and infrastructural dimensions are needed to truly build resilience and effectiveness.","[Rawlani, Amireeta K.; Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 259772, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Sovacool, BK (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore.",amireeta@nus.edu.sg; bsovacool@nus.edu.sg,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; ",,,,,38,93,94,3,96,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

The paradigm shift today in climate change issues is focused on mitigation and adaptation. Besides mitigation, adaptation is considered as an essential strategy for reducing the severity and cost of climate change impacts given the fact that additional future climate change is considered as being inevitable. In this paper, we analyze household socio-economic determinants of climate change adaptation and their policy implications. A survey of 130 farmers in four farm communities in Cameroon was conducted to capture the determinants of farmers' adaptation to climate change. We employed the binary Logistic regression model to assess the determinants of climate adaptation. Results reveal that in the midst of climate change, 78.33% of farmers have adopted rainfall-related adaptation while 63.33% have resorted to temperature-related adaptation. Based on the binary logistic regression, access to road, access to non-farm income source, and membership of farmers' groups were significant determinants for the adoption of temperature-related adaptation options. Furthermore, access to improved seeds was found to be the lone significant determinant for the adoption of rainfall-related adaptation options. All in all, much is required to strengthen farmers' adaptive capacity and increase the range of adaptation options undertaken. As such, policies geared towards building farmers' resilience should effectively capture the following tri-factors: provision of access roads linking farm communities to nearby urban centres, upscaling institutional interventions with regards to providing high quality and resistant seeds to farmers, and incentivizing farmers to create or join social groups in order to facilitate adaptation uptake.","[Bate, Bate Godwill; Amawa, Sani Gur] Univ Buea, Dept Geog, Fac Social & Management Sci, POB 63, Buea 00237, Cameroon; [Kimengsi, Jude Ndzifon] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Environm Sci, Inst Trop Forestry & Forest Prod, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Kimengsi, Jude Ndzifon] Catholic Univ Cameroon CATUC, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 782, Bamenda 00237, Cameroon",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Kimengsi, JN (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Environm Sci, Inst Trop Forestry & Forest Prod, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.;Kimengsi, JN (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Cameroon CATUC, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 782, Bamenda 00237, Cameroon.",gbatebate@gmail.com; jude_ndzifon.kimengsi@tu-dresden.de; amawasg@yahoo.com,,"Kimengsi, Jude Ndzifon/0000-0002-1927-7443",,,,,38,8,8,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR 1,2019,11,7,,,,,,,1921,10.3390/su11071921,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11071921,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HW2WV,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000466551600098,View Full Record in Web of Science

One way to improve the usefulness of SNA is to purposefully complement the structural analysis with cultural elements that can be drawn from field datasets. In this network-governance case study from Queensland, Australia, research on organizations involved in water management and flood responses events showed that cultural values were important in influencing network connections and preferred approaches to flood pre-planning and response. For example, there were differences in organizational preferences for the numbers and types of links that are rooted in different values. From this, Mary Douglas' Cultural Theory categories of individualists, hierarchists, and egalitarians were extended to analyze the types of ties between network nodes, the preferred approaches of different types of organization, and the problematic links and missing links among network nodes. This work illustrates that analyses of both structural SNA and cultural values can be used to improve regional-level adaptation activities such as disaster management. Here, increased knowledge about social networks, network ties, and cultural values can facilitate a process of social learning that will help societies adapt to climate change impacts.","[Malone, Elizabeth L.] Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Kinnear, Susan] Cent Queensland Univ, North Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia",Central Queensland University,"Malone, EL (corresponding author), Joint Global Change Res Inst, 5825 Univ Res Court Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",e.malone@pnnl.gov,,,Australian National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF),Australian National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF),"This research was funded by the Australian National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF).

This study aims to explore a conceptual definition, the subjective framework of CCA including its domains, attributes, and consequences. The approach of qualitative conventional content analysis was considered for the explanation of the subjective concept, and at the same time as the collection process, data analysis was performed using Zhang and Wildemuth's method. The interview method was semi-structured and sampling was targeted and with maximum diversity. The interview was conducted with 22 qualified experts. The accuracy and validity of the data were ensured using Guba and Lincoln scientific accuracy criteria. Six main categories including sustainability, productivity, stability, empowerment, transformation, and flexibility were conceptualized in the theme of adaptation characteristics. Sustainable development, life improvement, response coordination and integration, creativity and innovation, resilience promotion, vulnerability reduction, effective management, and independence were the main categories in the theme of the adaptation consequences. According to the results, the following conceptual-functional definition can be presented for adaptation to climate change: CCA refers to the ability of system instability, sustainability, empowerment, productivity, flexibility, and transformation to climate change through the optimal use of resources, resistance, and coping, capacity building and opportunity creation. This definition is conceptual, it means that includes the main features of climate-adaptation and is also functional that is, includes adaptation strategies for climate change.","[Salehi, Shiva; Ardalan, Ali; Ostadtaghizadeh, Abbas] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Emergencies & Disasters, Ghods Ave,Poursina Ave, Tehran, Iran; [Salehi, Shiva; Ardalan, Ali; Ostadtaghizadeh, Abbas] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Inst Environm Hlth Res, Ctr Air Pollut Res, Tehran, Iran; [Ardalan, Ali] Harvard Humanitarian Initiat, Cambridge, MA USA; [Garmaroudi, Gholamreza] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Promot & Educ, Tehran, Iran; [Zareiyan, Armin] Aja Univ Med Scinces, Sch Nursing, Dept Publ Hlth, Tehran, Iran; [Rahimiforoushani, Abbas] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidmiol & BioStat, Tehran, Iran",Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Harvard University; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences,"Ostadtaghizadeh, A (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Emergencies & Disasters, Ghods Ave,Poursina Ave, Tehran, Iran.",sh_salehi@razi.tums.ac.ir; aardalan@tums.ac.ir; a-ostadtaghizadeh@sina.tums.ac.ir; garmaroudi@tums.ac.ir; a.zareian@ajaums.ac.ir; rahimifo@tums.ac.ir,"salehi, Shiva/AAN-6390-2021; Ostadtaghizadeh, Abbas/AAO-2137-2020; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Ostadtaghizadeh, Abbas/0000-0001-5260-6221; ",,,,,48,5,5,2,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,2052-336X,,J ENVIRON HEALTH SCI,J.

Rapid population growth with competition for land and water could affect aquaculture production. Although aquaculture uses non-consumptive water, there are significant water footprints for aquaculture due to water lost and water required for fish-feed production. Moreover, climate change affects water availability and demand for aquaculture, and poses a further threat to global fish production. Nevertheless, the efficient use of blue water (surface and groundwater) and green water (rain) in inland, coastal, and marine aquaculture could make a significant contribution to global fish production and climate change adaptation. Sustainable intensification of freshwater aquaculture, mangrove restoration with brackish water fish production, and the expansion of mariculture could increase global fish production with adaptation to climate change.

While rigorous evaluations of adaptation strategies provide decision makers with valuable insights, those that are published often overlook major constraints, ignore local adaptive capacity, and suffer from a compartmentalization of disciplines and scales. The objective of our study was to identify current knowledge of evaluation methods and their limitations, reported in the literature. We reviewed 111 papers that evaluate adaptation strategies in the main vineyards worldwide. Evaluation approaches are analyzed through key features (e.g., climate data sources, methodology, evaluation criteria) to discuss their ability to address climate change issues, and to identify promising outcomes for climate change adaptations. We highlight the fact that combining adaptation levers in the short and long term (location, vine training, irrigation, soil, and canopy management, etc.) enables local compromises to be reached between future water availability and grapevine productivity. The main findings of the paper are three-fold: (1) the evaluation of a combination of adaptation strategies provides better solutions for adapting to climate change; (2) multi-scale studies allow local constraints and opportunities to be considered; and (3) only a small number of studies have developed multi-scale and multi-lever approaches to quantify feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation. In addition, we found that climate data sources were not systematically clearly presented, and that climate uncertainty was hardly accounted for. Moreover, only a small number of studies have assessed the economic impacts of adaptation, especially at farm scale. We conclude that the development of methodologies to evaluate adaptation strategies, considering both complementary adaptations and scales, is essential if relevant information is to be provided to the decision-makers of the wine industry.","[Naulleau, Audrey; Gary, Christian] Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro, CIHEAM IAMM, ABSys,INRAE,CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Prevot, Laurent] Univ Montpellier, LISAH, INRAE, IRD,Inst Agro, Montpellier, France; [Hossard, Laure] Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro, Innovat, INRAE,CIRAD, Montpellier, France",CIHEAM; CIHEAM IAM Montpellier; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; Institut Agro; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Universite de Montpellier,"Naulleau, A (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro, CIHEAM IAMM, ABSys,INRAE,CIRAD, Montpellier, France.",audrey.naulleau@inrae.fr,"Prevot, Laurent/A-5929-2011; Naulleau, Audrey/AGU-9912-2022","Prevot, Laurent/0000-0002-4627-4379; Gary, Christian/0000-0003-3267-5400","Occitanie Regional Council; INRAE Department AgroEcoSystem; LACCAVE 2.21 project - meta-program Adaptation of Agriculture and Forests to Climate Change (AAFCC) of the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment (INRAE)","Occitanie Regional Council; INRAE Department AgroEcoSystem; LACCAVE 2.21 project - meta-program Adaptation of Agriculture and Forests to Climate Change (AAFCC) of the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment (INRAE)","This work was carried out with the financial support of the Occitanie Regional Council, the INRAE Department AgroEcoSystem and the LACCAVE 2.21 project funded by the meta-program Adaptation of Agriculture and Forests to Climate Change (AAFCC) of the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment (INRAE).",,115,31,31,26,64,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Given these projections, there is a need to identify effective strategies to help rural communities adapt to climatic risks. Yet, relatively little research has examined the politics and social dynamics around knowledge and sources of information about climate-change adaptation with smallholder farming communities. This paper uses a political ecology approach to historically situate rural people's experiences with a changing climate. Using the concept of the co-production of knowledge, we examine how Malawian smallholder farmers learn, perceive, share and apply knowledge about a changing climate, and what sources they draw on for agroecological methods in this context. As well, we pay particular attention to agricultural knowledge flows within and between households. We ask two main questions: Whose knowledge counts in relation to climate-change adaptation? What are the political, social and environmental implications of these knowledge dynamics? We draw upon a long-term action research project on climate-change adaptation that involved focus groups, interviews, observations, surveys, and participatory agroecology experiments with 425 farmers. Our findings are consistent with other studies, which found that agricultural knowledge sources were shaped by gender and other social inequalities, with women more reliant on informal networks than men. Farmers initially ranked extension services as important sources of knowledge about farming and climate change. After farmers carried out participatory agroecological research, they ranked their own observation and informal farmer networks as more important sources of knowledge. Contradictory ideas about climate-change adaptation, linked to various positions of power, gaps of knowledge and social inequalities make it challenging for farmers to know how to act despite observing changes in rainfall. Participatory agroecological approaches influenced adaptation strategies used by smallholder farmers in Malawi, but most still maintained the dominant narrative about climate-change causes, which focused on local deforestation by rural communities. Smallholder farmers in Malawi are responsible for <1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet our results show that the farmers often blame their own rural communities for changes in deforestation and rainfall patterns. Researchers need to consider differences knowledge and power between scientists and farmers and the contradictory narratives at work in communities to foster long-term change.","[Kerr, Rachel Bezner] Cornell Univ, Dept Dev Sociol, 262 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, 3846 SPH 1,1415 Washington Hts, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dakishoni, Laifolo; Lupafya, Esther; Shumba, Lizzie] SFHC Org, POB 36, Ekwendeni, Malawi; [Kerr, Rachel Bezner; Luginaah, Isaac] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON, Canada; [Snapp, Sieglinde S.] Michigan State Univ, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Snapp, Sieglinde S.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Microbial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Cornell University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Kerr, RB (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Dev Sociol, 262 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",rbeznerkerr@cornell.edu,"Kerr, Rachel Bezner/AAQ-6552-2020; Snapp, Sieglinde/AAU-8121-2020; Snapp, Sieg/GWQ-5774-2022","Kerr, Rachel Bezner/0000-0003-4525-6096; Snapp, Sieglinde/0000-0002-9738-0649; Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson/0000-0002-6407-1970","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [410-2009-1434]; International Development Research Centre, Canada [105152]; Canadian FoodGrains Bank; Presbyterian World Service and Development","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); International Development Research Centre, Canada(CGIAR); Canadian FoodGrains Bank; Presbyterian World Service and Development","This work was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (# 410-2009-1434), the International Development Research Centre, Canada (grant # 105152).

Among the barriers are lack of awareness, certainty, resources and political commitment. Since these and other barriers can be overcome (e.g., by raising awareness, closing knowledge gaps, and increasing resources), numerous decision-support frameworks (mainly written guidelines) have been developed for this purpose. The present paper takes stock of both the barriers in adaptation policymaking, as documented in the literature, and the guidelines that aim to facilitate public policies on climate change adaptation. It then compares to what degree selected adaptation guidelines serve as knowledge-brokerage tools that provide guidance on how to overcome the barriers addressed in the scientific literature. The comparison shows that adaptation guidelines address barriers of adaptation policymaking neither comprehensively nor systematically. Since most adaptation guidelines focus on (subjective) experiences with good practices than on empirical research findings, we conclude that they represent a missed opportunity of scientific knowledge-brokerage in climate change adaptation.","[Clar, Christoph; Steurer, Reinhard] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy InFER, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Clar, C (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy InFER, Vienna, Austria.",christoph.clar@boku.ac.at; andrea.prutsch@umweltbundesamt.at; reinhard.steurer@boku.ac.at,,"Steurer, Reinhard/0000-0002-5000-7046; Clar, Christoph/0000-0003-3556-8256",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP);  [K10AC0K00004],Austrian Climate and Energy Fund within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP); ,This study received funding by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP).

The engagement of the private sector and citizens has received increasing attention in recent years. Local authorities' choice of policy instruments, the distribution of responsibilities and the benefits of adaptation as a public or a private good have a bearing on the involvement of private actors. Based on interviews and documents from Copenhagen and Helsinki, we analyse how public authorities' choices, to whom and how they shift responsibilities, can foster transformational, participatory or market-oriented elements of adaptation. The results indicate that local authorities play a dominant role in providing adaptation. Public authorities steer where the private sector and citizens are expected to take responsibilities.

Every natural WH site is at risk from climate change, but the scope and nature of that risk varies widely. Climate change adaptation is a wicked problem; that is, there are no clear-cut solutions and stakeholders at each site disagree on values, norms and first steps, making adaptation difficult. Yet, delaying action poses more risks than taking action under uncertainty. I synthesize the refereed literature relevant to climate adaptation for natural WH sites. I argue that adaptation should be ecosystem based. It should begin by understanding linkages among site attributes and the surrounding landscape, and asking how off-site and on-site practices might reduce risk of negative effects of climate change on those attributes. Adaptation responses are tiered. Fine-scale, on-site responses are less expensive and easier but will have less impact than coarse-scale responses involving the surrounding community. We cannot precisely predict future conditions so we must act adaptively, designing responses, acting, evaluating results, re-designing and trying again. Action is constrained by institutional mandates focused on preserving existing conditions rather than recognizing a dynamic future. Climate change adaptation at natural WH sites should be Adaptive, Participatory and Transformative, deployed through clumsy solutions. Such solutions will require strong leadership and excellent communication, drawing together widely disparate views and iterative practices focusing on resilience. That requirement establishes the need for capacity development for climate change adaptation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explores farmers' anticipated adaptive responses to climate change across five different adaptation strategies, including, cropping system, crop rotation, tillage practices, soil conservation practices, and crop insurance. This research examines whether farmers anticipate making little to no change or moderate to big changes to their production system in response to climate change and whether perceived economic and environmental risks motivate farmers' intentions to adapt to climate change. I found that a small percentage (18-28%) of respondents intend on taking moderate to big action in response to predicted climate change, across both surveys and all five adaptation strategies. Further, high levels of perceived economic and environmental risks, associated with climate change and positive attitudes towards adaptation, are motivating intentions to adapt.","[Roesch-McNally, Gabrielle E.] USDA Northwest Climate Hub, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA",,"Roesch-McNally, GE (corresponding author), USDA Northwest Climate Hub, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.",groeschmcnally@fs.fed.us,,,USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture [32011-68002-30191],USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture,"I would like to acknowledge the entire Regional Approaches to Climate Change in the Pacific Northwest (www.reacchpna.org) project (Award 32011-68002-30191 from USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture) and in particular, Sanford Eigenbrode and Dianne Daley-Laursen for their leadership.

We used a sustainable livelihood approach and Ostrom's design principles for managing commons, to assess how CF confers climate change adaptive capacity in two communities in Myanmar. Our findings indicate that CF provides tangible contributions to human and social capital, by increasing landless and female forest users' knowledge of forest management. However, CF has yet to enhance the physical, financial, and natural capital within these communities. The major challenges preventing the enhancement of socioeconomic benefits include limited community participation and weak institutional systems for monitoring and conflict resolution. We argue that CF increases community engagement in natural resource management, but in the absence of effective monitoring and decision-making, socioeconomic benefits to communities from CF programs may be limited. Our results elucidate important factors limiting the uptake and progress of CF as a viable climate change adaptation strategy in Southeast Asia, and indicate that comparative research is needed to better understand the factors that influence CF efficacy in forest- and natural resource-dependent communities globally.","[Lin, T.; Martin, A.

Climate change adaptation is of special concern in regions facing water scarcity where water management is already challenged by many problems. This paper is a review of current knowledge on approaches to address water issues under uncertainty in water-scarce regions, identifying specific policy actions for climate change adaptation. The focus is on regions, like the Mediterranean, California or Australia, where water resources are well developed and have become an essential part of socioeconomic activities but are currently facing significant challenges due to their dependence on water availability to maintain living standards. We provide an overview of the expected impacts of climate change on water resources and discuss management responses based on peer-reviewed studies published over the past three decades. The adaptation choices cover a wide range of options, from adaptive demand management to utilization of remaining marginal water sources. The intensification of successful measures already applied in the past is still viewed as a solution to reduce climate impacts. However, the emphasis is progressively being placed on sustainability, developing and extending the water management paradigm to include not only technical and economic criteria, but also ecological and social considerations.","[Garrote, Luis] Tech Univ Madrid, Civil Engn Dept Hydraul Energy & Environm, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Garrote, L (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Civil Engn Dept Hydraul Energy & Environm, Madrid, Spain.",l.garrote@upm.es,"Garrote, Luis/B-5925-2013","Garrote, Luis/0000-0001-9087-3638",,,,,96,44,44,2,80,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

We focus on the city's local climate change adaptation policies, and in particular the role of urban and greenspace planning in facilitating adaptation actions within Fukuoka. Fukuoka is a humid subtropical city which is currently experiencing significant population and economic growth. It has also made comparatively rigorous advances in climate adaptation, in a country context where local governments have been criticised for focusing more on mitigation. Fukuoka hence may yield lessons for other rapidly urbanising subtropical Asian cities. We illustrate that Fukuoka has a long tradition of science-policy connection towards the creation of a liveable urban environment. This creates a favourable research and policy infrastructure for adaptation, in particular mitigation of heat risk. This is evidenced in consideration of climate issues within the city's greenspace plans since the 1990s, and in an extensive body of underpinning applied research from local institutions into urban thermal environments in particular. Fukuoka's green terraced ACROS building has come to symbolise adaptation via the built environment, and has been followed by the emergence of further green roofs and through citizen and private sector involvement in smaller-scale greening actions. We caution that challenges remain around connecting different sections of local governments, and in maintaining climate and environmental imperatives in the face of ongoing development and expansion pressures.","[Mabon, Leslie] Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Appl Social Studies, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Kondo, Kayoko; Kanekiyo, Hiroyuki; Yamaguchi, Asako] Kyushu Univ, Fac Design, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Hayabuchi, Yuriko] Kyushu Univ, Global Innovat Ctr, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan",Robert Gordon University; Kyushu University; Kyushu University,"Mabon, L (corresponding author), Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Appl Social Studies, Aberdeen, Scotland.",l.j.mabon@rgu.ac.uk,,"Mabon, Leslie/0000-0003-2646-6119",Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Humanities and Social Sciences [205764-Z-16-Z],Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Humanities and Social Sciences,This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Humanities and Social Sciences [Grant Number 205764-Z-16-Z].,,61,20,21,9,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,OCT,2019,93,,,,,,273,285,,10.1016/j.cities.2019.05.007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2019.05.007,,,13,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,JA9AR,31787795,"Green Accepted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000488142900024,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents lessons from an assessment of an autonomous adaptation in the Great Ruaha River catchment in Tanzania following WWF intervention. The project was designed to address challenges resulting from natural resource use and existing levels of climate variability by changing water resource management. The study applied participatory methods and an open-ended questionnaire to collect data. The study found key adaptation benefits, including reduced vulnerability to drought and strengthened local water user associations and other regional institutions. As a result of the project interventions from 2003 to 2009, rural livelihoods became more profitable and water-sustainable, and local livelihood strategies were diversified. Regional ecosystems improved as a result of restoring river flows in some rivers, conservation of riparian vegetation and halting tree felling for charcoal production. As a result of these changes the communities and ecosystems in the Great Ruaha River catchment should be more resilient to emerging climate change impacts, yet the need for further physical interventions and institutional reform is identified. The study concludes that strengthening local institutions and capacity building are fundamental to climate change adaptation and sustainable freshwater management.","[Kashaigili, Japhet J.] Sokoine Univ Agr, Fac Forestry & Nat Conservat, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Rajabu, Kossa; Masolwa, Petro] World Wide Fund Nat Tanzania Programme Off, Ruaha Water Programme, Iringa, Tanzania",Sokoine University of Agriculture,"Kashaigili, JJ (corresponding author), Sokoine Univ Agr, Fac Forestry & Nat Conservat, POB 3013, Morogoro, Tanzania.",jkashaigili@suanet.ac.tz,,,,,,,21,12,12,1,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional research design was used to collect data from 400 randomly selected rain-fed rice farmers owning mobile phones. Semi-structured questionnaires were used for data collection in eight selected wards in two districts of Kilombero and Kilosa districts in Morogoro Region, Tanzania. Findings The findings of the study showed that the use of mobile phones to access rice information on climate change adaptation was statistically significantly influenced by respondents' sex, age, education level, marital status, farm size, farming experience, radio ownership and off-farm incomes. Furthermore, the use of mobile phones in accessing rice information on climate change adaptation among the study districts was not statistically significant. Practical implications This paper provides practical recommendations on how to improve accessibility of rice information through mobile phones on climate change adaptation. Implementation of information delivery system to farmers using mobile phones without ascertaining farmers' socio-demographic characteristics leads to resource underutilization. Originality/value The paper provides appropriate knowledge that is needed in improving access to information through mobile phones by Tanzanian farmers and in other communities in developing countries with the aid of the additional theoretical moderators of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology as the research findings suggest. Moderators' variables have high influence on farmers' use of mobile phones on accessing rice information on climate change adaptation.","[Mwalukasa, Nicholaus] Sokoine Univ Agr, Informat & Record Studies, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Mlozi, Malongo R.

The logistic regression analysis results indicated that farmers' loss aversion is consistently and positively associated with choices across adaptation behaviors, indicating that more loss-averse farmers are more likely to improve irrigation, access to credit and increase rotation. The effects of farmers' risk aversion on adaptation practices are mixed. Farmers' risk aversion is negatively and significantly related to adaptation strategies on changing or increasing irrigation, but positively associated with crop diversification, accessing credit, increasing rotation and planting new crop varieties.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a review work which synthesises lessons from relevant journal articles and other related documents. The literature was retrieved from Google and Google Scholar using search terms such as climate change, climate change and mitigation, climate change and mitigation in Africa, climate change adaptation and mitigation in Africa, climate change vulnerability, climate change impacts, among others. Various combinations of the search terms were also deployed. The journals were subjected to critical review and key lessons synthesised from them and reflections on their future implications in relation to climate risks and vulnerability presented. Findings - Key lessons were synthesised and reflections on their future implications in relation to climate risks and vulnerability were presented. The evidence seems to suggest that countries in Africa recognise that it is time for them to take action on the impacts of climate change. The key lessons which emerge, going forward, are that climate change adaptation should be mainstreamed into development plans of nations. All efforts should be geared towards sustaining livelihoods of people. Key stakeholders also have a role to play in adaptation. The paper has indicated that although a lot has happened, there are areas that require strengthening and that should be the focus and priority of change and policy makers for the future. Research limitations/implications - The paper is a synthesis and reflection of existing literature and it is possible that some of the dynamics may have changed since the paper was published. Practical implications - The dynamics of climate change adaptation is understood. The approaches to adaptation are also explored. Areas worth prioritising in the discourse of adaptation studies have also been indicated. Originality/value - The syntheses provided are the reflections of the author. The views of the researcher provide insights and understanding into the current adaptation debate.","[Abraham, Ernest Mensah] Univ Profess Studies, Dept Business Adm, Accra, Ghana",,"Abraham, EM (corresponding author), Univ Profess Studies, Dept Business Adm, Accra, Ghana.",emabraham14@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1477-7835,1758-6119,,MANAG ENVIRON QUAL,Manag.

Interviews with 11 key-informant irrigators from the South Australian Riverland uncovered skepticism about climate change predictions. Interviewees mostly believed changes to the climate were not human-induced but were a result of natural cycles, which meant that they then felt less obliged to undertake climate-change adaptation responses. With low water allocations and low commodity prices, most did not identify climate change as their most compelling problem. They found it hard to identify climate change adaptation options beyond those they had implemented to manage their immediate problems. The reasons for interviewees' stated skepticism are complex, but not as equated to disbelief as they might seem. Their beliefs about climate change appear to be chosen to allow them to retain hope for the future.","CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Kuehne, G (corresponding author), CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, PMB 2, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia.",geoffkuehne@gmail.com,"Kuehne, Geoff/B-3688-2008","Kuehne, Geoff/0000-0002-0015-9738",,,,,34,20,20,0,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1920,1521-0723,,SOC NATUR RESOUR,Soc.

A total of 77 sustainable production options were developed for the companies based on the audits conducted. After screening these opportunities with each company's staff, 19 options were selected and implemented. Significant water savings (849,668 m(3)/year) were achieved as a result of the applications that targeted reduction of water use. In addition to water savings, the energy consumption was reduced by 3,607 MWh, which decreased the CO2 emissions by 904.1 tons/year. Moreover, the consumption of 278.4 tons/year of chemicals (e.g., NaCl, CdO, NaCN) was avoided, thus the corresponding pollution load to the wastewater treatment plant was reduced. Besides the tangible improvements, other gains were achieved, such as improved product quality, improved health and safety conditions, reduced maintenance requirements, and ensured compliance with national and EU regulations. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first ever activity in Turkey devoted to climate change adaptation in the private sector. This study may serve as a building block in Turkey for the integration of climate change adaptation and mitigation approach in the industry, since water efficiency (adaptation) and carbon reduction (mitigation) are achieved simultaneously.","[Alkaya, Emrah; Bogurcu, Merve; Ulutas, Ferda] Technol Dev Fdn Turkey TTGV, Ankara, Turkey; [Demirer, Goeksel Niyazi] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Environm Engn, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University,"Demirer, GN (corresponding author), Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Environm Engn, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey.",goksel@metu.edu.tr,"Demirer, Göksel/AAB-5562-2019; Demirer, Goksel/ABC-6440-2020","Demirer, Goksel/0000-0001-6030-2041",Millennium Development Goals Fund (MDG-F),Millennium Development Goals Fund (MDG-F),"This study was financed by the Millennium Development Goals Fund (MDG-F), within the scope of the United Nations Joint Program entitled MDG-F 1680: Enhancing the Capacity of Turkey to Adapt to Climate Change.",,68,13,13,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-4303,1554-7531,,WATER ENVIRON RES,Water Environ.

The endogenous switching regression (ESR) model is employed to achieve the study's aim. The results show that age, education, access to credit, extension visits, smartphone use, and peer influence significantly influence farmers' decision to adopt climate change (CC) adaptation strategies. Also, it is observed that the adoption of CC adaptation strategies increases farm and household income. The study recommended that policymakers, the national government, and NGOs should target promoting climate change adaptation technologies for rural growth.

Drawing on discussions with residents in informal settlements and interviews with staff from government agencies, NGOs and donors, it shows the lack of connection between the formal institutional structure for disaster preparedness and the groups most at risk from extreme weather disasters and their community level actions. There is no clear definition of roles among local government agencies with regard to climate change adaptation. Although there is a donor-funded programme to reduce poverty and disaster risks, this is not being implemented in the settlements most at risk from landslides. Neither are there any measures underway to address the needs of the residents in these high risk settlements, in part because of the financial weakness of local government. Nor is there much support for this from national government - since national climate change adaptation policy does not consider urban adaptation and strengthening urban government capacity to reduce the vulnerability of the extreme poor as a priority. NGOs undertake programmes for community-based disaster risk reduction but their scale and scope are limited by not being integrated into local government.","UNDP Bangladesh, CBACC CF Project, Dhaka, Bangladesh",,"Ahammad, R (corresponding author), UNDP Bangladesh, CBACC CF Project, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",ronju222@yahoo.com,"Ahammad, Ronju/R-8910-2019","AHAMMAD, RONJU/0000-0001-7978-0721",,,,,29,31,31,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

Creating and mobilizing AC is a continuous process that requires social learning (SL). Although rich with empirical cases, the literature theorizing and empirically investigating the relationship between AC and SL is highly fragmented. This paper aims to critically examine the peer-reviewed literature that focusses on SL and AC in the context of climate change adaptation (CCA). Special attention is paid to the interplay between the two. Understanding this interplay can help improve our understanding of how CCA takes place in practice and advances theoretical debates on CCA. Systematic review methods are used to analyse 43 papers (1997-2016). Our findings reveal three perspectives that each play an important role in different contexts: an AC-focused perspective, a SL-focused perspective, and a hybrid perspective. These differences in conceptualizations of the relationship between SL and AC may seem trivial at first, but they have consequences for the design of learning-based interventions aimed at helping communities respond to climate change. It appears that such interventions need to be preceded by an analysis of the climate change context in order to decide whether to emphasize AC, SL or both simultaneously.","[Le Thi Hong Phuong; Wals, Arjen E.

Therefore, climate finance institutions and national decision-makers face difficult trade-offs when allocating funds. While not a substitute for expert judgement, we argue that understanding how the public thinks could play a role in building support. Using a representative sample of the UK population, we use a discrete choice experiment to explore in particular the way in which distributional considerations drive respondent decisions in two dimensions: (a) among recipients of adaptation finance in recipient developing countries, and (b) among those who contribute to this finance (via taxation). We categorise our results as follows. First, respondents show strong distributional preferences for funds to reach the poorest individuals, supporting adoption of egalitarian policy mandates among climate adaptation funds. Secondly, respondents prefer an 'ability-to-pay' approach over the 'polluter-pays-principle' as a way of funding. Thirdly, our results suggest that a focus on communicating future benefits to UK residents can increase policy support. Overall, however, our findings also reveal that public support for global climate adaptation payments is insufficient.

Participatory research was used to rank the spectrum of livelihood options according to their significance in the face of climate change-induced drought and other socio-economic pressures. A coping capacity index (CCI) was used to estimate the level of adaptation limit imposed by each livelihood strategy, with composite CCI values generated to compare the coping capacities of villages studied. Given that most of the livelihoods options are climate dependent, and combined with other non-climatic drivers of vulnerability that are besetting rural areas in Zimbabwe, we argue that adaptation limits abound. Most of these limits are explained by the limitation of the environment that the villagers largely depend on for their survival. With the analytic capabilities of participants engaged, the article isolates three departure points for adaptation research, policy and practice: understanding the type and magnitude of climatic hazards thatthe locals are exposed to; assessment of their coping capacities and determination of adaptation barriers; and using their knowledge of the local environment to suggest interventions for evading adaptation barriers.","[Chanza, Nelson] Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Dept Geog, Bindura, Zimbabwe; [Chigona, Aaron; Nyahuye, Alleta; Nondo, Ntandokamlimu] Environm Management Agcy, Environm Management Serv Dept, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Mataera-Chanza, Loice] Univ Zimbabwe, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Community Med, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Mundoga, Tanyaradzwa] Minist Environm Water & Climate, Dept Nat Resources Management, Harare, Zimbabwe",University of Zimbabwe,"Chanza, N (corresponding author), Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Dept Geog, Bindura, Zimbabwe.",nchanza@gmail.com,"Chanza, Nelson/ABG-3970-2020; Chigona, Aaron/HOC-5314-2023","Chanza, Nelson/0000-0001-5328-5546; ",,,,,41,11,10,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0343-2521,1572-9893,,GEOJOURNAL,GeoJournal,JUN,2019,84,3,,,,,771,783,,10.1007/s10708-018-9890-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-018-9890-3,,,13,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,IB3DE,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000470147400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The policy intervention has also been observed as a critical package for reducing climate risks. Using the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) program in Ghana, the study investigates the role of SCT to climate change adaptation in rural Ghana. The study employs a mixed-method study using interview schedule and in-depth interviews to obtain responses from 325 LEAP beneficiaries. The quantitative data is analysed descriptively using Statistical Package for Social Sciences while the thematic approach is used to analyse the qualitative data. Chi-Square test is used to determine the relationship between beneficiaries' use of transfer and climate change adaptation. The results of the study revealed that transfer given to beneficiaries is used to engage in mixed off-farm and on-farm activities to include farm intensification, purchasing of early-maturing crop varieties, shea butter/dawadawa processing and purchasing of livestock/poultry to respond to climate-induced events. The Chi-Square results reveal that both off-farm and on-farm activities funded from SCT are significantly associated with climate change adaptation. The study recommends the development of a robust and reliable targeting scheme for increasing enrolment of the most vulnerable population in rural areas to benefit from Social Protection as that is one of the surest ways of reducing rural poverty and vulnerability.","[Yiridomoh, Gordon Yenglier; Bonye, Samuel Ziem] SD Dombo Univ Business & Integrated Dev Studies, Dept Community Dev, Wa, Ghana; [Chireh, Vincent Kuuteyiri] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil IRES, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Derbile, Emmanuel K.] SD Dombo Univ Business & Integrated Dev Studies, Dept Planning, Wa, Ghana",University of British Columbia,"Yiridomoh, GY (corresponding author), SD Dombo Univ Business & Integrated Dev Studies, Dept Community Dev, Wa, Ghana.",yiridomoh@gmail.com,,,,,,,70,1,1,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,JAN 2,2021,26,1,,,,,146,164,,10.1080/13549839.2020.1867839,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2020.1867839,,JAN 2021,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,PT3YI,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000605046700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is often contested who should actively steer and take part in local adaptation, for which reasons and based on what kind of mandate, and with which methods. Planning theory can serve as a helpful reference point for examining the sources of legitimacy for adaptation in an urban context. From a planning perspective, adaptation is concerned with climate change as one out of many issues planning has to respond to. The layered co-existence of planning paradigms in practice suggests diverse, sometimes contradictory sources of legitimacy for urban planning and-as we claim here-also for climate change adaptation. This study examines the legitimacy of adaptation from a planning theoretical perspective in Helsinki, drawing on semi-structured interviews and social network analysis to show how adaptation is commonly understood from a rationalist perspective as an apolitical activity with local authorities' experts designing and implementing adaptation. Nevertheless, some of the central actors understand adaptation as a communicative activity and a common deliberation of solutions. The co-occurrence of disparate paradigms results in ambiguous legitimacy that can impede the successful implementation of local climate change adaptation.","[Klein, Johannes; Mantysalo, Raine; Juhola, Sirkku] Aalto Univ, Land Use Planning & Urban Studies Grp, Dept Real Estate Planning & Geoinformat, Espoo, Finland; [Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland",Aalto University; University of Helsinki,"Klein, J (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Land Use Planning & Urban Studies Grp, Dept Real Estate Planning & Geoinformat, Espoo, Finland.",johannes.klein@aalto.fi; raine.mantysalo@aalto.fi; sirkku.juhola@aalto.fi,"Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Mantysalo, Raine/0000-0002-9109-4764; Klein, Johannes/0000-0003-0721-4063; Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282",Norden Top-level Research Initiative through Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR),Norden Top-level Research Initiative through Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR),"The preparation of this publication has been supported by the Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change through the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR).

Using a regional literature review, we evaluate the role of evolving hybrid forms of adaptive knowledge for coping with environmental and social change. The literature is clear that appreciating local knowledge is not enough; enfranchising people with representative decision-making and resource rights and responsibilities is also required so that people can employ that knowledge toward climate adaptation.

The study was conducted in the North Wollo and Wag Hemra zones of the Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia. It employed both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection. The zones and districts were selected purposively based on the frequency of shocks and the sample Kebeles and sample respondents were selected randomly. Quantitative data were collected using a household survey, whereas qualitative data were collected via focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field observations. While the quantitative data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, the qualitative data were transcribed, coded, organized thematically based on these similarities, and interpreted thematically. The results show that the major climate change-induced shocks in the area were increase in temperature and changes in rainfall-related variables, such as shifts in rainy periods, shortages of rain, and variability of rainfall. In addition, droughts, crop and livestock pests and diseases, and pasture and water scarcity are all widespread in the area. As a result, land degradation and reduced crop and livestock output were identified as the primary impacts due to climate change-induced shocks on smallholder livelihoods. The findings demonstrate that households and communities are extremely vulnerable to climate change-related shocks. To reduce their vulnerability to climate change, smallholder farmers in the area used both autonomous and policy-driven climate change adaptation strategies, such as soil and water conservation practices, haystack preparation, improved crop varieties, fertilizer, pesticide, and herbicide application. Nonetheless, smallholder farmers' vulnerability to climate change-induced shocks persists, owing to the limitations in the implementation of existing adaptation strategies in the area. Limited access to finance, information, and technologies have all been an obstacle in the sector, preventing comprehensive adaptation to climate change. As a result, smallholder farmers' capacity to adopt both autonomous and policy-driven climate change adaptation strategies must be strengthened. Hence use of improved crop and livestock varieties, application of good agricultural practices, construction of micro-and small-scale irrigation structures, and provision of well-coordinated early warning systems are examples of adaptation strategies that could be implemented to reduce vulnerability to climate change-induced shocks and increase farmers' adaptive capacity.","[Tofu, Daniel Assefa] Ambo Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Ambo, Ethiopia; [Woldeamanuel, Teshale] Hawassa Univ, Wondo Genet Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, Awasa, Ethiopia; [Haile, Firafis] Ambo Univ, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Ambo, Ethiopia",Ambo University; Hawassa University; Ambo University,"Tofu, DA (corresponding author), Ambo Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Ambo, Ethiopia.",danasse19@gmail.com,,,United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP),United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),This project was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP).,,82,3,3,2,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2666-1543,,,J AGR FOOD RES,J.

One key point is that all development policy should be formulated using forecasts from climate science as a baseline. When this is not done, there is risk that a false status quo without climate change is seen as an implicit baseline. Another key point is that authors must be clearer about their behavioral assumptions: Many studies either (problematically) assume profit maximization on the side of farm households, or do not specify behavioral assumptions at all. A third important point is that the allocation of rights is crucial for the results; if households have a right to maintain their current livelihoods, the costs of climate change in developing countries are considerably greater than traditional willingness-to-pay studies would indicate. Thus, costs and benefits of climate change adaptation cannot be analyzed using economic aspects only; climate science, behavioral science, and legal and moral aspects have crucial implications for the outcome of the analysis.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Stage, J (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Jesper.Stage@economics.gu.se,"Stage, Jesper/B-6718-2009","Stage, Jesper/0000-0001-7206-6568",,,,,77,30,33,4,48,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER STREET, HOBOKEN, NJ, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-57331-766-5,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2010,1185,,,,,,150,163,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05168.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05168.x,,,14,Ecology; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BOV88,20146767,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000277794400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a place-based and contextual approach to imaginaries, we present emerging dialectics that collectively bring a set of knowledge to address climate adaptation challenges. With the analysis of the Local Adaptation Plans of Action (LAPA) initiative in the Gandaki River Basin, Western Nepal, we explore how local adaptation initiatives promote sociotechnical imaginaries and how it translates to social practice. Drawing on an initial field visit, stakeholder interviews, a scoping review, and the analysis of LAPA documents, this article reveals that local adaptation practices not only are designed to address climatic challenges but are also a response to a host of other ongoing stresses and are firmly connected to local communities. Although the LAPA initiative in Nepal looks innovative, there still is a need to reinforce grassroots-level initiatives and practices with the use of both traditional and modern knowledge and capacity to enhance the adaptation action at the local level. The study of Nepal's LAPA shows how both scientific and traditional knowledge coalesce at the community level as a response to changing climate, illustrating the complex and hybrid nature of climate adaptation.","[Ghimire, Rajiv; Chhetri, Netra] Arizona State Univ, Sch Future Innovat Soc, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Ghimire, R (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Future Innovat Soc, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",rghimir2@asu.edu; Netra.Chhetri@asu.edu,,"Ghimire, Rajiv/0000-0003-1962-1803",USAID; ASU GPSA,USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); ASU GPSA,We are thankful to the USAID-funded Hariyo Ban Program and ASU GPSA for providing dissertation support grants to conduct this research.

Due to difficulties in quantifying adaptation measures, previous studies did not take into account the impacts of adaptation, leading to biased climate change impact assessments. Here, we developed a comprehensive vulnerability assessment method that can systematically consider the quantitative impact of both climate change and adaptation measures on agricultural production. Based on this method, a case study with potato production in Inner Mongolia, China, was conducted. The results showed that during 1961-2018, the climate in Inner Mongolia was warming and drying, and has made a negative effect on potato production. Reasonable increase of the fertilizer and irrigation could enhance the adaptability of potato production to climate change. The appropriate adaptation input could compensate for the adverse effects of climate change. In the future, potato production will be increasingly vulnerable to climate change if there is no increase of adaptation inputs. By 2100, some regions will be unsuitable for potato planting such as Baotou, Huhehaote. Here, a conceptual model of agricultural adaptation to climate change was created (Fig. 7). It is found that the level of adaptation input affects the sensitivity of potato yield to climate, adaptation level is the main factor determining the vulnerability to climate change, and insufficient or excessive adaptation would make potato production more vulnerable. These mechanisms are of great significance to promote the implementation of climate change adaptation.","[Huang, Na; Wang, Jialin; Song, Yu; Pan, Yuying; Han, Guolin; Zhang, Ziyuan; Ma, Shangqian; Sun, Guofeng; Liu, Cong; Pan, Zhihua] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Pan, ZH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",huangna@cau.edu.cn; wangjial@cau.edu.cn; bh2019245624@cau.edu.cn; caupyy@gmail.com; hanguolin@cau.edu.cn; 15901023512@163.com; b20193030283@cau.edu.cn; S20193030216@cau.edu.cn; shuralk@163.com; panzhihua@cau.edu.cn,,,"National Key R&D program of China [2018YFA0606303]; key R&D program of Inner Mongolia, China [2020ZD0005, 2019GG016]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41871086]","National Key R&D program of China; key R&D program of Inner Mongolia, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Key R&D program of China (No. 2018YFA0606303), the key R&D program of Inner Mongolia, China (2020ZD0005, 2019GG016), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41871086).",,65,0,0,8,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

By estimating a recursive bivariate probit model, we show that the use of climate information has no significant impact on the adoption of a climate change adaptation measure. Household heads' decision to adopt a climate change adaptation measure is positively and significantly affected by household size, membership in the farmer-based organization and their perceptions on climate variability. Household heads' decision to use climate information is mainly driven by their marital status, access to extension services, perceptions on climate variability and TV ownership.

However, the conditions for adaptive co-management to emerge and the resulting network structures and relational patterns remain unclear in the literature. To address these identified needs, this study examines social relationships from a network perspective while initiating a collaborative multiactor initiative aimed to develop into adaptive co-management for climate change adaptation, an action research project undertaken in the Niagara region of Canada. The project spanned 1 year, and a longitudinal analysis of participants' networks and level of participation in the process was performed. Evidence of support for climate change adaptation from the process included the development of deliberative and adaptive responses to opportunities presented to the group and the development of a strong subgroup of participants where decision-making was centered. However, the complexity of the challenge of addressing climate change, funding constraints, competing initiatives, and the lack of common views among participants may have contributed to the group, highlighting the finding that beneficial network structural features and relational patterns are necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of an adaptive co-management process. The context of climate change adaptation may require a different social network structure and processes than other contexts for adaptive co-management to occur, and there may be limitations to adaptive co-management for dealing with super wicked problems.","[Baird, Julia; Plummer, Ryan] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Plummer, Ryan; Bodin, Oerjan] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-11419 Stockholm, Sweden",Brock University; Stockholm University,"Plummer, R (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.;Plummer, R (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-11419 Stockholm, Sweden.",jbaird@brocku.ca; rplummer@brocku.ca; orjan.bodin@stockholmresilience.su.se,"Bodin, Örjan/A-5098-2010","Bodin, Örjan/0000-0002-8218-1153",Environment Canada; Brock University; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Mistra; Strategic Research Programme EkoKlim at Stockholm University,Environment Canada(CGIAR); Brock University; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Mistra; Strategic Research Programme EkoKlim at Stockholm University,"The authors thank all the participants in the action research project associated with this paper.

Data collection was conducted by survey methods on 336 maize producers randomly sampled and interviewed based on a questionnaire in North Benin. The results highlighted that farmers' socio-economic characteristics such as contact with extension services, organization membership, access to credit, farm size and observed climate change adaptations such as on-farm diversification, land use changes and other adaptations were found to be the major driving forces underlying the sustainability level of maize farming systems. Among the observed climate change adaptations, on-farm diversification and land use change strategies were found to be sustainable options, whereas other adaptations such as change of activity (e.g. on-farm to off-farm activity), migration to another agro-ecological zone, prayers and access to credit appeared to be unsustainable options.","[Yegbemey, Rosaine N.; Yegbemey, Evince O.; Yabi, Jacob A.] Univ Parakou, Fac Agron, Dept Econ & Sociol Rurales, Lab Anal & Rech Dynam Econ & Sociales, Parakou, Benin",,"Yegbemey, RN (corresponding author), Univ Parakou, Fac Agron, Dept Econ & Sociol Rurales, Lab Anal & Rech Dynam Econ & Sociales, Parakou, Benin.",yrosaine@hotmail.fr,"Yegbemey, Rosaine N/J-8860-2013; Yegbemey, Rosaine Nérice/AAV-1497-2020","Yegbemey, Rosaine N/0000-0003-2051-0289; Yegbemey, Rosaine Nérice/0000-0003-2051-0289","International Foundation for Science, Stockholm, Sweden; German Academic Exchange Service","International Foundation for Science, Stockholm, Sweden(International Foundation for Science); German Academic Exchange Service(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD))","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors would like to thank the International Foundation for Science, Stockholm, Sweden, and the German Academic Exchange Service for financing this research.",,29,8,9,2,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0030-7270,2043-6866,,OUTLOOK AGR,Outlook Agric.,MAR,2017,46,1,,,,,20,27,,10.1177/0030727016689638,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0030727016689638,,,8,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,EM6TE,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000395444300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Building on such considerations, the paper explores the perceptions of port decision makers on the effectiveness of climate adaptation actions. The findings suggest that while port decision makers are aware of potential climate change impacts and feel that more adaptation actions should be undertaken, they are skeptical about their effectiveness and value. This is complemented by a regional analysis on the results, suggesting that more tailor-made adaptation measures suited to local circumstances should be developed. The study illustrates the complexity of climate adaptation planning and of involving port decision makers under the current planning paradigm.","[Ng, Adolf K.

Evolutionary theory can help,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; CULTURAL INHERITANCE; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; SELECTION; VULNERABILITY; RISK; SUSTAINABILITY; BIODIVERSITY; UNCERTAINTY; VARIABILITY,"The idea of adaptation, in which an organism or population becomes better suited to its environment, is used in a variety of disciplines. Originating in evolutionary biology, adaptation has been a central theme in biological anthropology and human ecology. More recently, the study of adaptation in the context of climate change has become an important topic of research in the social sciences. While there are clearly commonalities in the different uses of the concept of adaptation in these fields, there are also substantial differences. We describe these differences and suggest that the study of climate-change adaptation could benefit from a re-integration with biological and evolutionary conceptions of human adaptation. This integration would allow us to employ the substantial theoretical tools of evolutionary biology and anthropology to understand what promotes or impedes adaptation. The evolutionary perspective on adaptation focuses on diversity because diversity drives adaptive evolution. Population structures are also critical in facilitating or preventing adaptation to local environmental conditions. This suggests that climate-change adaptation should focus on the sources of innovation and social structures that nurture innovations and allow them to spread. Truly innovative ideas are likely to arise on the periphery of cohesive social groups and spread inward. The evolutionary perspective also suggests that we pay careful attention to correlated traits, which can distort adaptive trajectories, as well as to the importance of risk management in adaptations to variable or uncertain environments. Finally, we suggest that climate-change adaptation could benefit from a broader study of how local groups adapt to their dynamic environments, a process we call autochthonous adaptation.","[Jones, James Holland] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ready, Elspeth; Pisor, Anne C.] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Behav Ecol & Culture, Leipzig, Germany; [Pisor, Anne C.] Washington State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Stanford University; Max Planck Society; Washington State University,"Jones, JH (corresponding author), Dept Earth Syst Sci, Y2E2 Bldg,473 Via Ortega,Room 140, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jhj1@stanford.edu,"Pisor, Anne C/C-4756-2019; Pisor, Anne/M-9847-2013","Pisor, Anne/0000-0001-5780-4542; Jones, James/0000-0003-1680-6757",,,,,132,6,6,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1042-0533,1520-6300,,AM J HUM BIOL,Am.

However, while climate adaptation planning has become more open to public input, these processes still do not ensure equitable outcomes. This study examined equity concerning climate adaptation planning processes in New York City with a focus on the relationship between community-based organizations and participatory planning. The two planning processes studied here were the OneNYC comprehensive resilience plan and the Zoning for Coastal Flood Resiliency policy. 57 organizations responded to a survey investigating awareness of, participation in, and barriers to engagement with planning. These variables were compared to characteristics of each organization such as the issues they work on and the demographics of their local community boards. This study provides both quantitative and qualitative data demonstrating the roles that community-based organizations have played in climate adaptation planning in New York City. The results of the study demonstrated the existence of multiple barriers to engagement such as the absence of clarity about ongoing processes and a low understanding of how a climate adaptation plan may help an organization achieve its goals. This study has demonstrated that climate change adaptation planning processes should be revised in multiple ways to increase climate justice. The proposed changes are urgently needed because without equitable processes, there will be significant gaps in any cities' climate resilience.","[Rudge, Kieren] Yale Sch Environm, New Haven, CT USA",,"Rudge, K (corresponding author), 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",Kieren.rudge@yale.edu,"Rudge, Kieren/GYA-2936-2022","Rudge, Kieren/0000-0003-1501-1696",Hixon Center for Urban Ecology at the Yale School of the Environment through the Hixon Graduate Student Research Fellowship; Climate Change Science and Solutions Learning Community at the Yale School of the Environment through the Climate Project Fellowship,Hixon Center for Urban Ecology at the Yale School of the Environment through the Hixon Graduate Student Research Fellowship; Climate Change Science and Solutions Learning Community at the Yale School of the Environment through the Climate Project Fellowship,"I would like to thank the funders of this research for their support.

Out of 110 households studied, male household members were absent in 66 cases because they had migrated to nearby towns and regional centres for alternative livelihood options. Male members' absence created opportunities for Gabura women to develop a range of novel adaptation strategies through engagement with aid agencies, changed gender roles, leveraging social capital and utilizing local knowledge. For example, women are increasingly contributing to income through works within and outside of the house in agricultural innovations and handmade productions. These adaptations are built on social capital and trust between community women and the NGOs through mobilization and sharing of local knowledge. Based on the findings, a framework for informed autonomous adaptation is proposed. The generalization of coastal women in developing contexts as passive victims of climate change due to social norms and instead highlights women's active agencies in adaptation is challenged. There is a need for a critical understanding of gender-specific dynamics in post-cyclone aid interventions towards in-situ climate change adaptation.","[Khalil, Momtaj Bintay; Jacobs, Brent C.; McKenna, Kylie] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Ultimo, Australia; [Khalil, Momtaj Bintay] Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Urban & Reg Planning Dept, Khulna 9203, Bangladesh; [Kuruppu, Natasha] UN Univ, Int Inst Global Hlth, Shibuya Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Kuruppu, Natasha] UNEP DTU, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Technology Sydney; Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET); United Nations University; Technical University of Denmark,"Khalil, MB (corresponding author), Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Urban & Reg Planning Dept, Khulna 9203, Bangladesh.",Momtaj.B.Khalil@student.uts.edu.au,,"Khalil, Momtaj Bintay/0000-0003-4286-140X",University of Technology Sydney's Institute for Sustainable Futures,University of Technology Sydney's Institute for Sustainable Futures,"Thanks to the University of Technology Sydney's Institute for Sustainable Futures for supporting the research through the International Research Scholarship.

The present study was designed to identify and assess the adaptation strategies followed by the climate sensitive livestock rearers of coastal Odisha and West Bengal. Livestock rearers (480) were selected from 4 coastal districts of Odisha and West Bengal. The study revealed that 17 adaptation strategies were followed by the livestock rearer. To trace the relative importance among the adaptation strategies, an exclusively climate change adaptation index was developed. It was observed that change in micro-climate in cattle shed/grazing area/stall was the most preferred adaptation strategy followed by providing the frequent clean and fresh drinking water and additional washing/sprinkling of cattle and buffaloes. Livestocks are very much susceptible to heat stress. Therefore, most of the livestock rearers followed heat alleviating adaptation strategies.","[Jha, Sujeet Kumar; Garai, Sanchita; Nag, Arindam; Chakravarty, R.; Kadian, K.

To ensure the coherence of adaptation policies, cooperation is necessary between sectors as well as between administrative levels. As such, fragmentation between both sectors and levels is a huge challenge for the successful formulation and implementation of climate change adaptation policies. Bridging actors who coordinate actions across levels and sectors play an important role in overcoming this challenge. Through means of social network analysis, I investigate which actors occupy key bridging roles in the multi-level and federalist arrangement of Swiss climate change adaptation governance. I analyse a two-mode network of actors and climate change adaptation measures, conducting a complete inventory of all measures and policies carried out in the context of the Swiss adaptation strategy as well as all actors involved in their design, funding and implementation. I find that federal governmental actors occupy the most important bridging roles. However, for the most part, they seem more focused on building cross-sectoral ties than on building cross-level ties. The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) stands out as the one national authority that managed to establish almost as many cross-level ties as cross-sectoral ties through the coordination of an adaptation funding programme Thus, while adaptation measures will primarily be implemented on the municipal level, higher level actors still have a vital role to play in promoting municipal efforts, fostering collaboration and reducing fragmentation.","[Braunschweiger, Dominik] Eidgenoss Forsch Anstalt Wald Schnee & Landschaft, Econ & Social Sci, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Braunschweiger, D (corresponding author), Eidgenoss Forsch Anstalt Wald Schnee & Landschaft, Econ & Social Sci, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",dominik.braunschweiger@wsl.ch,,,Lib4RI -Library for the Research Institutes within the ETH Domain: Eawag; Lib4RI -Library for the Research Institutes within the ETH Domain: Empa; Lib4RI -Library for the Research Institutes within the ETH Domain: PSI; Lib4RI -Library for the Research Institutes within the ETH Domain: WSL; Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) [16.0144.PJ/Q074-1254],Lib4RI -Library for the Research Institutes within the ETH Domain: Eawag; Lib4RI -Library for the Research Institutes within the ETH Domain: Empa; Lib4RI -Library for the Research Institutes within the ETH Domain: PSI; Lib4RI -Library for the Research Institutes within the ETH Domain: WSL; Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN),"Open Access funding provided by Lib4RI -Library for the Research Institutes within the ETH Domain: Eawag, Empa, PSI & WSL.

Thus, it is important to raise awareness of climate-related risks - and opportunities - among forest stakeholders, and engage them in adaptation. However, many social barriers have been shown to hinder adaptation, including perceptions of climate change as irrelevant or not urgent, underestimates of adaptive capacity and lack of trust in climate science. This study looks into how science-based learning experiences can help overcome social barriers to adaptation, and how learning in itself may be hindered by those barriers. The study examines the role of learning in engagement with climate change adaptation with the help of the theory of transformative learning. Our analysis is based on follow-up interviews conducted with 24 Swedish forestry stakeholders who had participated in a series of focus group discussions about climate change impacts and adaptation measures. We find that many stakeholders struggled to form an opinion based on what they perceived as uncertain and contested scientific knowledge. The study concludes that engagement with climate change adaptation can be increased if the scientific knowledge addresses the needs, objectives and aspirations of stakeholders and relates to their previous experiences with climate change and extreme weather events.","[Vulturius, Gregor; Swartling, Asa Gerger] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm Off, S-11523 Stockholm, Sweden; [Vulturius, Gregor] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Swartling, Asa Gerger] Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm Environment Institute; University of Edinburgh; Stockholm University,"Vulturius, G (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm Off, Linnegatan 87 D, S-11523 Stockholm, Sweden.",gregor.vulturius@sei-international.org,"Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/J-1420-2018","Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/0000-0003-3616-7323; Vulturius, Gregor/0000-0001-8899-2267",Swedish Foundation for Environmental Research (Mistra),Swedish Foundation for Environmental Research (Mistra),"The authors would like to thank all participants in this project for their time and interest.

Drawing from 117 online questionnaires and interviews with sector leaders across the Carolinas, the article highlights several key functions of networks in regard to supporting adaptation-intra-sector information sharing; monitoring, data collection, and research; and education and outreach. Furthermore, the analysis examines how climate networks in the region have facilitated the development of bonding, bridging, and linking social capital while also noting factors that have constrained the growth and success of both intra- and cross-sector collaboration. Although no formal, or discrete, state or regional cross-sector climate change network exists in the Carolinas, climate adaptations and capacity-building efforts have been supported by ad hoc and decentralized networks, emerging collegial partnerships within and across sectors, and collaborative efforts to pool expertise and resources. The role of different forms of social capital within these networks is discussed in the context of a contentious political environment where support for activities designed to address climate change is limited. These findings enhance our understanding of the social factors and relational processes that shape and influence capacity to adapt to climate change.","[Dow, Kirstin; Haywood, Benjamin K.; Kettle, Nathan P.; Lackstrom, Kirsten] Univ S Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Haywood, BK (corresponding author), Univ S Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",haywoodb@email.sc.edu,,"Haywood, Benjamin/0000-0003-0336-673X",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program Office [NA060AR4310007],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"This study was part of a larger research project (Lackstrom et al. 2012) funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program Office (NA060AR4310007) and conducted by the Carolinas Integrated Sciences and Assessments (CISA), one of 11 US RISA programs, to serve as a technical input for the 2013 National Climate Assessment.

This capacity may entail social actor's ability to learn from past experience, and create opportunities in the present for dealing with uncertainty and change in the future. However, it also means that actors need to be able to overturn structural barriers that impede anticipatory adaptation to climate change such as lack of political leadership, power imbalances, acceptance of climate risks and willingness to act. While scholarship around questions of structural barriers is common in environmental studies literature, there is less understanding about how future thinking could help to strengthen human agency. Harnessing the temporal and projective attributes of human agency by which social actors can exert influence over the future and create solutions may comprise a promising way forward. This paper investigates how social actors understand past social and environmental change and explores how scenario planning may help actors apply their understanding of changes over time to devise policies for climate change adaptation. The paper applies this exploratory lens to an Australian coastal local government area engaged in scenario planning and adaptation pathways planning. Findings indicate that the temporality aspect of agency applied to solving complex issues and overcoming structural barriers manifests differently from an individual to a collective perspective. This means that while scenario planning and adaptation pathways planning helps with anticipatory identification and experimentation, this may not be sufficient to overturn structural barriers to adaptation in the short-term.","[Serrao-Neumann, Silvia] Univ Waikato, Environm Planning Programme, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Serrao-Neumann, Silvia; Taygfeld, Pazit; Choy, Darryl Low] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Asbridge, Emma F.] Univ Wollongong, Fac Sci Med & Hlth, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Adaptat Response, Gold Coast, Australia; [Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Climate Act Beacon, Gold Coast, Australia; [Rogers, Kerrylee] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth Atmospher & Life Sci, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of Waikato; Griffith University; University of Wollongong; Griffith University; Griffith University; University of Wollongong,"Serrao-Neumann, S (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Environm Planning Programme, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",s.neumann@waikato.ac.nz,,"Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064; Serrao-Neumann, Silvia/0000-0001-9601-4914; Rogers, Kerrylee/0000-0003-1350-4737",Australian Research Council [DP160103371],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP160103371",,62,0,0,1,3,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

Using examples from two municipalities in the context of institutional responses to floods, we find, first, that the institutional framework for flood management in Norway gives weak incentives for proactive local flood management. Second, when strong local political and economic interests coincide with national level willingness to pay and provide support, measures are often carried out rapidly at the expense of weaker environmental interests. Third, we find that new perspectives on flood management are more apparent at the national than the municipal level, as new perspectives are filtered by local power structures. The findings have important implications for vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in terms of policy options and the local level as the optimal level for adaptation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, literature suggests that the governance of adaptation requires roles for both public and private actors so that responsibilities can be shared and all of society's resources can be fully exploited. Active involvement of all societal actors might overcome problems of inefficiency and raise the legitimacy of adaptation action. This article presents a framework that enables the characterization and explanation of existing governance arrangements in terms of responsibility divisions among public and/or private actors, and that facilitates the search for alternative responsibility divisions and their associated advantages and disadvantages. The framework is illustrated with an example of a governance arrangement for green roofs as an adaptation measure for storm water retention in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The merit of the framework is that it promotes the conscious deliberation of considerations in the public-private divide, taking into account some specific challenges to the governance of climate adaptation. It may, therefore, support well-informed decisions on responsibility divisions in climate adaptation by local governments.","[Mees, Heleen L. P.; Driessen, Peter P. J.; Runhaar, Hens A.

However, there is limited research accomplished to date on the process of adaptation of cultural heritage to climate change. This paper examines the perceptions of experts involved in the management and preservation of cultural heritage on adaptation to climate change risks. For this purpose, semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts from the UK, Italy, and Norway as well as a participatory workshop with stakeholders. The results indicate that the majority of interviewees believe that adaptation of cultural heritage to climate change is possible. Opportunities for, barriers to, and requirements for adapting cultural heritage to climate change, as perceived by the interviewees, provided a better understanding of what needs to be provided and prioritized for adaptation to take place and in its strategic planning. Knowledge of management methodologies incorporating climate change impacts by the interviewees together with best practice examples in adapting cultural heritage to climate change are also reported. Finally, the interviewees identified the determinant factors for the implementation of climate change adaptation. This paper highlights the need for more research on this topic and the identification and dissemination of practical solutions and tools for the incorporation of climate change adaptation in the preservation and management of cultural heritage.","[Sesana, Elena; Gagnon, Alexandre S.; Hughes, John] Univ West Scotland, Sch Comp Engn & Phys Sci, High St, Paisley PA1 2BE, Renfrew, Scotland; [Bertolin, Chiara] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Architectural Design Hist & Technol, Alfred Getz Vei 3, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",University of West Scotland; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Hughes, J (corresponding author), Univ West Scotland, Sch Comp Engn & Phys Sci, High St, Paisley PA1 2BE, Renfrew, Scotland.",elena.sesana@uws.ac.uk; alexandre.gagnon@uws.ac.uk; chiara.bertolin@ntnu.no; John.Hughes@uws.ac.uk,"Gagnon, Alexandre S/AFO-7218-2022; Sesana, Elena/AAK-4927-2020; Muñoz-Tuñon, Casiana/AAA-9309-2019; Gagnon, Alexandre S/AAB-6465-2020; Hughes, John J/Q-3740-2019; Gagnon, Alexandre/AFC-8654-2022; Bertolin, Chiara/ABI-3960-2020; Gagnon, Alexandre S/C-2942-2013","Sesana, Elena/0000-0002-6428-4626; Muñoz-Tuñon, Casiana/0000-0001-8876-4563; Gagnon, Alexandre S/0000-0002-1301-6015; Hughes, John J/0000-0001-7633-9607; Bertolin, Chiara/0000-0002-0684-8980; Gagnon, Alexandre S/0000-0002-1301-6015","University of the West of Scotland; Scottish Funding Council; Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society (SAGES)","University of the West of Scotland; Scottish Funding Council; Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society (SAGES)","A university studentship was provided by the University of the West of Scotland to support the doctoral studies of the first author.

In Morogoro, agricultural households have extended cultivation, intensified agriculture, diversified livelihoods and migrated to gain access to land, markets and employment as a response to climatic and other stressors. Some of these responses have depleted and degraded natural resources such as forest, soil and water resources, which will complicate their living with climate change in the future. This will be particularly problematic to vulnerable groups such as women, children and pastoralists who have limited access to employment, markets and public services. In this light, fair adaptation to climate change by agricultural households in Morogoro and elsewhere in developing countries requires several complementary responses. Adaptation efforts should involve effective governance of natural resources because they function as safety nets to vulnerable groups. In addition, strengthening of national markets by infrastructure investments and institutional reforms is needed to give incentives to intensification and diversification in agriculture. Market participation also demands enhancement of human capital by public programs on health, education and wellbeing. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A random sampling technique was used to select 220 household heads, while descriptive statistics and binary logit models were used to analyze the data obtained from the households. We determine that male and female respondents are not significantly different in their knowledge and perceptions of climate change, but there is a gender difference in adopting climate change adaptation measures. Male-headed households are more likely to adopt new technology for water conservation and to increase investment in irrigation infrastructure. The research also indicates that the adaptation decisions of male and female heads are influenced by different sets of factors. The findings of this research help to elucidate the determinants of climate change adaptation decisions for male and female-headed households and the strategic interventions necessary for effective adaptation.

It draws on a diagnostic framework as a foundation for identifying and organising barriers and opportunities in terms of three broad phases of the adaptation process, i.e. (1) understanding the problem, (2) planning adaptation options and (3) managing implementation of such options. Data come from the analysis of documents (e.g. policy, plans and reports) and a survey of 49 representatives from 42 organisations (e.g. government, environmental non-governmental organisations, businesses and local industry and professional associations). Nineteen barriers and/or opportunities pertaining to the different phases of the adaptation process were identified. Three of those barriers (i.e. competing priorities, existing management context and existing ecological context) are our additions to the initial list of common barriers proposed in the diagnostic framework. Barriers pertaining to the understanding phase were the most frequently noted by respondents. The understanding phase was also one which most of the barriers were nevertheless considered as opportunities. Emerging critical barriers and/or opportunities for climate change adaptation included perception of signal, availability and accessibility of information, existing management context and leadership. We propose that addressing these barriers and opportunities would involve improving perception about climate change and availability and accessibility of information, fostering anticipatory planned adaptation through the existing management context and developing leadership for adaptation. Findings from this study may prove useful to other jurisdictions, particularly those where climate adaptation is at its early stages of development.","[Simoes, Eliane; de Sousa Junior, Wilson C.; de Freitas, Debora M.; Iwama, Allan Y.; Goncalves, Isabel; Olivato, Debora] Aeronaut Inst Technol, Dept Water Resources & Environm, Pca Mal Eduardo Gomes,50 CTA IEI, BR-12228900 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [de Freitas, Debora M.] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Biosci Inst, Coastal Campus,Praca Infante Dom Henrique S-N, Sao Vicente, SP, Brazil; [Mills, Morena] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Fidelman, Pedro] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia",Universidade Estadual Paulista; Imperial College London; University of the Sunshine Coast,"Simoes, E (corresponding author), Aeronaut Inst Technol, Dept Water Resources & Environm, Pca Mal Eduardo Gomes,50 CTA IEI, BR-12228900 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil.",simoeslica@gmail.com,"De Freitas, Debora/E-7561-2011; Iwama, Allan Yu/V-3511-2019; Sousa Junior, Wilson/J-8576-2014; M de Freitas, Debora/HNB-8940-2023; Mills, Morena/AAD-8916-2019; Fidelman, Pedro/N-1466-2014; Mills, Morena/C-6546-2013","De Freitas, Debora/0000-0002-0374-5732; Iwama, Allan Yu/0000-0003-1707-8392; Sousa Junior, Wilson/0000-0001-6176-2410; Fidelman, Pedro/0000-0001-7780-0952; Mills, Morena/0000-0001-9865-0770",CAPES/RedeLitoral (Project CAPES) [417/2010],CAPES/RedeLitoral (Project CAPES),This research was funded by CAPES/RedeLitoral (Project CAPES 417/2010).

In response to this, fishers have resorted to using some climate change adaptation strategies(CCAS). This study assessed whether or not climate change adaptation strategies used by inland artisanal fishers improve fish catchability along the Volta Lake in Ghana. The study used primary cross-sectional data. A conditional mixed-process (CMP) with an ordered probit outcome was used to estimate the effects of climate change adaptation strategies on fish catchability. The climate change adaptation strategies used by fishers in the study area are; increasing daily fishing time, increasing fishing efforts, changing fishing time, aquaculture production, migrating to another fishing area, fishing further away or deep inside the water, catching smaller fish, participation in alternative non-fishing livelihoods and taking a moratorium in fishing. It was evident that the more climate change adaptation strategies fishers use, the more fish they catch per unit man effort. It is prudent for stakeholders promoting climate change adaptation strategies and sustainable fishing especially the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development to promote these strategies in fishing. More emphasis should be placed on sustainable climate change adaption strategies such as aquaculture production and implementation of close fishing seasons.","[Mabe, Franklin Nantui] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Agribusiness & Commun Sci, Tamale, Ghana; [Asase, Amos] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Sch Nat Resources, Dept Fisheries & Water Resources, Sunyani, Ghana",University for Development Studies,"Mabe, FN (corresponding author), Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Agribusiness & Commun Sci, Tamale, Ghana.",mfnantui@uds.edu.gh; amos.asase@uenr.edu.gh,,,West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL); Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under Building Local Capacity for Policy-Oriented Research in Adaptation and Mitigation in West Africa (BLOC) Award,West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL); Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under Building Local Capacity for Policy-Oriented Research in Adaptation and Mitigation in West Africa (BLOC) Award(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),We acknowledge the financial support received from West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) and Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under Building Local Capacity for Policy-Oriented Research in Adaptation and Mitigation in West Africa (BLOC) Award.,,45,7,7,2,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-7836,1872-6763,,FISH RES,Fish Res.,OCT,2020,230,,,,,,,,105675,10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105675,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105675,,,8,Fisheries,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Fisheries,MR1XZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000553385900043,View Full Record in Web of Science

This framing is often used to attract adaptation investment in islands, the targets and directives of which are frequently market-based and oriented toward economic-growth development models. In Fiji, this takes the form of land tenure policy and efforts to attract investment to support agricultural modernization. Such a pattern is the source of scholarly and activist critique that climate change adaptation is nothing more than a repackaging of neoliberal development. This paper seeks to situate such critique alongside parallel attention to climate change adaptation practices emerging from alternative, hopeful frames and aimed at less national development driven efforts. In doing so, it centers adaptation as a space of unsettled struggle and asks, in what ways do climate change adaptation practices in Fiji align and conflict with dominant framing of island vulnerability and climate catastrophe, and how might they suggest alternative adaptive interventions that renegotiate these frames? Specifically, this paper focuses on efforts to promote 'traditional' agriculture throughout Fiji as an endogenous and hopeful form of adaptation, and one consistently opposed to efforts at agricultural modernization as an adaptation strategy.","[Griswold, Delilah] Cornell Univ, Dept Global Dev, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Griswold, D (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Global Dev, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",djg327@cornell.edu,,,,,,,70,3,3,0,2,Island Studies Journal,Copenhagen,"c/o Adam Grydehj, Lillegrund 39, Copenhagen, DENMARK",,1715-2593,,ISL STUD J,Isl.

Many of the adjustments in farm management that farmers adopt do not necessarily represent true adaptations to climate change, an issue often ignored in existing literature and resulting in a risk that policy makers are misled to think that adaptation is easier than it actually is, and thereby underestimate the challenge that climate change presents. The overall goal of this study is to identify whether farmers' adoptions are enhancing food production and adapting to climate change. The identification uses a plot-level panel from a survey of 619 rural households in three provinces in China and county-level weather data. With the use of plot and county-by-year fixed effects as well as instrumental variable approaches, our estimates show that the autonomous adoptions are not effective in improving crop yields. This implies that farmers' adoptions cannot be always considered adaptations to climate change. The paper provides a possible explanation for the results and concludes with policy implications.","[Wang, Yangjie; Chen, Xiaohong] Cent South Univ, Sch Business, 932 Lushan South Rd, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yangjie; Chen, Xiaohong] Resource Conserving & Environm Friendly Soc & Eco, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiaohong] Hunan Univ Commerce, Key Lab Hunan Prov Mobile Business Intelligence, Changsha 410205, Hunan, Peoples R China",Central South University; Hunan University of Technology & Business,"Wang, YJ (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Business, 932 Lushan South Rd, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Wang, YJ (corresponding author), Resource Conserving & Environm Friendly Soc & Eco, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.",yangjie.wang@csu.edu.cn,"chen, xia/GXM-5435-2022; chen, xia/GYR-3948-2022; chen, xi/GXH-3653-2022",,"National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [71873148, 71503276, 71431006]; Ministry of Education [16JZD013]; Sciences Foundation of Hunan in China [2016JJ3156, 16YBA362]",National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education; Sciences Foundation of Hunan in China,"This research received financial support from the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (71873148, 71503276, 71431006), Ministry of Education (16JZD013), and Sciences Foundation of Hunan in China (2016JJ3156, 16YBA362).",,40,0,0,10,38,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

This study examines the availability of various types of information used in climate adaptation plans of 40 municipalities with a population of less than 300,000 people in the United States and France, probing into the choice and usage of relevant information by small municipalities. We argue that non-climatic spatial data, such as population demographic and socio-economic patterns, urban infrastructure, and environmental data must be integrated with climate tools and datasets to inform effective vulnerability assessment and equitable adaptation planning goals. Most climate adaptation plans examined in this study fail to address the existing structural inequalities and environmental injustices in urban infrastructure and land use. Their challenges include methodological and ideological barriers, data quality issues, and a lack of meaningful community connections. Adaptation methodological approaches should be reassessed in the context of much-needed societal transformation.

It targeted Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara States in the North-West, Nigeria that are among the major rice producing States in the country. A multistage sampling procedure was used to obtain a sample of 522 farmers for the study. The data were obtained with the aid of structured interview schedule were analysed using both descriptive (frequency counts, percentages, ranges and means) and inferential (Chi-square) statistics. Findings of the study reveal that the majority (96%) of the respondents had their income from rice production, within the (sic)50,000.00 to (sic)499,999.00 (143 to 1,429 USD) range. The mean rice income was (sic)308, 742.00 (882 USD). The majority (84.48%) and (77.40%) of the respondents used improved rice varieties and intercropping as climate change adaptation practices, respectively. Other climate change adaptation practices used by the rice farmers included moderate use of fertilizers (93.10%) and other chemicals (89.85%), as well as use of organic manure (99.43%). The farmers also adjusted the planting calendar through early planting (92.34%) and early harvesting (93.10%). Similarly, the majority (89.85%) of the respondents made mounds and ridges across slopes while 96.17% and 89.08% used rivers/streams and dug wells for irrigation. About 51% of the rice farmers spent (sic)5,000.00 - (sic)370,999.00 of their rice income on vehicles. 54% spent (sic)8,000.00 - (sic)92,299.00 of their rice income on electronics and only about 14% spent (sic)4,000.00 - (sic)102,999.00 of their rice income on land and housing. There was a significant (X-2 = 258.6325; p < 0.00) relationship between farmers' use of climate change adaptation practices and their level of living.

Adaptive management strategies have become an important tactic to compensate for the unknown environmental conditions that coastal managers and restoration ecologists face. Adaptive management requires extensive planning and resources, which can act as barriers to achieve a successful project. These barriers also create challenges in incorporating adaptive management into climate change adaptation strategies. This case study describes and analyzes the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council's approach to overcome these challenges to implement a successful adaptive management project to restore a drowning salt marsh using the climate change adaptation strategy, sediment enhancement, at Quonochontaug Pond in Charlestown, RI.

Microfinance services (MFS) are recognised as tools for helping to reduce the vulnerability of the poor. If this is indeed the case, then the possibility of linking MFS to climate change adaptation deserves careful consideration. MFS can provide poor people with the means to diversify, accumulate and manage the assets needed to become less susceptible to shocks and stresses and/or better able to deal with their impacts. Yet these links may not hold for everybody. MFS typically do not reach the chronically poor, may encourage short-term coping instead (or at the expense) of longer-term vulnerability reduction, or even increase vulnerability. These limitations and risks aside, MFS can still play an important role in vulnerability reduction and climate change adaptation among some of the poor, provided services better match client needs and livelihoods.","[Matthew, Richard] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Ecol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Matthew, Richard] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Sci, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [McCarter, Elissa] Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [McCarter, Elissa] Inst Etud Polit Paris, Paris, France",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Georgetown University,,,"de Groot, M/A-2025-2012",,,,,,33,49,50,0,15,INST DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,BRIGHTON,"UNIV SUSSEX, BRIGHTON BN1 9RE, E SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0265-5012,1759-5436,,IDS BULL-I DEV STUD,IDS Bull.-Inst.

Although the extant literature has described factors that explain climate change adaptation, the roles of proactive versus reactive adaptation related to perceived vulnerability are still underexplored. The aim of our study was to open a new angle of discussion by linking farmers' perceptions of vulnerability with their adaptation response, and exploring the dynamic of such a relationship. Semi-structured interviews with farmers were held in the Maule Region of central Chile (n = 36). The interview included questions o about main agricultural challenges, perceptions of climate change and its impact, adaptation strategies, and perceptions of vulnerability, exposure, sensitivity, and ability to adapt. In order to interpret the interview data, a content analysis procedure was followed. The results indicate that farmers respond differently by either engaging in proactive or reactive adaptation behavior. Furthermore, the patterns of either proactive or reactive adaptation behavior can be explained by structural factors and social and human capital. While structural factors, such as production systems and financial capital, explain engaging in adaptation to climate change, social and human capital act as enhancing factors that explain proactive adaptation. Future policies on adaptation behavior should focus on promoting proactive forms of adaptation behavior by developing and enhancing social connections and access to information, as well as on the provision of financial schemes to enable efficient and effective adaptation within the agricultural sector.","[Engler, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Agr Econ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4686, Santiago 8330024, Chile; [Engler, Alejandra] Nucleo Milenio Ctr CESIEP, Talca 3460000, Chile; [Rotman, Marieke L.; Poortvliet, P.

Based on this analysis, recommendations are made for the implementation of the Territorial Agenda of the European Union. The central research hypotheses addressed in this article are: (1) climate change impacts in Europe are distributed differently in European regions which influence the design of national adaptation strategies (NASs) in Europe as well as the planning-related fields of action; (2) the legal framework and the political-administrative system significantly determine how national adaptation responses are designed and by which institutions they are implemented and (3) spatial planning has the potential to play an important role in climate change adaptation due to its integrative, cross-sectoral character. In order to discuss the hypotheses, a meta-evaluation of already existing assessments of climate adaptation strategies was carried out, as well as nine in-depth country studies (Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Spain, The Netherlands and the UK). The results show that spatial planning is only given minor attention in the assessed analyses and national strategies and that it is rather a matter of political willingness and capacity building than particular instruments or a high climate change vulnerability if spatial planning, however, plays an important role in an NAS.","[Greiving, Stefan; Fleischhauer, Mark] TU Dortmund, Inst Spatial Planning, Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Greiving, S (corresponding author), TU Dortmund, Inst Spatial Planning, Dortmund, Germany.",stefan.greiving@tu-dortmund.de,,,,,,,41,52,55,0,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-4313,1469-5944,,EUR PLAN STUD,Eur.

This paper elaborates on this balance with an overview of disaster risk financing mechanisms and how they contribute to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation in developing countries. We suggest a risk management approach that targets risk reduction and risk financing to different layers of risk, including a layer that represents a possible limit to adaptation. By reviewing traditional post-disaster financial arrangements, such as government compensation, and non-traditional pre-disaster instruments, such as index-based insurance, we show how risk financing can complement and stimulate risk reduction. We discuss the benefits of financial instruments, including the provision of post-disaster finances for recovery and pre-disaster security necessary for climate adaptation and poverty reduction. These benefits come at a cost, and we discuss the risks, challenges, and future prospects of risk financing in developing countries.","[Linnerooth-Bayer, Joanne; Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Hochrainer-Stigler, S (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",bayer@iiasa.ac.at; hochrain@iiasa.ac.at,,"Bayer, Joanne/0000-0003-3084-2471; Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan/0000-0002-9929-8171",,,,,59,71,71,5,86,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

One source of uncertainty in complex SESs is ambiguity, defined as the range and variety of existing perceptions in and of an SES, which are considered equally valid, resulting in a lack of a unique or single system understanding. Current modelling practices that acknowledge the presence of ambiguity in SESs focus on finding consensus with stakeholders; however, advanced methods for explicitly representing and aggregating ambiguity in SESs are underdeveloped. Moreover, understanding the influences of ambiguity on SES representation is limited. This paper demonstrates the presence and range of ambiguities in endogenous and exogenous system drivers and internal relationships based on individual fuzzy cognitive maps derived from stakeholder perceptions of climate change adaptation in Kenya and introduces an ambiguity based modelling process. Our results indicate that acknowledging ambiguity fundamentally changes SES representation and more advanced methods are required.","[de Jong, Charlotte Esmeralda] Wageningen Univ & Res, Soil Geog & Landscape Grp, PO Gox 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kok, Kasper] Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Syst Anal Broup, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [de Jong, Charlotte Esmeralda] Hanze Univ Appl Sci, Inst Future Environm, NoorderRuimte, Zernikepl 7,POB 3037, NL-9701 DA Groningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"de Jong, CE (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Soil Geog & Landscape Grp, PO Gox 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.;de Jong, CE (corresponding author), Hanze Univ Appl Sci, Inst Future Environm, NoorderRuimte, Zernikepl 7,POB 3037, NL-9701 DA Groningen, Netherlands.",c.e.de.jong@pl.hanze.nl,,"de Jong, Charlotte/0000-0003-2946-360X; Kok, Kasper/0000-0002-6319-9227",Dutch partners of the SENSES project (NWO) [438.17.810]; BMBF (DE); BMWFW (AT); NWO (NL); FORMAS (SE); European Union [690462],Dutch partners of the SENSES project (NWO); BMBF (DE)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); BMWFW (AT); NWO (NL); FORMAS (SE); European Union(European Commission),"This research was funded by the Dutch partners of the SENSES project (NWO), Grant number 438.17.810.

All comparisons were based on either regular survey questions or on the results of a choice experiment.

Although there is significant research on adaptation planning processes, there is scant empirical evidence of how local governments are completing the adaptation planning cycle by monitoring or evaluating their efforts. This leads to a fundamental lack of understanding about what actions work, in which contexts, and why? This article explores the practice of monitoring and evaluation of adaptation by local government, drawing on data from a national survey of Australian local governments, enhanced by interviews with selected respondents. It finds that monitoring and evaluation of climate change adaptation is challenging for local governments. Monitoring efforts focus on tracking implementation of actions, and evaluation of adaptation plans and projects is rare. It argues that for effective adaptation planning and learning, greater attention needs to be paid to building evaluative capacity of local governments to complete the adaptation planning cycle.","[Scott, Helen; Moloney, Susie] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Scott, H (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",helen.scott@rmit.edu.au,"Scott, Helen/AAV-5861-2021","Scott, Helen/0000-0001-5339-5016; Moloney, Susie/0000-0002-3177-3618",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)",The corresponding author was supported by the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.,,103,3,3,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Stakeholder participation has been hailed as a facilitated approach in climate change adaptation that supports social learning, depolarization of perceptions, and fosters collective action. But stakeholder participation remains loosely interpreted and evaluating measures are limited. This study employs social network analysis (SNA) to investigate how social relations among stakeholders, which emerge as a result of participation, are associated with stakeholder learning, as changes in perceptions of climate change. We hypothesized that reciprocal ties of understanding, respect, and influence can predict changes in perceptions of climate change. This approach was applied to a case study in Deal Island Peninsula, Maryland (USA) where local residents, scientists, and government officials met from 2016 to 2018 to collaboratively manage the impacts of sea-level rise in their communities. We found that social relations based on mutual understanding, respect, and influence are positively associated with perceptions of climate change. We provide a detailed conceptualization and implementation of a network-based approach that may serve as a potential quantitative performance measure of stakeholder participation processes in climate change adaptation. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence of the role that emerging social relations have on enhancing or constraining social learning among stakeholders in the Deal Island Peninsula project.","[Teodoro, Jose Daniel; Sun, Laixiang] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Teodoro, Jose Daniel; Prell, Christina] Univ Groningen, Dept Cultural Geog, Groningen, Netherlands",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Groningen,"Teodoro, JD (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",teodoro@umd.edu,"Sun, Laixiang/ABB-2622-2021","Sun, Laixiang/0000-0002-7784-7942; Teodoro, Jose Daniel/0000-0002-6904-2829; Prell, Christina/0000-0003-2693-0065","Maryland Sea Grant [SA75281450N]; Maryland Sea Grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce [NA18OAR4170070 R/CL-2]","Maryland Sea Grant; Maryland Sea Grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce","We would like to acknowledge the Deal Island Peninsula stakeholders and practitioners who provided valuable feedback.

An important social factor influencing outcomes is communication or the way information spreads through groups of people who need adaptation support. A community's unique information-sharing potential can be understood through social network analysis. A social network perspective views humans as actors in a system of interconnected relationships. This approach is useful for mapping information flows or how adaptation strategies can spread within a community. Through a study with coffee farmers in Risaralda, Colombia, we demonstrate how a community's network strengths can be identified in order to develop tailored climate change adaptation communication strategies. To do this, we measure ego networks, which are social relations stemming from one unit of interest, or coffee farmers, around climate change. From there, we identify the information attributes or the preferred ways farmers receive and send information on climate change. Lastly, we analyze this data against the broader stakeholder system to provide a macro level context. Together, this provides a clear vision of how climate change adaptation strategies may be spread through a community's information network. For coffee farmers in Risaralda, Colombia, key institutions and their agents do not currently acknowledge long-term climate change. The farmers interact the most on this subject with their self-organizing associations. Therefore, targeting information campaigns to local associations offers the most potential for effective climate change adaptation information-sharing, and these same associations also offer the in-person communication these farmers indicate they prefer.","[Eise, Jessica] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Commun, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Lambert, Natalie J.] Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Wiemer, Eric C.] Purdue Univ, Brian Lamb Sch Commun, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Eise, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Commun, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",jessica.eise@utsa.edu,,,,,,,60,2,2,2,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Innovations in this sector are being promoted as part of the adaptation solutions to this problem. In this paper, we use available data on water-related climate change adaptation technological developments to examine the degree to which the vulnerability to climate change in the water sector is motivating these innovations. Using pooled data for African countries between 1990 and 2016, we estimate the relationship between climate-induced vulnerability in the water sector and water-related innovations, controlling for country size and proxies for technology transfer environment, institutional and regulatory quality, knowledge base, and research and development activity. Data on innovative activity shows evidence of over-dispersion; thus we use the negative binomial distribution with robust standard errors for estimation of our model. We find evidence that countries most exposed to water stress are innovating at lower rates. Though counterintuitive, this result is explained by the fact that such vulnerable countries also tend to have little research and development infrastructure needed to develop the kind of high quality innovations that usually necessitate patenting. Our result suggests that African countries experiencing water stress may need to reconsider priorities in the design of water-related adaptation to climate change. We also find that a country's knowledge base and openness to trade are important determinants of adaptation technologies in the water sector. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Observed trends and projected future evolutions of climatic and cryospheric variables clearly show the need to adapt to these changes. Accordingly, the topics addressed herein have been put on the agendas of many larger funding agencies. This article provides a brief overview on major ongoing activities on glacier, snow and related runoff research in order to then analyze data gaps and research needs from a climate change adaptation perspective. Major data needs are identified with respect to the spatial and temporal coverage of local-scale data and related needs for (data) services that distribute and maintain these data sets. Moreover, clear research needs are also recognized at the local scale where process knowledge needs to be improved (e.g., the influence of albedo on snow and ice or debris cover on glaciers) in order to derive plausible climate change impacts assessments. The paper then discusses directions on how to move forward to better serve the practical needs for climate change adaptation planning. In the future, substantial support by large funding agencies might be key for capacity building in target regions of climate change adaptation programs, for longer-term and more sustainable commitments, and for the development of approaches, which aim at assessing the transferability of data, techniques, and tools.

In this paper, the Strategic Forest Management Plans for the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Traditional Territory (CATT) and the Teslin Tlingit Traditional Territory (TTTT) are examined for evidence of adaptation to climate change. For each plan, management policies and practices that are also recognized as ways to adapt to climate change are identified to provide information on the incremental costs and benefits of additional adaptation efforts. A typology for classifying sustainable forest management plans according to how they address climate change is proposed and applied to the CATT and TTTT plans. This typology, which may be useful to any future retrospective assessments on how successful these or other sustainable forest management plans have been in addressing and managing the risks posed by climate change, consists of a matrix that categorizes plans into one of four types; (1) proactive-direct, (2) proactive-indirect, (3) reactive-direct, and (4) reactive-indirect. Neither of the plans available for the southern Yukon explicitly identifies climate change vulnerabilities and actions that will be taken to reduce those vulnerabilities and manage risks. However, both plans have incorporated some examples of 'best management practices' for sustainable forest management that are also consistent with appropriate climate adaptation responses. Even in a jurisdiction facing rapid ecological changes driven by climate change, where there is a relatively high level of awareness of climate change and its implications, forestry planning processes have yet to grapple directly with the risks that climate change may pose to the ability of forest managers to achieve the stated goals and objectives of sustainable forest management plans.","[Ogden, A.

We analysed the role of social capital in regulating and mobilising other livelihood assets from a gendered perspective and found that gender norms explain the division and interactions of men and women in formal and informal networks.

Yet, this new paradigm and its effects are not unproblematic, as the empirical research in three East African countries presented in this article indicates. The article argues that the current transformation of environmental governance reflects not only climate change as such, but also - and perhaps even more so - the discourse of a changing climate and its effect on development politics. The empirical evidence shows that African farmers, politicians and government officials often respond to the new 'adaptation paradigm' more readily than to directly felt phenomena caused by a changing climate. We therefore argue that the ontology of the concept of adaptation to climate change needs to be readjusted. Epistemologically, our concern is to trace the discourse of adaptation to climate change across multiple sites, i.e. how it 'travels' between global epistemic communities and adaptation projects in developing countries. Drawing on actor-network theory and its concept of translation, we provide an alternative view of adaptation to climate change by highlighting the contested and multi-sited narratives and practices that bring adaptation into being.","[Weisser, Florian; Doevenspeck, Martin] Univ Bayreuth, Inst Geog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Bollig, Michael] Univ Cologne, Inst Social Anthropol, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Mueller-Mahn, Detlef] Univ Bonn, Inst Geog, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",University of Bayreuth; University of Cologne; University of Bonn,"Weisser, F (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Inst Geog, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",florian.weisser@uni-bayreuth.de; michael.bollig@uni-koeln.de; doevenspeck@uni-bayreuth.de; mueller-mahn@geographie.uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,56,68,68,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0016-7398,1475-4959,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

Paradigm-shifting developments, however, can be highly contested and produce diverse outcomes. New insights are needed as to how tensions and uncertainties emerging from these developments shape adaptive capacity. This article investigates the extent to which a sustainable pathway for economic development offers a systemic fix for increasing this capacity through overcoming general vulnerability. It presents an analytical framework based on a multistage project that involved a transforming fishing town in South China being turned into a popular tourist destination. We argue that a given package of prodevelopment policies and strategies might result in multiple forms of adjustments and transformations, each reflecting a different facet of the nexus between economic development and adaptation. This study shows a mixed picture. Adaptive capacity is increasing, due to the decreasing resource dependency and new hazard management initiatives, yet local economies and demographic regimes are experiencing substantial restructuring. These transformations threaten to increase the opportunity cost of climate-resilient land uses and destabilize some of the social conditions underlying existing adaptive capacities. Heightened tensions concerning what to sustain and what is vulnerable marginalize long-term considerations. This article concludes that although development is directed toward a sustainable path, the politicized and side-tracking process of transformation could reinforce vulnerability.

This study aimed to assess the degree to which climate change adaptation measures are mainstreamed into the water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) development planning process in Ghana. Stakeholders from government and non-government agencies were interviewed to gain perspectives on the threat of climate change, the inclusion of climate change in WaSH planning and the barriers preventing mainstreaming. Despite awareness of climate change, adaptation measures have not been considered, and the immediateWaSH needs remain the priority. Overall, stakeholders felt the adaptive capacity of the Municipality was low and that mainstreaming has not yet occurred.

Nonmaterial or subjective attributes of adaptation (e.g. identity, beliefs, and values) are more difficult to quantify, and research in this area is less developed. Further effort is required to develop and test frameworks that facilitate a systematic examination of the subjective attributes of climate change adaptation. This article outlines the contribution of place identity theory as a lens through which to systematically examine how personplace bonds influence climate change adaptation. We provide a working typology of three interconnected place identity approaches to help elucidate this relationship. Each has strengths and weaknesses, depending on the theoretical and practical contexts within which they are used. The cognitive-behavioral approach has important utility in addressing how place identity shapes climate change perceptions and behavior; it can, however, be limited due to cognitive complexity and lack of richness from quantitative methodologies. The health and well-being approach addresses the often underemphasized health and well-being impacts from climate change on place and identity, though the subjective nature of health must be considered in such an approach. The collective action approach offers important insight into using place identity as a mechanism to foster collective opportunities for climate change adaptation. With such an approach, however, care must be taken to ensure inclusive representation of subgroup identities. We conclude by reflecting on how place identity theory can foster improved understanding in a critically important and emerging area of climate change adaptation research.

Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from two sub-watersheds of Anjeni: the Minchet sub-watershed (with SWC measures) and the Zikrie sub-watershed (without SWC measures). Soil samples were taken from 30-cm depth from five representative landscape positions and analyzed following the standard soil lab analysis procedures. The results show that soils from the conserved sub-watershed had improved quality indicators compared with those from the non-conserved site. Significant improvement due to SWC measures was observed in the soil hydrological [total moisture content (+543%), field capacity (+535%), and available water capacity (+418%)] and chemical [cation exchange capacity (+440cmol(+)kg(-1)), Mg2+ (+190cmol(+)kg(-1)), Na+ (+010cmol(+)kg(-1))] properties. SWC interventions significantly reduced soil erosion by 57-81% and surface runoff by 19-50% in the conserved sub-watershed. Reduction in soil erosion can maintain the soil organic carbon stock, reduce the land degradation risks, and enhance the C sequestration potential of soils. Therefore, adoption of SWC measures can increase farmers' ability to offset emissions and adapt to climate change. However, SWC measures that are both protective and sufficiently productive have not yet been implemented in the conserved sub-watershed. Therefore, it is important that SWC structures be supplemented with other biological and agronomic measures in conjunction with soil fertility amendments appropriate to site-specific conditions.

Hence, this study was initiated to assess the socioeconomic contribution of dry forests to climate change adaptation in Tigray Region, Ethiopia. A mixed quantitative and qualitative research design was used to examine the role of dry forests in climate change adaptation. Household questionnaire survey, key informants, and a focus group discussion were used to collect data. The results indicated that 94% of all households visited a dry forest at least once a month to access the forest and forest products. While the dry forest income level varied significantly (p < 0.05), the overall dry forest income level contributed to 16.8% of the total household income. Dry forest income enabled the reduction of the area between the line of equality and the Lorenz curve by 21% in dry evergreen Afromontane Forest users, by 3.02% in Combretum-Terminalia woodland users, and by 3% in Acacia-Commiphora woodland users. Gender, occupation, wealth status, and distance from the forest to their homes are all factors that significantly affected Combretum-Terminalia woodland users' income level. Among Acacia-Commiphora woodland users, the respondents' age influenced the dry forest income level, whereas, among dry evergreen Afromontane Forest users, the family size of the household influenced the dry forest income level. The findings of this study could help policy makers understand the crucial role of dry forest income in the livelihood of the community and in climate change adaptation. Policymakers could reduce the pressure on dry forests by introducing policies that recognize the role of dry forest income in reducing poverty and income inequality and by establishing farmer cooperation in commercializing the non-timber forest products which support the long-term coping and adaptation strategy. Further research is needed to understand the increasing role of dry forest products in climate change adaptation over time and its contribution to the national economy at large.","[Tesfaye, Musse; Eshetu, Shibire Bekele; Loehr, Katharina; Sieber, Stefan] Leibniz Zentrum Agrarlandschaftsforsch ZALF eV, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Tesfaye, Musse] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Int Forestry & Forest Prod, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany; [Manaye, Ashenafi] Tigray Inst Policy Studies, Mekelle 7000, Ethiopia; [Tesfamariam, Berihu] Mekelle Environm & Forest Res Ctr, Ethiopian Environm & Forest Res Inst, Mekelle 7000, Ethiopia; [Mekonnen, Zenebe] Ethiopian Environm & Forest Res Inst, Addis Ababa 24536, Ethiopia; [Eshetu, Shibire Bekele; Sieber, Stefan] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Loehr, Katharina] Humboldt Univ, Urban Plant Ecophysiol, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Technische Universitat Dresden; Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Lohr, K (corresponding author), Leibniz Zentrum Agrarlandschaftsforsch ZALF eV, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.;Lohr, K (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Urban Plant Ecophysiol, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",katharina.loehr@zalf.de,"Zeratsion, Berihu Tesfamariam/AAD-4372-2019","Zeratsion, Berihu Tesfamariam/0000-0002-6665-5785; Sieber, Stefan/0000-0002-4849-7277; Mekonnen, Zenebe/0000-0002-3522-0420",Ethiopian Environment and Forestry Research Institute; Ethiopian Forestry Development; Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association,Ethiopian Environment and Forestry Research Institute; Ethiopian Forestry Development; Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association,"This research was funded by the then Ethiopian Environment and Forestry Research Institute, now merged with Ethiopian Forestry Development.

Droughts and floods in 2015-16 had devastating effects on food production, crop failures and livestock deaths reaching record levels. One of the underlying projects of the Tanzanian government to mitigate these impacts is the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridors of Tanzania (SAGCOT), an area spanning the country's largest river basin, the Rufiji, where it collaborates with national and transnational companies to intensify irrigated crop production. Irrigation, drought-tolerant seeds, and employment are three of the key government-advised strategies to help smallholders increase crop yield, adapt to climate change, and alleviate poverty through the corridor. However, little research is available on whether these goals have been achieved. This paper aims to contribute to the literature by assessing harvest and income levels following the 2015-16 drought. Through fieldwork conducted in 2016-17 in Usangu, a key paddy production area in the Great Ruaha Basin within SAGCOT, data is collected from documents and 114 informants. This study finds that irrigation did not significantly contribute to rising paddy production in the case study. Prioritizing the downstream national park and the energy sector, the government periodically cut down the water access of the case-study irrigation scheme, which exacerbated water stress. Moreover, though farmers widely shifted to intensive farming and used hybrid seeds, mainly, the high-income groups ensured and increased the crop yield and profit. The-low income groups encountered crop failure and, due to rising production costs, debt. Many of them left farming, impoverished, and sought to secure subsistence through wage laboring. This study discusses the shortcomings of the transitions from traditional to intensive farming and from farming to employment as climate change adaptation strategies and draws critical policy-relevant conclusions.","[Ires, Idil] Humboldt Univ, Fac Humanities Social Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Ires, Idil] Kings Coll London, London, England",Humboldt University of Berlin; University of London; King's College London,"Ires, I (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Fac Humanities Social Sci, Berlin, Germany.;Ires, I (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, London, England.",idil.ires@kcl.ac.uk,,"Ires, Idil/0000-0002-4274-6965",German Research Foundation (DFG); Open Access Publication Fund of HumboldtUniversitat zu Berlin,German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publication Fund of HumboldtUniversitat zu Berlin,I acknowledge support by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Open Access Publication Fund of HumboldtUniversitat zu Berlin.,,144,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Our study is relevant to Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems because the research site is located in Kunisaki Peninsula in Japan, which is conventionally prone to drought. We examined how producers have been coping with climate change by adopting low- and middle-temperature varieties of shiitake, Lentinula edodes. This survey collected qualitative and quantitative data at the field level. Qualitative data were derived from interviews with shiitake producers, cooperative staff members, government officials, and a wholesaler followed by a quantitative survey. Moreover, a workshop was organized to verify the results of the interviews. The study results indicate that producers with a higher-than-average ratio of low-temperature shiitake production tend to sell through a brand for low-temperature shiitake varieties and acquire production knowledge from a parent. Annual sales and sloping terrain also affected the ratio. Furthermore, ongoing challenges presented by climate change can alter information and knowledge exchange, which thus increases interaction beyond family members.","[Miyake, Yoshitaka; Kohsaka, Ryo] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Kohsaka, R (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",kohsaka@hotmail.com,"Kohsaka, Ryo/J-3022-2019","Kohsaka, Ryo/0000-0001-6822-4340; Miyake, Yoshitaka/0000-0003-3246-243X","Kurita Water and Environment Foundation [20C002]; JST RISTEX, Japan [JPMJRX20B3]; JST [JPMJPF2110]; JSPS KAKENHI [2022-2025, JP16KK0053, JP17K02105, JP21K18456, JP22H03852]; Kunisaki Peninsula Usa Area GIAHS Research Project","Kurita Water and Environment Foundation(Kurita Water and Environment Foundation); JST RISTEX, Japan; JST(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Kunisaki Peninsula Usa Area GIAHS Research Project","The work was supported by the following grants: Kunisaki Peninsula Usa Area GIAHS Research Project; Kurita Water and Environment Foundation 20C002; JST RISTEX Grant Number JPMJRX20B3, Japan; JST Grant Number JPMJPF2110; the JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP16KK0053, JP17K02105, and JP21K18456.

This Article argues for an approach that involves a wide range of actors throughout the planning process in order to confront the challenges of urban adaptation to climate change. It builds on the results of a three-year participatory action research project to identify the catalysts with which local administrations can overcome the lack of data, the low level of engagement around the climate issue, and the cause-and-effect linkages of climate change impacts on the urban environment. Significant factors include territorial rootedness, leveraging actors' experience, interaction between actors, as well as the valuing of local actors as experts of territorial management rather than as novices with regard to climate change adaptation. In addition to contributing towards the engagement of a large number of stakeholders around adaptation issues, a planning process that involves representatives from various sectors and during several stages contributes to a greater understanding of these issues and their linkages. It follows that such a process will bring changes to urban practices by better articulating local concerns about climatic issues. Policy relevance Although participation is commonly advocated in policy responses to climate change, only few empirical studies have investigated the ways in which local actors' knowledge can be integrated into climate change adaptation planning processes. The article builds on the results of an action research project carried out in Quebec City, Canada, to address the relevance of involving a progressively broader range of actors as the adaptation process moves through its various phases. Given that a multitude of barriers to adaptation are at play at different times in a municipality, collaborations between local stakeholders emerge as a key factor. These collaborations provide greater insight into the linkages between climate change impacts and the urban environment and, in doing so, bring into question ordinary urban management and design practices.","[Cloutier, Genevieve; Joerin, Florent; Labarthe, Martial; Legay, Christelle; Viens, Dominique] Univ Laval, CRAD, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Dubois, Catherine] Univ Laval, Sch Architecture, Quebec City, PQ G1R 3V6, Canada; [Joerin, Florent] Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland, CH-1401 Yverdon, Switzerland",Laval University; Laval University; University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland,"Cloutier, G (corresponding author), Univ Laval, CRAD, Pavillon Felix Antoine Savard, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",genevieve.cloutier@crad.ulaval.ca,"Cloutier, Gérard/O-9415-2015; Cloutier, Geneviève/AIE-4942-2022","Cloutier, Geneviève/0000-0001-9697-3648",Ouranos Consortium under the Climate Change and Urban Transformation Research-Action Project,Ouranos Consortium under the Climate Change and Urban Transformation Research-Action Project,"The authors wish to thank the Ouranos Consortium (http://www.ouranos.ca/en/) for supporting this study under the Climate Change and Urban Transformation Research-Action Project.

Our study revealed that ecological and climatic circumstances are maintained through the traditional system of governance and local self-government. Local skills, tools, techniques, wisdom, beliefs and costumes of the aboriginal people act as a shock absorber during disasters and successfully build resilience to climatic hazards. Most of this knowledge was transmitted over successive generations and became a part of living, cultural and religion sustenance. Adaptation strategies at community level fisheries helps in reducing vulnerabilities to extreme weather such as drought, flood and erratic rainfall pattern. Adaptation to climate change in fisheries can decipher through strategies available from fine-scale spatial and grassroots levels.

Our goal is to propose a consistent approach for managing major risk in urban systems by bringing together emergency management, organisational resilience, and climate change adaptation. Design/methodology/approach We develop a theory-building process using an example from the work of the Greater London Authority in the United Kingdom. First, we explore how emergency management approaches systemic risk, including examples from of exercises, contingency plans and responses to complex incidents. Secondly, we analyse how systemic risk is integrated into strategies and practices of climate change adaptation. Thirdly, we consider organisational resilience as a cross cutting element between the approaches. Findings London has long been a champion of resilience strategies for dealing with systemic risk.

The islands of the Outermost Regions are also being affected by this phenomenon. When these islands have a higher level of functional complexity, climate change increases the difficulty of defining their urban and regional planning tools. A comparative analysis of the characteristics of these islands (comparing land use and demographic density) and a review of the efficacy of planning tools for incorporating climate change adaptation has been developed in order to understand the transformations produced in the regulatory frameworks. Through the case studies of Gran Canaria (Spain) and Reunion Island (France), which show high levels of urban and peri-urban land use pressure, the paper focuses on analysing the degree of mainstreaming adaptation strategies, as key elements for land use planning in a context of climate change. Results show a dysfunction between adaptation needs and the incorporation of the climatic issue in land use management. Insular planning tools do not generally consider climate change adaptation and excessive top-down management is observed in the decision-making process. This paper contributes new case studies to the literature, comparing two non-sovereign European islands, and reviews the regulatory framework on adaptation in insular contexts related to climate change.","[Ribalaygua, Cecilia; Garcia, Francisco] Univ Cantabria, Cantabria, Spain; [Garcia Sanchez, Hector] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Garcia, F (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Cantabria, Spain.",cecilia.ribalaygua@unican.es; franciscojose.garcia@unican.es; hectorjulian.garcia@ulpgc.es,"Sánchez, Francisco García/O-5576-2019; Garcia Sanchez, Francisco/J-7479-2016","Garcia Sanchez, Francisco/0000-0003-1911-8749",,,,,73,4,4,1,7,Island Studies Journal,Copenhagen,"c/o Adam Grydehj, Lillegrund 39, Copenhagen, DENMARK",,1715-2593,,ISL STUD J,Isl.

The paper covers a broader context, namely the significance of cities for fighting climate change and the attitude of Polish central authorities to the issue of climate change. It also demonstrates the importance of urban planning in climate change issues. Against this background concrete cities and their climate change adaptation policies are examined and compared to the national strategical adaptation plan to climate change. The research questions are: how do Polish cities deal with the climate change? What actions do they undertake? What kind of documents at the local level are relevant? The major conclusions are that Polish central government only declaratively meets its commitments, while cites, including Polish cities, are taking real actions and in this way, they bypass States by complementing or replacing their actions.

This paper ascertains the factors affecting effective climate change adaptation among cowpea farmers in Ido local government area of Oyo State, Nigeria for cowpea supply security. Following a survey of 108 randomly selected cowpea farmers, descriptive statistical tools were used for data analysis while multiple regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing effective climate change adaptation among cowpea farmers. Adaptation measures adopted by respondents ranged from local (low sophisticated) to high regional (moderate sophisticated) technology. The use of precision farming technology such as variable-rate technology and green seeker were discouraged among farmers. Hence, there is a need to eliminate factors hindering utilisation of modern adaptation measures for better coping mechanism and sustainable cowpea production.","[Arimi, Kayode] Natl Open Univ Nigeria, Ibadan Study Ctr, Dept Agr Extens & Management, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Olooto, Felicia Motunrayo] Kwara State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Extens Serv, Malete, Kwara State, Nigeria",,"Arimi, K (corresponding author), Natl Open Univ Nigeria, Ibadan Study Ctr, Dept Agr Extens & Management, Ibadan, Nigeria.",arimi2009@yahoo.com; feliciamolooto@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,1,1,1,1,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",2054-5819,2054-5827,,INT J SUST AGR MANAG,Int.

Furthermore, as the recent literature suggests, values held by policy actors are centrally located in the debates linking adaptation to development. However, different values tend to give way to diverging adaptation policy preferences, which often appear as a dichotomy of adjustment (incremental change) versus transformation. This study enquires the assumptions and values in adaptation policy by using Q-methodology and advances value-based approach to adaptation policy with an empirical case from Turkey, a developing country with key vulnerabilities in its agricultural system. By exploring the narratives of 29 policy actors who participated in the making of Turkey's climate change adaptation strategy, the analysis suggests that assumptions regarding an economic growth-driven development agenda often shape adaptation concerns. Further analysis of the 4 emerging discourses (productivism, techno-managerialism, eco-localism, and authoritarianism) suggests that while discourses agree that the ultimate goal of adaptation is safeguarding a developmentalist vision in agriculture, they differ on the means and agents for reaching this goal. I argue that this divergence can enhance the transformative potential of adaptation by bringing how, for whom, and why questions back to policymaking. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As the effects of climate change amplify the impacts of natural hazards, a critical aspect of the nation's overall resiliency includes the ability of the maritime and coastal sectors to recover effectively from external shocks and to adapt to changing environmental conditions in order to continue to provide the services the nation relies upon for economic viability and homeland security. This requires adaptation for physical infrastructure as well as organizational, operational, and community elements throughout the maritime transportation system. This paper provides a literature review of port climate adaptation approaches, which highlights the established need and opportunities for collaboration among coastal stakeholders to implement climate adaptation in port communities. The current lack of federal support in the United States for climate adaptation in the maritime sector emphasizes the need for novel methods and approaches to facilitate adaptation at individual port and regional levels. A case study from the port community of Hampton Roads, Virginia provides an example of the time and effort dedicated to stakeholder collaboration to encourage local understanding of climate risks in order to facilitate successful adaptation.","[Morris, Lauren L.] 4412A Lemay Ln, Jbmdl, NJ 08641 USA",,"Morris, LL (corresponding author), 4412A Lemay Ln, Jbmdl, NJ 08641 USA.",llandmorris@gmail.com,,"Morris, Lauren/0000-0002-1017-8991",,,,,39,3,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-8839,1464-5254,,MARIT POLICY MANAG,Marit.

UN-led adaptation has occasioned opportunities for new networks of actors to make claims about Palestinian futures and to perform PA readiness for statehood. These actors weigh scientific uncertainties about climate against uncertainties over if and when settler colonialism in Palestine will end. How they do so matters because it is the foundation of requests for capital that could be translated into some of the most important institutions and infrastructures of Palestinian governance over the next several years, including those that provide Palestinians with access to water. It also matters because it constitutes the image with which PA officials represent what needs to be fixed in Palestine in important international forums such as the UN.

Amidst the means of adjustment is the use of adaptation strategies to combat the detrimental effect. In order to promote zero hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and encourage sustainable agriculture, which were listed under the second goal of the Sustainable Development Goals, then, farmers must necessarily have recourse to controlling measures. Consequently, climate change adaptation strategy was identified as one of the key approaches to achieving the catalogue itemised under the second goal. Hence this study aimed to determine the synergy between climate change adaptation strategy and smallholder farmers' food security status in South Africa, in addition to exploring factors that influenced the duo. A cross-sectional survey was conducted where 346 maize farmers in Ngaka Modiri Molema District of the North West Province, South Africa were interviewed. Data were analysed using STATA software, while two-stage regression model was used to establish the bi-causal link. On the one hand, the result highlighted variables that influenced climate change adaptation strategies: awareness of climate change, access to irrigation and frequency of agricultural extension agent visit.

This paper examines the roles of key actors in Namibia in the production and dissemination of climate adaptation knowledge. The intention was to identify opportunities for enhancing collaboration among actors to facilitate knowledge flow and uptake in adaptation action. The Omusati Region was used as a case study in understanding the chain of interactions among actors from local/district to the national level vis-a-vis the production and dissemination of adaptation knowledge in Namibia. The researchers conducted key informant interviews with representatives of key organizations in the Namibian adaptation network operating in the Omusati Region. The selection of the organizations of interviewed respondents was based on a previous climate change adaptation stakeholder and influence network mapping exercise in the region. Results indicate that adaptation knowledge generation by organizations happens mainly in the context of other developmental services. Furthermore, most organizations generate their adaptation knowledge internally through their directorates of research and also through cooperation with other organizations. However, there is little or no collaboration between organizations with respect to dissemination of adaptation knowledge to intended targets. The study, therefore, recommends a more concerted effort towards improving collaboration between organizations, and with local communities in the dissemination of adaptation knowledge as a way of enhancing knowledge uptake. This will have practical implications for the improvement in the rate of knowledge uptake in adaptation actions, particularly at the local level. In this regard, the use of workshop and field day meetings show the best prospect for improving collaboration between organizations in knowledge dissemination.","[Ofoegbu, Chidiebere; New, Mark; Spear, Dian] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Nyamwanza, Admire Mutsa] Human Sci Res Council, Econ Performance & Dev Unit, ZA-8001 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town; Human Sciences Research Council-South Africa,"Ofoegbu, C (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",ofoegbu.c@gmail.com,"Ofoegbu, Chidiebere/Q-8372-2019; New, Mark/A-7684-2008; Spear, Dian/B-2469-2009","Ofoegbu, Chidiebere/0000-0002-8920-9411; New, Mark/0000-0001-6082-8879; Spear, Dian/0000-0002-2417-3980","International Development Research Centre, Canada (IDRC); Department for International Development, UK (DFID)","International Development Research Centre, Canada (IDRC); Department for International Development, UK (DFID)","Research for this article was part of work on the project Adaptation at Scales in Semi-Arid Regions (ASSAR).

We made comparisons of keyword usage between shrinking and non-shrinking cities to examine how shrinking cities-with overlapping vulnerabilities and industrial legacies-differ from stronger market cities. Although health (97%) and equity/justice (81%) were common, only half of the cities discussed health and equity/justice concurrently, with overrepresentation from shrinking cities. Parks/green space were discussed alongside these themes in 28% of cities. Health equity emerged more in shrinking cities and recent plans (e.g., since 2018), suggesting recent shifts toward equity. Many cities vaguely described health equity solutions, necessitating clearer solutions for injustices, including parks/green space as climate adaptation and health infrastructure.","[Mullenbach, Lauren E.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, 100 E Boyd St SEC 658, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Stanis, Sonja A.

This paper synthesizes insights from relevant literature on urban climate change governance, climate adaptation, urban planning, social justice theory, and policy implementation to develop three propositions concerning the conditions that must occur to implement just adaptation. First, just adaptation requires the inclusion of socially vulnerable populations as full participants with agency to shape the decisions that affect them. Second, just adaptation requires that adaptation framings explicitly recognize the causes of systemic injustice. Third, just adaptation requires a focus on incremental evaluations of implementation to avoid timeframes inconsistent with advancing justice. We then integrate the advocacy coalition framework (ACF) with the just adaptation literature to develop a framework to evaluate the implementation of climate adaptation. We present two novel modifications to the ACF aimed at fostering policy analysis of the previously presented three propositions for implementation of just adaptation.","[Malloy, Jeffrey T.] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Ashcraft, Catherine M.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, 114 James Hall, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Malloy, JT (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",jtq57@wildcats.unh.edu,,"Ashcraft, Catherine/0000-0001-9706-1042; Malloy, Jeffrey/0000-0001-9959-693X",,,,,63,26,26,8,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

It sustains approximately 500 million people. Even though people living in the basin have coped with and adapted to change in climate for centuries, they are finding it increasingly difficult, as both the frequency and magnitude of climate-induced extreme weather events have increased over the years. Both market and non-market impacts of climate change are increasing, and increasing quite significantly. In 2007, floods resulting from monsoon rains killed over 2000 people and displaced more than 20 million people in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. As traditional coping mechanisms are proving to be increasingly insufficient, improvement in climate change adaptation planning and practices in the basin is becoming increasingly urgent. This paper makes an attempt to assess the effectiveness of climate information system, infrastructure, and institutions, which are considered as three important pillars of successful climate change adaptation. The needs and capacities of agencies and institutions to observe, collect, disseminate climate information products and early warning, and existing physical and institutional structures' robustness and flexibility in responding to climatic change and climate-induced extreme events are evaluated.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Dulal, HB (corresponding author), World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",hbdulal@gmail.com,,,,,,,73,5,6,2,42,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,1745-2627,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

The relative novelty of adaptation measures in this context opens up an opportunity to examine the ways in which more well-established systems of governance are able to address concerns of a changing climate and its expected effects. This paper examines the modes of climate change adaptation governance systems, by presenting two empirical multi-scale case studies in Finland and Italy. The two countries represent different stages of planned adaptation measures: while Finland began work on adaptation relatively early and elected for a mainstreaming approach, Italy has yet to form concrete national adaptation actions. In both cases, however, adaptation actions have autonomously emerged at lower scales of governance, railing questions as to the role and importance of vertical integration. This study concludes that the governance of adaptation is mainly taking place through both formal institutions and networks across actors at various scales. Though such networks present actors at sub-national scales the resources and opportunity to engage in planned adaptation, the ability of a wider set of actors to plan adaptation remains somewhat limited by a lack of coordination at the national scale. As a result, there exists an opportunity for increased interaction and participation of actors across scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It is based on cross-sectional data from 400 randomly selected sample farm households. By using cross-sectional data from a primary survey of 400 randomly selected sample farm households and applying a multivariate probit regression model, it identifies the factors determining farm households' adoption of climate change adaptation options. The study finds five major climate change adaptation options adopted by farm households, viz. agro-forestry, soil and water conservation, small-scale irrigation, crop diversification, and adjusting planting dates. Findings indicate that various demographics, socio-economic, institutional, biophysical and climate change risk factors determine adoption of climate change adaptation strategies. The study suggests the significance of formulating different information opportunities such as local climate forums, access to media centers, and training centers for farmers, which can help to increase adaptation of farm households to climate change. Therefore, policies and development plans that persuade the adoption of adaptation strategies to climate change must consider these factors to reduce the climate repercussions.","[Tesfaye, Taye] Dilla Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Dilla, Ethiopia; [Nayak, Diptimayee] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Haridwar 247667, India",Dilla University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee,"Tesfaye, T (corresponding author), Dilla Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Dilla, Ethiopia.;Nayak, D (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Haridwar 247667, India.",rome1795@gmail.com; dipti.nayak@hs.iitr.ac.in,"Nayak, Diptimayee/GWC-4160-2022",,,,,,78,1,1,4,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

We find that, despite encouraging potential and a lot of common ground, key barriers and hindrances still exist, such as inertia of organisational cultures and existing financial models.

It focuses on Inuit relationships with the Arctic environment, including hunting knowledge and land skills, and examines their roles in adaptation to biophysical changes that affect subsistence hunting. In several instances, TEK underpins competency in subsistence and adaptations to changing conditions, which includes flexibility with regard to seasonal cycles of hunting and resource use, hazard avoidance through detailed knowledge of the environment and understanding of ecosystem processes, and emergency preparedness, e.g., knowing what supplies to take when traveling and how to respond in emergency situations. Despite the documented importance of TEK in adaptation and in maintaining a level of competency in subsistence, the relationships between TEK and adaptation to climate change are not well defined in the scholarly literature. This paper aims to conceptualize the relationships between TEK and adaptation to climate change by di-awing on case study research with Inuit in the Canadian Arctic. TEK is considered an element of adaptive capacity (or resilience) that is expressed as adaptation if TEK is drawn upon to adapt to changing conditions.

We conducted a deliberation within the communities for 14 days on identifying important climate change adaptation policies for 30 years later under climate change impacts with the relevant knowledge from experts. During the deliberation, after self-introduction took place including the realization of climate change impacts, the participants were provided with the expert knowledge on impacts of climate change, adaptation policies in agricultural sector and so on, then the following discussions covered issues such as the distribution of agricultural produce, insufficient successors, and support for farmers, such as impacts on crops during disasters concerning future scenarios. Attitude changes before and after deliberation were observed in terms of the pros and cons of climate change adaptation policies in agriculture and rural areas, but statistically significant differences were not observed. On the other hand, a statistically significant change was observed in some determinants of the pros and cons, such as the perceived effectiveness and goal intention. This structural change results from that the participants became aware of a different perspective through deliberation. Thus, the online deliberation process was effective to some extent in increasing knowledge and promoting deeper understanding among participants during inquiry and reasoning was deepened in the process as they listened to the opinions of others in a different position with a different idea as well as read and search for scientific findings and information provided by experts.","[Baba, Kenshi] Tokyo City Univ, Fac Environm Studies, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2248551, Japan; [Amanuma, Eri] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Kosugi, Motoko] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Sci & Technol, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4328561, Japan",Tokyo City University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Shizuoka University,"Baba, K (corresponding author), Tokyo City Univ, Fac Environm Studies, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2248551, Japan.",kbaba@tcu.ac.jp; amanuma.eri@nies.go.jp; kosugi.motoko@shizuoka.ac.jp,"Baba, Kenshi/P-6079-2019; Amanuma, Eri/GYD-8652-2022","Baba, Kenshi/0000-0003-3878-2960; Amanuma, Eri/0000-0002-7250-1934; Kosugi, Motoko/0000-0002-3416-4922","Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan [JPMXD0715667201]; Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Research Institute of Science and Technology for Society (RISTEX), Japan [JPMJRX20A1]","Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); Research Institute of Science and Technology for Society (RISTEX), Japan","This study was supported by the Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan, Grant No. JPMXD0715667201 and also supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Research Institute of Science and Technology for Society (RISTEX), Japan, Grant No. JPMJRX20A1.",,44,2,3,0,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,MAY,2021,9,5,,,,,,,75,10.3390/cli9050075,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9050075,,,19,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,SH2XC,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000653999100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we review the state of knowledge for adapting existing and future MPAs to climate change and synthesize case studies (n = 27) of how marine conservation planning can respond to shifting environmental conditions. First, we derive a generalized conservation planning framework based on five published frameworks that incorporate climate change adaptation to inform MPA design. We then summarize examples from the scientific literature to assess how conservation goals were defined, vulnerability assessments performed and adaptation strategies incorporated into the design and management of existing or new MPAs. Our analysis revealed that 82% of real-world examples of climate change adaptation in MPA planning derive from tropical reefs, highlighting the need for research in other ecosystems and habitat types. We found contrasting recommendations for adaptation strategies at the planning stage, either focusing only on climate refugia, or aiming for representative protection of areas encompassing the full range of expected climate change impacts. Recommendations for MPA management were more unified and focused on adaptative management approaches. Lastly, we evaluate common barriers to adopting climate change adaptation strategies based on reviewing studies which conducted interviews with MPA managers and other conservation practitioners. This highlights a lack of scientific studies evaluating different adaptation strategies and shortcomings in current governance structures as two major barriers, and we discuss how these could be overcome. Our review provides a comprehensive synthesis of planning frameworks, case studies, adaptation strategies and management actions which can inform a more coordinated global effort to adapt existing and future MPA networks to continued climate change.","[Wilson, Kristen L.; Tittensor, Derek P.; Worm, Boris; Lotze, Heike K.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St,POB 15000, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Tittensor, Derek P.] UN Environm World Conservat Monitoring Ctr, Cambridge, England; [Wilson, Kristen L.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Dartmouth, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University; Bedford Institute of Oceanography; Fisheries & Oceans Canada,"Wilson, KL (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St,POB 15000, Halifax, NS, Canada.",kristen.wilson@dal.ca,"Tittensor, Derek P./AAV-1117-2021","Tittensor, Derek P./0000-0002-9550-3123; Lotze, Heike/0000-0001-6258-1304; Worm, Boris/0000-0002-5742-8716",Canada First Research Excellence Fund Ocean Frontier Institute (OFI): Safe and Sustainable Development of the Ocean Frontier (Module G); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2014-04491]; Jarislowsky Foundation,Canada First Research Excellence Fund Ocean Frontier Institute (OFI): Safe and Sustainable Development of the Ocean Frontier (Module G); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Jarislowsky Foundation,This work was funded by the Canada First Research Excellence Fund Ocean Frontier Institute (OFI): Safe and Sustainable Development of the Ocean Frontier (Module G) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (RGPIN-2014-04491).

Yet the influence of adaptation law and policy on the distribution of climate impacts is often overlooked in studies of socio-ecological resilience to climate change. This article demonstrates how environmental justice scholarship helps to address this gap in the literature relating to adaptation law and resilience. Drawing on existing literature, the article identifies four principles to promote resilience and justice through climate adaptation laws. Climate adaptation laws must (i) prepare for, and respond to, change; (ii) address the distributive effects of climate change and adaptation; (iii) promote participation in adaptation processes; and (iv) cross sectors and scales. Each criterion can be implemented in part through existing legal processes, but might also be further supported by incremental law reform. Developing both resilience and justice dimensions will enhance the effectiveness of adaptation laws in addressing climate impacts.","[Wenta, Joseph; McDonald, Jan; McGee, Jeffrey S.] Univ Tasmania, Fac Law, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Wenta, Joseph; McDonald, Jan; McGee, Jeffrey S.] Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [McGee, Jeffrey S.] Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Wenta, J (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Fac Law, Hobart, Tas, Australia.;Wenta, J (corresponding author), Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",Joseph.Wenta@utas.edu.au; Jan.McDonald@utas.edu.au; Jeffrey.McGee@utas.edu.au,,"Wenta, Joseph/0000-0003-0946-6133",Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)","Faculty of Law, University of Tasmania; Centre for Marine Socioecology, Hobart, Tasmania (Australia).

Hence, climate-related disaster preparedness is now acknowledged by climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction experts. However, there is limited knowledge of communities and policymakers on the integration of climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR). This paper through the lens of resilience theory presents goals towards linking coastal climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction from the case study of East London, coastal city in South Africa. This study gathered data through a semi-structured survey, aimed at defining salient public issues to improve CCA and DRR policies, public participation inclusion, and programmes. This study shows that the knowledge of CCA and DRR is relatively low in the study area, also the provision of disaster information by the local authority is quite low. Conversely, most of the respondents affirm that available disaster information is always in locally understood languages, this is important in understanding disaster early warning by local dwellers. Accordingly, in disaster information dissemination, the government should be proactive and responsive in spreading information that covers every people. Further work that respects the importance of indigenous knowledge for CCA and DRR integration is needed i.e. local participation in the framework of development endeavours, through the inclusion of indigenous people in policymaking at the sub-national, national and international levels, this would help them to participate in administrative processes that affect them; providing a resilient community, improved adaptive capacity and sustainable living. Effective flexibility, adaptability, interoperability among stakeholders at various levels are key ingredients to reaching these goals.","[Busayo, Emmanuel Tolulope; Kalumba, Ahmed Mukalazi] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Private Bag X1314, ZA-5700 Alice, Eastern Cape Pr, South Africa",University of Fort Hare,"Busayo, ET (corresponding author), Univ Ft Hare, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Private Bag X1314, ZA-5700 Alice, Eastern Cape Pr, South Africa.",etobusayo@yahoo.com; amkalumba@gmail.com,,"Kalumba, Ahmed Mukalazi/0000-0001-7593-9096",,,,,74,6,6,2,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,APR 1,2021,203,,,,,,,,105454,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105454,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105454,,MAR 2021,9,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,UL3TX,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000692578700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whilst there is a growing field of scholarship in a European and North America setting, research on the policy and governance of urban greenspace for climate adaptation in subtropical Asia is limited. Given the different development patterns, environmental characteristics and governance arrangements in subtropical cities, plus their comparatively large population and high climate risk, this is a significant knowledge gap. In response, this paper evaluates competences - skill sets, capabilities, and supporting policy and legislation - to enact adaptation through greenspace across different governance contexts; and assesses how international rhetoric on nature-based adaptation becomes localised to subtropical Asian city settings. We conduct interviews with stakeholders, plus review of relevant policy and city-specific research, for three cities with different governance and development contexts: Hanoi (Vietnam); Taipei (Taiwan); and Fukuoka (Japan). Across all three cases, we find that institutional structures and processes for connecting different remits and knowledge systems are a bigger challenge than a lack of appropriate policy or individuals with the required technical knowledge. However, opportunities for civil society participation and consideration of justice issues vary between the cities according to the socio-political context. These findings illustrate the value of individuals and organisations able to work across institutional boundaries in linking greenspace and adaptation agendas for subtropical Asian cities; and the importance of competence in collaboration with developers and civil society so that the rapid development or regeneration seen in subtropical Asian contexts does not tend towards green climate gentrification. More broadly, our findings show that the diverse nature of subtropical Asian cities means the role of greenspace in climate adaptation is likely to be context-specific, and thus that caution must be exercised against uncritically importing best practices from exemplar cases elsewhere.","[Mabon, Leslie] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland; [Shih, Wan-Yu] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Disaster Management, Taipei, Taiwan",UHI Millennium Institute; Ming Chuan University,"Mabon, L (corresponding author), Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland.",leslie.mabon@sams.ac.uk,,"Mabon, Leslie/0000-0003-2646-6119; Shih, Wan-Yu/0000-0003-4427-492X",Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Humanities and Social Sciences [205764-Z-16-Z]; Royal Society of Edinburgh-Ministry of Science and Technology Joint Research Project [MOST 106 -2911-I-130 -502]; Scottish Funding Council Global Challenges Research Fund; Scottish Funding Council COVID-19 Research Uplift fund,Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Humanities and Social Sciences; Royal Society of Edinburgh-Ministry of Science and Technology Joint Research Project; Scottish Funding Council Global Challenges Research Fund; Scottish Funding Council COVID-19 Research Uplift fund,"The data on which this paper is based was collected through: (a) Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Humanities and Social Sciences (205764-Z-16-Z) (LM, WYS); (b) Royal Society of Edinburgh-Ministry of Science and Technology Joint Research Project (MOST 106 -2911-I-130 -502) (WYS, LM); (c) Scottish Funding Council Global Challenges Research Fund funding allocated to Robert Gordon University and assigned to LM; and (d) Scottish Funding Council COVID-19 Research Uplift funding allocated to the Scottish Association for Marine Science at the University of the Highlands and Islands and assigned to LM.

However, these critical habitats and their diverse ecosystem services are threatened by coastal development and the impacts from a changing climate. Ever increasing pressure on coastal habitats calls for coastal climate adaptation efforts that mitigate or adapt to these pressures in ways that maintain the integrity of coastal landscapes. An important challenge for decisionmakers is determining the best mitigation and adaptation strategies that not only protect human lives and property, but also safeguard the ability of coastal habitats to provide a broad suite of benefits. Here, we present a potential pathway for local-scale climate change adaptation planning through the identification and mapping of natural habitats that provide the greatest benefits to coastal communities. The methodology coupled a coastal vulnerability model with a climate adaptation policy assessment in an effort to identify priority locations for nature-based solutions that reduce vulnerability of critical assets using feasible land-use policy methods. Our results demonstrate the critical role of natural habitats in providing the ecosystem service of coastal protection in California. We found that specific dune habitats play a key role in reducing erosion and inundation of the coastline and that several wetland areas help to absorb energy from storms and provide a protective service for the coast of Marin county, California, USA. Climate change and adaptation planning are globally relevant issues in which the scalability and transferability of solutions must be considered. This work outlines an iterative approach for climate adaptation planning at a local-scale, with opportunity to consider the scalability of an iterative science-policy engagement approach to regional, national, and international levels.","[Wedding, Lisa M.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Wedding, Lisa M.; Reiter, Sarah; Moritsch, Monica; Hartge, Eric; Reiblich, Jesse; Gourlie, Don] Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Reiter, Sarah] New England Aquarium, Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, Boston, MA USA; [Moritsch, Monica] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Reiblich, Jesse] William & Mary Law Sch, Virginia Coastal Policy Ctr, Williamsburg, VA USA; [Gourlie, Don] Puget Sound Partnership, Seattle, WA USA; [Guerry, Anne] Nat Capital Project, Stanford, CA USA",University of Oxford; Stanford University; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; William & Mary,"Wedding, LM (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England.;Wedding, LM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",lisa.wedding@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,"Moritsch, Monica/0000-0002-3890-1264",Packard Foundation,Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation),"This work was supported by the Packard Foundation.

This report outlines a geographic information system-based method with which transportation departments can assess vulnerabilities to climate change in their multimodal surface transportation systems. The city of Portland, Oregon, is used as an illustrative case study.

This paper aims at analysing the maize producers' adaptation to climate change. Accordingly, the farmers' perception of and adaptation to climate change were identified in order to analyse the underlining determinants. The study was conducted in the municipal areas of Malanville, Banikoara, Bembereke, and Natitingou, in northern Benin. A total of 336 farmers producing maize were randomly sampled and were then interviewed. Generally, maize producers in Northern Benin perceive climate change and adapt to it, primarily, through crop diversification and adjustment of cropping practices and agricultural calendar. A Heckman Probit model highlights that experience in agriculture and organisation membership were positively correlated with both perception of and adaptation to climate change. In addition, running a side activity, accessing credit, and having contact with agricultural extension services had positive effects on the farmers' decision to adapt to climate change. Neither the number of household workers in agriculture nor land ownership showed any significant effects on the farmers' decision to adapt to climate change.","[Yegbemey, Rosaine Nerice] Univ Giessen, Inst Project & Reg Planning, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Yegbemey, Rosaine Nerice; Yabi, Jacob Afouda; Aihounton, Ghislain Boris] Univ Parakou, Fac Agron, URED, LARDES, Parakou, Benin; [Paraiso, Armand] Univ Parakou, Fac Agron, Dept Prod Vegetale, Parakou, Benin",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Yegbemey, RN (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Inst Project & Reg Planning, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",yrosaine@hotmail.com; ja_yabi@yahoo.com; aihountong@yahoo.fr; arparaiso@yahoo.fr,"Yegbemey, Rosaine Nérice/AAV-1497-2020; Yegbemey, Rosaine N/J-8860-2013","Yegbemey, Rosaine Nérice/0000-0003-2051-0289; Yegbemey, Rosaine N/0000-0003-2051-0289; AIHOUNTON, Dossou Ghislain Boris/0000-0002-4518-6887",,,,,29,14,14,1,20,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1166-7699,1777-5949,,CAH AGRIC,Cah.

Moving towards more sustainable energy solutions in the urban context by integrating renewable energy technologies supports decarbonizing the energy sector and climate change mitigation. A successful transition also needs adequate consideration of climate change including extreme events to ensure the reliable performance of energy systems in the long run. This review provides an overview of and insight into the progress achieved in the energy sector to adapt to climate change, focusing on the climate resilience of urban energy systems. The state-of-the-art methodology to assess impacts of climate change including extreme events and uncertainties on the design and performance of energy systems is described and discussed. Climate resilience is an emerging concept that is increasingly used to represent the durability and stable performance of energy systems against extreme climate events. However, it has not yet been adequately explored and widely used, as its definition has not been clearly articulated and assessment is mostly based on qualitative aspects. This study reveals that a major limitation in the state-of-the-art is the inadequacy of climate change adaptation approaches in designing and preparing urban energy systems to satisfactorily address plausible extreme climate events. Furthermore, the complexity of the climate and energy models and the mismatch between their temporal and spatial resolutions are the major limitations in linking these models. Therefore, few studies have focused on the design and operation of urban energy infrastructure in terms of climate resilience. Considering the occurrence of extreme climate events and increasing demand for implementing climate adaptation strategies, the study highlights the importance of improving energy system models to consider future climate variations including extreme events to identify climate resilient energy transition pathways.","[Nik, Vahid M.] Lund Univ, Div Bldg Phys, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, S-22363 Lund, Sweden; [Nik, Vahid M.] Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Bldg Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, S-41258 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Nik, Vahid M.] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Inst Future Environm IFE, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Perera, A.

These challenges are exacerbated in conservation contexts where there are no clear and accepted definitions, goals, strategies, and evaluation criteria for adaptation. Using a Delphi expert elicitation (n = 18) involving successive semi-structured interview and survey phases, we address this gap by developing a concise yet comprehensive set of criteria to evaluate the success of adaptation projects. Through this process we identified 16 evaluation criteria organized into four categories: (1) use of information, (2) project management, (3) ecological and social outcomes, and (4) advancing the field of adaptation. We then trialed these criteria using an online survey of adaptation practitioners (n = 47), including to assess the relative importance of the various criteria for evaluating climate adaptation projects as compared with the views of experts involved in the Delphi survey. Results highlight a potential disconnect between what is considered important in theory (as perceived by experts) and in practice (as perceived by practitioners).

The adaptation behaviors in the study area were identified as crop adjustment, environmental improvement, financial management, and livelihood diversification. A boosted regression tree model was used to analyze the effects of different dimensions of social capital on farmers' choices of climate change adaptation behavior. The results show that most farmers in Dazu District of Chongqing have adopted crop adjustment adaptation behavior. The social capital and socioeconomic characteristics of farmers have different impacts on different adaptation behaviors. Among social capital, the largest influence on climate change adaptation behavior is the degree of trust in the information of agricultural technology extension service centers, and the lowest influence is participation in rural cooperatives. In terms of socioeconomic characteristics, the largest impact on climate change adaptation behavior is agricultural income share, and the lowest impact is gender. The findings of this study can provide empirical support for governments to formulate effective policies to improve farmers' climate change adaptation capabilities.","[Li, Lin; Jin, Jianjun; He, Rui; Kuang, Foyuan; Zhang, Chenyang; Qiu, Xin] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Li, Lin; Jin, Jianjun; He, Rui; Kuang, Foyuan; Zhang, Chenyang; Qiu, Xin] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Sch Nat Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Jin, JJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Jin, JJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Sch Nat Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jjjin@bnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671170],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Number 41671170].,,53,0,0,17,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The binary logit model was applied to analyze data collected by face-to-face interviews with 110 households in Phu Vang Coastal District, Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. The findings indicate that most farmers accurately perceived climate-related changes during the recent decade, and implemented various adaptation measures in an effort to alleviate the potential risks. Adaptations included changing crop varieties, adjusting farming calendar, diversifying crops, diversifying livestock, improving irrigation, and intensifying soil quality. In addition, the farming household adaptation decisions were positively affected by gender, education level, number of laborers, income level, involvement in local community organizations, and perception of climate change severity and adaptation measure efficacy. Farmer adaptations, in contrast, were negatively influenced by non-farm income and entirely unaffected by access to credit. Policy-related recommendations were proposed to encourage smallholder farmers to adapt to climate change in the region. Recommendations included (1) improvements in the understanding of climate change, especially for female and less educated farmers; (2) more attention paid to the activities of local community organizations to be more attractive for members; (3) participation in the non-agricultural sector in parallel with implementing climate change adaptation measures in agriculture; (4) preferential loans designed as targets for low-income households combined with strict management to avoid misuse by beneficiaries.","[Hoang Ha Vo; Cong Dinh Nguyen] Univ Econ, Hue Univ, Fac Econ & Dev Studies, Hue, Vietnam; [Mizunoya, Takeshi] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Cong Dinh Nguyen] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Life Sci, Okayama, Japan",Hue University; University of Tsukuba; Okayama University,"Mizunoya, T (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",vhha@hce.edu.vn; mizunoya.takeshi.ff@u.tsukuba.ac.jp; ncdinh@hce.edu.vn,"Nguyen, Cong Dinh/GWZ-6615-2022","Nguyen, Cong Dinh/0000-0002-4679-6775",,,,,59,10,10,2,5,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2509-7946,2509-7954,,ASIA-PAC J REG SCI,Asia-Pac.

The impacts of climate change are highly localized and thus federal systems theoretically have the inherent advantage of allowing for regional diversity and policy experimentation in adaptation. However, there are also higher levels of conflict and stalemates in federal systems than in unitary systems, complicating intergovernmental relations and coordination necessary for public health adaptation. We examine how intergovernmental dynamics are patterned across national, regional and local levels of government for public health adaptation to climate change, drawing upon semi-structured interviews (n = 28) in comparative embedded case studies of Canada and Germany. We find that coordination between levels of government specifically for climate change and health is rare, but climate change issues are occasionally discussed through working groups or through existing methods of public health coordination. These findings have implications for national and regional governments in federal systems seeking to enable sub-national public health adaptation to climate change and create synergies between levels of government.","[Austin, Stephanie E.; Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea; Ross, Nancy A.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Burnside Hall Bldg Room 705, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Austin, Stephanie E.; Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea; Biesbroek, Robbert] Tracking Adaptat Climate Change Collaborat TRAC31, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Biesbroek, Robbert] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Tosun, Jale] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Tosun, Jale] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg Ctr Environm, Neuenheimer Feld 229, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",McGill University; University of Leeds; Wageningen University & Research; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Austin, SE (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Burnside Hall Bldg Room 705, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",stephanie.austin@mail.mcgill.ca; J.Ford2@leeds.ac.uk; l.berrangford@leed.ac.uk; robbert.biesbroek@wur.nl; jale.tosun@ipw.uni-heidelberg.de; nancy.ross@mcgill.ca,"Biesbroek, Robbert/ABE-3686-2021; Ford, James/A-4284-2013; Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Tosun, Jale/0000-0001-9367-5039",Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) (Fredrick Banting and Charles Best Canada Graduate Scholarship); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante (FRQS) (Bourse de Formation de Maitrise); Trottier Institute for Science and Public Policy; Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) (Michael Smith Foreign Study Supplement),Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) (Fredrick Banting and Charles Best Canada Graduate Scholarship)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante (FRQS) (Bourse de Formation de Maitrise); Trottier Institute for Science and Public Policy; Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) (Michael Smith Foreign Study Supplement),"The authors would like to thank the Canadian and German interviewees for participating in this research, and Dorothy Heinrich, Jannes Rupf and Florian Dorner for their assistance.

To reach these goals, the paper determines rainfall variability and monthly and annual trends in that variability. The results agree with earlier work showing gradients in rainfall and rainfall variability across Botswana. The results also identify a trend towards decreased rainfall throughout the nation, which is associated with decreases in the number of rainy days. Both the drying trend and decrease in rainy days agree with climate change projections for southern Africa.

Filling this knowledge gap is relevant, as many national governments rely on communicative tools to raise the awareness and understanding of climate impacts, and to stimulate adaptation action by local governments. To address this knowledge gap, this study focuses on the effectiveness of communicative tools in addressing key municipal barriers to climate change adaptation, by conducting a large N-size empirical study in the Netherlands. This study explores the effectiveness of these tools in theory, by checking whether their goals match the perceived barriers to municipal climate change adaptation, and the effectiveness in practice by analysing whether they are used and perceived as useful. Document analyses have clarified the assumptions underlying the tools. By conducting semi-structured interviews with 84 municipalities the key barriers to climate change adaptation and the use and usefulness of the tools in practice were analysed. The research revealed that the key barriers experienced by municipalities are a lack of urgency, a lack of knowledge of risks and measures, and limited capacity, the first being the primary one. Communicative tools, while being effective in theory, are not sufficiently effective in practice in addressing the key barriers. Municipalities that are not experiencing a sense of urgency to take on adaptation planning are not likely to be activated by the tools. Advanced municipalities need more sophisticated tools. This article concludes with some suggestions to improve the effectiveness of communicative tools.Key policy insights Although effective in theory in addressing key barriers to municipal adaptation planning, the effectiveness in practice of communicative tools is limited.To increase their effectiveness in practice, municipalities' awareness of the existence of the communicative tools needs to be raised.Advanced municipalities need more sophisticated tools that are context-specific and address a wide range of climate risks.The effectiveness of communicative tools can be improved by embedding them in a wider mix of policy instruments.","[Mees, Heleen; Dieperink, Carel] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Tijhuis, Niels] Omgevingsdienst IJmond, Beverwijk, Netherlands; [Tijhuis, Niels] Royal HaskoningDHV, Amersfoort, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Mees, H (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",h.l.p.mees@uu.nl,"Mees, Heleen/L-5394-2013","Mees, Heleen/0000-0002-4401-6106",,,,,46,12,12,3,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Local governments are key actors in climate change adaptation because they have the responsibility to translate top-down risk information to vulnerable populations and can scale bottom-up initiatives of communities in adaptation planning. There is a need for integrated approaches for adaptive capacity building that incorporate specific capacities to tackle multiple climate risks and generic capacities to address basic needs for human development. In this analysis, we assess the institutional capacity profiles of local governments in Mexico through a cluster analysis to understand how different aspects of generic and specific capacities, which operate through bottom-up or top-down approaches, coincide in local governments. Our results show that local governments in Mexico can be grouped by type and level of institutional capacity, as follows: those that (1) engage in intergovernmental coordination; (2) focus on safety-first; (3) exhibit high capacities in transparency and citizen participation; and (4) are in a poverty trap. These groups reflect challenges for local governments in Mexico, including the need to resolve short-term crises, the lack of climate change awareness, and a low capacity to access and mobilize economic resources for adaptation. Conversely, horizontal and vertical coordination, transparency, and citizen participation are found to be key elements able to strengthen institutional capacities for adaptation. In the context of multiple climate risks and underdeveloped enabling conditions for adaptation, there is a need for strategic investment in capacities that are contextually relevant and that can reduce the adaptation gap for climate action in Mexico. Further analysis will be needed to evaluate how the mobilization of the institutional capacities by local governments in each group influences climate change adaptation outcomes, particularly differentiated for urban and rural contexts, as well as for metropolitan scales.Key policy insights- Local governments in Mexico are faced with the challenge of resolving urgent and short-term issues, making it difficult to face climate change adaptation. - Intergovernmental coordination is a key attribute that local governments can develop to address and overcome deficiencies in institutional capacities for climate change adaptation - Administrative capacity, transparency, accountability, and public participation are critical elements for local governments and will assist them to access and mobilize economic resources for climate change adaptation.","[Cid, Abril] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Ciencias Sostenibil, Mexico City, Mexico; [Cid, Abril] Umbela Transformac Sostenibles AC, Mexico City, Mexico; [Lerner, Amy M.

This article offers a systematic review and synthesis of the publications about climate change impacts on the diverse ICH and climate change adaptation in the polar regions. Gray literature was not included in the study. Arctic countries like Sweden, Finland, Iceland, and Russia, and their associated research organizations, are under-represented in this literature when compared with the USA, Canada, Denmark, and Norway. More than half of the analyzed literature is published in the last 3 years (2019, 2020, and 2021) with a focus on coastal erosion and ICH degradation (cryospheric hazards). ICH is at risk from biological degradation, coastal erosion, debris flow, and thaw slumping. Nearly half of the studies report on the need for climate change adaptation planning and implementation for ICH. This study shows that advances in research on climate change impacts and adaptation responses are needed to improve decision- and policy-maker capacity to support effective adaptation policies and to contribute to the achievement of SDGs in polar regions. The polar regions' vulnerable landscapes and ICH sites can be used to communicate a larger message about the climate change challenges and adaptation measures.This article is categorized under:Assessing Impacts of Climate Change > Observed Impacts of Climate ChangeVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Learning from Cases and AnalogiesClimate and Development > Sustainability and Human Well-Being","[Nicu, Ionut Cristi] Norwegian Inst Cultural Heritage Res NIKU, High North Dept, Tromso, Norway; [Fatoric, Sandra] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Delft, Netherlands; [Nicu, Ionut Cristi] Norwegian Inst Cultural Heritage Res NIKU, Fram Ctr, High North Dept, N-9296 Tromso, Norway",Delft University of Technology,"Nicu, IC (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Cultural Heritage Res NIKU, Fram Ctr, High North Dept, N-9296 Tromso, Norway.",ionut.cristi.nicu@niku.no,"Nicu, Ionut Cristi/K-5237-2016","Nicu, Ionut Cristi/0000-0001-6451-341X; Fatoric, Sandra/0000-0002-3712-0749",,,,,109,1,1,10,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1757-7780,1757-7799,,WIRES CLIM CHANGE,Wiley Interdiscip.

However, climate change threatens to reverse the progress made so far in the fight against food insecurity. The agricultural sector in many developing countries, including the rice and wheat producers such as in Punjab (Pakistan and India), is highly vulnerable to climate change, which has serious implications for rural livelihoods and food security. Adaptation is considered a key tool to tackle climate challenges at the farm level and is, therefore, the focus of this study in terms of its impact on rice yields. A household survey was conducted in the Punjab province of Pakistan, and farmers were interviewed face-to-face. We employed a simultaneous equations model to assess the differential impacts of climate change adaptation on adapting and non-adapting farmers' rice yields. Using the cross-sectional data of 480 rice growers, an endogenous switching regression model provided a means to estimate the selection bias of farmers' attributes. The results show a significant positive impact of adaptations on rice yields. Specifically, the yield of farmers who adapted to climate change was 24% higher than the non-adapting farmers. The results further indicate that non-adapters can also benefit from the adaptation strategies if they decide to adapt. We also found a significant positive effect of farmers' climate risk perceptions, literacy level, access to irrigation, ownership of livestock, and availability of farm advisory services on their adaptation decisions. These results, therefore, suggest that policymakers should take into account farmers' local adaptation knowledge and farming practices when formulating adaptation policies.","[Khan, Nasir Abbas] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Risk Management & Emergency Decis Making, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Khanal, Uttam] Prod Commiss, Melbourne, Vic 8003, Australia; [Wilson, Clevo] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad] Hohai Univ, Res Ctr Environm & Soc, Sch Publ Adm, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China; [Tariq, Muhammad Atiq Ur Rehman] Victoria Univ, Coll Engn & Sci, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Tariq, Muhammad Atiq Ur Rehman] Victoria Univ, Inst Sustainable Ind & Liveable Cities, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Tariq, Muhammad Atiq Ur Rehman] Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Engn IT & Environm, Darwin, NT 0810, Australia",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Hohai University; Victoria University; Victoria University; Charles Darwin University,"Tariq, MAUR (corresponding author), Victoria Univ, Coll Engn & Sci, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.;Tariq, MAUR (corresponding author), Victoria Univ, Inst Sustainable Ind & Liveable Cities, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.;Tariq, MAUR (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Engn IT & Environm, Darwin, NT 0810, Australia.",atiq.tariq@yahoo.com,"Khan, Nasir Abbas/Z-3608-2019","Khan, Nasir Abbas/0000-0002-6079-715X",,,,,78,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2022,14,23,,,,,,,16035,10.3390/su142316035,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142316035,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6X1GU,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000896171100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate adaptation actions also have significant synergies and tradeoffs with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 5 on gender equality. Questions are increasingly being raised about the gendered and climate justice implications of different adaptation options. This paper investigates if reported climate change adaptation actions are contributing to advancing the goal of gender equality (SDG 5) or not. It focuses on linkages between individual targets of SDG 5 and climate change adaptation actions for nine major sectors where transformative climate actions are envisaged. The assessment is based on evidence of adaptation actions documented in 319 relevant research publications published during 2014-2020. Positive links to nine targets under SDG 5 are found in adaptation actions that are consciously designed to advance gender equality. However, in four sectors-ocean and coastal ecosystems; mountain ecosystems; poverty, livelihood, sustainable development; and industrial system transitions, we find more negative links than positive links. For adaptation actions to have positive impacts on gender equality, gender-focused targets must be intentionally brought in at the prioritisation, designing, planning, and implementation stages. An SDG 5+ approach, which takes into consideration intersectionality and gender aspects beyond women alone, can help adaptation actions move towards meeting gender equality and other climate justice goals. This reflexive approach is especially critical now, as we approach the mid-point in the timeline for achieving the SDGs.","[Roy, Joyashree; Some, Shreya] Asian Inst Technol, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Roy, Joyashree; Some, Shreya] Jadavpur Univ, Kolkata, India; [Prakash, Anjal] Bharti Inst Publ Policy, Indian Sch Business, Hyderabad, India; [Some, Shreya] Ahmedabad Univ, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Singh, Chandni] Indian Inst Human Settlements, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Bezner Kerr, Rachel; Hillenbrand, Emily] Cornel Univ, New York, NY USA; [Caretta, Martina Angela] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Conde, Cecilia] Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico UNAM, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ferre, Marta Rivera] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, INGENIO, Valencia, Spain; [Schuster-Wallace, Corinne; Irvine, Alison] Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [von der Pahlen, Maria Cristina Tirado] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Totin, Edmond] Univ Natl Agr Benin, Ecole Foresterie Trop, Cotonou, Benin; [Vij, Sumit] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Dean, Graeme; Ravera, Federica] Univ Vic, Cent Univ Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain; [Islam, Farjana] Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [McGlade, Katriona] Univ East Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson] Univ Denver, Denver, CO USA; [Segnon, Alcade] Alliance Biovers Int, Dakar, Senegal; [Segnon, Alcade] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Dakar, Senegal; [Solomon, Divya] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Tandon, Indrakshi] Amer Univ Dubai, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",Asian Institute of Technology; Jadavpur University; Indian School of Business (ISB); Ahmedabad University; Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS); Lund University; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; University of Saskatchewan; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Geneva; Universitat de Vic - Universitat Central de Catalunya (UVic-UCC); Heriot Watt University; University of East Anglia; University of Denver; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; American University in Dubai (AUD),"Prakash, A (corresponding author), Bharti Inst Publ Policy, Indian Sch Business, Hyderabad, India.",anjal_prakash@isb.edu,"Tandon, Indrakshi/GRO-2277-2022; Conde, Cecilia/GVU-7315-2022; Vij, Sumit/AAV-6617-2021; Segnon, Alcade/L-3908-2016; Rivera-Ferre, Marta Guadalupe/G-3879-2016","Segnon, Alcade/0000-0001-9751-120X; Singh, Chandni/0000-0001-6842-6735; Bezner Kerr, Rachel/0000-0003-4525-6096; Roy, Joyashree/0000-0002-9270-8860; Dean, Graeme/0000-0002-8780-6845; Some, Shreya/0000-0002-7254-9970; Rivera-Ferre, Marta Guadalupe/0000-0001-8183-8398; Caretta, Dr. Martina Angela/0000-0002-6811-304X; Schuster Wallace, Corinne/0000-0003-0187-0326",,,,,100,1,1,13,18,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-9992,,HUM SOC SCI COMMUN,Hum.

This paper aims to examine climate change adaptation strategies of farmers in the dry zone region. Farmers' choice for adaptation strategies is influenced by many factors such as the practical availability and by socioeconomic conditions of the farmers. They are moreover influenced by the perception about climate change and by the specific problems prevailing in the farming systems. Design/methodology/approach - This research is carried out in Magwe district in the dry zone region of Myanmar using a random selection of 212 farmers from three Townships (Magwe, Yenanchaung and Chauk). A multinomial logistic regression (MLR) was applied to assess the factors affecting the choice by farmers for adaptation strategies. Findings - The study found that in the past, farmers used to apply locally available indigenous climate change adaptation strategies. However, recently, most farmers seem to have shifted to introduced adaptation strategies. The most popular adaptation strategy is to adjust the planting dates and sowing method (56.1 per cent). Furthermore, farmers identified a number of barriers that limit the adoption of adaptation methods. Risk is found to be an important driver of crop diversification. Finally, the MLR model showed that information from radio, access to seeds and extension services affect the choice of adaptation strategies. Originality/value - The study shows that adoption of locally available indigenous climate change adaptation methods is gradually decreasing, and there is a shift to introduced adaptation strategies. The study can assist public and private organizations to obtain insight in the determinants of climate change adaptation in the dry zone region of Myanmar.","[Oo, Aung Tun; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido; Speelman, Stijn] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Oo, AT (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium.",aungtun.oo@ugent.be,"Van Huylenbroeck, Guido/L-9251-2017","Van Huylenbroeck, Guido/0000-0002-9654-0727; Tun Oo, Aung/0000-0003-2203-5549; speelman, stijn/0000-0001-7692-3459",Train Education for Nature Program (EFN),Train Education for Nature Program (EFN),The authors are grateful for the comments from anonymous reviewers and also extend gratitude to the editors.

Given that research funding to understand adaptation is limited, rapid return on investment is critical. For Australian marine environments, climate-change impacts are well documented and adaptation opportunities have been identified across aquaculture, fisheries, conservation and tourism sectors. Here, we have evaluated the recent Australian scientific literature to determine (1) the degree to which climate-change impacts and adaptation have been addressed across sectors, and, specifically, (2) the role of a major research program instituted in 2009 to address priority climate-change questions for these sectors, namely, Australia's ` National Climate Change Adaptation Research Plan for Marine Biodiversity and Resources' (MNARP). Although the number of priority questions addressed by the general scientific literature increased in the 2009-2015 period, there was a 92% increase in the number of priority questions addressed during the peak of MNARP (2013-2014). MNARP research also addressed a greater range of priority questions than did the general scientific literature, which showed consistency in the questions and study systems examined. Overall, structured research planning focussed attention on key climate-change questions, which is a critical consideration for enacting adaptation in the face of rapid climate change.","[Ling, Scott D.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Ecol & Biodivers Ctr, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania,"Ling, SD (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Ecol & Biodivers Ctr, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia.",scott.ling@utas.edu.au,"Hobday, Alistair/A-1460-2012; Ling, Scott/J-7161-2014","Hobday, Alistair/0000-0002-3194-8326; Ling, Scott/0000-0002-5544-8174",NCCARF Ecosystems Network,NCCARF Ecosystems Network,This analysis was supported by the NCCARF Ecosystems Network.

Design/methodology/approach - The research employed a combination of approaches; predominantly literature review and interview methodologies. Recognising the need to understand climate change adaptation as an iterative learning process, the literature review concentrated on organisational and policy learning, with special consideration given to those characteristics most pertinent to urban governance in the Pakistani context. This analysis was then furthered through primary data collated through a series of interviews, with the City District Government of Lahore as the chosen case study for this piece of research. Initial scoping interviews were followed up by a series of in-depth, semi-structured, interviews with local government officials, an assessment process used to examine conceptual evidence and findings in the Pakistani urban context. A total of 21 Pakistani professionals, working in a variety of roles for local government, were subject to the interview process. Findings - From a critical analysis of conceptual and real world evidence, the authors identified six discrete characteristics that could be used to frame the context of climate change adaptation learning and action in the Pakistani urban local government context. These have been categorised as: leadership for adaptation, vision for adaptation, culture for adaptation, good governance for adaptation, innovation and creativity for adaptation and resources for adaptation. Originality/value - The value of this paper is several-fold: it applies a learning perspective to the climate change adaptation debate, identifies a framing of key characteristics for climate change adaptation learning and action, and uses an actor-based approach to examine some of the key conceptual ideas in the Pakistani urban context.","[Janjua, Saleem; Thomas, Ian] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Studies Social Sci & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Janjua, Saleem; McEvoy, Darryn] RMIT Univ, Global Cities Res Inst, Climate Change Adaptat Programme, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Janjua, S (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Global Studies Social Sci & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",muhammadsaleem.janjua@rmit.edu.au,"McEvoy, Darryn/K-8015-2017","McEvoy, Darryn/0000-0003-4144-4137","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [0937777] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,57,6,6,1,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

It argues that the detrimental impacts of climate change experienced by farmers-turned-workers across the rural - urban divide is due to their precarity. In doing so, this article draws on a conceptualisation of precarity which recognises it as emerging from the specific political economy of Cambodia, and as something that is neither new, nor confined to conditions of labour alone. As such, in looking to precarity as a means of conceptualising the relations of power which shape impacts of climate change, we advance a 'climate precarity' lens as a means of understanding how adaptation to climate change is an issue of power, rooted in a specific geographical context, and mobile over the rural-urban divide.","[Natarajan, Nithya; Brickell, Katherine; Parsons, Laurie] Royal Holloway Univ London, London, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Parsons, L (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Geog, Egham Hill, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",katherine.brickell@rhul.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Department for International Development (DFID) [ES/R00238X/1]; ESRC; DFID; The Leverhulme Trust; British Academy,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Department for International Development (DFID); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); DFID; The Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); British Academy,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article is based on research from the study entitled: 'Blood Bricks: Examining the Modern Slavery-Climate Change Nexus in the Cambodian Construction Industry' (2017-2019).

While most of existing studies focus on mapping the current state of adaptation plans, there is a significant lack of studies on the current implementation of adaptation strategies. This study addresses this challenge by assessing how coastal adaptation is being financed and implemented in Spain. In the absence of a detailed roadmap for implementing the Spanish Strategy for Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change, we have analysed how adaptation has been and is currently being funded; which the rationale for investments along the territory is; how adaptation investments compare to regular coastal protection costs; and assessed when implemented measures are really adaptation ones Our results show that the financing source clearly conditions the type of measures implemented, with those funded under the Environment Promotion Plan for Climate Change Adaptation (PIMA Adapta initiative) being dominated by classical coastal engineering actions, whereas ecosystem-related actions are mostly funded under the LIFE programme. In territorial terms, the Mediterranean coastal regions present the most important problems under current conditions and attract most of the funding. Most of the funded actions have been designed to solve current coastal problems, and although they indirectly contribute to adaptation by improving the coastal base status, they are not specifically designed for climate change. This misuse of the concept of adaptation measure will tend to the society to be overconfident about adopted actions whereas we are not progressing to real adaptation. To overcome this risk, it is necessary to have a clear roadmap for implementing adaptation measures together a proper financing structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

National governments play a key role in public health adaptation to climate change, but there are competing views on what responsibilities and obligations this willor shouldinclude in different nations. This study aims to: (1) examine how national-level public health adaptation is occurring in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries; (2) examine the roles national governments are taking in public health adaptation; and (3) critically appraise three key governance dimensions of national-level health adaptationcross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination and national health adaptation planningand identify practical examples suited to different contexts. We systematically reviewed publicly available public health adaptation to climate change documents and webpages by national governments in ten OECD countries using systematic web searches, assessment of self-reporting, and content analysis. Our findings suggest national governments are primarily addressing infectious disease and heat-related risks posed by climate change, typically emphasizing capacity building or information-based groundwork initiatives. We find national governments are taking a variety of approaches to public health adaptation to climate change that do not follow expected convergence and divergence by governance structure. We discuss practical options for incorporating cross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination and national health adaptation planning into a variety of contexts and identify leaders national governments can look to to inform their public health adaptation planning. Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement and subsequent increased momentum for adaptation, research tracking adaptation is needed to define what health adaptation looks like in practice, reveal insights that can be taken up across states and sectors, and ensure policy orientated learning.","[Austin, Stephanie E.; Berrang-Ford, Lea; Ford, James D.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Burnside Hall Bldg Room 705, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Austin, Stephanie E.; Biesbroek, Robbert; Berrang-Ford, Lea; Ford, James D.] McGill Univ, Tracking Adaptat Climate Change Collaborat TRAC3, Burnside Hall Bldg Room 705, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Biesbroek, Robbert] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Parker, Stephen; Fleury, Manon D.] Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, Enter Surveillance & Populat Studies Div, Ctr Food Borne Environm & Zoonot Infect Dis, 255 Woodlawn Rd West,Unit 120, Guelph, ON N1H 8J1, Canada",McGill University; McGill University; Wageningen University & Research; Public Health Agency of Canada,"Austin, SE (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Burnside Hall Bldg Room 705, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.;Austin, SE (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Tracking Adaptat Climate Change Collaborat TRAC3, Burnside Hall Bldg Room 705, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",stephanie.austin@mail.mcgill.ca; robbert.biesbroek@wur.nl; lea.berrangford@mcgill.ca; lea.berrangford@mcgill.ca; stephen.parker@phac-aspc.gc.ca; Manon.D.Fleury@phac-aspc.gc.ca,"Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022; Biesbroek, Robbert/ABE-3686-2021; Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Austin, Stephanie E./0000-0002-9008-6666",Public Health Agency of Canada; Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR),Public Health Agency of Canada; Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR).

Often the costs will be immediate and clear, but the benefits may be uncertain and only occur in the distant future. Robust decision-making methods such as real options analysis (ROA) handle uncertainty better and are therefore useful to guide decision-making for climate change adaptation. ROA allows for learning about climate change by developing flexible strategies that can be adjusted over time. Practical examples of ROA to climate change adaptation are still relatively limited and tend to be complex. We propose an application that makes ROA more accessible to policy-makers by using the user-friendly and freely available UK climate data of the UKCP09 weather generator, which provides projections of future rainfall, deriving transition probabilities for the ROA in a straightforward way and demonstrating how the analysis can be implemented in spreadsheet format using backward induction. The application is to afforestation as a natural flood management measure (NFM) in a rural catchment in Scotland. The applicability of ROA to broadleaf afforestation as a NFM has not been previously investigated. Different ROA strategies are presented based on varying the damage cost from flooding, fixed cost and the discount rate. The results illustrate how learning can lower the overall investment cost of climate change adaptation but also that the cost structure of afforestation does not lend itself very well to ROA.","[Dittrich, Ruth] Univ Portland, Pamplin Sch Business, 5000 N Willamette Blvd, Portland, OR 97203 USA; [Butler, Adam] BioSS, James Clerk Maxwell Bldg,Kings Bldg,Mayfield Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JZ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ball, Tom] Univ Winchester, Dept Geog, Sparkford Rd, Winchester SO22 4NR, Hants, England; [Wreford, Anita] Lincoln Univ, POB 85084, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand; [Moran, Dominic] Univ Edinburgh, Global Acad Agr & Food Secur, Easter Bush Campus, Roslin EH25 9RG, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Portland; James Hutton Institute; University of Edinburgh; University of Winchester; Lincoln University - New Zealand; University of Edinburgh,"Dittrich, R (corresponding author), Pamplin Sch Business, 5000 N Willamette Blvd, Portland, OR 97203 USA.",dittrich@up.edu; adam.butler@bioss.ac.uk; tom.ball@winchester.ac.uk; anita.wreford@lincoln.ac.nz; dominic.moran@ed.ac.uk,"Wreford, Anita/Y-1996-2018","Wreford, Anita/0000-0002-9546-4080","European Commission, Seventh Framework Programme [266018]; BBSRC [BB/N020545/2] Funding Source: UKRI","European Commission, Seventh Framework Programme(European Commission); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","European Commission, Seventh Framework Programme, 2007-2013, Grant/Award Number: 266018.",,61,7,7,4,49,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted its impacts will accelerate rapidly over the coming decades. The components of vulnerability have been defined as exposure, sensitivity and the capacity to adapt to climate change. Vulnerability, however, is not an easy concept for policy makers, local communities and other affected stakeholders to understand. This paper illustrates the use of participatory processes in understanding climate change adaptation and defines indicators for assessing the vulnerability of the Javan rhino's national park habitat in Indonesia. The processes generated local vulnerability indicators, organised hierarchically as principles, criteria and indicators (PCIs). While vulnerability principles and criteria were pre-determined and globally defined, the indicators were designed to address the local context. We found the PCIs to be practical tools for communicating vulnerability and for multi-stakeholder dialogues on vulnerability to climate change.","[Purnomo, Herry] Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Forestry, Bogor, Indonesia; [Purnomo, Herry; Herawati, Hety] Jalan CIFOR, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor 16115, Indonesia; [Santoso, Heru] Indonesian Inst Sci LIPI, Bandung 40135, Indonesia",Bogor Agricultural University; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); National Research & Innovation Agency of Indonesia (BRIN); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI),"Purnomo, H (corresponding author), Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Forestry, Bogor, Indonesia.",h.purnomo@cgiar.org; h.herawati@cgiar.org; therunoff@yahoo.co.uk,"Purnomo, Herry/GPP-3417-2022; Santoso, Heru/GPC-6564-2022","Santoso, Heru/0000-0002-8350-7856; Purnomo, Herry/0000-0003-1957-9385",European Union [EuropeAid/ENV/2004/081-719]; CIFOR,European Union(European Commission); CIFOR(CGIAR),LThis study is part of the Tropical Forests and Climate Change Adaptation (TroFCCA) Project (http://www.cifor.cgiar.org/trofcca/_ref/home/index.htm).

This study contributes to the implementation of adaptation policies at subnational levels by development of a decision-support model for local-level management of the climate change adaptation process. The study explores the potential for synergetic application of multicriteria decision making analysis and probabilistic reasoning methods by focusing on Bayesian networks, analytical hierarchy processes, and geographic information systems for selection of priority adaptation measures. The study was based on the formation of causal chains, which enable linking management decisions and socioeconomic or biophysical consequences into articulated sequences of conditional relationships. A model was tested in the forestry sector, and it clearly pointed out development of an early warning system and planning of water intake basins as priority adaptation measures.

Six focus group discussions and 120 households' survey were carried out to identify the major climate events in our study areas which were temperature change, drought, heavy rainfall and cyclone and storm surges. Furthermore, main livelihood problems arising from these events were lack of fish availability, scarcity of water in drought seasons and frequent flood in the rainy seasons. Results also revealed that a little portion (10%) of the respondents had well knowledge about the present climate change. However, seasonal livelihood and hazard calendar demonstrated that local people were increasingly changing their livelihood status with changing climatic hazards. At that situation local people tried to adapt themselves with the changing climate through changing their own behavior and introducing some adaptation strategies. We recognized total 16 adaptive measures in the study areas within which crop diversification, floating garden, duck rearing, cage aquaculture, wave protection walls, re-digging of canal and construction of embankments were popular.

The effectiveness of these replications is questionable, because it is necessary to align the set-up of learning processes with the social, economic and environmental conditions of the local context. In this paper, we compare the theory of social learning in Learning Alliances with a Working Group for climate change adaptation in Can Tho City in Vietnam to see how far it is possible to extrapolate current social learning concepts from developed countries to developing countries. The Working Group facilitates participation processes among stakeholders to use and produce knowledge, to work together on problems and to further develop solutions. This is mostly similar to the social learning form of a Learning Alliance. However, the interactions among stakeholders in the Working Group evolve in a much more formal way, which leads to several problems caused by the relative inflexibility of the top-down stipulation of stakeholders' participation, planning procedures and solution approaches. To overcome this challenge, we recommend introducing elements of Learning Alliances to the Working Group, in order to stimulate an open dialogue with incentives and an extension of an action practice approach.","[Clemens, Maria; Rijke, Jeroen; Pathirana, Assela; Evers, Jaap] UNESCO IHE Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands; [Nguyen Hong Quan] Viet Nam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh, Inst Environm & Resources, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City,"Clemens, M (corresponding author), UNESCO IHE Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands.",maria.clemens@web.de,"Evers, Jaap/AAC-6142-2022","Evers, Jaap/0000-0002-9191-0338; Nguyen, Hong Quan/0000-0001-7685-8191",PRoACC (Postdoctoral Programme on Climate Change Adaptation in the Mekong River Basin) programme by the Netherlands Ministry of Development Cooperation (DGIS) through the UNESCO-IHE Partnership Research Fund,PRoACC (Postdoctoral Programme on Climate Change Adaptation in the Mekong River Basin) programme by the Netherlands Ministry of Development Cooperation (DGIS) through the UNESCO-IHE Partnership Research Fund,"This study was funded as a part of the PRoACC (Postdoctoral Programme on Climate Change Adaptation in the Mekong River Basin) programme by the Netherlands Ministry of Development Cooperation (DGIS) through the UNESCO-IHE Partnership Research Fund.

This article investigates how the institutional structure of the Australian private housing development industry influences its risk profile and its ability to innovate, particularly in the type of housing produced. Consumers on the other hand are reluctant to invest in climate-adapted housing, particularly if adaptive products are costlier. Using the results of a multi-method study, including a questionnaire survey and a series of interviews and focus groups, the broader issue of sustainability in housing development is revealed. The article highlights the complex and diverse structure of the various players in the development industry, and shows how their position within the broader structure of the housing and financial market influences their adaptive capacity.","[Shearer, Heather; Coiacetto, Eddo; Taygfeld, Pazit] Griffith Univ, Urban Res Program, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Dodson, Jago] RMIT, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Griffith University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Shearer, H (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Urban Res Program, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",h.shearer@griffith.edu.au,,"Shearer, Heather/0000-0002-7434-1794; Dodson, Jago/0000-0003-4756-4287","National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) [SD11 07, 215679]",National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF),"This work was supported by the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) [project number SD11 07, grant number 215679].",,55,11,11,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0267-3037,1466-1810,,HOUSING STUD,Hous.

While many studies address the impact of climate change on plants and mechanisms of their resilience to climate stressors, the role of the plant microbiome in aiding plants' adaptation to climate change has been less investigated. We argue here that fungal endophytes, an important constituent of the plant microbiome, may be key to the ability of plants to adapt to climatic stressors. The rapid adaptive response of endophytes coupled with their ability to 'transfer' resistance to their hosts may fast-track plants' adaptation to climate change. We briefly review the importance of Class 3 fungal endophytes of terrestrial plants and discuss how they may accelerate adaptations to climate change in crops and natural plant communities and call for efforts directed at improving the understanding of fungal endophyte-facilitated plant health. Such information could aid in devising improved strategies for mitigating climate change effects on plant communities. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

First, that the climate represented in the instrumental record is representative of the future. Instead, future water resource planning cannot be based on old measurements (or sequences derived from attaching change factors to instrumental data) and it should be recognized that stationarity is no longer viable, and, second, that climate modelling can be expected to give precise and certain predictions of the future. Instead, probabilistic projections of the future that take into account the full range of uncertainty should form the basis of robust climate change adaptation plans. As a response to the first assumption, it is suggested that stochastic weather generators represent a particularly useful approach to understanding the impacts of future climate change on water resources at a catchment scale, particularly given the recent release of 'science-hidden' tools such as the UKCP09 weather generator. With regards to the second assumption, it is suggested that modelling activity should identify the range of plausible futures to develop probabilities of risk, using those robust decision-making techniques which can gauge the performance of potential adaptation strategies. The best practice for delivering a replicable and practical hydroclimatological impact assessment for UK water resources at a catchment scale is identified, and an hypothetical example is outlined. It is suggested that although augmenting the resilience of water resources to climate change on a catchment scale is dependent on using the correct modelling tools, the robustness of the method with which that information is used to make adaptation decisions is equally as important.

The results indicate that municipal climate adaptation plans in Ontario are generally strong in features relating to information base, goals and objectives, policies, public participation, and organization and presentation. However, they are relatively weak in terms of implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and interorganizational coordination. We therefore identify three fundamental areas where municipal adaptation planning could be strengthened in the province: first, through engagement and information sharing, there is an opportunity for municipalities in Ontario to learn from one another to improve their plans. Second, there is a need to conduct geographically specific climate risk assessments to better understand localized risks and vulnerabilities; and third, there is a need to develop tools and frameworks to better implement, monitor, and evaluate climate change adaptation as the process unfolds.

The paper seeks to understand the types of vulnerability and explore planned adaptation options through a content analysis of adaptation planning documents in 45 selected coastal cities in developing countries. The result shows the complexity of vulnerabilities that are not only climate change impacts, but more importantly, the socio-economic sensitivity, the insufficient infrastructure system, and limited adaptive capacity. Adaptation responses, correspondingly, address primarily current vulnerabilities rather than future climate change impacts. Local climate change adaptation in developing countries, therefore, cannot separate from socio-economic development and capacity enhancement.

We find that the partnerships catalyse policy innovations in three distinct ways: through collaboration among the partners, through scaling up their activities beyond the partnerships, and by supporting national adaptation politics. However, the instrumental portfolio of the policy innovations is limited. It primarily comprises informational policies (e. g. guidelines), strategies, and plans (usually non-binding). Regarding innovation mechanisms, the analysis highlights the importance of collaboration and learning. Although there is a risk that partnerships will become talking shops, we conclude that, thus far, they support policymakers in tackling the challenges of an emerging policy field.","[Bauer, Anja; Steurer, Reinhard] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, INFER Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Bauer, A (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, INFER Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Vienna, Austria.",anja.bauer@boku.ac.at,"Bauer, Anja/X-5362-2019","Bauer, Anja/0000-0003-2197-1925; Steurer, Reinhard/0000-0002-5000-7046",,,,,53,25,26,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

Strong social networks have been said to support individuals and collective initiatives of adaptation and enhance resilience. As a result, there is an expectation that social capital could reduce vulnerability to risks from the impacts of climate change in the health sector. This paper examines evidence on the role social networks play in individuals' responses to heat wave risk in a case study in the UK. Based on interviews with independently living elderly people and their primary social contacts in London and Norwich, we suggest that strong bonding networks could potentially exacerbate rather than reduce the vulnerability of elderly people to the effects of heat waves. Most respondents interviewed did not feel that heat waves posed a significant risk to them personally, and most said that they would be able to cope with hot weather. Bonding networks could perpetuate rather than challenge these narratives and therefore contribute to vulnerability rather than ameliorating it. These results suggest a complex rather than uniformly positive relationship between social capital, health and adaptation to climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we advance a detailed classification and high-resolution map of physiography, built by combining landforms and lithology (soil parent material) at multiple spatial scales. We used only relatively static abiotic variables (i.e., excluded climatic and biotic factors) to prevent confounding current ecological patterns and processes with enduring landscape features, and to make the physiographic classification more interpretable for climate adaptation planning. We generated novel spatial databases for 15 landform and 269 physiographic types across the conterminous United States of America. We examined their potential use by natural resource managers by placing them within a contemporary climate change adaptation framework, and found our physiographic databases could play key roles in four of seven general adaptation strategies. We also calculated correlations with common empirical measures of biodiversity to examine the degree to which the physiographic setting explains various aspects of current biodiversity patterns. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between landform diversity and measures of climate change to explore how changes may unfold across a geophysical template. We found landform types are particularly sensitive to spatial scale, and so we recommend using high-resolution datasets when possible, as well as generating metrics using multiple neighborhood sizes to both minimize and characterize potential unknown biases. We illustrate how our work can inform current strategies for climate change adaptation. The analytical framework and classification of landforms and parent material are easily extendable to other geographies and may be used to promote climate change adaptation in other settings.","[Theobald, David M.; Albano, Christine M.] Conservat Sci Partners, Truckee, CA 96161 USA; [Theobald, David M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Theobald, David M.; Harrison-Atlas, Dylan] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Monahan, William B.] Natl Pk Serv, Inventory & Monitoring Div, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Albano, Christine M.] Univ Calif Davis, John Muir Inst Environm, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University; United States Department of the Interior; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Theobald, DM (corresponding author), Conservat Sci Partners, Truckee, CA 96161 USA.",davet@csp-inc.org,,,NASA Applied Sciences program [10-BIOCLIM10-0034],NASA Applied Sciences program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This work was supported by the NASA Applied Sciences program (http://www.nasa.gov/applied-sciences/) through award number 10-BIOCLIM10-0034.

A scoping review of English-language literature over the past 10 years was undertaken and the top findings related to animal health adaptation and climate change were inventoried on Google. Documents found in the search focussed predominantly on hypothesizing what hazards might occur with climate change, describing their spread or proposing possible impacts. Scant evidence was found of scholarship related to sustainable animal health climate change adaptation planning or action. Investment and attention to adaptation planning and research are needed to increase confidence in climate change recommendations in the face of continuing uncertainty about the breadth of effects on animal health and the best actions to take in preparing and responding to them.","[Stephen, Craig] Univ Saskatchewan, Western Coll Vet Med, Canadaian Wildlife Hlth Cooperat, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B4, Canada; [Wade, Joy] Fundy Aqua Serv, Nanoose Bay, BC V9P 9B3, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Stephen, C (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Western Coll Vet Med, Canadaian Wildlife Hlth Cooperat, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B4, Canada.",craigstephen.pes@gmail.com,"Stephen, Craig/HNJ-6213-2023",,,,,,14,2,2,0,3,CANADIAN VET MED ASSOC,OTTAWA,"339 BOOTH ST, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1R 7K1, CANADA",0008-5286,,,CAN VET J,Can.

We first present a framework, which distinguishes five functions of leadership within inter-organizational networks: the connective, enabling, adaptive, political-administrative and dissemination functions. Next, we compare the role of leadership in two examples of regional adaptation practices which were initiated by governmental actors with two examples which were initiated by non-governmental actors. The case studies are located in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Our research question is twofold: to what extent can the five functions of leadership be identified in practices of climate change adaptation, and are there differences in the patterns of leadership between adaptation practices which are initiated by governmental and by non-governmental actors? The study shows that although all leadership functions were fulfilled in all four cases, patterns of leadership were different and the fulfilment of leadership functions posed different challenges to non-governmental actors and governmental actors.","[Meijerink, Sander] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Stiller, Sabina] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Keskitalo, E.

Although the literature on adaptation to climate change is rapidly expanding, little is known about the actual extent of implementation. We systematically screened >48,000 articles using machine learning methods and a global network of 126 researchers. Our synthesis of the resulting 1,682 articles presents a systematic and comprehensive global stocktake of implemented human adaptation to climate change. Documented adaptations were largely fragmented, local and incremental, with limited evidence of transformational adaptation and negligible evidence of risk reduction outcomes. We identify eight priorities for global adaptation research: assess the effectiveness of adaptation responses, enhance the understanding of limits to adaptation, enable individuals and civil society to adapt, include missing places, scholars and scholarship, understand private sector responses, improve methods for synthesizing different forms of evidence, assess the adaptation at different temperature thresholds, and improve the inclusion of timescale and the dynamics of responses. Determining progress in adaptation to climate change is challenging, yet critical as climate change impacts increase. A stocktake of the scientific literature on implemented adaptation now shows that adaptation is mostly fragmented and incremental, with evidence lacking for its impact on reducing risk.","[Berrang-Ford, Lea; Callaghan, Max W.; Davis, Katy; Canosa, Ivan Villaverde; van Bavel, Bianca; Mosurska, Anuszka; Minx, Jan C.; Ford, James D.; Arotoma-Rojas, Ingrid] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Siders, A.

Design/methodology/approach - A mixed-method approach was used to gather data on campus climate change vulnerabilities and adaption strategies. A literature review highlighted common themes in adaption research. Meetings, surveys, and a specialized workshop with climate scenarios were created to elicit campus and community input. Findings - The majority of the peer-reviewed and grey literature surrounding climate change adaptation planning is aimed at larger levels of organization than a University campus (e.g. nations, populations, regions, and cities). An original planning process was created to identify vulnerabilities, risks and strategies. Key vulnerabilities fell into three main areas of concern: energy, transportation, and built environment. Adaptation goals, objectives and strategies were outlined for the Dalhousie University Climate Change Plan, based on risk levels associated with vulnerabilities. Research limitations/implications The adaption survey and workshop was created for this research. Small improvements were suggested for future use. The six weather scenarios presented at the workshop emphasized extreme events. Some participants felt that scenarios should be developed that feature smaller climate changes over a longer period of time. The prioritization activity used to establish risk needed to clarify the definition of risk being used. Future scenarios could include more consideration of socio-economic factors. Originality/value - Specific planning frameworks to create campus-level climate adaptation strategies are sparse. A unique planning framework and workshop was developed to identify key climate change adaption strategies for universities.","[Owen, Rochelle; Fisher, Erica] Dalhousie Univ, Off Sustainabil, Halifax, NS, Canada; [McKenzie, Kyle] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University,"Owen, R (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Off Sustainabil, Halifax, NS, Canada.",rjowen@dal.ca,,,,,,,22,10,10,3,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1467-6370,1758-6739,,INT J SUST HIGHER ED,Int.

Solutions journalism, an emerging practice focused on credible stories about responses to societal problems, may offer an alternate approach. From an online experiment with a convenience sample of U.S. undergraduates (N = 348), we found that solutions journalism stories were positively associated with perceived behavioral control, which mediated support for collective action for climate change adaptation. Additionally, attribution of responsibility to individuals and government, participant hope, and eco-anxiety were associated with support for collective action.

The necessity to consider different knowledge systems in climate change research has been established in the fifth assessment report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, gaps in author expertise and inconsistent assessment by the IPCC lead to a regionally heterogeneous and thematically generic coverage of the topic. We conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed academic literature to support better integration of the existing and emerging research on indigenous knowledge in IPCC assessments. The research question underpinning this scoping review is: How is evidence of indigenous knowledge on climate change adaptation geographically and thematically distributed in the peer-reviewed academic literature? As the first systematic global evidence map of indigenous knowledge in the climate adaptation literature, the study provides an overview of the evidence of indigenous knowledge for adaptation across regions and categorises relevant concepts related to indigenous knowledge and their contexts in the climate change literature across disciplines. The results show knowledge clusters around tropical rural areas, subtropics, drylands, and adaptation through planning and practice and behavioural measures. Knowledge gaps include research in northern and central Africa, northern Asia, South America, Australia, urban areas, and adaptation through capacity building, as well as institutional and psychological adaptation. This review supports the assessment of indigenous knowledge in the IPCC AR6 and also provides a basis for follow-up research, e.g. bibliometric analysis, primary research of underrepresented regions, and review of grey literature.","[Petzold, Jan; Hedemann, Christopher] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Hamburg, Germany; [Andrews, Nadine] Univ Lancaster, Pentland Ctr Sustainabil Business, Lancaster, England; [Ford, James D.] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Postigo, Julio C.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",University of Hamburg; Lancaster University; University of Leeds; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Petzold, J (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Hamburg, Germany.",jan.petzold@uni-hamburg.de,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013; Andrews, Nadine/A-1196-2017; Postigo, Julio/AAP-4772-2021; Postigo, Julio C./AAA-4820-2021; Petzold, Jan/ABB-1785-2021","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Andrews, Nadine/0000-0002-0814-2092; Postigo, Julio C./0000-0003-0272-8348; Petzold, Jan/0000-0003-0508-3362","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy [EXC 2037, 390683824]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We thank the three anonymous reviewers and the editor whose comments and guidance helped improve and clarify this manuscript.

However, experience shows it is difficult to implement this interface in practice, particularly at the regional/local scale. This paper considers the communities of practice theory in a new way, by examining two model cases to highlight areas of potential opportunities and contentions with the theory, and to understand how a successful science-policy interface in climate change adaptation projects could be envisioned as a community of practice. The assumption is that the social contexts in which these projects often exist could be established by the concepts of communities of practice', which defines activities in a social and historical context that gives structure to the engagement of participants. We compiled cases from open-ended survey and interactive research experience and observation, and inductively reflected on these vis-a-vis communities of practice. The model cases revealed challenges as well as potential opportunities for communities of practice, in that they exist within a middle space (social context) that could facilitate personal and professional relationship, promote formal and informal interactions, and are needed to negotiate different expertise and narrow apparent boundaries. We conclude that vigorous and dynamic communities of practice promise to nurture the social context in which participants in adaptation projects are potentially engaged, and thus provide a provisional support to the science-policy interface.

However, progress in achieving SDG 12 which calls for, responsible consumption and production has been stalled by the unavailability of indicators that adequately capture and motivate increased responsible consumption. To fill this gap, this article presents an alternative indicator that makes use of cultivar characteristics and uses South African fresh peach and nectarine exports as a focus area. Principal component analysis is used to extract and summarize the product value propositions identified in composite indices that were constructed by weighting the proportional use of cultivars in exports between 1956 and 2017. The indices acquired from the analysis were found to measure the provisions for sustainable consumption, good-quality fruit and off-peak fruit supply. The study's results show that progress was found in the provisions for sustainable consumption and this was mainly driven by improvements in cultivars' climate change adaptability. However, the last two decades have been characterized by years of successive lower readings on this index. Improvements in fruit quality index were found to be attained at the expense of farm enterprise productivity. The study concludes that strategies be developed to encourage the use of cultivars that promote responsible consumption as, if left uninfluenced, market forces will spur unsustainable production.","[Tsvakirai, Chiedza Zvirurami] Univ Mpumalanga, Sch Agr, ZA-1200 Mbombela, South Africa; [Mosikari, Teboho Jeremiah] North West Univ, Dept Econ, ZA-2745 Mahikeng, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Tsvakirai, CZ (corresponding author), Univ Mpumalanga, Sch Agr, ZA-1200 Mbombela, South Africa.",chichitsvakirai@gmail.com; Teboho.Mosikari@nwu.ac.za,"Tsvakirai, Chiedza/AAF-9081-2019","Tsvakirai, Chiedza/0000-0002-6691-7642",North West University post-graduate bursary,North West University post-graduate bursary,This research was funded by the North West University post-graduate bursary.,,33,1,1,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,,,,,,,2615,10.3390/su12072615,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12072615,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LL4WR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000531558100040,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, survey data were used to examine the effect of adoption of adaptation strategies comprising irrigation, soil conservation, and enhanced cropping calendar management, on farm performance and multi-dimensional poverty index. Multinomial Endogenous Treatment Effect (METE) model which accounts for selectivity bias due to both observed and unobserved factors was employed. The results showed that a higher crop output and a greater reduction in downside risk exposure were associated with adoption of adaptation strategies as a package. The results further revealed that using all three strategies led to a significant reduction in multi-dimensional poverty among adapters. This suggests that adaptation is not only an ex-ante strategy against risk exposure, but an effective means of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. It is therefore important for policy makers to consider the promotion of irrigation, soil conservation and cropping calendar management as effective strategies that could enhance farm performance and reduce household poverty. Intensifying extension and farmer education will also enhance adaptation to climate change.","[Issahaku, Gazali; Amikuzuno, Joseph] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Climate Change & Food Secur, Tamale, Ghana; [Abdul-Rahaman, Awal] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agribusiness Management & Finance, Tamale, Ghana",University for Development Studies; University for Development Studies,"Issahaku, G (corresponding author), Univ Dev Studies, Dept Climate Change & Food Secur, Tamale, Ghana.",igazali@uds.edu.gh,"Abdul-Rahaman, Awal/GVS-8674-2022","Abdul-Rahaman, Awal/0000-0002-7356-6326; Issahaku, Gazali/0000-0002-3471-7347",,,,,77,1,1,3,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This study introduces a new definition of urban drainage system (UDS) sustainability, focusing on BMP usage to enhance system performance after adaptation to climate change. Three types of hydraulic reliability index (HRI) plus robustness and improvability indices were used to quantify the potential enhanced sustainability of the system in a changing climate, together with a climate change adaptability index (CCAI). The sustainability of UDS for the safe conveyance of storm-water runoff was investigated under different land-use scenarios: No BMP, BMP in urban areas, and BMP inside and upstream of urban areas, considering climate change impacts. Rainfall-runoff simulation alongside drainage network modelling was conducted using a storm-water management model (US EPA SWMM) to determine the inundation areas for both base-line and future climatic conditions. A new method for disaggregating daily rainfall to hourly, proposed to provide a finer resolution of input rainfall to SWMM, was applied to a semi-urbanized catchment whose upstream runoff from mountainous areas may contribute to the storm-water runoff in downstream urban parts. Our findings confirm an increase in the number of inundation points and reduction in sustainability indices of UDS due to climate change. The results present an increase in UDS reliability from 4% to 16% and improvements in other sustainability indicators using BMPs in upstream suburban areas compared to implementing them in urban areas.","[Binesh, Negin; Niksokhan, Mohammad Hossein; Sarang, Amin] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Environm, Tehran, Iran; [Rauch, Wolfgang] Univ Innsbruck, Unit Environm Engn, Innsbruck, Austria",University of Tehran; University of Innsbruck,"Niksokhan, MH (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Environm, Tehran, Iran.",niksokhan@ut.ac.ir,"Hossein, Mohammad/S-4222-2018; Binesh, Negin/HCG-8468-2022; Rauch, Wolfgang/ABC-9481-2020","Hossein, Mohammad/0000-0001-8172-696X; Rauch, Wolfgang/0000-0002-6462-2832; Binesh, Negin/0000-0003-0548-3171",,,,,82,19,19,2,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0262-6667,2150-3435,,HYDROLOG SCI J,Hydrol.

This phenomenon negatively affects the resilience of ecosystem functions in the face of unexpected impacts, particularly climate change. An approach is required for combining resilience with management in a Wetland City. This study aims to model the resilience of ecosystem functions for climate change adaptation management in a Wetland City via system dy-namics from 2021 to 2100. First, we set a system boundary through expert interviews to identify the main issues in the social-ecological system of a Wetland City. Second, we constructed a social-ecological system of a Wetland City that provides ecosystem function trade-offs between flood control and wildlife habitat provisioning. Then, we simulated the resilience of ecosystem functions according to different climate change adaptative management scenarios. Finally, we determined an appropriate scenario for minimizing the impacts of ecosystem function trade-offs reinforced by climate change. As a result, we recommend that the water level should be managed such that the controlled flood water level ranges from 12 to 14 m and that 30% of the willow areas should be thinned each year. Based on these simulation results, we proposed three climate change adaptive management strategies: considering long-term plans including short-term effects, networking with multiscale community participation, and applying sustainable wetland management to urban planning. Ultimately, this study can contribute to planning and management guidelines for a Wetland City.","[Jin, Lilan; Kim, Min] Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Chon, Jinhyung] Korea Univ, Coll Life Sci & Biotechnol, Div Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University,"Chon, J (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Coll Life Sci & Biotechnol, Div Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",jchon@korea.ac.kr,,"Kim, Min/0000-0003-1392-3958",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2020R1A2B5B01002369]; Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries of Korea (MOF) [20210427],"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries of Korea (MOF)(Ministry of Oceans & Fisheries (MOF), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2020R1A2B5B01002369).

Through an iterative process, expert respondents coalesced around a definition based on risk and vulnerability and agreed that a transparent and acceptable definition should reflect impacts on sustainability. According to the final definition, agreed by the Delphi panel, successful adaptation is any adjustment that reduces the risks associated with climate change, or vulnerability to climate change impacts, to a predetermined level, without compromising economic, social, and environmental sustainability.

Yet, adaptation processes are often ineffective because of deeply entrenched structures of power and different value systems leading to conflicting priorities for action. This paper draws on the notion of cultural politics to understand climate change adaptation in the tourism sector of Aotearoa New Zealand, a sector that depends on the environment for its survival but neglects it for short-term gains, often precipitating maladaptation in the process. Building on insights into how and why the tourism industry - in a pre-COVID19 context - struggled to adapt to the urgent imperatives of climate change, the paper goes on to show how a culture-centred, deliberative democratic approach can be applied to identify pathways for a transition to an environmentally sustainable tourism sector that can adapt to a climate-changed and pandemic-affected world.","[Kurian, Priya] Univ Waikato, Polit Sci & Publ Policy, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Munshi, Debashish] Univ Waikato, Management Commun, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Cretney, Raven] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Morrison, Sandra] Univ Waikato, Fac Maori & Indigenous Studies, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Kathlene, Lyn] LK Consulting, Denver, CO USA; [Kathlene, Lyn] Colorado State Univ, Spk Policy Inst, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Kathlene, Lyn] Colorado State Univ, Colorado Inst Publ Policy, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Kathlene, Lyn] Colorado State Univ, Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",University of Waikato; University of Waikato; University of Waikato; University of Waikato; Colorado State University; Colorado State University; Colorado State University,"Kurian, P (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Polit Sci & Publ Policy, Hamilton, New Zealand.",priya.kurian@waikato.ac.nz,"Munshi, Debashish/ABA-6774-2020; Cretney, Raven/B-6834-2015","Munshi, Debashish/0000-0002-7032-3468; Cretney, Raven/0000-0003-3444-2897; Kurian, Priya/0000-0002-8138-4602; Kathlene, Lyn/0000-0002-4898-856X","Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [Deep South NSC] [C01X1412]; New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE) [C01X1412] Funding Source: New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)","Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [Deep South NSC]; New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE))","This work was supported by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [Deep South NSC Grant No. C01X1412].",,62,0,0,3,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0032-3187,2041-0611,,POLIT SCI,Polit.

This study offers new evidence by investigating the effect of climate change adaptation on household food security, measured by the food insecurity experience scale (FIES) and food consumption score (FCS). The cross-sectional data were collected from 301 small-scale fishermen in East Java Province, Indonesia. This study applied two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI), and two-step predictor substitution (2SPS) approaches to solve an endogeneity issue in modelling the effect of climate change adaptation on household food security. This is achieved by considering the observable and the unobservable factors. The empirical result indicates that climate change adaptation significantly improves household food security. Further estimation also highlights the positive and significant effect of adaptation intensity on the food security measurement. Therefore, this study suggests that fishermen continuously apply adaptation strategies to improve their food security.","[Rahman, Moh Shadiqur] Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Trop Agr & Int Cooperat, Pingtung, Taiwan; [Huang, Wen-Chi] Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agribusiness Management, Pingtung, Taiwan; [Toiba, Hery] Brawijaya Univ, Fac Agr, Agr Socioecon, Malang, Indonesia; [Efani, Anthon] Brawijaya Univ, Fisheries & Marine, Dept Socioecon, Malang, Indonesia",National Pingtung University Science & Technology; National Pingtung University Science & Technology; Brawijaya University; Brawijaya University,"Rahman, MS (corresponding author), Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Trop Agr & Int Cooperat, 1 Xuefu Rd, Neipu Township 912, Pingtung County, Taiwan.",mohsodiqurrahman@gmail.com,"Toiba, Hery/GXG-2224-2022; Toiba, Hery/AFK-1090-2022; Rahman, Moh Shadiqur/AAZ-1338-2021; Huang, Wen-Chi/B-4136-2014","Toiba, Hery/0000-0003-3816-9066; Rahman, Moh Shadiqur/0000-0002-4275-3196; Huang, Wen-Chi/0000-0003-4427-9325",,,,,74,1,1,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,1745-2627,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

EBAs are missing a big opportunity to contribute to impactful, time-sensitive applied work: we have extensive theoretical and empirical knowledge pertinent to conversations about climate-change adaptation and to helping support communities as they cope. This special issue takes a tour of EBA contributions to our understanding of climate-change adaptation, from data on past and contemporary human communities to theoretically informed predictions about how individuals and communities will respond to climate change now and in the future. First, however, we must establish what we mean by climate change and adaptation, along with other terms commonly used by EBAs; review what EBAs know about adaptation and about human responses to climate change; and identify just a few topics EBAs study that are pertinent to ongoing conversations about climate-change adaptation. In this article, we do just that. Conclusion From our work on energy use to our work on demography, subsistence, social networks, and the salience of climate change to local communities, EBAs have an abundance of data and theoretical insights to help inform responses to contemporary climate change. We need to better reach the climate community and general public with our contributions.","[Pisor, Anne C.] Washington State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Pisor, Anne C.] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Behav Ecol & Culture, Leipzig, Germany; [Jones, James H.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Washington State University; Max Planck Society; Stanford University,"Pisor, AC (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",anne.pisor@wsu.edu,"Pisor, Anne C/C-4756-2019; Pisor, Anne/M-9847-2013","Jones, James/0000-0003-1680-6757; Pisor, Anne/0000-0001-5780-4542",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,"Thanks to Rebecca Bliege Bird, Kristina Douglass, Elspeth Ready, Mary Towner, and an anonymous reviewer for comments on this manuscript.

This is furthering the demand for the implementation of governance relocation frameworks. In order to stay true to the principles of environmental justice while at the same time ensuring an effective policy that meets the needs and wants of affected communities, an adaptive relocation framework requires collaboration between state and non-state actors. It is thus important to pay attention to how non-state actors are incorporated into public participatory climate change adaptation efforts. In order to affectively address previous limitations of public participation, stakeholders must pay attention to already existing power systems. Through a case study approach of a village relocation project in Fiji, I examine the role of power in a climate change adaptation plan that involved the community of Vunidogoloa, local government, and national government stakeholders. I employ Steven Lukes's three-dimensional framework of power to the case of Vunidogoloa, a Fijian village that relocated inland due to coastal erosion and shoreline flooding, to illustrate how the political arrangement of participation reinforced existing hierarchies between the village and the government.","[Bertana, Amanda] Univ Maine, Dept Polit Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Bertana, A (corresponding author), Univ Maine, 5754 North Stevens Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",Amanda.bertana@maine.edu,,,National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant [1519218],National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant under Grant #1519218.",,33,12,12,4,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2399-6544,2399-6552,,ENVIRON PLAN C-POLIT,Env.

While efforts to integrate climate change adaptation into development are increasingly prevalent, gaps remain in understanding the specific relationships, potential synergies, and trade-offs in the integration process. This article reviews the links and identifies and analyses three main themes. First, the review suggests that tools are needed to more effectively capture interactions within decision-making processes, and proposes a framework for more focused analyses of these relationships. Second, the framework supports examination of the two sets of goals - development and climate - together, evaluating alternative policies and programmes for their outcomes and identifying key relationships between development, poverty alleviation, and climate goals in both present and future planning processes (such as the MDGs beyond 2015). Finally, by using analytical visualizations, policy and decision makers assisted by relevant stakeholders could identify potential synergies and trade-offs, propose adaptation and mitigation actions, and design appropriate measurements and evaluations. The framework is designed to help direct efforts toward policy and programme outcomes that can best support development and mitigation and adaptation to climate change goals.","[Janetos, Anthony C.; Malone, Elizabeth; de Bremond, Ariane] Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Mastrangelo, Erin] Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hardee, Karen] Futures Grp Inc, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [de Bremond, Ariane] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"de Bremond, A (corresponding author), Joint Global Change Res Inst, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",adebrem@umd.edu,,"de Bremond, Ariane/0000-0002-0924-6053",,,,,75,10,10,7,52,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Further, it discusses potential implications of these differences for flood risk reduction and adaptation to climate change. The discrepancy in flood hazard projections raises caution, especially among decision makers in charge of water resources management, flood risk reduction, and climate change adaptation at regional to local scales. Because it is naive to expect availability of trustworthy quantitative projections of future flood hazard, in order to reduce flood risk one should focus attention on mapping of current and future risks and vulnerability hotspots and improve the situation there. Although an intercomparison of flood hazard projections is done in this paper and differences are identified and interpreted, it does not seems possible to recommend which large-scale studies may be considered most credible in particular areas of Europe.","[Kundzewicz, Z.

Rural households in developing countries adapt to the risks and impacts of climate change both individually and collectively. Empirical research has shown that access to capital financial, human, physical, and social is critical for building resilience and fostering adaptation to environmental stresses. Little attention, however, has been paid to how social capital generally might facilitate adaptation through trust and cooperation, particularly among rural households and communities. This paper addresses the question of how social capital affects adaptation to climate change by rural households by focusing on the relationship of household and collective adaptation behaviors. A mixed-methods approach allows us to better account for the complexity of social institutions at the household, community, and government levels which drive climate adaptation outcomes. We use data from interviews, household surveys, and field experiments conducted in 20 communities with 400 households in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Our results suggest that qualitative measures of trust predict contributions to public goods, a result that is consistent with the theorized role of social capital in collective action. Yet qualitative trust is negatively related to private household-level adaptation behaviors, which raises the possibility that social capital may, paradoxically, be detrimental to private adaptation. Policymakers should account for the potential difference in public and private adaptation behaviors in relation to trust and social capital when designing interventions for climate adaptation.

The methods and results have two parts. Firstly, a case study from the northern grains region examines the use of BMPs for managing climate risks associated with both climate variability and climate change. A series of industry workshops developed and tested a suite of 24 BMP standards for growing dryland grain crops, including four BMPs on risk management based on the Australian Standards for Risk Management. Secondly, priorities for research on climate change adaptation in the primary industries sector are described and evaluated to assess needs for updating, in response to industry and environmental changes. The analysis reveals strong reasons for increasing the priority given to education and extension on risk management and for developing BMPs for both incremental and transformative adaptation, and especially for deriving methods to achieve widespread adoption of BMPs for managing extreme climatic events. Collaborative development of BMPs involving farmers'Andustry/scientists is the process most likely to derive robust BMPs to withstand the complexities of climate risk and build greater resilience of communities and ecosystems.","[George, David A.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Clewett, Jeff Frank] Univ Southern Queensland, Natl Ctr Engn Agr, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Lloyd, David] Queensland Dept Primary Ind, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [McKellar, Richard] Univ Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby, Papua N Guinea; [Tan, Poh-Ling] Griffith Univ, Griffith Law Sch, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Howden, Mark] Australian Natl Univ, Climate Change Inst, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Rickards, Lauren] RMIT, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Ugalde, David] Dept Agr Fisheries & Forestry, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Barlow, Snow] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Griffith University; University of Southern Queensland; Queensland Department of Agriculture & Fisheries; University of Papua New Guinea; Griffith University; Australian National University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Queensland Department of Agriculture & Fisheries; University of Melbourne,"George, DA (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",d.george@griffith.edu.au,"OAM, David Llewellyn LLOYD/AAP-3268-2021; Howden, Stuart/C-1138-2008","Ugalde, David/0000-0003-3657-5087; McKellar, Richard/0000-0002-3888-6009; Howden, Stuart/0000-0002-0386-9671; Rickards, Lauren/0000-0001-6088-3448; Barlow, Snow/0000-0001-5652-5138; Clewett, Jeffrey/0000-0003-4454-9997",,,,,87,8,8,0,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1448-6563,2159-5356,,AUSTRALAS J ENV MAN,Australas.

This article argues that adaptation is an urgent priority, especially for the developing world, to build a resilient society. For poor nations, poverty alleviation is the main policy driver, although changes in livelihood strategies are driven by a range of factors. Using a case study, direct and indirect adaptation is examined with reference to the specific livelihoods of the Chagga people on Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Evidence suggests that coping strategies to maintain livelihood systems can work against long-term adaptation to climate change, unless there is linkage to poverty alleviation. Linking climate change adaptation to project development through notions of additionality does not carry sufficient leverage to simultaneously address poverty alleviation and climate change. It is suggested that, rather than micro-economic project management, a broader macro-economic frame be established. A rights-based approach is argued as a vital driver for informing financial, institutional, political and technological policies and instruments.","[O'Brien, Geoff; O'Keefe, Phil; Rose, Joanne] Northumbria Univ, Div Geog & Environm Management, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [O'Keefe, Phil; Rose, Joanne; Wilson, Leanne] ETC UK, N Shields NE30 1NQ, Tyne & Wear, England; [Meena, Hubert] CEEST Fdn, Ctr Energy Environm Sci & Technol, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",Northumbria University,"O'Brien, G (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Div Geog & Environm Management, Ellison Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",geoff.obrien@unn.ac.uk,"Rose, Jo/HIR-3393-2022",,,,,,29,46,47,1,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Climatic risks to socio-ecosystems are unbounded and highly uncertain and as a result require learning-based approaches to generate appropriate adaptation responses. Geographical research can effectively integrate knowledge developed through the mutual learning of researchers and stakeholders within a place to help guide adaptation planning. The roles of the geographer as a social learning researcher are critically analysed within the context of climate change adaptation research undertaken to support regional natural resource management adaptation planning in South Australia. Three research roles from the social learning literature are used to frame the analysis: the organic intellectual; the advocate for social justice; and the contemporary professional academic. While the social learning helped to develop a range of experimental adaptation policies and actions, the research would have proceeded more effectively if the challenges of the approach had been initially understood. The problems which emerge from social learning research, including inevitable tensions between real-world and academic outcomes, need to be acknowledged along with any successes to prepare future geographers to facilitate learning about socio-ecological risk.","Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Bardsley, DK (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",douglas.bardsley@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,85,6,7,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-9182,1465-3311,,AUST GEOGR,Aust.

Until recently, the predominant research focus has been on governments, communities, and the third sector as key actors in the adaptation process. Yet, there is a growing emphasis internationally on understanding the role of and the need to engage businesses in adaptation given their potential to finance projects, develop technologies and innovative solutions, and enhance the scale and cost-effectiveness of certain adaptation measures. Large national and multinational corporations are among the key actors in this respect. Already, many of these corporations are purportedly taking steps to adapt their operations to climate change. Some stated reasons for their engagement include minimizing potential impacts on value chains, improving resource efficiency, enhancing production of sustainable raw materials, and supporting customers', suppliers', and communities' climate change adaptation efforts. However, there is a paucity of work analysing adaptation actions by these corporations, their motivations and contribution to broader adaptation and climate-resilient development efforts, as well as possible instances of maladaptation. We apply a three-tier framework on drivers, responses, and outcomes to examine the state of knowledge according to recent literature on private sector and corporate adaptation to climate change. Our review highlights that the literature on the impact and outcomes of corporate adaptation actions is sparse and we consider the implications for future research. Our analysis concludes with a reflection on the relevance of corporate-led adaptationfor the companies themselves, policymakers at all scales, as well as society at large.

This is relevant in settings where climate change impacts become manifest at local level, and where financing power resides at national level but decisions are made more locally in a fragmented institutional setting. This study assists in overcoming this gap by analysing how the institutional context (i.e. a decentralised, privatised, fragmented setting) influences the capacity to address climate change challenges in a vulnerable area (the South Devon coast in the UK). There has been little action to address expected climate change impacts in this vulnerable stretch of coast. A lack of clarity around responsibility for addressing climate impacts and a lack of a deliberative structure between various actors involved, within a context of austerity, hamper climate change adaptation.

Yet, Africa is also a continent rich in Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK) that has a long history of informing responses to climatic variability and change. This paper explores the extent to which ILK has been used in climate change adaptation in Africa. It deploys a bibliometric analysis to describe the connections between ILK and climatic change adaptation in Africa, complemented by an analysis of ILK literature and case studies. We consider four key dimensions of ILK, 1) type, 2) contexts of application, 3) value for adaptation, and 4) outcomes and effects in responses to climate change in Africa. Examples drawn from 19 countries across Africa highlight ILK systems are closely connected with biocultural relationships associated with observed patterns of climate change and where adaptation can be more effective when informed by ILK. This body of knowledge is critical to the delivery of climate change adaptation in Africa. The paper suggests some measures through which ILK may be more widely leveraged, both for improved adaptation outcomes, as well as enhancing the biocultural heritage value of ILK systems across Africa. The study commends the remarkable value of ILK in Africa for climate change adaptation and its value for supplementing climate services, particularly in areas with limited access to modern climate and weather forecasts as well as the encouragement of Indigenous communities to develop senses of ownership and active contribution to the sustainability of the future interventions.","[Leal Filho, Walter; Barbir, Jelena] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chan, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Gwenzi, Juliet] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Space Sci & Appl Phys, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Ayal, Desalegn] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Food Secur Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Simpson, Nicholas P.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Adeleke, Lydia] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Fisheries & Aquaculture Technol, Akure, Nigeria; [Tilahun, Behiwot] Jirnma Univ, Sustainable Energy Engn Branch Manager, Nyalamotors SC, Ethiopia; [Chirisa, Innocent] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Demog Settlement & Dev, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Gbedemah, Shine Francis] Univ Environm & Sustainable Dev, Dept Geog & Earth Sci PMB, Somanya, Eastern Region, Ghana; [Nzengya, Daniel M.] St Pauls Univ, Fac Social Sci, PO Private Bag, Limuru 00217, Kenya; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci & Network Educ &, Higashihiroshima 7398530, Japan; [Theodory, Theobald] Mzumbe Univ Inst Dev Studies Ctr Environm Poverty, Changarawe, Tanzania; [Yaffa, Sidat] Univ Gambia, Sch Agr & Environm Sci, Serekunda, Gambia",Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; University of Zimbabwe; Addis Ababa University; University of Cape Town; University of Zimbabwe; Hiroshima University; University of the Gambia,"Barbir, J (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chan, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany.",walter.leal2@haw-hamburg.de; jelena.barbir@haw-hamburg.de; julievimbai@gmail.com; desalula@gmail.com; nick.simpson@uct.ac.za; mladeleke@futa.edu.ng; behiwot.tilahun@gmail.com; chirisa.innocent@gmail.com; sfkgbedemah@gmail.com; dmuasya@spu.ac.ke; Sharifi@hiroshima-u.ac.jp; fttheodory@mzumbe.ac.tz; syaffa@utg.edu.gm,"Sharifi, Ayyoob/M-7584-2013; Simpson, Nick/AAC-4578-2022","Sharifi, Ayyoob/0000-0002-8983-8613; Simpson, Nick/0000-0002-9041-982X; Leal Filho, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Gbedemah, Shine Francis/0000-0001-6118-2360",,,,,77,4,4,7,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

This paper seeks to contribute to the emerging discourse on migration as a form of adaptation to climate change based on empirical studies in the two atoll communities, Reef Islands and Ontong Java, which are located in the periphery of Solomon Islands. The paper will outline current migration patterns in the two island groups and discuss how some of this migration may contribute to adaptation to climate change and other stresses. It shows that migration currently improves access to financial and social capital, reduces pressure on natural resources and makes island communities less vulnerable to extreme weather events and other shocks all factors that contribute positively to adaptive capacity. It also shows that there are major barriers to migration that reduce the efficacy of positive outcomes to both migrants and their home communities, including high transport costs and problems in gaining access to housing, employment and government services in urban destination areas. If it is accepted that voluntary migration may play a positive role in adaptation to climate change in exposed atoll communities, addressing some of the barriers to migration seems logical. This may be done by efforts to stimulate migrant income opportunities, by improving migrant living conditions and by improving the transport services to the islands.","[Birk, Thomas; Rasmussen, Kjeld] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Geog & Geol, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Birk, T (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Inst Geog & Geol, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",tlb@geo.ku.dk; kr@geo.ku.dk,"Rasmussen, Kjeld/A-4212-2015","Rasmussen, Kjeld/0000-0003-3111-584X",,,,,66,28,28,2,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0165-0203,1477-8947,,NAT RESOUR FORUM,Nat.

After scale, the term place within the climate change adaptation literature is most often implicitly used in reference to a delineated and localised region, such as place-based risk assessment or place-based adaptation planning. Here, we use a case study of the Australian island-state of Tasmania to demonstrate the importance and particularity of place in the formation of climate change adaptation issues, problem definition and framing, and the dynamics of knowledge and praxis development across a range of research and industry sectors. We describe the significance of the place Tasmania with regard to its geographical location; its portrayal as an island place; and its cultural meaning and relations. Through a synthesis of climate change adaptation research, policy literature and engagement with researchers and stakeholders, we identify three emergent thematic place characterisations of Tasmania. We find that these characterisations have contributed directly or indirectly to the: initiation and extent of research and practical activities; the framing of adaptation issues and perspectives on potential adaptation responses in different sectors including the marine biodiversity and resources sector, small business and human health sectors. Exposing these influences is essential for focusing future adaptation activities, including research, planning, investment and practice, in Tasmania and other locations where place is a central issue.","[Lyth, Anna; Harwood, Andrew] Univ Tasmania, Sch Land & Food, Geog & Spatial Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Lyth, Anna] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.] CSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [McDonald, Jan] Univ Tasmania, Fac Law, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.; McDonald, Jan] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of the Sunshine Coast; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Lyth, A (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Land & Food, Geog & Spatial Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",anna.lyth@utas.edu.au,"Hobday, Alistair/A-1460-2012; Harwood, Andrew/C-2388-2014; McDonald, Jan/J-7204-2014","Hobday, Alistair/0000-0002-3194-8326; Harwood, Andrew/0000-0003-4562-2906; McDonald, Jan/0000-0002-7953-1458",,,,,101,10,10,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2016,21,6,,,,,730,751,,10.1080/13549839.2015.1015974,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2015.1015974,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,DP0HW,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000378171500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The project explicitly set out to design for governance learning in the sense of developing elements of social infrastructure such as workshops, performances and online media to bring stakeholders together and to facilitate co-learning of relevance to governance. CADWAGO drew on a variety of international cases from past and ongoing work of the project partners. It created a forum for dialogue among actors from different contexts working at different levels and scales. The range of opportunities and constraints encountered are discussed, including the principles and practicalities of working with distributed processes of design and leadership of events. A range of concepts, tools and techniques were used to consider and facilitate individual and collective learning processes and outcomes associated with water governance in the context of climate adaptation. Questions were addressed about how elements of past, present and future water governance thinking and practice are connected and how multi-level systemic change in governance can take place. Some reflections on the effectiveness of the design for learning process are included. The nature of the contribution that projects such as CADWAGO can make in learning for transformation of water governance practices is also critically considered.","[Blackmore, Chris; Foster, Natalie; Collins, Kevin] Open Univ, Appl Syst Thinking Practice Grp, Sch Engn & Innovat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [van Bommel, Severine; de Vries, Jasper] Wageningen Univ, Strateg Commun Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [de Bruin, Annemarieke] Univ York, Stockholm Environm Inst, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England; [Westberg, Lotten] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Foster, Natalie] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sunshine Coast, Qld 4558, Australia; [Roggero, Pier Paolo; Seddaiu, Giovanna] Univ Sassari, Desertificat Res Ctr, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Roggero, Pier Paolo; Seddaiu, Giovanna] Univ Sassari, Dept Agr Sci, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",Open University - UK; Wageningen University & Research; University of York - UK; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of the Sunshine Coast; University of Sassari; University of Sassari,"Blackmore, C (corresponding author), Open Univ, Appl Syst Thinking Practice Grp, Sch Engn & Innovat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",chris.blackmore@open.ac.uk; severine.vanbommel@wur.nl; annemarieke.debruin@york.ac.uk; jasper.devries@wur.nl; Lotten.Westberg@slu.se; npowell@usc.edu.au; natalie.foster@open.ac.uk; kevin.collins@open.ac.uk; pproggero@uniss.it; gseddaiu@uniss.it,"van Bommel, Severine/AAA-7002-2020; Powell, Neil/AAN-1961-2021; Roggero, Pier Paolo/D-2580-2012","Roggero, Pier Paolo/0000-0002-7269-4334; van Bommel, Severine/0000-0002-7782-9162; Foster, Natalie/0000-0003-4349-4162; Collins, Kevin/0000-0002-5716-7536; de Bruin, Annemarieke/0000-0001-8316-5975; Powell, Neil/0000-0002-8665-2370","Climate Change Adaptation and Water Governance (CADWAGO) project, from Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Volkswagen Stiftung; Compagnia di San Paolo through the Europe and Global Challenges programme","Climate Change Adaptation and Water Governance (CADWAGO) project, from Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Volkswagen Stiftung(Volkswagen); Compagnia di San Paolo through the Europe and Global Challenges programme(Compagnia di San Paolo)","We gratefully acknowledge funding for this work, as part of the Climate Change Adaptation and Water Governance (CADWAGO) project, from Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, the Volkswagen Stiftung and Compagnia di San Paolo through the Europe and Global Challenges programme.

However, barriers are often undertheorized and are blind to explanations of their origins or the causal mechanisms by which they operate. This is especially complex for barrier critiques in the Global South in particular. Using a 'hybrid' assemblage and postcolonial approach, this paper disentangles existing barrier critiques in Thailand to lay bare underlying power imbalances and tensions. It finds that 'simplistic' vulnerability framings have deep roots in postcolonial histories; 'complacent' mainstreaming/budgeting trajectories have been nurtured by various IOs, and not necessarily much-maligned Thai bureaucrats; and limited technical expertise/willingness to engage are not so illogical, but rather results of diverse external forces. Given this, this paper urges institutional actors and researchers to reflect on epistemology, ontology, and their own positionality when assessing barriers in future.","[Ober, Kayly] Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Bonn, Germany; [Sakdapolrak, Patrick] Univ Wien, Dept Geog & Reg Res, Vienna, Austria",University of Bonn; University of Vienna,"Ober, K (corresponding author), Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Bonn, Germany.",kober@uni-bonn.de,"Sakdapolrak, Patrick/AAT-6359-2021","Sakdapolrak, Patrick/0000-0001-7137-1552; Ober, Kayly/0000-0001-7473-8161",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LN1309A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This article was made possible by funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, grant number 01LN1309A, towards the research project `Building Resilience through Translocality: Climate Change, Migration and Social Resilience of Rural Communities in Thailand' (TransRe: www.transre.org).The authors would like to thank Harald Sterly, University of Bonn, for his input, which made the paper substantially stronger.

Although the concept has been extensively scrutinized in terms of its potential positive and negative impacts on the poor in developing countries, less attention has been paid to examining the role of PES in the context of adaptation to climate change. PES has some potential to contribute to adaptation to climate change, but there are also risks that it could undermine adaptation efforts. In order to maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs between PES and adaptation, it is important that the conceptual links between both are made explicit. The present article presents the main conceptual links between PES and adaptation to climate change and suggests ways of making PES pro-poor and pro-adaptation. Drawing upon the concepts of vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and socioecological systems, it is suggested that PES can potentially contribute to adaptation in three main ways: through enhancements in the provision of ecosystem services, by enhancing adaptive capacity in the way PES is designed and implemented, and by providing an incentive mechanism to adopt specific measures for adaptation to climate change. Reflecting on the lessons from the PES and poverty literature, the article suggests ways to make PES pro-poor and pro-adaptation and concludes with further research needs in this area.",,,,,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),"An earlier version of this article was presented at the 11th Biennial Conference of the International Society for Ecological Economics (ISEE) in Oldenburg in 2010, and I am grateful for the feedback received from the participants at the conference.

It describes how crony capitalism evolved in state-sponsored rural development as the national economy moved towards a new neoliberal model. Cronies reorganized rice production and re-appropriated capital flows. As smallholder farmers were marginalized in the rice economy, their reliance on the state for irrigation water made them vulnerable to drought. As the state adapted its water allocation scheme to drought conditions, it determined who would profit and who would lose their livelihood. The authors use this analysis to argue that climate change adaptation is a normative process that may be used to justify coercion and control of specific classes of people. To understand this process, current adaptation frames must be broadened to include the organization of production and the appropriation and realization of capital flows. This broadening facilitates an understanding of how climate change adaptation strategies produce stratified class structures; some classes are made vulnerable to climate change while others profit. Breaking with the common refrain in much of the critical literature on neoliberal development, the authors argue that state responses to neoliberal change - not just neoliberal change itself - must be increasingly incorporated into critical development studies of rural transformations.","[Warner, Benjamin P.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Childers, Daniel L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA; [Childers, Daniel L.] Cent Arizona Phoenix LTER Program, Tempe, AZ USA; [Childers, Daniel L.] Urban Sustainabil Res Coordinat Network, Tempe, AZ USA; [Kuzdas, Christopher] EDF, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Kuzdas, Christopher] EDF Colorado River team, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Stocks, Gabriela] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA",University of New Mexico; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Inter-American Development Bank,"Warner, BP (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",bpwarner@unm.edu; dan.childers@asu.edu; ckuzdas@edf.org,,"Warner, Benjamin P./0000-0002-8874-1692; Childers, Daniel/0000-0003-3904-0803","C.W. & Modene Neely Charitable Foundation; Organization for Tropical Studies National Science Foundation [0553925, 1132840]; GISER Integrative Society and Environment Research Program; NSF through the CAP LTER Program [DEB-1026865, DEB-1637590]; University of Florida's Tropical Conservation and Development program; NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant [0851073]",C.W. & Modene Neely Charitable Foundation; Organization for Tropical Studies National Science Foundation; GISER Integrative Society and Environment Research Program; NSF through the CAP LTER Program; University of Florida's Tropical Conservation and Development program; NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Funding was generously provided by the C.W. & Modene Neely Charitable Foundation, the Organization for Tropical Studies National Science Foundation (Grants 0553925 and 1132840), and the GISER Integrative Society and Environment Research Program.

Data collection involved quantitative and qualitative methods applied over a 6-year period from 2012 to 2017. This included a survey of 103 government staff (20 in Malawi, 29 in Tanzania and 54 in Zambia) and 242 interviews (106 in Malawi, 86 in Tanzania and 50 in Zambia) with a wide range of stakeholders, many of whom were interviewed multiple times over the study period, together with content analysis of relevant policy and programme documents. Whilst the climate adaptation agenda emerged in all three countries around 2007-2009, associated with multilateral funding initiatives, the rate and nature of progress has varied-until roughly 2015 when, for different reasons, momentum slowed. We find differences between the countries in terms of specifics of how they operated, but roles of two factors in common emerge in the evolution of the climate change adaptation agendas: national leadership and allied political priorities, and the role of additional funding provided by donors. These influences lead to changes in the policy and institutional frameworks for addressing climate change, as well as in the emphasis placed on climate change adaptation. By examining the different ways through which ideas, power and resources converge and by learning from the specific configurations in the country examples, we identify opportunities to address existing barriers to action and thus present implications that enable more effective adaptation planning in other countries. We show that more socially just and inclusive national climate adaptation planning requires a critical approach to understanding these configurations of power and politics.","[Pardoe, Joanna; Conway, Declan] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Vincent, Katharine; Tembo-Nhlema, Dorothy] Kulima Integrated Dev Solut Pty Ltd, Postnet Suite H79,Private Bag X9118, ZA-3200 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Vincent, Katharine] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Architecture & Planning, Private Bag X3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Archer, Emma] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Environm Studies, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Lynnwood Rd, ZA-0002 Hatfield, South Africa; [Dougill, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mkwambisi, David] Malawi Univ Sci & Technol, POB 5196, Limbe, Malawi",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Witwatersrand; University of Pretoria; University of Leeds,"Conway, D (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Vincent, K (corresponding author), Kulima Integrated Dev Solut Pty Ltd, Postnet Suite H79,Private Bag X9118, ZA-3200 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.;Vincent, K (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Architecture & Planning, Private Bag X3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",j.l.pardoe@gmail.com; katharine@kulima.com; d.conway@lse.az.uk; emma.archer@up.ac.za; a.j.dougill@leeds.ac.uk; dmkwambisi@must.ac.mw; dorothytembo@yahoo.com,"Conway, Declan/HCH-7778-2022; Vincent, Katharine/L-5669-2019","Vincent, Katharine/0000-0003-3152-1522; Conway, Declan/0000-0002-4590-6733; Archer, Emma/0000-0002-5374-3866; Dougill, Andrew/0000-0002-3422-8228; Mkwambisi, David/0000-0002-8010-5528","UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/M020398/1, NE/M020010/1, NE/M02007X/1, NE/M020177/1, NE/M020509/1]; UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID); UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy [ES/R002371/1, ES/K006576/1]; ESRC [ES/R009708/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/M02007X/1, NE/M020398/1, NE/M020010/1, NE/M020509/1, NE/M020177/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID); UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was carried out under the Future Climate For Africa UMFULA project, with financial support from the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), grant references: NE/M020398/1 (LSE), NE/M020010/1 (Kulima), NE/M02007X/1 (CSIR), NE/M020177/1 (University of Leeds) and NE/M020509/1 (LUANAR), and the UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID); and with financial support from the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, grant numbers ES/R002371/1 (LSE) and ES/K006576/1 (Leeds).

Adaptation seeks to reduce the harmful consequences and harness any beneficial opportunities arising from the changing climate. However, given that human activities are the main cause of environmental transformations worldwide(2), it follows that adaptation itself also has the potential to generate further pressures, creating new threats for both local and global ecosystems. From this perspective, policies designed to encourage adaptation may conflict with regulation aimed at preserving or enhancing environmental quality. This aspect of adaptation has received relatively little consideration in either policy design or academic debate. To highlight this issue, we analyse the trade-offs between two fundamental ecosystem services that will be impacted by climate change: provisioning services derived from agriculture and regulating services in the form of freshwater quality. Results indicate that climate adaptation in the farming sector will generate fundamental changes in river water quality. In some areas, policies that encourage adaptation are expected to be in conflict with existing regulations aimed at improving freshwater ecosystems. These findings illustrate the importance of anticipating the wider impacts of human adaptation to climate change when designing environmental policies.","[Fezzi, Carlo] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Fezzi, Carlo; Harwood, Amii R.; Lovett, Andrew A.; Bateman, Ian J.] Univ E Anglia, CSERGE, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of East Anglia,"Fezzi, C (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",c.fezzi@uea.ac.uk,"Lovett, Andrew A/C-9942-2011; Lovett, Andrew/Q-6723-2019","Lovett, Andrew/0000-0003-0554-9273; Bateman, Ian/0000-0002-2791-6137; Fezzi, Carlo/0000-0002-4860-9128","European Union [FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IOF-302290]; SEER - ESRC [RES-060-25-0063]; WEPGN, Brock University","European Union(European Commission); SEER - ESRC; WEPGN, Brock University","This research was supported by the European Union Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship 'Land Use Change, Environment and Society (LUCES)' (Ref: FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IOF-302290), the SEER Project, funded by the ESRC (ref: RES-060-25-0063) and WEPGN, Brock University.

A recent World Bank report highlighted that over 100 million people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty as a result of climate change. There is currently a lack of information about how to simultaneously address climate change and poverty. Climate change challenges provide an opportunity for those impacted most to come up with new and innovative technologies and solutions. This article uses an example from Mozambique where local and international partners are working side-by-side, to show how developing countries can simultaneously address climate change and poverty reduction using an ecosystem-based adaptation approach. Using ecosystem-based adaptation, a technique that uses the natural environment to help societies adapt to climate change, developing countries can lead the way to improve climate adaptation globally. This paradigm shift would help developing countries become leaders in ecosystem-based adaptation and green infrastructure techniques and has implications for climate policy worldwide. POLICY RELEVANCE The Paris Agreement resulting from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 21st Conference of Parties (COP 21) in December 2015 was rightly lauded for its global commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions. However, COP 21 was also historic because of its call for non-party stakeholders to address climate change, inclusion of a global goal of 'enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability', and the United States' commitment of $800 million to adaptation funding. The combination of recognizing the need for new stakeholders to commit to climate change adaptation, the large impact climate change will have on the developing world, and providing access to funds for climate change adaptation creates a unique opportunity for developing countries to pave the way in adaptation policies in practices. Currently, developing countries are creating National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) for the UNFCCC. Through including a strong component of ecosystem-based adaptation in NAPs, developing countries can shape their countries' policies, improve local institutions and governments, and facilitate a new generation of innovative leaders. Lessons learned in places like Mozambique can help lead the way in other regions facing similar climatic risks.","[Quinn, Colin F.] US Agcy Int Dev, Ronald Reagan Bldg, Washington, DC 20523 USA; [Howard, Jennifer F.] Conservat Int, Arlington, VA USA; [Chen, Chen; Coffee, Joyce E.] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame Global Adaptat Index, South Bend, IN USA; [Quintela, Carlos E.] Chemon Int, Washington, DC USA; [Parker, Britt A.] NOAA, Baldwin Grp Inc, N Charleston, SC USA; [Smith, Joel B.] Abt Associates Inc, Boulder, CO USA",United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Conservation International; University of Notre Dame; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; ABT Associates,"Quinn, CF (corresponding author), US Agcy Int Dev, Ronald Reagan Bldg, Washington, DC 20523 USA.",colin@physisglobal.com,,,,,,,15,2,2,3,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Based on field research conducted in Surat, India, across a period of two years, I illustrate how climate adaptation is rooted in preexisting and contextually specific urban political relationships that can be traced through the city's developmental history. Through assessing Surat's experience with recent industrialization, episodes of natural disasters, to more recent engagement with the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network, I highlight how adaptation planning, as well as how adaptation is integrated into urban development planning, occurs through processes of prioritizing adaptation against development needs and implementing options that are cocreated among public and civic actors. This case empirically shows how adaptation is mainstreamed into urban development planning, illustrates the trade-offs associated with how different urban actors plan and implement adaptation in the context of rapid industrialization, and assesses how internationally funded adaptation programs are operationalized in the context of local social and political realities.","[Chu, Eric] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Chu, E (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",E.K.Chu@uva.nl,"Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615","Department of Urban Studies and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Program on Environmental Governance and Sustainability at Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) in New Delhi, India; U.S. Institute for International Education's National Security Education Program","Department of Urban Studies and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Program on Environmental Governance and Sustainability at Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) in New Delhi, India; U.S. Institute for International Education's National Security Education Program","The author (s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Financial support came from the Department of Urban Studies and Planning and the Program on Environmental Governance and Sustainability at Center for International Studies, both at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) in New Delhi, India, and the U.S. Institute for International Education's National Security Education Program.",,93,34,34,2,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-774X,1472-3425,,ENVIRON PLANN C,Environ.

More recently, John Urry (2011) contributed a rather speculative book on 'post-carbon sociology', yet sociologists continue to lag behind geographers and psychologists in contemplating the social and cultural dimensions of climate-change adaptation. The findings of the present paper suggest that the sociology of climate-change adaptation could take its lead from the work of cultural and human geographers on people-place relationships, and engage with art theory and practice to offer imaginative insights into the scope and scale of the climate-change challenge. Sociologists could also make a major contribution to current debate on the roles of community action and community engagement in climate-change adaptation, noting that the word 'community' is open to abuse and misunderstanding. Drawing on his own research on the challenges facing local communities in Australia and Sri Lanka, the author combines previously disconnected bodies of literature to identify some important points of departure for the journey towards Urry's 'post-carbon sociology'.","RMIT Univ, Globalism Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Mulligan, MJ (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Globalism Res Ctr, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",martin.mulligan@rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,55,8,8,0,18,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0963-2719,1752-7015,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

Accordingly, frameworks that integrate urban water management with climate change adaptation become increasingly relevant. The Water Sensitive Cities (WSC) framework is built on three pillars that address cities' role as communities and networks, water catchments, and providers of ecosystem services. A major element of the framework is the WSC index, which can be applied to assess cities by using multiple indicators under each pillar. With the objectives of adjusting and testing the WSC index in the context of the North Sea Region through a transdisciplinary knowledge co-production process, this paper presents the results from a self-assessment conducted by seven midsize cities. Insights gained from the comparison of self-assessment results are twofold. Firstly, the cities need to value the benefits of ecosystem services for climate change adaptation, and integrate climate change into other sectors. Secondly, the cities differ regarding the priority of climate change, and even the cities that aspire to be frontrunners have weaknesses. The application of the self-assessment process also creates an exchange and mutual learning platform for cities, and increases their awareness on climate resilience.","[Ozerol, Gul; Bressers, Hans; Lulofs, Kris] Univ Twente, Enschede, Netherlands; [Dolman, Nanco] Royal HaskoningDHV, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bormann, Helge; Boege, Mike] Jade Univ Appl Sci, Oldenburg, Germany",University of Twente; Jade University of Applied Sciences,"Ozerol, G (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Enschede, Netherlands.",,"Dolman, Nanco/AGM-8983-2022; Bormann, Helge/C-1880-2008","Dolman, Nanco/0000-0002-8134-6307; Bormann, Helge/0000-0001-7740-4554; Ozerol, Gul/0000-0002-4805-6666",Interreg VB North Sea Region Programme,Interreg VB North Sea Region Programme,"We would like to thank the CATCH practice partners for their valuable inputs and commitment throughout the self-assessment process; the two reviewers for their insightful comments that helped us improve the paper significantly; Susan Lijzenga for her feedback to an earlier version of the paper; and Rim Khamis and Jelle Reitsma for reviewing several literature sources as part of their thesis studies on water management, climate change adaptation and urban resilience.

The results show that a city's climate change adaptation plan and GDP have significant positive relationships with the economic opportunities present in the cities. Meanwhile, climate change risks also have a positive relationship with economic opportunities. Furthermore, economic opportunities present in cities have a negative relationship with three variables: one group of climate actions and two groups of stakeholders.

The paper is based on a three stage hybrid policy-making cycle: (i) agenda setting; (ii) policy formulation; and (iii) policy implementation stage, where the contributions of EbA can horizontally (on the ground) or vertically (strategic stage) be mainstreamed and integrated. A total of nine national and sectoral development and climate change policies, and 329 climate change adaptation projects are examined belonging to different policy-making stages. The major findings include that the role of ESS is marginally considered as an adaptation component in most of the reviewed policies, especially at the top strategic level (vertical mainstreaming). However, at the policy formulation and implementation stage (horizontal mainstreaming), they are largely ignored and priority is given to structural adaptation policies and projects, e.g., large scale concrete dams and embankments. For example, ESS's roles to adapt sectors such as urban planning, biodiversity management and disaster risk reduction are left unchecked, and the implementation stage receives overwhelming priorities and investments to undertake hard adaptation measures such that only 38 projects are related to EbA. The paper argues that: (i) dominant structural adaptation ideologies; (ii) the expert and bureaucracy dependent policy making process; and (iii) the lack of adaptive and integration capacities at institutional level are considerably offsetting the EbA mainstreaming process that need to be adequately addressed for climate change adaptation.","[Huq, Nazmul; Ribbe, Lars] TH Koln Univ Appl Sci, ITT Inst Technol & Resources Management Trop & Su, Betzdorfer Str 2, D-50679 Cologne, Deutz, Germany; [Huq, Nazmul; Bruns, Antje] Univ Trier, Governance & Sustainabil Lab, Dept Spatial & Environm Sci 4, D-54286 Trier, Germany; [Huq, Saleemul] Independent Univ, ICCCAD, Plot 16 Block B,Aftabuddin Ahmed Rd, Dhaka 1220, Bangladesh",Universitat Trier; Independent University Bangladesh (IUB),"Huq, N (corresponding author), TH Koln Univ Appl Sci, ITT Inst Technol & Resources Management Trop & Su, Betzdorfer Str 2, D-50679 Cologne, Deutz, Germany.;Huq, N (corresponding author), Univ Trier, Governance & Sustainabil Lab, Dept Spatial & Environm Sci 4, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",nazmulhuqrussell@gmail.com; brunsa@uni-trier.de; lars.ribbe@fh-koeln.de; saleemul.huq@iied.org,"Huq, Nazmul/AAS-5209-2020","Huq, Nazmul/0000-0002-5791-2217; Ribbe, Lars/0000-0003-3052-1782; Bruns, Antje/0000-0002-9266-5530",Technische Hochschule Koln; University of Trier; International Centre for Climate Change Adaptation and Development (ICCCAD),Technische Hochschule Koln; University of Trier; International Centre for Climate Change Adaptation and Development (ICCCAD),"The authors are grateful to the two anonymous reviewers for their very constructive comments to improve the manuscript.

One possible climate change adaptation measure is the construction of lakes to increase water availability for drinking and irrigation (food production) and decrease fire risk. These lakes can also increase local biodiversity and human well-being. However, other non-target services such as carbon (C) storage, water purification, and sediment retention might also change. Our main aim was to evaluate the trade-offs on non-targeted ecosystem services due to lakes construction in drylands. This was done using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) modeling tools, comparing a Mediterranean area located in southwest (SW) Europe, with and without artificial lakes. Results showed that the construction of artificial lakes caused an increase of 9.4% in C storage. However, the consequent increase in agricultural area decreased water purification and sediment retention services. This could diminish the life span of the lakes changing the initial beneficial cost-benefit analysis on lakes as adaptation measures to climate change. As a global measure for mitigation and adaptation to climate change strategy, we consider lake construction in drylands to be positive since it can store C in sediments and reduces the vulnerability to water scarcity.

Winter tourism is closely related to climate variations, especially in mountain regions where resorts are heavily dependent on snow. This paper explores how to effectively integrate a climate change adaptation perspective with local discourses about sustainability and tourism, an increasing priority for policy-makers in the region and elsewhere. It reports on the development and application of a participatory decision support process for the analysis of adaptation strategies for local development of an Alpine tourism destination, Auronzo di Cadore (Dolomites, Italy). This experience significantly contributed to the idea that an efficient combination of modelling capabilities, decision support tools, and participatory processes can substantially improve decision-making for sustainability. The authors show that, in this case study, such a combination of methods and tools allowed for managing the involvement of local actors, stimulating local debates on climate change adaptation and possible consequences on winter tourism, encouraging creativity and smoothing potential conflicts, and easing the integration of the qualitative knowledge and the preferences of the involved actors with quantitative information. This contributed to an integrated sustainability assessment of alternative strategies for sustainable tourism planning.","[Bonzanigo, Laura; Giupponi, Carlo; Balbi, Stefano] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Climate Impacts & Policies Div, Venice, Italy; [Bonzanigo, Laura; Giupponi, Carlo; Balbi, Stefano] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy; [Balbi, Stefano] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Bizkaia, Spain",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Bonzanigo, L (corresponding author), Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Climate Impacts & Policies Div, Venice, Italy.;Bonzanigo, L (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy.",laura.bonzanigo@cmcc.it,"Giupponi, Carlo/E-5895-2012; BALBI, STEFANO/M-5740-2013","Giupponi, Carlo/0000-0001-5358-9208; BALBI, STEFANO/0000-0001-8190-5968","Veneto Region, lead partner of the ClimAlpTour project; Italian Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea","Veneto Region, lead partner of the ClimAlpTour project; Italian Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea","This research was supported by the Veneto Region, lead partner of the ClimAlpTour project and by the Italian Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea.",,31,48,49,5,84,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

This paper identifies consequentialist and non-consequentialist ethical principles to guide a fair international burden-sharing scheme of climate change adaptation costs. We use these ethical principles to derive political principles - historical responsibility and capacity to pay - that can be applied in assigning a share of the financial burden to individual countries. We then propose a hybrid 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities' approach as a promising starting point for international negotiations on the design of burden-sharing schemes. A numerical assessment of seven scenarios shows that the countries of Annex I of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change would bear the bulk of the costs of adaptation, but contributions differ substantially subject to the choice of a capacity to pay indicator. The contributions are less sensitive to choices related to responsibility calculations, apart from those associated with land-use-related emissions. Assuming costs of climate adaptation of USD 100 billion per year, the total financial contribution by the Annex I countries would be in the range of USD 65-70 billion per year. Expressed as a per capita basis, this gives a range of USD 43-82 per capita per year. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Public health adaptation is imperative, but there has been little discussion of how to increase adaptive capacity and resilience in public health systems. OBJECTIVES: We explored possible explanations for the lack of work on adaptive capacity, outline climate-health challenges that may lie outside public health's coping range, and consider changes in practice that could increase public health's adaptive capacity. METHODS: We conducted a substantive, interdisciplinary literature review focused on climate change adaptation in public health, social learning, and management of socioeconomic systems exhibiting dynamic complexity. DISCUSSION: There are two competing views of how public health should engage climate change adaptation. Perspectives differ on whether climate change will primarily amplify existing hazards, requiring enhancement of existing public health functions, or present categorically distinct threats requiring innovative management strategies. In some contexts, distinctly climate-sensitive health threats may overwhelm public health's adaptive capacity. Addressing these threats will require increased emphasis on institutional learning, innovative management strategies, and new and improved tools. Adaptive management, an iterative framework that embraces uncertainty, uses modeling, and integrates learning, may be a useful approach. We illustrate its application to extreme heat in an urban setting. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing public health capacity will be necessary for certain climate-health threats. Focusing efforts to increase adaptive capacity in specific areas, promoting institutional learning, embracing adaptive management, and developing tools to facilitate these processes are important priorities and can improve the resilience of local public health systems to climate change.","[Hess, Jeremy J.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Emergency Med, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Hess, Jeremy J.; McDowell, Julia Z.; Luber, George] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Climate & Hlth Program, Div Environm Hazards & Hlth Effects, Natl Ctr Environm Hlth, Atlanta, GA USA; [Hess, Jeremy J.; McDowell, Julia Z.] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Hlth, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",Emory University; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; Emory University; Rollins School Public Health,"Hess, JJ (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Emergency Med, Steiner Bldg,1st Floor,49 Jesse Hill Jr Dr, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",jhess@emory.edu,,,,,,,163,109,109,11,115,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

This paper starts with a review of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, Palestine and Jordan, in the context of the regional health systems, demography and politics. We suggest that Israel and Palestine function as one epidemiological unit due to extensive border crossing of inhabitants and tourists, resulting in cross-border infections and potential for outbreaks transmission. Indeed, there is a correlation between the numbers of confirmed cases with a 2-3 weeks lag. In contrast, Jordan has the ability to seal its borders and better contain the spread of the virus. We then discuss comparative public health aspects in relation to the management of COVID-19 and long term adaptation to climate change. We suggest that lessons from the current crisis can inform regional adaptation to climate change. There is an urgent need for better health surveillance, data sharing across borders, and more resilient health systems that are prepared and equipped for emergencies. Another essential and currently missing prerequisite is close cooperation within and across countries amidst political conflict, in order to protect the public health of all inhabitants of the region.

In Mexico, extreme events and climate change projections suggest the urgency of promoting local adaptation policies and strategies. This paper provides an assessment of adaptation actions based on the local knowledge of coffee farmers in southern Mexico. The strategies include collective and individual adaptation actions that farmers have established. To determine their viability and impacts, carbon stocks and fluxes in the system's aboveground biomass were projected, along with water balance variables. Stored carbon contents are projected to increase by more than 90%, while maintaining agroforestry systems will also help serve to protect against extreme hydrological events. Finally, the integration of local knowledge into national climate change adaptation plans is discussed and suggested with a local focus. We conclude that local knowledge can be successful in conserving agroecological coffee production systems.","[Ruiz-Garcia, Patricia] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Dept Fitotecnia, Km 38-5 Carretera Mexico Texcoco, Chapingo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Conde-Alvarez, Cecilia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Atmosfera, Circuito Invest Cient S-N, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [David Gomez-Diaz, Jesus; Monterroso-Rivas, Alejandro Ismael] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Dept Suelos, Km 38-5 Carretera Mexico Texcoco, Chapingo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Monterroso-Rivas, AI (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Dept Suelos, Km 38-5 Carretera Mexico Texcoco, Chapingo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico.",al18127941@chapingo.mx; conde@servidor.unam.mx; dgomez@correo.chapingo.mx; aimrivas@correo.chapingo.mx,"Monterroso Rivas, Alejandro Ismael/GRE-7561-2022; Rivas, Alejandro Ismael Monterroso/ABB-3809-2020","Rivas, Alejandro Ismael Monterroso/0000-0003-4348-8918; Ruiz-Garcia, Patricia/0000-0003-3283-5996",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) - Universidad Autonoma Chapingo,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) - Universidad Autonoma Chapingo(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),This research received no external funding.

The forestry sector, with its long time laps between decisions to plant and harvesting stands, is among the most relevant to investigate in this respect. This contribution analyzes the results of a survey conducted in Wallonia (Belgium) among private forest owners (PFO) and an array of organizations, both public and private, that influence these owners' actions. The objective of our research is to investigate already implemented or envisaged practices of climate change adaptation as well as the adaptive capacity of these PFOs. In this respect, adaptive capacity is defined as the ability of systems, institutions, humans and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences (of climate change) (IPCC, 2014, p. 2). The results show that different ways of (not) integrating climate change in forest management are visible in the sample of PFOs that can be divided into different profiles of (non) adapters. Analyzing these profiles reveals the influence of multiple objective and sociocognitive factors contributing to the PFOs adaptive capacity. The way climate change adaptation is conceived and implemented by other forest and timber actors has also repercussions on adaptive capacity as some adaptive measures are promoted and facilitated while others are hindered.

Bangladesh is one example where environmental changes have long been amongst the multitude of reasons for migrating, with contemporary climate change suggested as a major impetus towards more migration. This paper examines local expert perceptions of migration as a climate change adaptation strategy for Bangladeshis. Seventeen in-depth interviews were conducted with local experts in Bangladesh and Assam (India) on environmental change and migration to understand the perspectives of those with formal education and expert-related jobs who come from the areas being directly affected by Bangladeshi migration. Findings show that local experts consider that migration is used and will be used for climate change adaptation in Bangladesh, but migration is not solely for climate change adaptation, instead interweaving with all other factors influencing migration-related decisions.","[Stojanov, Robert; Prochazka, David] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Informat, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Kelman, Ilan] UCL, Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kelman, Ilan] UCL, Inst Global Hlth, 30 Guilford St, London WC1N 1EH, England; [Kelman, Ilan] Univ Agder, Gimlemoen 25, N-4630 Kristiansand, Norway; [Ullah, A.

Thus, climate change adaptation is crucial, especially for natural resource-dependent farmers. Based on a qualitative research approach using a feminist political ecology lens, this article investigates gendered patterns of rural agrarian livelihoods and climate adaptation in the province of Thai Binh. In doing so, we identify differentiated rights and responsibilities between female and male farmers, leading to unequal opportunities and immobility for females, making them more vulnerable to climate impacts and threatening to reduce their capacity to adapt. This research also shows that demands on farmers to contribute to perpetual increases in agricultural output by the state poses a challenge, since farming livelihoods in Vietnam are increasingly becoming feminised, as a result of urbanisation and devaluation of farming. Past and present national strategies and provincial implementation plans linked to climate change do not consider the burden affecting rural female farmers, instead the focus lies on addressing technical solutions to adaptation. With little attention being paid to an increasingly female workforce, existing gender inequalities may be exacerbated, threatening the future existence of rural livelihoods and the viability of Vietnam's expansion into global markets.","[Ylipaa, Josephine; Gabrielsson, Sara] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, POB 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; Lund Univ, LUCSUS, POB 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Ylipaa, J; Gabrielsson, S (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, POB 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",ylipaa@live.se; sara.gabrielsson@lucsus.lu.se; anne.jerneck@lucsus.lu.se,"Ylipää, Josephine/AAA-1167-2019","Ylipaa, Josephine/0000-0003-0578-0651","Swedish International Centre for Local Democracy (ICLD, Sweden)","Swedish International Centre for Local Democracy (ICLD, Sweden)","This research was funded by Swedish International Centre for Local Democracy (ICLD, Sweden).",,54,22,22,5,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY 2,2019,11,10,,,,,,,2805,10.3390/su11102805,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11102805,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IC5LV,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000471010300088,View Full Record in Web of Science

Rising temperatures, abnormal rainfall increases, storms, floods, and droughts have become more frequent and severe phenomena in Vietnam. This causes serious consequences for the livelihood security of the poor. Binh Chanh district (Ho Chi Minh City) is an area subject to severe risks of climate change in the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam. Here, the low-income groups are the most vulnerable because their adaptive capacity is still limited and low. This study uses the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) to assess the level of vulnerability to climate change in households and communes in the Binh Chanh district. LVI includes three components: exposure (E), sensitivity (S), and adaptive capacity (AC) based on 23 indicators selected by reviewing the literature and consulting with experts. The article also conducted surveys with 931 households in 16 administrative communes in Binh Chanh for primary data. The research results showed that Tan Kien and An Phu Tay communes have the highest level of vulnerability since they are areas with mainly low-lying terrain and contiguous location rivers; the people in these towns are also vulnerable groups because they do not have a stable source of income, skills, and have low education and experience in climate change adaptation. The study also proposes some solutions to improve the capacity to adapt to climate change of vulnerable communes specifically: 1) creating diversified livelihoods with stable incomes; 2) deploying community-based climate change adaptation models for communes adjacent to rivers; 3) implementing adaptive agriculture and improving social capital for vulnerable households; 4) building resettlement areas for households heavily affected by disasters; and 5) raising awareness among low-income households to respond to natural hazards in the context of climate change.","[Truong, Dinh Duc; Hang, Nguyen Dieu; Huan, Le Huy] Natl Econ Univ, Fac Environm Climate Change & Urban Studies, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Dat, Tran Tho] CFVG, Hanoi, Vietnam",National Economics University - Vietnam,"Dat, TT (corresponding author), CFVG, Hanoi, Vietnam.",tranthodat@neu.edu.vn,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,"National Economics University, Vietnam","National Economics University, Vietnam","This research is funded by the National Economics University, Vietnam.",,41,0,0,8,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Using the multinomial panel endogenous switching regression model, we discovered that combining climate change adaptation strategies such as crop rotation and improved seed varieties is the most effective way to improve the welfare of smallholder farmers. The average treatment effect (ATT) results show that all CCAS have a positive and significant effect on the pattern of welfare improvement among smallholder farmers, but combinations of CCAS provide the highest payoffs. As a result, the combination of crop rotation and improved seed is the most appealing CCAS package that farmers could adopt as an ex-ante strategy to improve farm household welfare. We also discovered that climate change and technology adoption are the most important factors influencing the welfare of rural farm households. Furthermore, we discover that the effectiveness of climate change adaptation strategies varies by farm households. Thus, we argued that targeted extension and advisory services, as well as other policies that support the synchronization of adaptation strategies, are critical for improving the welfare of rural farm households.","[Mogess, Yohannes Kefale; Ayen, Dereje Degu] Haramaya Univ, Dept Econ, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Mogess, Yohannes Kefale] Haramaya Univ, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia",Haramaya University; Haramaya University,"Mogess, YK (corresponding author), Haramaya Univ, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.",yohanneskefale4@gmail.com,,"Mogess, Yohannes Kefale/0000-0002-4941-252X",,,,,47,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2048-3694,,,FOOD ENERGY SECUR,Food Energy Secur.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/fes3.451,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fes3.451,,FEB 2023,12,Agronomy; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,9B3RF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000934656900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Societies across the world are working to adapt to climate change, but climate adaptation is currently inadequate to meet the needs of the people left increasingly vulnerable and the places that risk being irreversibly changed or destroyed. One tactic of climate adaptation is strategic retreat, sometimes referred to as managed retreat. Strategic retreat is the process by which the government or another entity purchases (buys out) developed properties that are at risk of destruction or have been destroyed by natural disasters. The structure is most often demolished, and the land is placed under a permanent easement to prevent future development. What happens next is dependent on the entities involved in the buyouts, and can range from derelict, vacant lots to full restoration of ecosystems and their abilities to mitigate flood damage. Sometimes recreational amenities, such as trails or park infrastructure, are prioritized and funded as well. Conservation organizations can leverage their expertise in conservation planning, land acquisition and restoration, policy advocacy, and partnership development to improve the implementation of strategic retreat so that nature and people can thrive in the long term. In this policy paper, we review ways that conservation organizations have and can continue to engage in buyout processes to ensure positive outcomes for communities and nature. Conservation organizations must also evolve their approaches to climate adaptation to integrate equity and redress historical injustices in land use, and contribute towards improving strategic retreat for a more just and resilient future across disaster-prone communities. This work focuses on the context of disasters and climate adaptation in the USA, though many of the principles presented are applicable around the world.","[Kodis, Mali'o] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Bortman, Marci] Nature Conservancy, New York, NY USA; [Newkirk, Sarah] Nat Conservancy Calif, Santa Cruz, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Nature Conservancy; Nature Conservancy,"Kodis, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",maliokodis@gmail.com,,"Kodis, Malio/0000-0001-9746-7667","Coastal Science and Policy Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz; Nature Conservancy","Coastal Science and Policy Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz; Nature Conservancy","Mali'o Kodis' time was supported by a fellowship from the Coastal Science and Policy Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, as well as a grant from The Nature Conservancy.",,45,3,3,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

A total of 220 arable farming households completed a livelihoods survey preplanting. The perceptions survey was followed by a survey of 154 households post-harvest for the attitudes questions based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). In addition to the positive responses from the farmers towards climate change perceptions, TPB findings reveal that such perceptions could lead to intentions to adapt as determinants of attitude were significant. Subjective norm was a significant predictor of adaptation intention in Kofa, but not in Zango. Perceived behavioural control, though useful, was not a determinant of climate change adaptation intention. Most importantly, principal component analysis (PCA) of climate change perception variables allowed us to discriminate smallholder farming households and can be used as a tool for segmentation into climate change-perceiving and nonperceiving farming households. Efforts towards improving the determinants of behavioural intention for the poorly perceiving group could lead to better decisions to adapt to climate change and provide more targeted extension support in the future.","[Jellason, Nugun Patrick; Baines, Richard N.; Conway, John S.] Royal Agr Univ, Sch Agr, Cirencester GL7 6JS, Glos, England; [Jellason, Nugun Patrick] Natl Biotechnol Dev Agcy, Bioresource Dev Ctr, Abuja 900001, Nigeria; [Ogbaga, Chukwuma C.] Nile Univ Nigeria, Dept Biol Sci, Airport Rd, Abuja 900001, Nigeria",,"Jellason, NP (corresponding author), Royal Agr Univ, Sch Agr, Cirencester GL7 6JS, Glos, England.;Jellason, NP (corresponding author), Natl Biotechnol Dev Agcy, Bioresource Dev Ctr, Abuja 900001, Nigeria.",nugunjellason@gmail.com; richard.baines@rau.ac.uk; john.conway@rau.ac.uk; chukwumaogbaga@gmail.com,"Ogbaga, Chukwuma C/ABD-5384-2020","Ogbaga, Chukwuma C/0000-0003-4951-2253; Jellason, Nugun P/0000-0002-5583-354X",,,,,70,12,12,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0760,,SOC SCI-BASEL,Soc.

Adaptation to current climate variability has been proposed as an additional way to approach adaptation to long-term climate change. In effect improved adaptation to current climate is a step in preparation for longer term climate change. International programs of research and assessment are separately organized to deal with natural disasters and climate change. There is no scientific concensus so far, that extreme events have changed in frequency on a world-wide basis, although some regional changes have occured. It is extremely unlikely that significant shifts in the means of weather distrbutions will take place without shifts in the tails. In some situations it may make more sense to focus on adaptation to extreme events and the tails of distributions. In other circumstances adaptation to the norms is the logical focus. The relationship between normal climate and climate change is examined in terms of single and complex variables and phenomena. It is proposed that the research communities studying adaptation to extreme events and adaptation to climate change work more closely together, perhaps in a newly organized joint research program.","ENVIRONM CANADA,ATMOSPHER ENVIRONM SERV,DOWNSVIEW,ON,CANADA",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada,"Burton, I (corresponding author), UNIV TORONTO,INST ENVIRONM STUDIES,ENVIRONM ADAPTAT RES GRP,TORONTO,ON,CANADA.",,,"Burton, Ian/0000-0003-2191-0639",,,,,11,123,127,3,24,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

There remains, however, considerable uncertainty about which factors influence adaptation project completion, as a pre-cursor to effective adaptation. In this study, we empirically establish the links between project attributes (duration, funding, cash co-financing, in-kind contributions, location, and adaptation approach) and whether a project is likely to complete or be terminated. We examine this issue by developing a logistic regression model to predict the probability of completion for small-scale climate change adaptation projects using a new dataset of 190 projects in the South Pacific (with end dates ranging from November 1995 to May 2016) that were financed through the Global Environment Facility Small Grants Programme. Empirical results suggest that all else equal, such a project was more likely to complete if it was shorter, received more co-financing cash input and in-kind support from other donors and project partners, was explicitly targeted towards climate change adaptation, focused on a single adaptation approach, and was undertaken in Micronesia or Fiji. Our results can be used to help funders and project proponents design projects to mitigate the risks of non-completion, particularly in high-risk settings. These findings should not be misinterpreted to undermine the importance of continued investment in adaptation projects across the whole of South Pacific region.","[Hasan, Syezlin; Smart, James C.

Our framework is different, and in this respect more comprehensive, than the present UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) approach and could be used to address concerns that the IPCC approach is oversimplified. We have studied the role of uncertainty in climate change adaptation planning using examples from four Danish water related sectors. The dominating sources of uncertainty differ greatly among issues; most uncertainties on impacts are epistemic (reducible) by nature but uncertainties on adaptation measures are complex, with ambiguity often being added to impact uncertainties. Strategies to deal with uncertainty in climate change adaptation should reflect the nature of the uncertainty sources and how they interact with risk level and decision making: (i) epistemic uncertainties can be reduced by gaining more knowledge; (ii) uncertainties related to ambiguity can be reduced by dialogue and knowledge sharing between the different stakeholders; and (iii) aleatory uncertainty is, by its nature, non-reducible. The uncertainty cascade includes many sources and their propagation through technical and socio-economic models may add substantially to prediction uncertainties, but they may also cancel each other.

Yet, how resilience is precisely understood, how its institutionalisation works and how organisations can operationalise principles for achieving resilience often remains vague. Therefore, the paper explores how institutional and organisational theory can enhance the understanding on resilience. Linking organisational institutionalism to resilience theory, the paper analyses in particular how resilience thinking can diffuse and translate into organisational action, and which challenges and barriers may exist. Empirical research on formal urban climate change adaptation in Vietnam is used to explore the important role of distinctive institutional features in a given culture, region or sector for shaping this process. It is argued that such context-specific institutional framework conditions are often underemphasised, thereby, hampering the transferability as well as operationalisation and implementation of resilience propositions. Relevant aspects include epistemological, ontological and normative dimensions. Linking the case study to neoinstitutional theory, recommendations are developed for increasing the intercultural transferability of resilience thinking into organisational practices.","United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",,"Garschagen, M (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, UN Campus,Hermann Ehlers Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",garschagen@ehs.unu.edu,,,,,,,110,49,49,1,73,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Key findings from the study were as follows. First, the perception of climate change risk and awareness of impacts of climate change had strong effects on the preferences for and willingness to participate in measures rather than trusting the government and values pertaining to the policy decision-making process. Second, farmers tended to prefer protection and transfer of risks (insurance) as climate change adaptation measures more than nonfarmers did. Farmers also tended to be unwilling to participate in withdrawal, reflecting the difficulty of relocating agricultural land. Third, farmers' willingness to participate in climate change adaptation measures was determined strongly by their preferences. Therefore, to increase preference, there needs to be communication about multiple risks including climate change risks associated with not only adjustment and protection, which tend to be preferred, but also withdrawal, which tends to not be preferred. Contrasting with these, nonfarmers tended to prefer any particular climate change adaptation measures statistically-significantly, but they tended to be willing to accept self-help absolutely and withdrawal relatively. Also, farmers' willingness to participate in climate change adaptation measures was determined strongly by their preference. One of the ways to increase the preference is communicating about the multiple risks including climate change risks associated with adjustment, protection and transfer which tend to be preferred more than nonfarmers did. Finally, trust in the government and values pertaining to the policy decision-making process did not necessarily have a serious impact on policy preferences and willingness to participate, both for farmers and nonfarmers. More analyses for other sectors will be needed for further study.","[Baba, Kenshi] Tokyo City Univ, Fac Environm Studies, Tokyo 2248551, Japan; [Tanaka, Mitsuru] Hosei Univ, Fac Social Sci, Tokyo 1940298, Japan",Tokyo City University; Hosei University,"Baba, K (corresponding author), Tokyo City Univ, Fac Environm Studies, Tokyo 2248551, Japan.",kbaba@tcu.ac.jp; mtanaka@hosei.ac.jp,"Baba, Kenshi/P-6079-2019","Baba, Kenshi/0000-0003-3878-2960","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-8) of the MOE (the Ministry of the Environment) of Japan; JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) [26340122]; SI-CAT (Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology) of the MEXT (the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) of Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26340122] Funding Source: KAKEN","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-8) of the MOE (the Ministry of the Environment) of Japan; JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); SI-CAT (Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology) of the MEXT (the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) of Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-8) of the MOE (the Ministry of the Environment) of Japan, a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (No. 26340122) of the JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science), and by SI-CAT (Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology) of the MEXT (the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) of Japan.",,32,4,4,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,MAY,2019,7,5,,,,,,,71,10.3390/cli7050071,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7050071,,,11,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,IC4UK,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000470961700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

One such challenge is water security, an aspect that draws us to the subject matter of climate change adaptation. This article discusses findings about institutional complexities surrounding Day Zero, a concept associated with water taps running dry because of drought conditions as aggravated by climate change in the city of Cape Town, South Africa. The thrust on institutional complexities is deliberate, as this affects how crisis situations like Day Zero were handled. The data were generated mainly from the actor-actant-network theory, events study as well as document and discourse analysis methods. The actor-actant-network theory is used widely to trace how actors (humans) and actants (non-human phenomena) interact in space and time through their networks, following narratives like Day Zero, and act on climate-related matters. The analysis applied elements of grounded theory, resulting in categories and themes emerging for discussion. The article found that narratives surrounding Day Zero were embedded in both political and administrative dilemmas and red tape. Despite these challenges, the article concludes that Day Zero remains one of the landmark learning points for climate change adaptation and water security in Cape Town, South Africa, and in other cities across the world. The article recommends that Day Zero experiences continue to be embraced positively and documented further to enhance local government climate adaptation for water security currently and into the future as well.","[Nhamo, Godwell; Agyepong, Adelaide O.] Univ South Africa, Inst Corp Citizenship, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Nhamo, G (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Inst Corp Citizenship, Johannesburg, South Africa.",nhamog@unisa.ac.za,"Nhamo, Godwell/N-5165-2015","Nhamo, Godwell/0000-0001-5465-2168; Agyepong, Adelaide Owusu/0000-0002-7298-8615",,,,,37,11,11,0,12,AFRICAN CENTRE DISASTER STUDIES,POTCHEFSTROOM,"INTERNAL BOX 265, NORTH-WEST UNIV, PRIVATE BAG X6001, POTCHEFSTROOM, 2520, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

This paper explores institutionalizing resilience and adaptation to climate change in the intergovernmental transportation planning processes that address bridge infrastructure in the Northeastern United States (USA), specifically in Vermont and Maine. The research presented here relies on nine interviews with policy-makers and planners, a survey of transportation project prioritization criteria, development of a longitudinal bridge funding database, and its integration with publicly available geospatial data. It presents a novel spatial analysis methodology, a modified version of which could be adopted by transportation agencies for prioritizing scarce adaptation funds. Although transportation agencies are undertaking a variety of mitigation activities to address business-as-usual needs, climate change adaptation and resilience efforts remain underprioritized. Adaptation is a global concern, but impacts vary dramatically between regions and require localized solutions. Bridges and culverts, which are especially vulnerable to climate-induced flooding impacts, have complex maintenance and design processes and are subject to convoluted adaptation planning procedures. Critical gaps in resources and knowledge are barriers to improved adaptation planning. Restructuring the transportation project prioritization procedures used by planning organizations to explicitly include adaptation may provide a novel strategy to institutionalize resilience in transportation. These procedures must be considered in the context of the intergovernmental networks that exist to support transportation infrastructure. Although these networks will likely vary across countries, the approaches introduced here to study and address transportation infrastructure adaptation may be applied to many settings.","[Schulz, Anna; Zia, Asim; Koliba, Christopher] Univ Vermont, Dept Community Dev & Appl Econ, Morrill Hall 102,146 Univ Pl, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont,"Schulz, A (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Community Dev & Appl Econ, Morrill Hall 102,146 Univ Pl, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",Anna.Schulz@uvm.edu,,"zia, asim/0000-0001-8372-6090",United States Department of Transportation via the University of Vermont Transportation Research Center; National Science Foundation [EPS-1101317]; Office of Integrative Activities; Office Of The Director [1101317] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,United States Department of Transportation via the University of Vermont Transportation Research Center; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Integrative Activities; Office Of The Director(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),We gratefully acknowledge funding from the United States Department of Transportation via the University of Vermont Transportation Research Center and National Science Foundation EPS-1101317.,,46,9,9,1,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

However, at a global level, there is little statistical data about small cities, and their numbers and locations are thus so far unknown. In this paper, five cases of small coastal cities, two of which are located in the USA -Miami Beach and Milford -and three, in Australia (Mandurah), Bangladesh (Sundarbans), and South Africa (Knysna) respectively, are presented and discussed in view of adaptation to climate change. All cases reported vulnerability to sea level rise, with impacts compounded by increasing storminess (and even hurricanes of increasing intensity), tides, inland flooding and loss of natural habitat. Changes in precipitation resulted in both reduced river flow, leading to sediment deficits and coastal erosion (from the sea) or increased river flow with similar damage (from the land). Adaptation response was most clearly delineated along lines of development status with wealthier, more highly developed cities pursuing more technologically advanced solutions, whilst the two cities of the Global South focused more on governance and capacity building solutions. Also, it was clear from the Knysna case that if a city or municipality lacks the capacity to effectively respond with adaptation measures, local private wealth may dominate and result in haphazard adaptation responses to the detriment of regional adaptation planning efforts. While this paper provides a first step in establishing a richer understanding, it is clear that more case studies across global regions and economic categories are required to deepen our understanding of climate change adaptation planning in small cities.","[O'Donoghue, Sean; Sutherland, Catherine; Motau, Andries] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Kwa Zulu, South Africa; [O'Donoghue, Sean] EThekwini Municipal, Durban, South Africa; [Lehmann, Martin] Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark; [Major, David] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Haddaden, Nancy] Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Kibria, Abu Smg] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Costanza, Robert; Groves, Colin; Behie, Alison] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Johnson, Katie] RFF CMCC European Inst Environm Econ, Milan, Italy; [Johnson, Katie] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Lecce, Italy; [Johnson, Katie] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Venice, Italy",University of Kwazulu Natal; Aalborg University; Columbia University; University of Western Australia; University of Arizona; Australian National University; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"O'Donoghue, S (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Kwa Zulu, South Africa.",sean.odonoghue@durban.gov.za,"Johnson, Katie/AHA-9459-2022","Johnson, Katie/0000-0002-8369-8234; Lehmann, Martin/0000-0003-2089-4550; Behie, Alison/0000-0002-7436-3694",,,,,14,3,3,1,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,OCT 1,2021,211,,,,,,,,105788,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105788,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105788,,JUN 2021,8,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Oceanography; Water Resources,UI6TP,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000690737100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate change involves long-term slow changes in climate, short-term year-to-year climatic variability and unpredictable extreme climatic events. Agriculture, especially crop production, is highly dependent on the prevailing weather conditions and therefore is highly sensitive to climate change, both short-term and long-term. Almost all General Circulation Models predict that the processes of climate change such as increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and global warming will continue well into the 21(st) century even If the mitigation measures to minimize the causes of climate change exert maximum effect. Therefore, it is imperative that a well-co-ordinated and sustained effort is set in motion to increase the capacity of Sri Lankan agriculture to adapt to short and long-term climate change. Adaptation involves measures to minimize the impacts of climate change. At present, implementation of climate change adaptation measures in Sri Lanka is piecemeal and lacks co-ordination and direction. Hence, a clear policy framework identifying the measures to be pursued and the roles of different stakeholders is needed for allocating and channelling the necessary financial and human resources for successful adaptation to climate change. A clear and comprehensive policy framework also becomes the basis for development of an effective road map and an action plan to achieve successful adaptation. This paper discusses a policy framework for adaptation of Sri Lankan agriculture to climate change based on the following components: (a) Quantification and forecasting of climate change; (b) Assessment of impacts and vulnerability to climate change; (c) Identification and formulation of responses to adapt to climate change; (d) Creating and strengthening the institutional framework and infrastructure to implement and monitor adaptation measures to climate change. Major advances in scientific research on components a, b and c, both locally and internationally, are briefly discussed and key policy measures to facilitate and accelerate their progress along with the relevant stakeholders are identified. Importance of allocating adequate resources to promote research on all aspects of climate change and their impacts by developing infrastructure, a critical mass of experts and an institutional framework to effectively link all stakeholders to channel the formulated adaptation measures to the farming communities at the grass-root level are emphasized.","Univ Peradeniya, Dept Crop Sci, Fac Agr, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka",University of Peradeniya,"De Costa, WAJM (corresponding author), Univ Peradeniya, Dept Crop Sci, Fac Agr, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.",janendrad@yahoo.com,,,,,,,105,19,19,1,75,NATL SCIENCE FOUNDATION SRI LANKA,COLOMBO,"47/5  MAITLAND PLACE, COLOMBO, 00000, SRI LANKA",1391-4588,2362-0161,,J NATL SCI FOUND SRI,J.

Building and expanding on these literatures, this article draws on poststructuralist discourse theory, specifically its notion of political fantasy, to explore further how these prevalent techno-managerial approaches to adaptation operate and what it might be that makes them seem appealing. Based on an exploratory, qualitative analysis of how affect (emotions) and fantasy are at play in the German government discourse on adaptation, the article discerns four specific forms that fantasy takes in official documents: (1) fantasies of control and preparedness, (2) fantasies of objectivity and reason, (3) fantasies of a shared sense of place, and (4) fantasies about 'the good life'. These support the common narrative for how to adapt to climate change in the German context - primarily in a way that does not challenge or change the social order. The findings show that German adaptation policy is sustained and legitimised by fantasmatic elements that seek to speak to a-rational desires and provide important affective anchor points for collective identification, especially those evoking a shared sense of place. In other words, the German adaptation policy discourse is not constructed only at the level of rational argumentation, but very much so on the level of affect. In demonstrating this, the article makes the case for placing political fantasy into the analytical and theoretical vocabulary within critical adaptation research.","[Remling, Elise] Univ Canberra, Fac Business Govt & Law, Ctr Environm Governance, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Remling, Elise] Univ Canberra, Inst Governance & Policy Anal, Fac Business Govt & Law, Ctr Environm Governance CEG, Bldg 24,1 Kirinari St, Bruce, ACT 2617, Australia",University of Canberra; University of Canberra,"Remling, E (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, Inst Governance & Policy Anal, Fac Business Govt & Law, Ctr Environm Governance CEG, Bldg 24,1 Kirinari St, Bruce, ACT 2617, Australia.",Elise.Remling@canberra.edu.au,,,,,,,86,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2399-6544,2399-6552,,ENVIRON PLAN C-POLIT,Env.

There is widespread consensus that they both support and require transdisciplinary approaches, notably by involving citizens in the change process and finding innovative ways to unite different actors' efforts and capacities. However, there is little empirical evidence regarding the actual value of citizen involvement to sustainability in this field. Against this background, this paper examines whether (or not) current forms and conditions of citizen involvement help to create a platform to support nature-based solutions and ensure a transformative adaptation process. The results show that under current conditions, citizen engagement often hampers sustainable outcomes. In fact, current structures and mechanisms for mainstreaming nature and climate considerations into sectoral planning are limited and, furthermore, neglect citizen involvement. In addition, there is a blind spot with respect to personal spheres of transformation toward sustainability regarding citizens, civil servants, and decision-makers. Key constraints are power structures and the lack of cognitive/emotional and relational capacities required for improved democratic governance. If we are to tap into the potential of nature-based solutions to increase climate adaptation governance, we need targeted financial and human resources, and greater capacity to overcome current constraints and support all levels and phases of mainstreaming, notably planning, implementation, monitoring, and learning.","[Wamsler, C.] Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Alkan-Olsson, J.; Hanson, H.] Lund Univ Ctr Environm & Climate Res CEC, Lund, Sweden; [Bjorn, H.] Lomma Municipal, Lomma, Sweden; [Falck, H.] Malmo Municipal, Malmo, Sweden; [Oskarsson, T.] Eslov Municipal, Eslov, Sweden; [Simonsson, E.] Kristianstad Municipal, Kristianstad, Sweden; [Zelmerlow, F.] Hoganas Municipal, Hoganas, Sweden",Lund University; HOGANAS AB,"Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden.",christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,,,Lund University; Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2011-901]; Mistra Urban Futures,Lund University; Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Mistra Urban Futures,"Open access funding provided by Lund University.

This entails the development of assessment methods and metrics as plans are drafted and actions implemented. To this end, this paper explores the concept of credibility as a critical issue in climate policy and develops an Adaptation Policy Credibility (APC) conceptual and operational assessment framework for helping to allocate public funding and private investments, and for implementing and catalysing climate policy. Through a pilot testing in four early-adopting cities (Copenhagen, Durban, Quito and Vancouver), a clear potential for large-n tracking and assessment exercises of local climate adaptation plans is envisaged. The APC approach might also be useful to guide individual cities that aim to improve their adaptation planning and policy-making processes.","[Olazabal, Marta; Galarraga, Ibon; De Murieta, Elisa Sainz] Basque Ctr Climate Change, BC3,Edificio Sede,Planta 1,Parque Cient UPV EHU, Leioa 48914, Bizkaia, Spain; [Ford, James; Lesnikowski, Alexandra] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ford, James] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Ford, James; Lesnikowski, Alexandra] Tracking Adaptat Climate Change Collaborat TRAC3, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [De Murieta, Elisa Sainz] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); McGill University; University of Leeds; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Olazabal, M (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change, BC3,Edificio Sede,Planta 1,Parque Cient UPV EHU, Leioa 48914, Bizkaia, Spain.",marta.olazabal@bc3research.org,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013; de Murieta, Elisa Sainz/M-1166-2019; Olazabal, Marta/AFT-6957-2022; Sainz de Murieta, Elisa/D-4946-2012","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; de Murieta, Elisa Sainz/0000-0001-8120-3392; Olazabal, Marta/0000-0002-3381-0654; Sainz de Murieta, Elisa/0000-0001-8120-3392; Galarraga, Ibon/0000-0002-2683-9360","European Commission [653522]; Eusko Jaurlaritza [POS_2016_1_0089]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [FPDI2013-16631, IJCI-2016-28835]",European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Eusko Jaurlaritza; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO)(Spanish Government),"This work was supported by the European Commission [653522];Eusko Jaurlaritza [POS_2016_1_0089];Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [FPDI2013-16631,IJCI-2016-28835];",,88,36,36,2,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1946-3138,1946-3146,,INT J URBAN SUSTAIN,Int.

Different responses have emerged to intervene in these communities and slum upgrading is currently considered the best framework. How slum upgrading interventions engage with climate change adaptation and mitigation is not fully explored in the literature. This article scrutinizes three recent slum upgrading programs in Latin America to uncover the ways these tend to engage or not with climate change adaptation and mitigation. The analysis revealed that slum upgrading is both a policy mechanism to address socio-economic issues and an instrument by which built-environment interventions can enhance adaptation and mitigation in informal settlements. Six key areas emerged from the analysis of the case studies that link slum upgrading to climate change adaptation and mitigation through infrastructure and policies: (1) security of tenure, (2) relocation and barriers, (3) public space, (4) energy-efficient and improved architecture, (5) connectivity, and (6) land management. Slum upgrading can be an effective mechanism that combines mitigation and adaptation efforts whilst addressing sustainable development priorities in disadvantaged territories.","[Nunez Collado, Jose Rafael] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington Sch Architecture, 139 Vivian St, Wellington 6011, New Zealand; [Wang, Han-Hsiang] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan; [Nunez Collado, Jose Rafael] Natl Cent Univ, IESD Program, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan",Victoria University Wellington; National Central University; National Central University,"Wang, HH (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.",jose.nunezcollado@vuw.ac.nz; hhwang@ncu.edu.tw,,"Nunez C., Jose R./0000-0002-2071-3548",Victoria University of Wellington,Victoria University of Wellington,The authors would like to thank the reviewers and the editor for their constructive comments during the revision process.

These events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity under climate change scenarios. Although the climatic change may be unavoidable, effective planning and response can reduce its impacts. Drawing on empirical data from a 3-year multi-sectoral study of climate change adaptation for human settlements in the South East Queensland region, Australia, this paper draws on multi-sectoral perspectives to propose enablers for maximising synergies between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to achieve improved planning outcomes. Multi-sectoral perspectives are discussed under four groups of identified enablers: spatial planning; cross-sectoral planning; social/community planning; and strategic/long term planning. Based on the findings, a framework is proposed to guide planning systems to maximise synergies between the fields of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to minimise the vulnerability of communities to extreme weather events in highly urbanised areas.

This paper is specifically focused on the assessment of the opportunities and challenges of traditional knowledge and institutions for community's sustainable climate change adaptation in Ethiopia. We used knowledge products form journal articles, policy documents, working papers, policy briefs, and other gray literature. In addition, two case studies were conducted in central and eastern Ethiopia by interviewing 251 randomly selected households. This helped to determine the state-of-the art for knowledge co-products for community's sustainable climate change adaptation and natural resource management. Regardless of the challenges from global change, cultural erosion and transformation, traditional knowledge still serve as the bases for weather forecasting, agricultural and natural resource management thereby sustain community's livelihoods and landscape resilience against the impacts of climate change and variability. Traditional knowledge and institutions in Ethiopia have maintained landscapes for millennia: Konso cultural landscapes and Gedeo Agroforestry systems are some to mention. The knowledge systems have also contributed for the large diversity of crops and livestock breeds in Ethiopia which play roles in community's climate change adaptation. From this assessment, it can be concluded that both scientific and traditional knowledge have their own gaps and what will be better is the integration of the two to give an additive impact that can foster sustainable development and build livelihood and landscape resilience in times of climate change.","[Mekonnen, Zenebe; Kidemu, Marta; Abebe, Habtamu; Semere, Mihiret; Gebreyesus, Marta; Worku, Adefris; Tesfaye, Musse; Chernet, Abraham] Ethiopian Environm & Forest Res Inst, POB 24536, Addis Ababa 1000, Ethiopia",,"Mekonnen, Z (corresponding author), Ethiopian Environm & Forest Res Inst, POB 24536, Addis Ababa 1000, Ethiopia.",zenebem@eefri.gov.et,,,Ethiopian Environment and Forest Research Institute (EEFRI),Ethiopian Environment and Forest Research Institute (EEFRI),"The authors are highly indebted to acknowledge Ethiopian Environment and Forest Research Institute (EEFRI) for covering the financial costs for this study.

This study applies an iterative process of field assessments and literature reviews across multiple governance levels and spatial scales to identify constraints to effective formulation and implementation of climate change related policies and strategies in Uganda. Data was collected through sex-segregated participatory vulnerability assessments with farming communities in Rakai district, policy document reviews, and interviews with policy actors at national and district levels. Findings reveal that the key challenges to effective policy implementation are diverse and cut across the policy development and implementation cycle. Policies are mainly developed by central government agencies; other actors are insufficiently involved while local communities are excluded. There is also a communication disconnect between national, district, and community levels. Coupled with limited technical capacity and finances, political interference, and absence of functional implementation structures across these levels, climate change adaptation becomes constrained. We propose strategies that enhance linkages between levels and actors, which will improve policy formulation, implementation and ultimately adaptation by smallholders.","[Ampaire, Edidah L.; Jassogne, Laurence; Providence, Happy; Acosta, Mariola; Van Astena, Piet] Int Inst 1m Trop Agr, POB 7878, Kampala, Uganda; [Twyman, Jennifer] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Cali 6713, Colombia; [Winowiecki, Leigh] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, POB 30772, Nairobi, Kenya",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Ampaire, EL (corresponding author), Int Inst 1m Trop Agr, POB 7878, Kampala, Uganda.",E.Ampaire@cgiar.org; L.Jassogne@cgiar.org; H.Providence@cgiar.org; M.Acosta@cgiar.org; j.twyman@cgiar.org; L.A.WINOWIECKI@CGIAR.ORG; P.VanAsten@cgiar.org,,"Acosta, Mariola/0000-0003-4456-1283",CGIAR,CGIAR(CGIAR),"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

Starting with theoretical discourse on urban climate change adaptation strategy, this research examines state-of-the-art challenges and trends in planning for adaptation measures in Russia's Arctic industrial centers. Special attention is given to a comparative analysis of the cities' climate change adaptation strategies. The role of civil society institutions and business community in the adaptation strategy planning process is explored. Moreover, conflict-sensitive approaches to ensure participatory processes for designing and implementing adaptation measures are discussed. The field component of research is based on the cities of Apatity, Arkhangelsk, Murmansk, Norilsk, Salekhard, and Severodvinsk and the towns of Monchegorsk, Nickel, and Vorkuta. The study concludes that, despite significant challenges identified, the total balance sheet'' of the Arctic cities' efforts to enhance their adaptive capacities is very positive: Russian northern urban settlements do their best in addressing existing challenges via planning for sustainability approach. However, there is more to do, and municipalities should learn from one another's experiences, as the different approaches can be helpful in developing adequate climate change adaptation strategies at the local level.","[Bobylev, Nikolai; Konyshev, Valery; Lagutina, Maria; Sergunin, Alexander] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Gadal, Sebastien] Aix Marseille Univ, Univ Cote dAzur, Avignon Univ, CNRS,ESPACE,UMR 730, Marseille, France; [Gadal, Sebastien] North Eastern Fed Univ, Dept Ecol & Geog, Inst Nat Sci, Yakutsk, Russia; [Sergunin, Alexander] Nizhnii Novgorod State Univ, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University; Avignon Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite Cote d'Azur; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Sergunin, A (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.;Sergunin, A (corresponding author), Nizhnii Novgorod State Univ, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia.",a.sergunin@spbu.ru,"GADAL, Sébastien/L-2835-2016","GADAL, Sébastien/0000-0002-6472-9955",Russian Foundation for BasicResearch (RFBR); Foundation ''Maison des Sciences de L'homme'' (France) [20-514-22001]; RFBR and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Germany) [21-514-12001]; U.S. National Science Foundation PIRE project [1545913]; Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies/Kone FoundationResearch Fellowship; EUErasmus1 Jean Monnet project [GRASS 587697-EPP-1-2017-1-RU-EPPJMO-PROJECT]; EU Erasmus1 Jean Monnet project [TERRA 611949-EPP-1-2019-1-RU-EPPJMO-PROJECT],Russian Foundation for BasicResearch (RFBR)(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Foundation ''Maison des Sciences de L'homme'' (France); RFBR and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Germany); U.S. National Science Foundation PIRE project; Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies/Kone FoundationResearch Fellowship; EUErasmus1 Jean Monnet project; EU Erasmus1 Jean Monnet project,This paper is based on the study done in the framework of several research projects: 1) Russian Foundation for BasicResearch (RFBR) and Foundation ``Maison des Sciences de L'homme'' (France) project 20-514-22001; 2) RFBR and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Germany) joint project 21-514-12001; 3) U.S. National Science Foundation PIRE project 1545913; 4) the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies/Kone FoundationResearch Fellowship; 5) EUErasmus1 Jean Monnet project GRASS 587697-EPP-1-2017-1-RU-EPPJMO-PROJECT; and 6) EU Erasmus1 Jean Monnet project TERRA 611949-EPP-1-2019-1-RU-EPPJMO-PROJECT.,,46,0,0,2,3,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",1948-8327,1948-8335,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

The following study develops a systemic analytical framework based on which climate risks for manufacturing industries are reviewed and drivers (defined as supportive factors) of entrepreneurial robustness are examined. The analysis builds upon a case study in the alpine Austrian state of Tyrol where an intense regional rise of average temperatures occurs, going along with increased risks of natural mountain hazards and exposed settlement structures. In this climate-sensitive setting the authors conducted a survey on risk perceptions among 102 managers from manufacturing firms. Based on a comparison of the sectors metal and engineering, timber products, and construction, the authors argue that drivers of entrepreneurial robustness can be subsumed under five major strategic principles: (a) the deployment of slack resources, (b) vertical supply chain integration, (c) manufacturing flexibility, (d) material efficiency, and (e) technological risk prevention. Departing from the empirical results, the authors argue that across these principles the development of drivers depends on an interplay of structural prerequisites and human decisions on the levels of the focal firm, the supply chain network, and the political, economic, and geographic environment. In this sense, the authors conceptualize different forms of contingencies - thus effects influencing the development of drivers - within an ontology which may support further system oriented analysis of climate change adaptation in industry.

The research aims to identify, describe and evaluate factors present in sustainable development projects for small rural communities (Type- A Demonstration Projects - PDA and Alternatives to Deforestation and Burnt Projects - PADEQ), already implemented, for recognizing its potential use as strategies for adaptation to climate change for small rural communities in the Amazon region. The researches, concerning fifteen projects in Rondonia, Para and Mato Grosso States, were developed through document analysis, technical visits, and interviews with stakeholders of three projects about the community perception, vulnerability and adaptation capacity. The analysis of documents regarding the potential success of the projects highlights their short history, important in the local context, prospects for continuity, and community participation in decision making. Few activities developed in projects could be associated with climate change adaptation practices. Two strategies and practices are the most important: the social organization and the process of awareness and training of the community, and the diversification of the types and forms of agricultural production. The interviews indicate that adaptation is implemented in projects, but without considering the pressures of climate variability and change. While these projects were not planned in the context of climate change, the greatest role of the projects relates to the strengthening of the already existing adaptation capacity, creating good conditions for incorporation of new strategies and adaptation measures, now clearly associated to the objective to reduce the vulnerability to climate change and variability impacts.","Fed Univ Para, Ctr Environm Sci NUMA, BR-66075900 Belem, Para, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Para,"Szlafsztein, CF (corresponding author), Fed Univ Para, Ctr Environm Sci NUMA, Augusto Correa 1,Cidade Univ Prof Silveira Netto, BR-66075900 Belem, Para, Brazil.",iosele@ufpa.br,"szlafsztein, claudio/F-4767-2019; Szlafsztein, Claudio/G-2153-2011","szlafsztein, claudio/0000-0002-2855-2056; ",project Licoes para a Adaptacao de Comunidades aos impactos das Mudancas Climaticas na Amazonia: Uma Avaliacao das Experiencias do Programa PDA - PADEQ of the GIZ (German International Cooperation),project Licoes para a Adaptacao de Comunidades aos impactos das Mudancas Climaticas na Amazonia: Uma Avaliacao das Experiencias do Programa PDA - PADEQ of the GIZ (German International Cooperation),This research was supported by the project Licoes para a Adaptacao de Comunidades aos impactos das Mudancas Climaticas na Amazonia: Uma Avaliacao das Experiencias do Programa PDA - PADEQ of the GIZ (German International Cooperation).

An important first step to increasing capacity is via an understanding of the level of existing capacity; future priorities can then be subsequently identified. This study aimed to assess the capacity of organizations to implement climate change activities in Cambodia in order to provide such a basis for building capacity. Four elements of capacity were investigated in this research: (1) financial resources, (2) cooperation and coordination of stakeholders, (3) availability and quality of information on vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, and (4) the level of understanding of climate change vulnerability and adaptation. The data were collected through semistructured interviews with a wide range of government and non-government informants across a number of sectors. Results of the study showed that informants perceived capacity for CCA to be very constrained, especially in terms of financial resources and cooperation, and addressing these factors was ranked as the highest climate change capacity priority. Institutional capacity constraints were considered to relate more generally to weak governance of CCA. In light of our research findings, the absence of local higher education institutions in CCA activities should be addressed. The support of such institutions would provide an important mechanism to progress both capacity development as well as partnerships and coordination between different types of organizations and relevant sectors. Policy relevance Capacity for CCA within Cambodian health and water sectors was perceived to be very constrained across a range of interdependent factors. Increasing funding was ranked as the highest priority for building capacity for CCA; however, governance factors such as 'improved cooperation' were also ranked highly. Improving stakeholders' awareness of the availability of adaptation funds and resources, and their responsiveness to funding criteria, is an important implication of our research, as is improving the mobilization of local resources and the private sector. To address the issue of weak cooperation among stakeholders, improving the coordination function of the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC) regarding stakeholder engagement and capacity building is crucial. Ensuring that CCA activities are based on sound information and knowledge from across different disciplines and, importantly, include the perspectives of vulnerable people themselves, ultimately underpins and supports the realization of the above priorities.","[Dany, Va] Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Dept Environm, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Dany, Va] Bond Univ, Inst Sustainable Dev & Architecture, Southport, Qld 4229, Australia; [Bowen, Kathryn J.] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Bowen, Kathryn J.; Miller, Fiona] Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Miller, Fiona] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Bond University; Australian National University; University of Melbourne; Macquarie University,"Dany, V (corresponding author), Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Dept Environm, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.",dva@bond.edu.au,,"Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4427-6466; Bowen, Kathryn/0000-0002-2125-1963",,,,,53,14,14,0,41,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Although climate adaptation takes place when cities replace critical infrastructure damaged by severe weather events, little is known about the influence of political affiliation and severe weather events on climate adaptation in a broader sense. Using multiple linear regression models, this study analyzes variations in local government climate adaptation efforts as a function of local gross domestic product (as a control variable), historical weather-related factors [i.e., number of extreme weather events, weather-related economic impact due to property damage, and weather-related human impact (injuries and fatalities)], and state and local political affiliation. The findings of this study indicate that local political affiliation significantly influences local government climate adaptation efforts; however, state political affiliation does not. Further, local weather-related impacts do not appear to affect the likelihood of local government to engage in climate adaptation efforts, even when accounting for potential interactions with local political affiliation. These results support the hypothesis that local political affiliation is a strong and robust predictor of local climate adaptation in U.S. cities. This study contributes to literature aimed at addressing the widely acknowledged need for understanding key barriers to U.S. climate adaptation, as well as the role of politics in moderating climate action.","[Gurney, Rachel M.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Meng, Sisi; Rumschlag, Samantha; Hamlet, Alan F.] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Notre Dame,"Gurney, RM (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",rgurney@wisc.edu,,,Kresge Foundation [G-1609-262913]; University of Notre Dame's Environmental Change Initiative (ND-ECI),Kresge Foundation; University of Notre Dame's Environmental Change Initiative (ND-ECI),"The authors gratefully acknowledge Ragan Sernel, a University of Notre Dame undergraduate researcher, for his assistance with data collection and processing and Professor Sara Hughes, from the University of Michigan, for providing literature that contributed to the background and theoretical framework of this study.

Despite the negligence of climate policy at the federal level in the United States, subnational governments have taken action to adapt to climate change impacts. Using national-level data on subnational government climate activities, this research examines three aspects of coastal community adaptation actions. First, it examines whether there are differences in climate adaptation activity between coastal and non-coastal communities. It then tests the relative importance of political partisanship, population, perception of climate risk, and awareness of state-level climate planning effort. Lastly, it examines the impact of participation within climate policy networks on the likelihood of a subnational government taking a climate adaptation action. Three types of network partners are examined: those focused on sea-level rise and coastal communities, climate change mitigation, and general environmental organizations. Concern about severe storms, awareness of state plans, and having a network partner focused either on climate mitigation or the environment were found to be statistically significant indicators of climate adaptation action. The paper discusses the importance of understanding the localized context of adaptation within nested governance structures, and how informal policy networks can facilitate learning and innovation across coastal communities.","[Kauneckis, Derek; Martin, Rachel] Ohio Univ, Voinovich Sch Leadership & Publ Affairs, Athens, OH 45701 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Kauneckis, D (corresponding author), Ohio Univ, Voinovich Sch Leadership & Publ Affairs, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",kaunecki@ohio.edu,"Kauneckis, Derek L/C-1650-2010","Kauneckis, Derek L/0000-0002-2588-6325","National Science Foundation; Nevada Infrastructure for Climate Change Science, Education Outreach Grant [EPS-0814372]; George Voinovich School of Leadership and Environmental Affairs, Ohio University","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Nevada Infrastructure for Climate Change Science, Education Outreach Grant; George Voinovich School of Leadership and Environmental Affairs, Ohio University","Support was received from the National Science Foundation, Nevada Infrastructure for Climate Change Science, Education, and Outreach Grant #EPS-0814372 and from The George Voinovich School of Leadership and Environmental Affairs, Ohio University.",,59,4,4,5,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0892-0753,1521-0421,,COAST MANAGE,Coast.

This study examines whether the effect of climate change on economic growth and political stability (measure for productivity growth) depends on the level of climate adaptation readiness, using data from 44 African countries. We conducted several robustness checks to identify the relationship of interest. The result confirms that increases in temperature exert significant negative effect on economic growth and productivity growth, but these effects critically depend on the level of adaptation readiness. For countries with enhanced adaptation capacity, we find that it is possible for them to see a resurgence in their economic growth after a rise in temperature. However, for countries with low capacity to adapt, climate change might produce permanent damages on economic growth and productivity growth. Thus, in Africa, beyond the level of income, the quality of institution is another channel through which climate change could affect economic growth. Integrating climate adaptation into development agenda is critical, but they should be pro-poor in nature.","[Adom, Philip Kofi; Amoani, Solomon] Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm GIMPA, Sch Publ Serv & Governance SPSG, Dept Dev Policy, Accra, Ghana",,"Adom, PK (corresponding author), Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm GIMPA, Sch Publ Serv & Governance SPSG, Dept Dev Policy, Accra, Ghana.",adomonline@yahoo.co.uk; msaviour24@yahoo.com,,,"Sustainable Energy Transition Initiative (SETI); Duke University; Environment and Natural Resource Research Initiative (ERRIEFD); University of Ghana, Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration; University of Gothenburg","Sustainable Energy Transition Initiative (SETI); Duke University; Environment and Natural Resource Research Initiative (ERRIEFD); University of Ghana, Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration; University of Gothenburg","The authors wish to thank Sustainable Energy Transition Initiative (SETI) , Duke University, Environment and Natural Resource Research Initiative (ERRIEFD) , University of Ghana, Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration, and University of Gothenburg for their support.",,55,11,11,14,27,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

The baseline scenario depicts a setting where total fish production in 2035 is about 5.5 million tons or about two times its levels in 2012. As a result, per capita consumption of fish will be about 37 kg/person in 2035 or about 20% higher than in 2012. Fish exports and imports in 2035 are also expected to be more than two times as much as in 2012.

Many countries attempt to promote renewable energy to reduce the impact of climate change, but the impacts of national energy policy in the climate vulnerability framework remain little understood. Here, we exploit variations in renewable energy uses to test the effectiveness of climate adaptation policy across the dimensions of climate impact and vulnerability. Using the Fuzzy AnalyticHierarchy Process and panel data regression, we analyze the spatiotemporal correlation between renewable energy transition and climate vulnerability across the world. We find that while renewable energy increases proportionally with climate exposure and sensitivity, many countries exhibit discrepancies between the variation in renewable energy transition and climate vulnerability. The promotion of renewable energy funnels into nations with a higher level of adaptive capacity while bypassing more vulnerable countries. The results signify that existing renewable energy policies can exacerbate climate inequality and undermine the benefits of the transition to renewable energy by neglecting the spatial heterogeneity in climate vulnerability. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the ways in which renewable energy policy can generate spatial inequalities in climate adaptation.","[Kim, Seung Kyum] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Moon Soul Grad Sch Future Strategy, Bldg N5,291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34141, South Korea; [Park, Soonae] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Adm, 302,Bldg 57-1,1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Seoul National University (SNU),"Park, S (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Adm, 302,Bldg 57-1,1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",skim1@kaist.ac.kr; psoonae@snu.ac.kr,,"Kim, Seung Kyum/0000-0002-6932-5829",Public Performance Management Research Center at Seoul National University [067820220006],Public Performance Management Research Center at Seoul National University,This study was conducted as part of the 2022 basic project (067820220006) of the Public Performance Management Research Center at Seoul National University.,,86,1,1,76,76,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

This paper offers a systematic, comparative analysis of three empirical studies which analysed how and why responsibilities were divided between public and private actors for the governance of local urban climate adaptation. For 20 governance arrangements in European and North-American cities, the divisions of responsibilities and the underlying rationales of actors for those divisions were analysed and compared. Data were gathered through content analysis of over 100 policy documents, 97 in-depth interviews and 2 multi-stakeholder workshops. The comparative analysis reveals that local public authorities are the key actors, as they bear the majority of responsibilities for climate proofing their cities. In this stage of policy emergence, local authorities are clearly in the driving seat. It is envisaged that local public authorities need to more actively engage the different private actors such as citizens, civil society and businesses through governance networks along with the maturation of the policy field and the expected acceleration of climate impacts in the coming decades.","[Mees, Heleen] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Mees, H (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",h.l.p.mees@uu.nl,"Mees, Heleen/L-5394-2013","Mees, Heleen/0000-0002-4401-6106",Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment,Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment,"This research was part of the Dutch Knowledge for Climate Research Programme, funded by the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment.",,81,67,67,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-908X,1522-7200,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

A major question is whether adaptation in developing countries should be financed under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), or whether funding should come from other sources. We present an overview of financial resources and propose the employment of a two-track approach: one track that attempts to secure climate change adaptation funding under the UNFCCC; and a second track that improves mainstreaming of climate risk management in development efforts. Developed countries would need to demonstrate much greater commitment to the funding of adaptation measures if the UNFCCC were to cover a substantial part of the costs. The mainstreaming of climate change adaptation could follow a risk management path, particularly in relation to disaster risk reduction.

However, such analyses involve many challenges, particularly because the actors concerned may not consider climate change to be an urgent concern. This paper examines the methodological choices made by three research teams in the design and implementation of participatory foresight analyses to explore agricultural and water management options for adaptation to climate change. Case studies were conducted in coastal areas of France, Morocco, and Portugal where the groundwater is intensively used for irrigation, the aquifers are at risk or are currently overexploited, and a serious agricultural crisis is underway. When designing the participatory processes, the researchers had to address four main issues: whether to avoid or prepare dialogue between actors whose relations may be limited or tense; how to select participants and get them involved; how to facilitate discussion of issues that the actors may not initially consider to be of great concern; and finally, how to design and use scenarios. In each case, most of the invited actors responded and met to discuss and evaluate a series of scenarios. Strategies were discussed at different levels, from farming practices to aquifer management. It was shown that such participatory analyses can be implemented in situations which may initially appear to be unfavourable. This was made possible by the flexibility in the methodological choices, in particular the possibility of framing the climate change issue in a broader agenda for discussion with the actors.","[Faysse, N.; Kuper, M.] Cirad, G Eau Res Unit, Montpellier, France; [Faysse, N.; Errahj, M.] Natl Coll Agr Meknes, Meknes, Morocco; [Rinaudo, J. -D.; Maton, L.] BRGM French Geol Survey, Water Dept, Montpellier, France; [Bento, S.] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Sch Econ & Management, SOCIUS, Lisbon, Portugal; [Richard-Ferroudji, A.; Rollin, D.; Garin, P.; Montginoul, M.] IRSTEA, G Eau Res Unit, Montpellier, France; [Varanda, M.] Univ Lisbon, ICS Social Sci Inst, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Imache, A.; Dionnet, M.] LISODE, Montpellier, France; [Kuper, M.] Hassan II Inst Agron & Vet Med, Rabat, Morocco",CIRAD; Moulay Ismail University of Meknes; Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); Universidade de Lisboa; INRAE; Universidade de Lisboa,"Faysse, N (corresponding author), Cirad, G Eau Res Unit, Montpellier, France.",faysse@cirad.fr,"Rinaudo, Jean-Daniel/AAI-1193-2021; Errahj, Mostafa/F-7829-2014; Bento, Sofia/N-7374-2019; GARIN, Patrice/AAA-9527-2021; Kuper, Marcel/ABE-1897-2020; Bento, Sofia/B-6454-2018; Varanda, Marta/N-6503-2013","Errahj, Mostafa/0000-0002-1891-2791; Bento, Sofia/0000-0002-2267-7376; Kuper, Marcel/0000-0002-1240-0592; Bento, Sofia/0000-0002-2267-7376; RINAUDO, Jean-Daniel/0000-0001-8539-574X; Varanda, Marta/0000-0002-9762-2724; GARIN, PATRICE/0000-0002-0392-508X","French Ministry of Ecology, Energy and Sustainable Development; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology; French National Research Agency","French Ministry of Ecology, Energy and Sustainable Development; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); French National Research Agency(French National Research Agency (ANR))","The study was part of the Aquimed project, which took place in the framework of the Eranet Circle-Med initiative (http://www.circle-med.net/).

Tackling climate change in these areas is a critical issue. Energy stability and equal energy distribution are crucial for improving the ability of households to adapt to climate change. However, there has been little research on factors influencing energy stability and inequality at the micro level in economically and ecologically vulnerable areas. Taking the Pan-Third Pole regions as an example, this study used a cross-national household dataset for 2018, which included information from 1060 households in 37 sample villages distributed in 5 countries, to assess the status of energy stability, inequality, and climate change vulnerability. The results showed that cooking energy use has shifted toward a more stable energy-dependent pattern, although there is still room for improvement. Education level of the household head, non-agricultural level, and income were the significant factors influencing stable energy use and focal points for increasing stable energy use. The inequality level was more severe in economically less-developed regions, and providing commercialized energy access to households is effective in reducing energy inequality. Increasing the education level, extracting labor from agriculture activities, increasing household income, and providing essential energy infrastructures could effectively improve stable energy use and reduce energy inequality, leading to climate change adaptation. The study extends its significance in exploring cross-country climate change adaptation measures from an energy perspective, providing insights for climate change-related research and practice in other vulnerable regions.","[Sun, Mingxing; Xu, Xiangbo; Li, Chang; Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Sun, Mingxing; Xu, Xiangbo; Li, Chang; Zhang, Linxiu] United Nations Environm Programme, Int Ecosyst Management Partnership, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Le] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Li, Chang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Renmin University of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Xu, XB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",ydxu.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022","Li, Chang/0000-0002-0775-3115","National Natural Science Foundation of China [52000170, 41901255]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20010303]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This study is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (52000170, 41901255) and Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20010303).",,60,8,8,11,32,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

We document evidence of over 300 examples of early adopters of adaptation practice to climate change in the UK. These examples span a range of activities from small adjustments (or coping), to building adaptive capacity, to implementing actions and to creating deeper systemic change in public and private organisations in a range of sectors. We find that adaptation in the UK has been dominated by government initiatives and has principally occurred in the form of research into climate change impacts. These government initiatives have stimulated a further set of actions at other scales in public agencies, regulatory agencies and regional government (and the devolved administrations), though with little real evidence of climate change adaptation initiatives trickling down to local government level. The sectors requiring significant investment in large scale infrastructure have invested more heavily than those that do not in identifying potential impacts and adaptations. Thus we find a higher level of adaptation activity by the water supply and flood defence sectors. Sectors that are not dependent on large scale infrastructure appear to be investing far less effort and resources in preparing for climate change. We conclude that the UK government-driven top-down targeted adaptation approach has generated anticipatory action at low cost in some areas. We also conclude that these actions may have created enough niche activities to allow for diffusion of new adaptation practices in response to real or perceived climate change. These results have significant implications for how climate policy can be developed to support autonomous adaptors in the UK and other countries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Crop breeders across the globe have continuously been working on development of crop cultivars to adapt to climate change, the detailed information is necessary on when and where the adaptability of current cultivars will be broken and what cultivar traits will be required. Here, we developed a novel hybrid crop modelling approach that coupled a process-based crop model with machine learning and systematically assessed the impacts of climate change on rice productivity for 36 representative cultivars in China. We identified when, where, and what cultivars would be required for rice production to adapt to climate change precisely across China. We showed substantial differences in climate change impacts amongst cultivars. Current cultivars replacement could only alleviate but not offset the potential yield loss due to climate change in the future. Without adaptations and CO2 effect, nearly 67% of single rice and 46% of double rice cultivation areas would require cultivar renewal before 2050. Only two decades of leading time remain in the mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The cultivars with a medium growth cycle, long grain-filling period, high photosynthetic capacity, and less spikelets should be breeding targets to adapt to climate change, although the ideotypic traits could be different for a specific environment and rice type.","[Zhang, Liangliang; Zhang, Zhao; Luo, Yuchuan; Zhang, Jing; Cao, Juan] Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management Minsi, Sch Natl Safety & Emergency Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tao, Fulu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tao, Fulu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tao, Fulu] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Helsinki, Finland","Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)","Zhang, Z (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management Minsi, Sch Natl Safety & Emergency Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",sunny_zhang@bnu.edu.cn,"Luo, Yuchuan/GSN-5985-2022","Tao, F/0000-0001-8574-0080","National Science Foundation of China [42061144003, 31761143006, 41977405]; National Key Research & Development Programme of China [2020YFA0608201]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research & Development Programme of China,"Acknowledgments This study was funded by the National Science Foundation of China (No. 42061144003, 31761143006, 41977405) , and the National Key Research & Development Programme of China (No. 2020YFA0608201) .",,65,6,6,31,39,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1923,1873-2240,,AGR FOREST METEOROL,Agric.

We assessed the role of public health and social justice in European climate change adaptation using a three-fold approach: a document analysis, a critical discourse analysis of a subgroup of strategies, and a ranking of strategies against our social justice framework. The ranking approach favored planning that includes various adaptation types, social issues and infrastructure changes. Themes on values identified in the five subgroup documents showed that risks are perceived as contradictory, technology is viewed as savior, responsibilities need to be negotiated, and social justice is advocated by only a few countries. Of 21 strategy documents assessed overall, those from Austria, England and Sweden received the highest scores in the ranking. Our qualitative assessment showed that in European adaptation planning, progress could still be made through community involvement into adaptation decisions, consistent consideration of social and demographic determinants, and a stronger link between infrastructural adaptation and the health sector.

Experts have identified clear climate change adaptation principles that MPA practitioners can incorporate into MPA management; however, adoption of these principles in MPA management remains largely unquantified. We conducted a text analysis of 647 English-language MPA management plans to assess the frequency with which they included climate change-related terms and terms pertaining to ecological, physical, and sociological components of an MPA system that may be impacted by climate change. Next, we manually searched 223 management plans to quantify the plans' climate change robustness, which we defined as the degree of incorporation of common climate change adaptation principles. We found that climate change is inadequately considered in MPA management plans. Of all plans published since 2010, only 57% contained at least one of the climate change-related terms, climate change, global warming, extreme events, natural variability, or climate variability. The mean climate change robustness index of climate-considering management plans was 10.9 or 39% of a total possible score of 28. The United States was the only region that had plans with climate robustness indices of 20 or greater. By contrast, Canada lags behind other temperate jurisdictions in incorporating climate change adaptation analysis, planning, and monitoring into MPA management, with a mean climate change robustness index of 6.8. Climate change robustness scores have generally improved over time within the most common MPA designations in Oceania, the United Kingdom, and the United States, though the opposite is true in Canada.

This empirical study contributes to the body of the literature on collective action and adaptive capacity by demonstrating how organizations frame responses to climate variability and change in rural Kenya by promoting local rural institutions. By analyzing interviews, role-playing games, and household surveys, we ask how local rural organizations shape coping strategies to climate variability and how they may structure future adaptations to climate change. We also investigate what types of households participate in those organizations and how their participation may impact their vulnerability to climate change and variability. Our analysis shows that in places rendered especially vulnerable to climate change by arid climatic conditions, the disengagement of governmental services, and a limited access to income-generating activities, local rural organizations increase livelihood security. Those organizations reduce local vulnerabilities and enhance collective action. In contrast to common diversification and livelihood security strategies which rely on the access to urban or peri-urban structures, local rural institutions and organizations allow for rural and grassroots sustainable adaptation strategies. In that respect, they constitute a resilient and mostly untapped resource for visibly strengthening livelihood security and adaptive capacities in rural Kenya.","[Washington-Ottombre, Camille] Oberlin Coll, Environm Studies Program, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA; [Pijanowski, Bryan C.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA",Oberlin College; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Washington-Ottombre, C (corresponding author), Oberlin Coll, Environm Studies Program, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA.",cwashing@oberlin.edu,"Washington-Ottombre, Camille/GXG-0564-2022",,,,,,44,11,11,1,52,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Sorghum has proven to be an adaptable and resilient crop despite limited funding for crop development. Recent breeding efforts target hybrid and perennial technologies that may facilitate adaptation to climate change. Advantages of perennial crops over their annual counterparts include improved soil quality and water conservation and reduced inputs and labor requirements. In contrast, hybrid crops are often bred for improved grain yield and earlier maturation to avoid variable conditions. We use discrete choice experiments to model adoption of sorghum as a function of attributes that differ between these technologies and traditional varieties in Mali. Overall, the main perceived advantage of perennial crops is agricultural ecosystem services such as soil improvement, while adoption of hybrid crops is hampered by the inability to reuse seed. Women farmers are less concerned about higher labor requirements associated with perennial crops and the ability to reuse hybrids seeds than male farmers. Farmers prefer traditional sorghum to perennial sorghum and are indifferent between traditional and hybrid sorghum. These findings have important policy implications for understanding tradeoffs that are central to farmer decision making when it comes to breeding technologies for climate adaptation.","[Waldman, Kurt B.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, 513 N Pk Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Richardson, Robert B.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, 480 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Michigan State University,"Waldman, KB (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, 513 N Pk Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.",kbwaldma@iu.edu; rbr@msu.edu,,"Richardson, Robert/0000-0001-7113-3896",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1076311],Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),This work was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under Grant OPP1076311.,,45,13,14,7,50,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

In the Saebat Maeul community, the study area, people have struggled with urban flooding, which is related to the poor sewer system and heat waves. Green infrastructures were used as the main tools to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. The suggested community plan includes physical and socioeconomic measures, such as new parking structures with green roofs and pervious pavement, drainage facilities that reduce flooding, repairs to homes with cool roofs, and installation of rainwater harvesting facilities to lower the impact of heat waves. If planners have proper knowledge about climate change and if they guide the participatory planning process (thus reflecting local knowledge and suggestions), we concluded that it is possible to consider climate change adaptations within the context of spatial and community planning.","[Kim, Donghyun] Korea Environm Inst, Sejong, South Korea; [Kang, Jung Eun] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Urban Engn, Urban Planning, Busan, South Korea",Korea Environment Institute (KEI); Pusan National University,"Kang, JE (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Urban Engn, Busan 46241, South Korea.",jekang@pusan.ac.kr,"Kim, Donghyun/HDO-8306-2022","Kim, Donghyun/0000-0003-3711-5103",basic research of Korea Environment Institute [2014-06],basic research of Korea Environment Institute,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was performed by the basic research of Korea Environment Institute (2014-06).",,70,10,10,3,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2399-8083,2399-8091,,ENVIRON PLAN B-URBAN,Env.

In response, we are having to learn to live with a renewed notion of limits and a novel level of uncertainty. One emerging governance response is a turn to scenario planning, which generates narratives about multiple futures refracted out from the present. Like climate change itself, scenario planning, and the broader field of futures studies it is part of, is historically and socially positioned, belying its application as a mere method or tool. This paper discusses the growing turn to scenario planning within government climate change adaptation initiatives in light of parallel shifts in governance (eg, interest in efficiency and wicked problems) and adaptation efforts (eg, framed as risk management or resilience) and their shared roots in the ambiguities of sustainable development. It provides an extended introduction to a theme issue that provides, overall, a nested discussion of the role of scenario planning by government for climate change adaptation, noting how governance, climate change adaptation, and scenario planning all fold together the motifs of openness and closedness. This paper engages with the emerging field of future geographies and critical interest in future orientations to highlight the way society's growing engagement on climate change adaptation exposes, critiques, replicates, and amplifies our existing orientations to the future and time and their politically contested and embedded character. It points to the way the motif of open futures can be both progressive and conservative, as political and economic interests seek to open up some futures while closing down others in the name of the ambivalent goals of adaptation and sustainable development.","[Rickards, Lauren; Wiseman, John] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Soc Inst, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Ison, Ray] Open Univ, Dept Commun & Syst, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Fuenfgeld, Hartmut] RMIT Univ, Global Cities Res Inst, Climate Change Adaptat Program, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",University of Melbourne; Open University - UK; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Rickards, L (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Soc Inst, Ground Floor,Alice Hoy Bldg Blg 162,Monash Rd, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",lauren.rickards@unimelb.edu.au; r.l.ison@open.ac.uk; harmut.fuenfgeld@rmit.edu.au; jwiseman@unimelb.edu.au,"Fünfgeld, Hartmut/X-8504-2019; Fünfgeld, Hartmut/C-5962-2011","Fünfgeld, Hartmut/0000-0003-0359-8207; Fünfgeld, Hartmut/0000-0003-0359-8207; Rickards, Lauren/0000-0001-6088-3448; Wiseman, John/0000-0003-2276-5517",,,,,87,49,49,1,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-774X,1472-3425,,ENVIRON PLANN C,Environ.

These risks arc exacerbated by factors such as increasing urban population and climate change. Urbanism and climate change are closely interlinked. Meanwhile, the concept of urban resilience has been introduced, in recent years, to reduce these negative impacts. Resilience is the ability of a system to absorb abnormalities while its basic structure is maintained when at risk. Resilience to climate change focuses on reducing vulnerabilities to these changes. The current research focuses on urban ecological resilience and its subsection of 'climate resilience' and also climate change adaptation strategies. Urban green infrastructure is also effective in reducing the impacts of climate change and enhancing climate resilience in cities. In the face of dangers such as climate change, the resilience approach can be used as a framework for intervention in existing and suggested urban green infrastructures and vice versa. This research attempts to answer this question: How can intervention in urban green infrastructure (their quality and quantity, maintaining, enhancing and location) lead to developing strategic principles to ensure an urban climate resilient city in times of drought, extreme heat, low annual precipitation and water shortages? The purpose of this research is to develop strategic principles for adaptation to climate change using green infrastructure and their capabilities to enhance urban climate resilience in dry countries. A qualitative method was used here by using aerial photos and producing GIS base and analytical maps of Yousef Abad neighbourhood in Tehran, the capital city of Iran, which lead to producing the above mentioned principles.","[Shirgir, E.; Kheyroddin, R.; Behzadfar, M.] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Environm Design, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Kheyroddin, R (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Environm Design, Tehran, Iran.",reza_kheyroddin@iust.ac.ir,"behzadfar, mostafa/S-6055-2018; kheyroddin, reza/S-6260-2018","Behzadfar, Mostafa/0000-0003-2882-694X",,,,,25,3,3,6,34,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2395-7611,2395-7697,,J CLIM CHANG,J.

It is, therefore, essential to understanding the various strategies used by farmers to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change and the factors that influence maize farmers' adoption and intensity of climate change adaptation strategies among smallholder maize farmers in South-west Nigeria. In all, a sample of three hundred and thirty (311) smallholder maize farmers were interviewed. A double-hurdle count data model was employed to estimate the factors influencing farmers' adoption of adaptation strategies while accounting for selection bias with the plugging of inverse mill ratio (IMR) as a regressor. Significant variables such as household size, depreciation ratio, frequency of extension visits, access to extension, and non-farm income were factors influencing the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among maize farmers. Age of the respondent, age square, household size, farm-based organization (FBO), nonfarm income, climate information, access to credit, farmers residing in Osun State (location_Osun), distance to market significantly influenced the intensity of climate change adaptation strategies. This study, therefore, concluded that farm-level policy efforts that aim to improve rural development should focus on farmers' membership in FBO, increase the visits of extension agents, encourage non-farm income and access to climate change information, particularly during the off-cropping season. Policies and investment strategies of the government should be geared towards supporting improved extension service, providing on-farm demonstration training, and disseminating information about climate change adaptation strategies, particularly for smallholder farmers in Nigeria.","[Adeagbo, O.

Climate change adaptation interventions can be better targeted by being linked with type of climatic risks experienced by women farmers, their social profile and their needs based on the role they play in agriculture. This study presents a methodology to identify hotspots where climate change adaptation and gender based interventions could be prioritized. The methodology is illustrated for India. The results suggest 36 hotspots across 10 states in India, where large number of women farmers are impacted by high levels of drought probability, excess rainfall and heat wave. The target population in these hotspots comprise 14.4% of the total women farmers in the country. A socioeconomic characterization of the hotspot population highlights barriers, such as labor, credit and market access for female cultivators and lower wage rates for female laborers in these hotspots. Based on the constraints as well as the climatic risks faced by these women in the hotspots, the potential of climate-smart agriculture technologies and practices are emphasized. Additionally, a comparison of current research being done in the field with the results of the study highlights the potential to learn from current efforts for efficient scalability of gender and climate change adaptation interventions.","[Chanana-Nag, Nitya; Aggarwal, Pramod K.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Borlaug Inst South Asia, CIMMYT, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, New Delhi 110012, India",CGIAR,"Chanana-Nag, N (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Borlaug Inst South Asia, CIMMYT, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, New Delhi 110012, India.",n.chanana@cgiar.org,,,CGIAR Fund Donors,CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR),"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

To account for selectivity bias, the study used endogenous treatment effect for count data model (precisely Poisson) augmented with the inverse probability-weighted-regression-adjustment (IPWRA) estimator. Both estimators found that rural non-farm jobs increase smallholder farmers' adaptive capacities and that participants would have used less adaptation techniques if they had not participated in non-farm work.

Using the success factors as evaluation criteria, we analysed the 278 formats. The analysis yields 13 good practise examples that can inspire future adaptation communication. Following our discussion which of the success factors have not yet been sufficiently addressed we propose going beyond the content level and address emotions, norms and values as well as making use of trusted messengers.","[Wirth, Veronika] Dept Hlth & Environm, Munich, Germany; [Wirth, Veronika; Prutsch, Andrea] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna BOKU, Vienna, Austria; [Wirth, Veronika; Prutsch, Andrea] Environm Agcy Austria, Dept Environm Impact Assessment & Climate Change, Vienna, Austria; [Prutsch, Andrea] BOKU, San Francisco, CA USA; [Grothmann, Torsten] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Grothmann, Torsten] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ecol Econ Inst, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg","Wirth, V (corresponding author), Dept Hlth & Environm, Munich, Germany.",,,,Austrian Climate and Energy Funds within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),Austrian Climate and Energy Funds within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),"This study was part of the project CcTalk!, which received funding from the Austrian Climate and Energy Funds within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP).",,49,24,24,3,26,OEKOM VERLAG,MUNICH,"WALTHERSTR 29, MUNICH, 80337, GERMANY",0940-5550,,,GAIA,GAIA,,2014,23,1,,,,,30,39,,10.14512/gaia.23.1.9,http://dx.doi.org/10.14512/gaia.23.1.9,,,10,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AE0MH,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000333659900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results indicate that the adaptation produced through the planning system remains incremental rather than transformative. It is focused on experienced hazards, especially flooding, and there is a lack of attention being paid to wider impacts of climate change, such as rising average temperatures. Furthermore, it was found that the contemporary contribution of planning to climate change adaptation is seriously limited by the government's emphasis on housing and economic growth and by the development industry's emphasis on economic viability.","[Young, Daniel] Portsmouth City Council, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Essex, Stephen] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Essex, S (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England.",stephen.essex@plymouth.ac.uk,,"ESSEX, Stephen/0000-0002-7728-4043",,,,,49,11,11,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Temporally, adaptation strategies and policies have to address potential impacts in both the short- and long term, whereas spatially, place-based and context-specific adaptations are essential. To help inform decision-making on climate change adaptation, this study adopted a bottom-up approach to assess local climate vulnerability and winegrowers' adaptive processes in two regulated wine-producing areas in the Anjou-Saumur wine growing sub-region, France. The data used for this study were collected through individual semi-structured interviews with 30 winegrowers. With a focus on wine quality, climate-related exposure, and sensitivity were dependent on many contextual factors (e.g., northern geographical position, wine regulatory frameworks, local environmental features) interacting with the regional oceanic climate. Climate and other non-climate-related variables brought about important changes in winegrowers' management practices, varying in time and space. This ongoing process in decision-making enhanced winegrowers' adaptive responses, which were primarily reactive (e.g., harvesting, winemaking) or anticipatory (e.g., canopy and soil management) to short-term climate conditions. Winegrowers described changing trends in climate- and grapevine (Vitis) -related variables, with the latter attributed to regional climate changes and evolving management practices. Regarding future climate trends, winegrowers' displayed great uncertainty, placing the most urgent adaptation priority on short-term strategies, while changing grapevine varieties and using irrigation were identified as last resort strategies. The study concluded by discussing the implications of these findings in the context of climate change adaptation in viticulture.","[Neethling, Etienne; Petitjean, Theo; Barbeau, Gerard] UMT Vinitera2, UE1117, INRA, URVV, 42 Rue Georges Morel, F-49071 Beaucouze, France; [Neethling, Etienne; Quenol, Herve] Univ Rennes 2, UMR LETG 6554, COSTEL CNRS, Pl Recteur Henri Le Moal, F-35043 Rennes, France",INRAE; Universite de Rennes; Universite Rennes 2,"Neethling, E (corresponding author), UMT Vinitera2, UE1117, INRA, URVV, 42 Rue Georges Morel, F-49071 Beaucouze, France.;Neethling, E (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 2, UMR LETG 6554, COSTEL CNRS, Pl Recteur Henri Le Moal, F-35043 Rennes, France.",etienne.neethling@angers.inra.fr,"Mikulka, Jan/K-1324-2012; Quénol, Hervé HQ/O-7939-2014; Bartusek, Karel/D-3389-2012","Mikulka, Jan/0000-0003-3270-1795; Quénol, Hervé HQ/0000-0002-5562-2232; Bartusek, Karel/0000-0002-6598-5424","European Union, as part of the LIFE-ADVICLIM project [LIFE13 ENV/FR/001512]; FranceAgriMer and InterLoire (Interprofessional body for Loire Valley wines)","European Union, as part of the LIFE-ADVICLIM project; FranceAgriMer and InterLoire (Interprofessional body for Loire Valley wines)","This study was carried out with the contribution of the LIFE financial instrument of the European Union, as part of the LIFE-ADVICLIM project (LIFE13 ENV/FR/001512).

The Government of Kenya is mandated to manage and disseminate climate information to enhance adaptation to climate change. However, the use of climate information on farm-level adaptation has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to: identify the climate information accessed by farmers, establish the association between using climate information and the adaptation strategies adopted, examine the factors influencing adaptation decisions, find out how climate information were used and the benefits and constraints of using the information . Data was collected from 432 households randomly selected from semi-arid areas in Machakos, Makueni and Kitui counties. The Multivariate probit model was used to analyse data. The results showed that farmers accessed short and medium-term forecasts; decadal forecasts and agrometeorological advisories. There was a significant association between using climate information and the climate change adaptation strategies adopted by the farmers. Demographic, socio-economic and institutional factors significantly influenced farmers' adaptation decisions. Farmers used the climate information for tactical, short-term farm operations. Benefits of using climate information were manifested in reduced crop loss, increased yield and farm revenue. However, farmers' use of climate information was constraint by economic and technical factors. The study recommends that the Government enforces policies that empowers farmers to access the requisite farm inputs and facilitate the provision of agrometeorological advisories to increase local-level utility of climate information. The Government should formulate and implement policies that strengthen the provision of timely, simplified and adequately actionable climate information that suit farmers' climate change adaptation needs.","[Matere, Stella; Busienei, John R.; Irungu, Patrick; Mbatia, Oliver Lee Ernest] Univ Nairobi, Coll Agr & Vet Sci, POB 29053-00625, Nairobi 905300625, Kenya; [Matere, Stella; Nandokha, Tabeel] Muguga South Ctr, Kenya Agr & Livestock Res, Food Crops Res Inst, POB 30148-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kwena, Kizito] Kenya Agr & Livestock Res Org, Katumani Res Ctr, POB 340-90100, Machakos, Kenya",University of Nairobi,"Matere, S (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Coll Agr & Vet Sci, POB 29053-00625, Nairobi 905300625, Kenya.",stellamatere@gmail.com,,,,,,,67,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0266-6669,1741-6469,,INFORM DEV,Inf.

We apply these frameworks to the road transport sector with a special emphasis on drivers' decision making before and during a trip.

This includes recognizing that climate change will affect the health and wellbeing of all populations over short and longer terms, albeit in varied ways and intensities. That recognition has drawn attention to the need to take adaptive actions to lessen adverse impacts over the next few decades from unavoidable climate change, particularly in developing country settings. A range of sectors is responsible for appropriate adaptive policies and measures to address the health risks of climate change, including health services, water and sanitation, trade, agriculture, disaster management, and development. Objectives: To broaden the framing of governance and decision-making processes by using innovative methods and assessments to illustrate the multi-sectoral nature of health-related adaptation to climate change. This is a shift from sector-specific to multi-level systems encompassing sectors and actors, across temporal and spatial scales. Design: A review and synthesis of the current knowledge in the areas of health and climate change adaptation governance and decision-making processes. Results: A novel framework is presented that incorporates social science insights into the formulation and implementation of adaptation activities and policies to lessen the health risks posed by climate change. Conclusion: Clarification of the roles that different sectors, organizations, and individuals occupy in relation to the development of health-related adaptation strategies will facilitate the inclusion of health and wellbeing within multi-sector adaptation policies, thereby strengthening the overall set of responses to minimize the adverse health effects of climate change.","[Bowen, Kathryn J.; Friel, Sharon; McMichael, Anthony J.] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Bowen, Kathryn J.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Ebi, Kristie] ClimAdapt LLC, Los Altos, CA USA",Australian National University; University of Melbourne,"Bowen, KJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",kathryn.bowen@anu.edu.au,"McLean, Laurence JA/C-7367-2014","Bowen, Kathryn/0000-0002-2125-1963; Friel, Sharon/0000-0002-8345-5435",AusAID Australian Development Research Award,AusAID Australian Development Research Award,The authors declare no conflict of interest.

This article highlights the role of a group of actors whose practices have so far received little attention in the study of climate change governance, namely the public servants who are responsible for the everyday implementation of national climate change policies and associated programmes on the ground. Situated at the frontline of the state and often engaging directly with citizens, these interface bureaucrats occupy a complex position in which they must balance their role as representatives of the state with the need to accommodate the pressures, interests and practical challenges associated with everyday policy implementation. In this article we examine how interface bureaucrats in Zambia seek to navigate this role as they go about implementing national climate change adaptation policies in practice, and what this means for the nature and outcome of these interventions. We identify key dilemmas of the interface bureaucrats in our study areas, namely (i) intervening with limited reach, (ii) implementing generic policies, and (iii) managing conflicting interests. We show how they address these dilemmas through highly pragmatic practices involving informal agreements with community members, discretionary adjustments of official policies, and negotiation of contested interventions. As a result, the nature and outcomes of climate change adaptation interventions end up differently from the official policies and the underlying governance interests of the central state. Our findings suggest a need for greater attention to the role of interface bureaucrats as everyday climate policy makers and point to the significance of pragmatism and compromise in the interaction between state actors and citizens in environmental interventions.","[Funder, Mikkel] Danish Inst Int Studies, Oestbanegade 117, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Mweemba, Carol Emma] Univ Zambia, Integrated Water Resources Management Ctr, Great East Rd, Lusaka, Zambia",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies; University of Zambia,"Funder, M (corresponding author), Danish Inst Int Studies, Oestbanegade 117, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",mfu@diis.dk; carol.mweemba@unza.zm,,"Funder, Mikkel/0000-0002-3808-919X",Danish Consultative Research Committee for Development Research,Danish Consultative Research Committee for Development Research,"This work was supported by the Danish Consultative Research Committee for Development Research.

Yet understanding how these processes unfold demands attention to how knowledge is translated from one context to another and across levels of governance to influence action. This paper examines the Mekong Delta Plan (MDP), produced in partnership between the Vietnamese and Dutch governments in 2013, as a vehicle for the translation of knowledge to shape climate change adaptation in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Drawing on ethnographic research at sites in Vietnam and the Netherlands, the findings illustrate how the MDP has come to play a key role in the governance of climate change adaptation in the Delta, driven first by Dutch advisors and then by the Vietnamese government. This study suggests that attention to the politics of translation in climate change adaptation governance can shed light on important factors shaping the socio-material evolution of both the Mekong Delta in particular and deltas more broadly.","[Weger, Jacob] Univ Georgia, Dept Anthropol, 250A Baldwin Hall,Jackson St, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Weger, J (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Anthropol, 250A Baldwin Hall,Jackson St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",joweger@uga.edu,,"Weger, Jacob/0000-0002-9624-9817",,,,,53,6,6,2,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Addressing globalisation, the effects on economic spatial hierarchies among regions and the active promotion of regionalisation are seen as important. Applied to the port industry, this allows approaching the fierce competition among European north range ports from an action- and power-oriented perspective. Climate adaptation of ports is predominantly referred to as technical responses to extreme events (e.g. coastal protection). A differentiated conceptualisation (based on still ongoing research), however, also addresses impacts on specific elements of the transport chain, and effects on the spatial function of a port (e.g. the changing competitiveness within the European port system). Hence, the ability of a specific port to adapt will also encompass the management of regional target conflicts, and of multi-level relations. Thus, climate adaptation becomes part of positional struggles in spatial hierarchies among regions and of conflicts about political priorities within them. At the same time, the limits of exclusively regional approaches in addressing sustainability issues without higher level support become evident. The article gives an overview of the literature on climate adaptation and its application to ports and provides a preliminary typology of forms of sectoral adaptation to climate change.","[Osthorst, Winfried; Maenz, Christine] Univ Appl Sci, Hsch Bremen, Fac Social Sci, Bremen, Germany",Bremen University of Applied Sciences,"Osthorst, W (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci, Hsch Bremen, Fac Social Sci, Neustadtwall 30, Bremen, Germany.",winfried.osthorst@hs-bremen.de,,,,,,,73,24,24,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-8839,1464-5254,,MARIT POLICY MANAG,Marit.

However, its potential contribution to climate change adaptation is unclear. Adaptation has become increasingly urgent in a continuously changing climate, especially in developing countries, which are projected to bear the brunt of climate-change-related damages. On the basis of a brief review of climate change impacts and adaptation literature, we suggest that IE can play an important role in the following two aspects. First, with the emphasis on a systems perspective, IE can help us determine how climate change interacts with our socio-economic system and how the interactions may aggravate (or moderate) its direct impacts or whether they may shift burden to other environmental impacts. Second, IE methodologies can help us quantify the direct and indirect environmental impacts of adaptation activities, identify mitigation opportunities, and achieve sustainable adaptation. Further, we find that substantial investment is needed to increase the resilience of infrastructure (e.g., transport, energy, and water supply) and agriculture in developing countries. Because these sectors are also the main drivers of environmental degradation, how to achieve sustainable climate-resilient infrastructure and agriculture in developing countries deserves special attention in future IE studies. Overall, IE thinking and methodologies have great potential to contribute to climate change adaptation research and policy questions, and exploring this growing field will, in turn, inspire IE development.","[Yang, Yi; Wang, Peng; Chen, Wei-Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yi; Smith, Timothy M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Liu, Beibei] Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Beibei] Johns Hopkins Univ Nanjin Univ Ctr Chinese & Amer, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Peng; Chen, Wei-Qiang] Xiamen Key Lab Urban Metab, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei-Qiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Nanjing University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Chen, WQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China.",wqchen@iue.ac.cn,"Chen, Wei-Qiang/HJY-2209-2023; WANG, Peng/GSN-5263-2022; CAS, KLUEH/T-5743-2019; Yang, Yi/AAM-9280-2021","Chen, Wei-Qiang/0000-0002-7686-2331; Yang, Yi/0000-0002-1131-6196; Liu, Beibei/0000-0003-3788-018X; Smith, Timothy/0000-0002-0479-4261",China's NationalKey Research andDevelopmentProgramof theMinistry of Science and Technology [2017YFC0505703]; Key ResearchProject of Frontier Science of Chinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDB-SSWDQC012]; Chinese Academy of Sciences Pioneer Hundred Talents Program; US National Science Foundation [CBET1639342]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71874078],China's NationalKey Research andDevelopmentProgramof theMinistry of Science and Technology; Key ResearchProject of Frontier Science of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences Pioneer Hundred Talents Program; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Wei-Qiang Chen andPengWang acknowledge funding from China's NationalKey Research andDevelopmentProgramof theMinistry of Science and Technology (2017YFC0505703), Key ResearchProject of Frontier Science of Chinese Academy of Sciences (QYZDB-SSWDQC012), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences Pioneer Hundred Talents Program.

However, predicting ecosystem effects remains highly uncertain and governance responses to OA are not yet forthcoming. Adaptive governance can provide a means to deal with this uncertainty and we consider its application to the polycentric governance of adaptation responses to OA in Scotland, focussing on the aquaculture industry as a vulnerable sector. A workshop was used to develop potential responses to OA and to gain information about present and potential capacity for adaptive governance at national and regional levels. Scottish legislation, policy and planning documents were subsequently analysed to enable description of how governance and management arrangements constrain or enable adaptation responses. Legislative and policy analysis indicates convergence across emerging mechanisms in support of adaptive governance and identified interventions. Recent advances in climate change adaptation in Scotland promotes integration of adaptation into wider Scottish Government policy development and functions, based on iterative and collaborative processes across scales. Alongside this, new models of coastal and marine governance, including a partnership-led regional marine planning process and devolution of seabed management rights under Crown Estate Scotland, seek to advance new models of locally-led and learning-based planning and management which can support adaptation responses. However, adaptation measures at operational scale requires flexibility in the aquaculture licensing regime which is currently of low adaptive capacity. Further, expansion of the industry faces social and ecological constraints which limit spatial measures, and are complicated by uncertainty in predicting local OA effects. Expanding the use of holistic and co-operative management tools such as Aquaculture Management Areas could support adaptation across wider spatial scales. Better integration across policy and planning instruments is also needed to enhance adaptive capacity, including between climate change adaptation, marine planning and aquaculture planning and management. This could be enabled by establishing links between existing and proposed collaborative groups to enhance development of adaptation responses and through co-ordination of monitoring and review processes to promote learning across scales.","[Greenhill, Lucy] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland; [Kenter, Jasper O.] Univ York, Dept Environm & Geog, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England; [Dannevig, Halvor] Western Norway Res Inst, Royrgata 4, Sogndal 6856, Norway",UHI Millennium Institute; University of York - UK,"Greenhill, L (corresponding author), Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland.",lucy.greenhill@sams.ac.uk; jasper.kenter@york.ac.uk; hda@vestforsk.no,"Dannevig, Halvor/P-3477-2019; Kenter, Jasper/AAO-6975-2021","Dannevig, Halvor/0000-0002-7648-4166; Kenter, Jasper/0000-0002-3612-086X; Greenhill, Lucy/0000-0002-5122-4552",project Adapting Coastal Zone Management to Ocean Acidification [255748]; Norwegian Research Council,project Adapting Coastal Zone Management to Ocean Acidification; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"This research was supported by the project Adapting Coastal Zone Management to Ocean Acidification (grant no. 255748), funded by the Norwegian Research Council.

It particularly examines the role of Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network as an exogenous driver that sought to sustain urban climate adaptation and resilience agenda in a secondary city in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach - The research combines fieldworks and desktop research. Primary data collection includes participant observation, unstructured interviews with city stakeholders and project managers, semi-structured interviews with local communities and literature reviews. This research also used an ethnographic field research approach. Findings - Exogenous drivers have temporarily fostered climate change adaptation at city level, but the question remains is how can international actors effectively create a meaningful transformation toward urban resilience in developing countries like Indonesia. Exogenous drivers can play significant roles as a catalyst for urban adaptation planning, including undertaking vulnerability assessment and city resilience strategy and implementing adaptation actions, and facilitates risk management. Further processes for mainstreaming climate adaptation and disaster reduction depend on how receptive and responsive local actors to co-facilitate and co-lead urban resilience buildings and development. Originality/value - There is still lack of documented knowledge on local institutional change and policy making processes. This research shows challenges and opportunities in institutionalising urban climate adaptation and risk management agenda. It further shows that genesis of endogenous adaptation cannot be separated from the exogenous climate adaptation processes as well as internal dynamic of urban governance in developing world.","[Nugraha, Erwin] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England; [Lassa, Jonatan A.] Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Indigenous Futures Arts & Soc, Darwin, NT, Australia",Durham University; Charles Darwin University,"Lassa, JA (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Indigenous Futures Arts & Soc, Darwin, NT, Australia.",jonatan.lassa@gmail.com,"Lassa, Jonatan/M-6112-2019; Lassa, Jonatan/D-2205-2017","Lassa, Jonatan/0000-0002-8432-842X; Lassa, Jonatan/0000-0002-8432-842X; Nugraha, Erwin/0000-0002-5294-9934",Durham University - Open Society Foundations; Norman Richardson Postgraduate Research Fund,Durham University - Open Society Foundations; Norman Richardson Postgraduate Research Fund,"The first author gratefully acknowledges the financial support provided by Durham University - Open Society Foundations and Norman Richardson Postgraduate Research Fund.

The first investigates adaptation to climate change in two of the state's major grain and sheep farming regions, using semi-structured interviews and focus groups. The second uses a postal questionnaire and an internet-based survey of residents in the peri-urban fringes of Adelaide, the state capital, to examine knowledge of and attitudes to climate change and resulting adaptations, especially in the context of increasing risk of wildfires. The research on adaptation to climate change in agriculture focused on formal institutions (e.g., government agencies) and communities of practice (e.g., farm systems groups). Both groups noted that farmers autonomously adapt to various risks, including those induced by climate variability. The types and levels of adaptation varied among individuals partly because of barriers to adaptation, which included limited communication and engagement processes established between formal institutions and communities of practice. The paper discusses possibilities for more effective transfers of knowledge and information on climate change among formal institutions, communities of practice, trusted individual advisors and farmers. Research in the peri-urban fringe revealed that actions taken by individuals to mitigate and/or adapt to climate change were linked to the nature of environmental values held (or ecological worldview) and place attachment. Individuals with a strong place attachment to the study area (the Adelaide Hills) who possessed knowledge of and/or beliefs in climate change were most likely to take mitigating actions. This was also linked to previous experience of major risk from wildfires. The paper concludes by discussing prospects for developing co-management for reducing the impact of climate change across multiple groups in rural and peri-urban areas.","[Robinson, Guy M.; Bardsley, Douglas K.; Bardsley, Annette M.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Raymond, Christopher M.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture Planning & Management, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Underwood, Tegan; Moskwa, Emily; Weber, Delene] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia; [Waschl, Nicolette] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Off Educ Res, 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616, Singapore",University of Adelaide; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of South Australia; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore,"Robinson, GM (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",guy.robinson@adelaide.edu.au; douglas.bardsley@adelaide.edu.au; christopher.raymond@slu.se; tegan.underwood@aurecongroup.com; emily.moskwa@gmail.com; delene.weber@gmail.com; nicolette.waschl@nie.edu.sg; annette.bardsley@adelaide.edu.au,"Raymond, Christopher M./Y-3115-2019; Waschl, Nicolette/AAB-3603-2020","Raymond, Christopher M./0000-0002-7165-885X; Robinson, Guy Martin/0000-0003-1652-6456; Waschl, Nicolette/0000-0002-0796-6866; Weber, Delene/0000-0002-8293-4960","NRM Alliance; Department of Water, Land & Biodiversity Conservation South Australia; Australian Research Council [LP130100406]; Eyre Peninsula NRM Board; Adelaide Mount Lofty Ranges NRM Board; Australian Research Council [LP130100406] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","NRM Alliance; Department of Water, Land & Biodiversity Conservation South Australia; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Eyre Peninsula NRM Board; Adelaide Mount Lofty Ranges NRM Board; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","This paper draws upon research conducted in two separate research projects.

Although Tehran, the capital of Iran, has been subject to a variety of climate change impacts in recent years, appropriate adaptation measures to address them are yet to be taken. This study primarily aims to categorize the barriers to climate change adaptation in Tehran and analyze the way they interact with each other. The study was done in three steps: first, the focus group discussion (FGD) method was used to identify the barriers; next, the survey and the structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to validate the barriers, identify their importance, and examine their possible inter-relationships; and finally, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) was applied to categorize and visualize the relationships between the barriers. Results show that barriers related to the 'structure and culture of research', 'laws and regulations', and 'planning' belong to the cluster of independent barriers and are of greater significance. The 'social' barrier and barriers related to 'resources and resource management' are identified as dependent barriers and are of lesser importance. Barriers related to 'governance', 'awareness', 'education and knowledge', 'communication and interaction', and 'economy' are identified at the intermediate cluster. The findings of this study can provide planners and decision makers with invaluable insights as to how to develop strategies for climate change adaptation in Tehran.

However, the scope for options that make our societies less vulnerable to flood risks, disruptive quantities of rainwater in cities, or urban heat stress tends to be narrowed down, often implicitly, by the existing institutional context. Institutions reflect past choices made regarding the legitimate distribution of burdens and benefits between government and society of measures against weather-related calamities. Alternative options, like innovative dyke concepts, green roofs, or urban planning to reduce heat stress, would require political debate on the legitimacy of different arrangements and would take climate adaptation policy out of the technocratic 'comfort zone'. This article offers a framework of analysis for describing the institutionalized distribution of responsibilities for initiation, implementation, costs and liability for climate adaptation measures, and the shift in these that alternative options would entail. Furthermore, it offers four perspectives for assessing the legitimacy of present and alternative distributions. The framework is applied to the Dutch context in three cases concerning flooding, urban water drainage and urban heat stress.","[Tennekes, Joost; Van Bree, Leendert] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, NL-2511 VE The Hague, Netherlands; [Driessen, Peter P.

Addressing adaptation deficits' and other approaches that target existing vulnerabilities are helpful for responding to current climate variability, but we argue that they may not be sufficient for adapting to climate change. Through a review and unique synthesis of the natural hazards and climate adaptation literatures, we identify why the dynamics of vulnerability matter for adaptation efforts. We draw on vulnerability theory and the natural hazards and climate adaptation literatures to outline how adaptation to climate variability, combined with the shifting societal landscape can sometimes lead to unintended consequences and increased vulnerability. Moreover, we argue that public perceptions of risk associated with current climate variability do not necessarily position communities to adapt to the impacts from climate change. We suggest that decision makers faced with adapting to climate change must consider the dynamics of vulnerability in a connected systemhow choices made in one part of the system might impact other valued outcomes or even create new vulnerabilities. We conclude by suggesting the need for greater engagement with various publics on the tradeoffs involved in adaptation action and for improving communication about the complicated nature of the dynamics of vulnerability.

Our framework examines the incremental, transitional, and transformational elements of climate change adaptation (the Adapt IT2 framework, for short), and we apply our framework to focus group discussions around hypothetical hydro-climatic variability and extremes to identify past and potential future adaptations. By applying our framework, we uncover the nuanced interplay between incremental and transformation adaptation and develop the related concept of transition. Our work provides insights into the interactions between the different types of adaptation processes, and our findings indicate that: (1) There are interdependencies between and among actions and actors across various scales and (2) one type of adaptation can set boundaries for the other. This work also identifies thresholds that, when perceived to be surpassed by actors, may facilitate transformation. It concludes with opportunities for further research, particularly into the transitional space that exists between the two types of adaptation.","[Pittman, Jeremy] Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Resource & Sustainabil, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Hill, Harvey] US Army Corps Engineers, Inst Water Resources, Alexandria, VA USA; [Bruce, Kristin] Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Howard, Allan] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Regina, SK, Canada",University of Waterloo; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; University of Saskatchewan; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,"Pittman, J (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Resource & Sustainabil, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",mhadarits@hotmail.com; pittman17@hotmail.com; corkald@sasktel.net; Harvey.S.Hill@usace.army.mil; kristin.bruce@usask.ca; Allan.Howard@agr.gc.ca,,,Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada; University of Regina,Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada); University of Regina,"The authors would like to thank the workshop participants for their participation and time, and the research team for their contributions to the workshop.

We developed a typology of approaches by which climate change adaptation can be tracked globally at a national level. On the one hand, outcome-based approaches directly measure adaptation progress and effectiveness with reference to avoided climate change impacts. However, given that full exposure to climate change impacts will not happen for decades, alternative approaches focus on developing indicators or proxies by which adaptation can be monitored. These include systematic measures of adaptation readiness, processes undertaken to advance adaptation, policies and programs implemented to adapt, and measures of the impacts of these policies and programs on changing vulnerability. While these approaches employ various methods and data sources, and identify different components of adaptation progress to track at the national level, they all seek to characterize the current status of adaptation by which progress over time can be monitored. However, there are significant challenges to operationalizing these approaches, including an absence of systematically collected data on adaptation actions and outcomes, underlying difficulties of defining what constitutes adaptation, and a disconnect between the timescale over which adaptation plays out and the practical need for evaluation to inform policy. Given the development of new adaptation funding streams, it is imperative that tools for monitoring progress are developed and validated for identifying trends and gaps in adaptation response.","[Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea; Lesnikowski, Alex; Barrera, Magda] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Heymann, S.

Integrated water resources management (IWRM) institutions and mechanisms offer a good entry point for the uptake and implementation of climate change adaptation measures. This review paper provides an overview about IWRM approaches in the MRB and ongoing processes as well as opportunities to mainstream climate change adaptation into existing basin strategies and water management instruments. The review clearly shows that approaches taken by the Mekong River Commission, the Greater Mekong Subregional Economic Cooperation Program, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with respect to water resources management are largely complementary and synergies could be increased to incorporate climate change adaptation into existing schemes. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) has a great potential in the region as its economy is still largely based on the use of natural resources. Despite this acknowledgment, the inclusion of EbA measures as a sustainable land and water management tool for climate change adaptation is still relatively new in the MRB context. We argue that mainstreaming EbA measures in IWRM-guided basin development planning offers no-regret and flexible solutions and opportunities and allows for action despite the considerable uncertainties decision-makers face.","[Sebesvari, Zita] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Rodrigues, Sandrina] Environm Canada, Boundary Water Issues Unit, Burlington, ON, Canada; [Renaud, Fabrice] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, Bonn, Germany",Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Sebesvari, Z (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",sebesvari@ehs.unu.edu; Sandrina.Rodrigues@ec.gc.ca; renaud@ehs.unu.edu,"Renaud, Fabrice/M-3249-2017","Renaud, Fabrice/0000-0002-0830-1196",,,,,87,4,4,3,46,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Green infrastructure (GI) is increasingly seen as an ideal climate change adaptation policy response. However, with this research the authors identify a number of crucial knowledge gaps within GI and, consequently, call for caution and for a concerted effort to understand the concept and what it can really deliver. GI has risen to prominence in a range of policy areas in large part due to its perceived ability to produce multiple benefits simultaneously, termed 'multifunctionality'. This characteristic strengthens the political appeal of the policy in question at a time when environmental issues have slipped down political agendas. Multifunctionality, however, brings its own set of new challenges that should be evaluated fully before the policy is implemented. This research takes important first steps to developing a critical understanding of what is achievable within GI's capacity. It focuses on one of GI's single objectives, namely climate change adaptation, to focus the analysis of how current obstacles in applying GI's multifunctionality could lead to the ineffective delivery of its objective. By drawing on expert opinion from government officials and representatives from the private, non-government organisation (NGO) and academic sectors, this research questions GI's ability to be effectively 'multifunctional' with an inconsistent definition at its core, deficiencies in its understanding and conflicts within its governance. In light of these observations, the authors then reflect on the judiciousness of applying GI to achieve the other objectives it has also been charged with delivering. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In a context of increasing pressure on water resources as a result of the reduction in water availability, it is essential and urgent to structure water management in a way that allows for adaptation to the challenges that the changing climate will bring to an already water scarce region. It is necessary to generate experiences and methodologies that are based on real case studies that will lay the foundations for the generalisation of practices of climate change adaptation in water management. In this study, we have developed a ready to use analytical framework to evaluate the coherence of water management plans and programs with climate change adaptation principles.

Here we present a scoping review, using PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols), examining the conditions that have led to the adoption of climate-resilient crops over the past 30 years in lower- and middle-income countries. The descriptive analysis performed on 202 papers shows that small-scale producers adopted climate-resilient crops and varieties to cope with abiotic stresses such as drought, heat, flooding and salinity. The most prevalent trait in our dataset was drought tolerance, followed by water-use efficiency. Our analysis found that the most important determinants of adoption of climate-resilient crops were the availability and effectiveness of extension services and outreach, followed by education levels of heads of households, farmers' access to inputs-especially seeds and fertilizers-and socio-economic status of farming families. About 53% of studies reported that social differences such as sex, age, marital status and ethnicity affected the adoption of varieties or crops as climate change-adaptation strategies. On the basis of the collected evidence, this study presents a series of pathways and interventions that could contribute to higher adoption rates of climate-resilient crops and reduce dis-adoption. Climate-resilient crops are essential for farmers to adapt to climate change. This scoping review identifies extension services and outreach as the most important factors for their adoption by small-scale producers in low- and middle-income countries.","[Acevedo, Maricelis; Tufan, Hale; Ghezzi-Kopel, Kate; Porciello, Jaron] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Pixley, Kevin] CIMMYT, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Zinyengere, Nkulumo] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Meng, Sisi] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Cichy, Karen] USDA ARS, E Lansing, MI USA; [Bizikova, Livia] Int Inst Sustainable Dev, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Isaacs, Krista] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Cornell University; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); The World Bank; University of Notre Dame; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Michigan State University,"Acevedo, M (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",ma934@cornell.edu,"Isaacs, Krista/AAC-9628-2021","Tufan, Hale Ann/0000-0002-5323-4244; Porciello, Jaron/0000-0002-3179-1971; Cichy, Karen/0000-0002-4311-0774; Meng, Sisi/0000-0003-0677-2717; Pixley, Kevin/0000-0003-4068-7436; Ghezzi-Kopel, Kate/0000-0002-8777-402X",,,,,57,46,46,12,39,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2055-026X,2055-0278,,NAT PLANTS,Nat.

In these and related efforts, a focus on building resilience is an important objective, one that resonates with development objectives. Compiling and applying indicators will help development practitioners consider resilience in projects, plans, and decision making. Exactly how to do this is a challenging, but important task. Drawing on diverse methods in the literature, this paper identifies factors important to understanding the evolution of resilience over time and space, and suggests a framework for developing indicators that analysts might select as useful for particular places or sectors. The paper lays the groundwork for an assessment framework that can make future development and adaptation choices more resilient. The framework is intended as a starting point for wider discussions of factors that contribute to building resilience and thus provide the basis to develop a toolkit of metrics and approaches. These discussions will need to bridge research on climate-change adaptation and resilience with practice.","[Engle, Nathan L.; de Bremond, Ariane; Malone, Elizabeth L.; Moss, Richard H.] Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [de Bremond, Ariane] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"de Bremond, A (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, 2181 LeFrak Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",adebrem@umd.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Moss, Richard/0000-0001-5005-0063; de Bremond, Ariane/0000-0002-0924-6053",,,,,54,48,51,2,77,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

As vast proportions of African countries' populations rely on agriculture for livelihood and food security, there is a need to adapt current practices and develop new climate-resilient strategies and farming systems. Here, we inventory and review which agroecological practices currently implemented in semiarid and subhumid Africa can promote adaptation to climate change. This work was carried out through extensive literature research, plus interviews with 24 experts from different African and French NGOs active in agricultural development programs in Africa. We found that: (1) some inventoried practices may not specifically be implemented in response to climate change impacts, yet they aid in adapting to reduced or more variable rainfall and increased temperature, and/or enhance carbon sequestration; (2) other practices promote indirect adaptation by increasing resilience of cropping or livestock systems; (3) many farmers use combinations of different practices to increase overall farming system resilience and through this strategy can achieve efficient adaptation to climate changes, as single practices normally are not sufficient. Our review and evaluation show that a broad variety of agroecological practices provides high potential to adapt to climate change effects in semiarid and subhumid African farming systems.","[Debray, Valentine; Wezel, Alexander] ISARA Lyon, Dept Agroecol & Environm, 23 Rue Jean Baldassini, F-69364 Lyon, France; [Debray, Valentine; Lambert-Derkimba, Adeline] CARI, Viols Le Ft, France; [Debray, Valentine; Roesch, Katia] AVSF, Lyon, France; [Lieblein, Geir; Francis, Charles Andrew] NMBU, Dept Plant Sci, As, Norway; [Francis, Charles Andrew] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, UNL, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",ISARA; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Wezel, A (corresponding author), ISARA Lyon, Dept Agroecol & Environm, 23 Rue Jean Baldassini, F-69364 Lyon, France.",awezel@isara.fr,,,,,,,68,10,11,8,62,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2168-3565,2168-3573,,AGROECOL SUST FOOD,Agroecol.

The studios focused on the sparsely populated, high flood risk region of the Lake District, UK. The Lake District faces urgent climate change challenges that demand effective solutions. On the other hand, the area is a UNESCO heritage site, characterized by massive tourism and tending towards museumification (sic). Three indicative design research projects were selected to illustrate the proposed research by design strategy. The results reveal that this strategy facilitates the iterative research by design process and hence offers a systematic approach to convert the threats of climate change into opportunities by unraveling the potentials of the study area. The findings lay the groundwork for more systematic studies on research by design as an effective strategy for climate change adaptation design.

Values-based approaches to climate change adaptation and the cultural cognition thesis both illustrate this trend. We argue that in the wake of this development it is necessary to take the dynamic relationship between values and beliefs seriously, to acknowledge the possibility of bi-directional relationships between values and beliefs, and to address the variety of values involved (e.g. personal, epistemic and cultural values). The dynamic relationship between values and beliefs, we claim, highlights the need to bring ethical considerations to bear on climate change communication.

Understanding farmers' perceptual and socio-cognitive processes is key in order to encourage on-farm adaptation. We aim at investigating how farmers' individual cognition on climate change and adaptation as well as socio-environmental context factors affect agricultural adaptation intention and avoidance. We build on the Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPACC) and apply a qualitative interview approach in two Austrian farming regions. Twenty semi-structured interviews have been conducted with 29 farmers. Based on the results of the qualitative content analysis, we have identified four groups of farmers, which differ in the formation process of adaptation intention and avoidance: (i) climate change adaptors, (ii) integrative adaptors, (iii) cost-benefit calculators, and (iv) climate change fatalists. Farmers who are part of groups (i)-(iii) form adaptation intentions, whereas climate change fatalists do not intend to adapt. According to our analysis, adaptation intentions are only formed if farmers are aware of effective adaptation measures, accept personal responsibility for their farms, and evaluate adaptation costs positively (i.e. adaptation appraisal). Farmers' climate change appraisal as well as farm and regional characteristics are also perceived relevant for farmers' adaptation decisions but seem to be less important than adaptation appraisal. Therefore, we conclude that engagement strategies and outreach efforts need not only address risks and opportunities, but should also strengthen farmers' self-responsibility and offer adaptation measures tailored to the regional characteristics and the farmers' needs.","[Mitter, Hermine; Larcher, Manuela; Schoenhart, Martin; Stoettinger, Magdalena; Schmid, Erwin] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Larcher, M (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",manuela.larcher@boku.ac.at,"Schmid, Erwin/Z-1946-2019","Schmid, Erwin/0000-0003-4783-9666; Mitter, Hermine/0000-0003-0799-9489","ERA4CS JPI Climate project Climate Services for the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus (CLISWELN) - Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research [863470]; University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU)","ERA4CS JPI Climate project Climate Services for the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus (CLISWELN) - Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research; University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU)","This article has been supported by the ERA4CS JPI Climate project Climate Services for the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus (CLISWELN)[863470] funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research and administered by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG).

Further irrigation development would continue to reduce climate vulnerabilities. Even with irrigation however, the compounding effects of climate and other socio-economic changes will likely require modifications in current practices and policies in order to secure adequate livelihoods.

One such is subsistence farming, which constitutes the backbone of most rural sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies, including Cameroon. Significant research and policy efforts have been directed towards overcoming barriers to climate adaptation. Such efforts have tackled a range of socio-economic and exogenous institutional constraints. However, knowledge gaps exist in the climate adaptation literature, particularly with regards to the extent to which endogenous cultural institutions (customary rules) in SSA shape gender (in)equality in access to productive resources like land. Based on a representative survey of 87 female-headed households in rural Cameroon, we contribute to bridge this gap by determining endogenous cultural institutional constraints to rural women's climate adaptation, specifically with regards to their access to land for subsistence farming. Results were obtained with logistic regression analysis and a chi-square test of independence, showing that: (i) an inverse relationship exists between discriminatory cultural practices and women farmers' capacity to adapt to climate change, and that (ii) tenure insecurity and inequality amplifies farmer's vulnerability to long- and short-term climatic change. While this paper contributes to existing theoretical frameworks on climate adaptation from an institutional perspective, it equally makes a succinct request for further studies to be undertaken to ground this theoretical assertion.","[Nchu, Innocent Ngiehnu; Kimengsi, Jude Ndzifon; Kapp, Gerald] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Environm Sci, Inst Int Forestry & Forest Prod, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Kimengsi, JN (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Environm Sci, Inst Int Forestry & Forest Prod, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany.",jude_ndzifon.kimengsi@tu-dresden.de,,"Kimengsi, Jude Ndzifon/0000-0002-1927-7443; Kapp, Gerald/0000-0001-5561-7970",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation under the International Climate Protection Fellowship - Technische Universitat Dresden,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation under the International Climate Protection Fellowship - Technische Universitat Dresden(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),This research was supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation under the International Climate Protection Fellowship.

The competition, disaster resilience, sustainable development and water policies examined underline the difficulty in developing and implementing effective policy frameworks. We find that to succeed, a national policy in this federation needs: a coalition of stakeholders advocating for their implementation; medium to long-term bipartisan support; a focus on a perceived urgent national issue; significant socio-economic benefits; a focus on a limited number of core principles and systemic legislative reform with incremental implementation over many years; the allocation by the federal government of substantial funds for state implementation; requirements to report to the Council of Australian Governments; and support from central government agencies rather than marginalisation in the environment portfolio. These qualities are not inherent in the 1992 National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development and this explains why it is now moribund.

In the private sector, local adaptation responses to climate change are observed as changes to the limited capacities of organizational processes to plan for social aspects of adaptation. This article applies a methodology to map these connections and presents empirical evidence of a firm's autonomous adaptation measures along their supply chain in Baja California, Mexico. The spatial conceptualization of the business model illustrates the potential to identify sources of climate-related risks, autonomous adaptation actions, and the barriers to improving the feedback loops to facilitate the integration of local knowledge for business model innovation. The results suggest that coproduction of innovations is a mechanism for organizational learning that can help to overcome the challenges for business strategy to identify the wide array of local factors associated to climate adaptation and normalize adaptation planning into business models. This approach might accelerate leveraging the capabilities of the private sector for socially oriented forms of adaptation that amplify the transformational value of business model approaches for improved adaptation strategies.","[DiBella, Jose] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England; [DiBella, Jose] Univ Waterloo, Sustainabil Policy Res Urban Transformat Lab, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of London; King's College London; University of Waterloo,"DiBella, J (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Sustainabil Policy Res Urban Transformat Lab, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",jose.dibella@gmail.com,,"DiBella, Jose/0000-0002-2348-1789",CONACYT - Mexico National Council for Science and Technology,CONACYT - Mexico National Council for Science and Technology(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),CONACYT - Mexico National Council for Science and Technology,,45,7,7,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2572-3170,,BUS STRATEGY DEV,Bus.

Farmers were interviewed across four districts and climate change observations were reported, most notably those of increased temperatures and unpredictable precipitation. Agricultural adaptation strategies adopted in response to climate change were varied, with agroforestry and organic farming being the most popular practices. Most adaptation strategies were thought to be development-facing actions to reduce vulnerability, rather than specifically addressing climate change. From this research it is evident that indigenous knowledge, financial support and increased accessibility all play a pivotal role for successful climate change adaptation in the Mid-Hills. This case study provides valuable evidence-based research of autonomous adaptation techniques in a highly climate-vulnerable location of Nepal. Recommendations are made for donors to learn from best-practice and adopt local knowledge when investing in climate change adaptation strategies to most effectively reduce the vulnerability of some of the world's poorest communities.","[Biggs, E.

The overarching objective of managed retreat is to reduce the exposure of people and assets to flooding, storm surges and sea level rise by retreating from these threats in a planned fashion. Managed retreat is one of four main options covered in the TARA' (protect/accommodate/retreat/avoid) framework explained in this paper, which can be used to enhance resilience in coastal megacities. In this paper, qualitative research methods were used to collect primary data on the feasibility of using managed retreat for two case study coastal megacities: Manila, Philippines, and Vancouver, Canada. Both case studies review the risk context of each city, local climate change adaptation/disaster risk reduction (CCA/DRR) policies linked to managed retreat, examples of managed retreat practice, and barriers to managed retreat identified through primary or secondary data analysis. Comparisons between the two cases are then carried out, and similarities and differences are highlighted. The paper concludes by suggesting possible means by which barriers to managed retreat might be overcome.","[Doberstein, Brent; Tadgell, Anne; Rutledge, Alexandra] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Doberstein, B (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",bdoberst@uwaterloo.ca,,"Doberstein, Brent/0000-0001-8891-7400",Coastal Cities at Risk (CCaR): Building Adaptive Capacity for Managing Climate Change in Coastal Megacities project [106372-001]; Canadian International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Ontario Graduate Scholarship program; SSHRC,Coastal Cities at Risk (CCaR): Building Adaptive Capacity for Managing Climate Change in Coastal Megacities project; Canadian International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR); Ontario Graduate Scholarship program(Ontario Graduate Scholarship); SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This research was carried out under the Coastal Cities at Risk (CCaR): Building Adaptive Capacity for Managing Climate Change in Coastal Megacities project (grant number 106372-001), one of several projects within the International Research Initiative on Adaptation to Climate Change (IRIACC) program.

Yet efforts to adapt to climate change, as reported in the literature over the last decade and in selected case studies, have not led to substantial rates of implementation of adaptation actions despite substantial investments in adaptation science. Moreover, implemented actions have been mostly incremental and focused on proximate causes; there are far fewer reports of more systemic or transformative actions. We found that the nature and effectiveness of responses was strongly influenced by framing. Recent decision-oriented approaches that aim to overcome this situation are framed within a pathways metaphor to emphasise the need for robust decision making within adaptive processes in the face of uncertainty and inter-temporal complexity. However, to date, such adaptation pathways approaches have mostly focused on contexts with clearly identified decision-makers and unambiguous goals; as a result, they generally assume prevailing governance regimes are conducive for adaptation and hence constrain responses to proximate causes of vulnerability. In this paper, we explore a broader conceptualisation of adaptation pathways that draws on 'pathways thinking' in the sustainable development domain to consider the implications of path dependency, interactions between adaptation plans, vested interests and global change, and situations where values, interests, or institutions constrain societal responses to change. This reconceptualisation of adaptation pathways aims to inform decision makers about integrating incremental actions on proximate causes with the transformative aspects of societal change. Case studies illustrate what this might entail. The paper ends with a call for further exploration of theory, methods and procedures to operationalise this broader conceptualisation of adaptation.

The study examined the recent extreme climate events that occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the climate change adaptation options mentioned in the literature, and the need for international technological transfer in SSA. 181 peer-reviewed publications were evaluated on the following topics: 1) the impacts of climate extremes in SSA; 2) the adaptation options discussed in the literature for the region; 3) the analysis of the needs and the gaps of the international technology transfer in SSA, and 4) the various impact areas of the technology transfer on the adaptive capacity in SSA. The major finding from this study is that the impacts of climate change have been observed in the region, with many extreme events leading to reductions in crop yield qualities and quantities, with much greater impacts on the smallholder farmers' livelihoods in SSA countries. Based on these findings climate change conceptual framework is proposed which summarises the observed impacts of climate change on agriculture and food systems in SSA countries. The study concluded that there are new adaptation options that SSA countries can adopt from developed countries, and that much greater agricultural technological transfer is needed to facilitate better adaptation to climate change in SSA.","[Ayanlade, Ayansina; Borderon, Marion; Sterly, Harald; Sakdapolrak, Patrick; Weldemariam, Lemlem F.] Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, Univ Str 7-5, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Ayanlade, Ayansina] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Geog, Ife, Nigeria; [Oluwaranti, Abimbola] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Crop Prod & Protect, Ife, Osun State, Nigeria; [Ayanlade, Oluwatoyin S.; Jegede, Margaret O.] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, African Inst Sci Policy & Innovat, Ife, Nigeria; [Ayinde, Adefunke F.

Design/methodology/approach - This study conducted an empirical analysis of the impact of climate change on maize (Zea mays), banana (Musa sapientum) and durian (Durio zibethinus) production. Furthermore, it estimated the determinants of adaptation to climate change and its corresponding effect on farm productivity. The analysis used primary data from 541 farmer-respondents producing maize, banana and durian in the 6 provinces and 18 municipalities of the sample areas. Findings - Based on the probit estimate results, farmers adaptation decisions were influenced by information about future climate change conditions, social capital, access to formal extension and farmer-to-farmer extension. The author found from the stochastic frontier estimation in the production function that climate change adaptations exerted a significant impact on farm productivity. It helped in coping with the adverse effects and risk of climate change while increasing agricultural productivities of the farmer-respondents. Originality/value - This research paper will be an addition to the body of knowledge on the socioeconomic aspects on the climate change and adaptation on the production of maize, banana and durian in the case of a developing country like Southern Philippines. This will bring more insights into the adaptation strategies that are crucial to cope with climatic variability and change.","Univ Southern Mindanao, Coll Business Dev Econ & Management, Dept Agr Econ, Cotabato, Philippines",,"Gomez, N (corresponding author), Univ Southern Mindanao, Coll Business Dev Econ & Management, Dept Agr Econ, Cotabato, Philippines.",nugomez@yahoo.com,,,Philippine Department of Agriculture - Bureau of Agricultural Research (DA-BAR),Philippine Department of Agriculture - Bureau of Agricultural Research (DA-BAR),The helpful comments of the anonymous reviewers are fully acknowledged.

We advance the concept of 'self-organized adaptation' to analyze how long-term pathways of transformation come about as the organic outcome of farmers' incremental and continuous responses to climate and other challenges. Through an analysis of four decades' responses to changing climate conditions in an agricultural system of the Indian Himalayas, we show how several key policy interventions-institutional support for the dissemination of agricultural knowledge, investments in infrastructure, and strengthening of market linkages-have produced favorable conditions for successful, long-term self-organized adaptation to climate change. This has led to the transformation of an agricultural system specialized in apple production to one with a great diversity of fruit, vegetable, and food grain crops. We find that farmers growing these crops cluster into five distinct agricultural portfolios that reflect the constraints and opportunities that different farmers face, and which are patterned by interaction with rural institutions and household social networks. We highlight the role of distributed decision-making in shaping broader trajectories of systemic transformation, and we argue for the need to move beyond pre-defined climate interventions toward the identification of policy mechanisms that can support more effective self-organization over the long-term.","[Fischer, Harry W.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, POB 7012, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Chhatre, Ashwini; Devalkar, Sripad; Sohoni, Milind] Indian Sch Business, Hyderabad 500111, Telangana, India",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Indian School of Business (ISB),"Fischer, HW (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, POB 7012, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",harry.fischer@slu.se,"; Devalkar, Sripad K/G-4139-2015; Sohoni, Milind/E-4894-2015","Fischer, Harry/0000-0001-7967-1154; Chhatre, Ashwini/0000-0002-5374-7867; Devalkar, Sripad K/0000-0002-3708-9104; Sohoni, Milind/0000-0003-0510-7109",Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet) [2018-05875]; University of Illinois Academy of Entrepreneurial Leadership research grant,Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet)(Swedish Research Council); University of Illinois Academy of Entrepreneurial Leadership research grant,"The authors would like to thank Satya Prasanna, Vijay Guleria, Rajesh Rana, and Sriharitej Kolagani for assisting in data collection and analysis, and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments on the manuscript.

The research presented here aimed to contribute to the current literature in sustainability and adaptation through identifying and evaluating the potential that BC has in supporting and promoting climate change adaptation in terms of theoretical and practical governance. Media City, Salford, UK, provided the context for this study having been identified as an exemplar case study and the site of practical implementation of a breadth of community sustainability strategies. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the relationship between established characteristics of adaptive governance (AG) in relation to relevant BC indicators; alongside an evaluation of the perceptions of key actors' as to the adaptive capacity promoted by the application of this tool in practice. This research was informed by interviews with key actors and wider stakeholders in the design, construction and management of the development as well as focus groups with occupants, workers and students in the case study location. Consequently, the need for enhancement of the tool's indicators was identified, and suggestions for their improvement were proposed. Accordingly, BC was found to be a significant tool that holds potential to positively influence community response to climate change adaptation needs. In conclusion, in order to enable effective neighbourhood scale adaptation to climate change, the following themes were identified for further enhancement in the tool: adaptive behaviour and learning, communication, community awareness, knowledge and management.","[Naji, Sally] Nahrain Univ, Sch Engn Al, Baghdad, Iraq; [Gwilliam, Julie] Cardiff Univ, Welsh Sch Architecture, Cardiff, Wales",Al-Nahrain University; Cardiff University,"Naji, S (corresponding author), Nahrain Univ, Sch Engn Al, Baghdad, Iraq.",Sally.naji@yahoo.com; gwilliamja@cardiff.ac.uk,,"naji, sally/0000-0002-0475-4884",,,,,64,0,0,2,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Accordingly, adaptation to climate change has shifted towards the centre of attention in both policy and research. In this article, we review the last 10 years of adaptation research (2008-2018), with a focus on work within the Earth System Governance network. We use the lens of access and allocation to structure our review and examine how adaptation affects, and is affected by, access to basic needs, basic rights, and decision-making on the one hand, as well as allocation of responsibilities, resources, and risks on the other. We find that questions of justice, equity, and fairness are fundamental to all dimensions of adaptation. The access perspective, for example, suggests that we need to assess vulnerability, understood broadly, while the allocation perspective focuses on questions of responsibility for being vulnerable, e.g. when people live, or move to, hazard-prone areas exposed to climate risk. This also relates to questions of who is responsible for selecting, implementing, and funding adaptation measures. Overall, we find that the framework of access and allocation and its subcategories offer a detailed approach to adaptation and adaptation research, but that it is not intuitive. The notion of climate justice seems to resonate more with both academic and policy debates.","[Grecksch, Kevin] Univ Oxford, Ctr Sociolegal Studies, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Klock, Carola] Sci Po Paris, Ctr Int Res CERI, 56 Rue Jacob, F-75006 Paris, France",University of Oxford,"Grecksch, K (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Ctr Sociolegal Studies, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",kevin.grecksch@csls.ox.ac.uk; carola.kloeck@sciencespo.fr,"Grecksch, Kevin/AAA-1826-2021","Grecksch, Kevin/0000-0002-1913-0134; Klock, Carola/0000-0003-2987-7570",,,,,147,4,4,3,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

For Austrian cities, depending on location and topography, heavy rainfall events, storms and heat waves in particular could become increasingly relevant in the tourism context. For medium-sized and large cities, heat is the most frequently discussed topic in connection with possible adaptation potentials. The analysis of challenges shows a strong overlap of adaptation targets in city tourism with adaptation challenges for city planning including connection to the sub-urban surrounding areas to confront climate change impacts. Covid-19 pandemic, additionally, offered the opportunity to discuss a new re-start of the city-tourism against the experience during the shutdown period in spring 2020. The paper argues that we can learn from the current health crisis for coping with climate change related extreme events and to increase achievements in climate change mitigation. Firstly, the pandemic provides a strong ability to discuss the impact of city tourism due to short-term air travel and options to enhance more climate-friendly options on the other hand. Secondly, Covid-19 emphasized the need to reconsider the role of free spaces in metropolitan areas as well as their accessibility. Herewith synergies with climate change adaptation are likely when questioning the availability and accessibility of green and blue infrastructure as well as their capacities. Challenges including crowding and impacts by over tourism on public free spaces will require joint strategies involving all public and private institutions (including local communities and businesses) responsible for the maintenance of green and blue free spaces. Thirdly, the strong interactions between urban and suburban areas became evident once more, which will also be very relevant for city tourism in the future (e.g. in times of heat waves). Reflection on the transferability of coping with such crowding effects, related to the adaptive behaviour of residents and tourists in times of severe heat waves, might be relevant for both city tourism and summer tourism destinations near metropolitan areas. Finally, the Covid-19 crisis encourages discussions on over-tourism in metropolitan destinations in favour of a more balanced approach, in particular in inner city areas and around major sightseeing attractions.","[Jiricka-Puerrer, Alexandra; Brandenburg, Christiane; Proebstl-Haider, Ulrike] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Peter Jordanstr 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Jiricka-Purrer, A (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Peter Jordanstr 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",alexandra.jiricka@boku.ac.at,,"Brandenburg, Christiane/0000-0002-7221-1451",Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),This discussion note results from a special report on climate change and tourism funded by the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) pertaining to the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund.,,45,23,23,5,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-0780,2213-0799,,J OUTDOOR REC TOUR,J.

First, we investigate farmers' perception of and adaptation to climate change using content analysis and group information. The findings are then compared with climatic and agriculture information collected through secondary sources. Results suggest that though farmers are aware of long-term changes in climatic factors (temperature and rainfall, for example), they are unable to identify these changes as climate change. Farmers are also aware of risks generated by climate variability and extreme climatic events. However, farmers are not taking concrete steps in dealing with perceived climatic changes, although we find out that farmers are changing their agricultural and farming practices. These included changing sowing and harvesting timing, cultivation of crops of short duration varieties, inter-cropping, changing cropping pattern, investment in irrigation, and agroforestry. Note that these changes may be considered as passive response or adaptation strategies to climate change. Perhaps farmers are implicitly taking initiatives to adapt climate change.

Economically, socially and culturally deprived groups are more vulnerable to climate change impacts. Women comprise the majority among these vulnerable groups, and it is, therefore, crucial to stress gendered perspectives in climate change adaptation strategies that promote gender equality and sustainable development. To that end, this paper documents the adaptation strategies employed by farmers and examines gender differences in climate change adaptation practices in Yunnan Province, China. A random sampling technique was used to select 1520 household heads for the survey. We used descriptive statistics and a multivariate probit model to document four categories of adaptation measures against a set of household features, social network, financial assets and perception variables. We discovered that female and male respondents do not significantly differ in their knowledge and perceptions of climate change, but female- and male-headed household respondents did differ in adopting climate change adaptation measures. The adaptation measures of female- and male-headed households were influenced by different sets of factors. The most significant determinant for both female- and male-headed households was perception of drought events in the last 20 years, followed by access to loans, while income from non-farm-based work had positive and significant impacts only for male-headed households. Findings from this study will help to elucidate the determinants of climate change adaptation decisions for female- and male-headed households in farming communities and the strategic interventions necessary for effective adaptation.","[Sujakhu, Nani Maiya; He, Jun] Yunnan Univ, Natl Ctr Borderland Ethn Studies Southwest China, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Sujakhu, Nani Maiya; Ranjitkar, Sailesh] N Gene Solut Nat Innovat, Kathmandu 44614, Nepal; [Sujakhu, Nani Maiya; Ranjitkar, Sailesh; Su, Yufang; Xu, Jianchu] Kunming Inst Bot, Honghe Ctr Mt Futures, Kunming 654400, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Ranjitkar, Sailesh] Lumbini Buddhist Univ, Sch Dev Studies & Appl Sci, Lumbini, Nepal; [Su, Yufang] Yunnan Acad Social Sci, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jianchu] World Agroforestry, CIFOR ICRAF China Program, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Yunnan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS","Sujakhu, NM (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Natl Ctr Borderland Ethn Studies Southwest China, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Sujakhu, NM (corresponding author), Kunming Inst Bot, Honghe Ctr Mt Futures, Kunming 654400, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",nanu.sujakhu@gmail.com,"Ranjitkar, Sailesh/I-9307-2014","Ranjitkar, Sailesh/0000-0002-4741-3975",,,,,63,0,0,6,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,JAN 2,2023,28,1,,,,,117,133,,10.1080/13549839.2022.2130883,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2022.2130883,,OCT 2022,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,7M3KB,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000866073800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Through collaborative research centred on climate adaptation planning with the Yuibera and Koinmerburra Traditional Owner groups on the Great Barrier Reef catchments, we demonstrate that Traditional Owners' primary concerns are in aligning the climate adaptation opportunity with their own strategies for Indigenous cultural renewal and survival. Their Indigenous identity generates a responsibility to protect cultural landscapes, sites, and their connections with these places. In this case study, to protect what is left of Indigenous material culture and socio-cultural relationships emerged as the best approach to climate adaptation planning, providing both the decolonisation narrative and the means to strengthen their Indigenous practices. Planning for climate change adaptation is useful for Indigenous peoples when it supports decolonising, strengthens Indigenous customary practices, and recognises customary governance.","[Lyons, Ilisapeci; Hill, Rosemary] CSIRO, Land & Water, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Deshong, Samarla] Koinmerburra Aboriginal Corp, Mackay, Qld, Australia; [Mooney, Gary] Yuibera Aboriginal Corp, Mackay, Qld, Australia; [Turpin, Gerry] Dept Sci Informat Technol & Innovat, Cairns, Qld, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Lyons, I (corresponding author), CSIRO, Land & Water, Cairns, Qld, Australia.",ilisapeci.lyons@csiro.au,"Hill, Rosemary/A-6954-2011; Lyons, Ilisapeci L/I-3085-2013","Hill, Rosemary/0000-0002-7426-3132; Turpin, GERALD/0000-0002-5663-2133",Australian Government of the Clean Energy Future Plan program,Australian Government of the Clean Energy Future Plan program(Australian Government),We acknowledge the Australian Government funding of the Clean Energy Future Plan program.,,50,9,9,6,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1745-5863,1745-5871,,GEOGR RES-AUST,Geogr.

One of the central methodological questions, which remain unanswered in climate change adaptation research, is exactly how public policy can learn from highly contextual experiences of community-based adaptation and what role should be played by case study research. In this paper we undertake a comparison between three large research projects in Sweden, Canada and Indonesia, which aim to study and/or foster local adaptation in selected case studies through a process of social learning. We present a novel framework based on mapping of 'sense-making perspectives', which enables analysis of the multiple ways case study research can support local climate adaptation and link such efforts to higher level public policy. The analysis demonstrates how methodological choices shape how case study research works at the interface between planned (steered/regulatory policy) and self-organised adaptation of stakeholders (non-coercive policy). In this regard, there is a need for a high degree of transparency from the research community to enable local professionals to decide on their stakes and interests when inviting researchers into their grounded activities. We conclude that case study research can achieve new significance if viewed as a platform to leverage stakeholder competencies when informing existing social structures and enable the implementation of political objectives, but equally driving the very reinvention and improvement of these institutions.

In high-income societies, adaptation at the household level then frequently refers to adopting technological fixes distributed through the market, sometimes at a considerable cost. Informed by a study in the context of Central Europe, this article aims to discuss different practices of households and individuals that do not require increased consumption of energy or materials, but still help adapting to climate change in some of its local expressions, such as heatwaves and drought. They were described by participants in focus groups in six cities in the Czech Republic. I argue that such 'inconspicuous adaptations' emerge without connection to the climate change debate, or without deeper knowledge about the issue.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation contends that, to adapt, both 'modern' and Indigenous agricultural practices and knowledge are needed. A challenge lies in combining agricultural knowledge systems and enabling adaptive knowledge to be shared amongst Pacific Islanders. Opportunities to integrate different types of agricultural knowledge (including 'modern' and Indigenous) are needed. This paper argues that international labour mobility programmes provide an avenue for knowledge exchange that can support climate change adaptation in agriculture. It presents empirical evidence from research with 33 Pacific Islanders who grow crops in their home countries and were employed in Australia's Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP). We demonstrate how SWP participation opened new possibilities for climate change adaptation in agriculture in the Pacific Islands. Adaptive knowledge stems from SWP workers' exposure to different agricul-tural skills and ideas in Australia, combined with their knowledge and experience of crop production in their countries of origin. SWP participation created opportunities for workers to draw on different agricultural skills and knowledge on return to the Pacific Islands. The ability for SWP workers to then exchange adaptive knowledge with other Pacific Islanders is enabled by their social relationships, the likes of which an official agricultural extension officer might not have to the same degree. So far, such adaptive agricultural knowledge and skills exchanges are serendipitous. There is scope to explicitly build climate change knowledge exchange into agriculture-focused international labour mobility schemes.","[Dun, Olivia; Klocker, Natascha] Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Dun, Olivia; Farbotko, Carol; McMichael, Celia] Univ Melbourne, Fac Sci, Sch Geog Earth & Atmospher Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Dun, Olivia] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Dun, Olivia] Univ Wollongong, Australian Ctr Culture Environm Soc & Space ACCESS, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong; University of Melbourne; University of Queensland; University of Wollongong,"Dun, O (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Australian Ctr Culture Environm Soc & Space ACCESS, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",odun@uow.edu.au; natascha_klocker@uow.edu.au; Carol.Farbotko@unimelb.edu.au; celia.mcmichael@unimelb.edu.au,"Farbotko, Carol/K-2592-2014","Farbotko, Carol/0000-0001-8257-2085","Australian Research Council (ARC) [LP170101136, DP140101165]; University of Melbourne; Australian Research Council [LP170101136] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); University of Melbourne(University of Melbourne); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The research reported on in this article is funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Project 'Transformative human mobilities in a changing climate' (LP170101136), ARC Discovery Project 'Sustainability and climate change adaptation: unlocking the potential of ethnic diversity' (DP140101165), and The University of Melbourne.",,164,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

The decisions on how to assess such adaptation options involve qualitative evaluations that rely on subjective judgements, which results in data uncertainty. We propose a Monte-Carlo simulation-based method to provide robust analysis against the data uncertainty. The proposed method is applied to a case study in which 11 adaptation options in water sector are evaluated.

Sea level rise, ocean warming and acidification, and increased storminess threaten to alter or intensify biophysical coastal changes. Communities respond in ways that neither maximize total economic value nor apply the appropriate spatial scale of policy response. Focusing on coastline change, particularly in North Carolina, we synthesize modeling approaches and empirical studies to identify research that is needed to support coastal climate adaptation policy. Modeling coastlines as coupled human-natural systems explains historical patterns of coastline change, clarifies the need for empirical estimates, and provides a roadmap for interdisciplinary policy analysis. Despite the extensive literature on coastal amenities, hazards, and ex post policy evaluation, more empirical information is needed to parameterize coupled models of complex coastal environments facing climate change. Extending coupled models of coastal adaptation to incorporate spatial dynamics and market and nonmarket values highlights fundamental problems with current governance structures. We conclude that to maximize total economic value in the coastal zone, adaptation will require governance coordination across multiple levels, attention to intensive and extensive margins of adaptation, and trade-offs across market and nonmarket values. These findings echo recent advances in fisheries bioeconomics.","[Gopalakrishnan, Sathya] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Landry, Craig E.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 301 Conner Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Duke University,"Gopalakrishnan, S (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",gopalakrishnan.27@osu.edu; clandry@uga.edu; marsmith@duke.edu,"Gopalakrishnan, Sathya/K-4079-2012","Gopalakrishnan, Sathya/0000-0002-3593-0297","National Science Foundation Environment, Society, and the Economy [EAR 0951802]","National Science Foundation Environment, Society, and the Economy","Funding for S.

Limited knowledge about uncertainty has prompted this empirical investigation of forest planners' understanding of uncertainty related to its recognition, its management and risk perception. We used a comprehensive uncertainty framework to address and test these uncertainties, with data from an online survey, to identify the views of 33 forest planners through Britain. Responses were analysed using non-parametric tests. The results showed that planners have significantly different views on uncertainty among economic, social and climatic categories. Uncertainty in the climatic category was more acutely perceived than in the economic and social categories. Planners preferred to practice active uncertainty management, as the results suggest they feel more able to manage uncertainty in forest models and their outcomes. Forest planners also indicated diverse perceptions of salient risks of change over the next 30 years. The results show they may take action only to pests, drought and wind risks posing a threat to forests even though they perceived these risks potentially to be highly regulated and controlled by forestry policies. The findings provide a better understanding of uncertainty as a source of inertia to climate change adaptation in forestry, identify new research objectives and support the development of forestry policies for climate change adaptation.

There were significantly differing levels of concern about weather and climate-related impacts between the two types of organisations. Mining company respondents reported lower levels of severity of impact from both past and (expected) future weather events, as well as lower levels of belief in climate change and of adaptation activities to prepare for it. Interestingly, mining companies generally reported less concern about future impacts than those experienced in the past, suggesting discounting of risks due to climate change scepticism.

Some of the main objectives of this study included the: (1) determination of whether the current perception is in line with the observed climatic changes at the local scale, and (2) identification of the typology of these farmers, together with those factors that affect both skepticism and acceptance of climate change. This study provided an important first step in the objective validation of local farmers' perceptions of climate change, as well as in the development of a comprehensive understanding of their attitude, beliefs, willingness and capacity to adjust their practices in response to climate change. The results pointed to several important conclusions that can be used to inform research, outreach strategies and policy formulation, targeting the Gozitan farming sector to adapt to climate change without delay.

A broad-based survey was conducted which included data from 119 organic and 305 conventional farmers in Germany. Most of the farmers surveyed recognized the existence of climatic changes and their negative impacts on cereal production. Given this context, the choice of climate-adapted varieties was very important to the majority of respondents. The farmers ranked eco-stability, grain yield performance and steadiness as the most crucial varietal requirements. For cereals, farmers perceived that a higher eco-stability was most important compared to other variety types. The selection of varieties with high and eco-stable yields levels should be given increased consideration, with their use likely to improve overall cereal yields and reduced plant production risks due to climate change.","[Macholdt, Janna; Honermeier, Bernd] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Agron & Plant Breeding 1, Biomed Res Ctr Seltersberg, Schuberstr 81, D-35392 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Macholdt, J (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Agron & Plant Breeding 1, Biomed Res Ctr Seltersberg, Schuberstr 81, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.",janna.c.macholdt@agrar.uni-giessen.de,"Honermeier, Bernd/AAN-3032-2020; Macholdt, Janna/AAK-5953-2020; Macholdt, Janna/AAF-3540-2021","Macholdt, Janna/0000-0001-9703-8109",,,,,28,3,3,0,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0030-7270,2043-6866,,OUTLOOK AGR,Outlook Agric.,SEP,2017,46,3,,,,,178,184,,10.1177/0030727017722420,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0030727017722420,,,7,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,FH2SY,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000410993700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The two main issues for climate change adaptation are sea level rise and the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These issues are considered in the paper. It considers the risks to existing transport infrastructure and the resulting considerations necessary in planning new infrastructure, transport systems operations under changing climatic conditions, and potential changes in travel behaviour. The use and capability of regional rural networks in emergency evacuation planning emerges as one particular area for further research. More generally, recognition of the risks associated with climate change is required for better planning of new infrastructure and mitigating potential damage to existing infrastructure. Climate change poses a significant risk to infrastructure and its owners, managers and operators. There is a need to undertake research into the likely impacts of climate change on Australia's transport infrastructure, establish the categories of infrastructure most at risk and outline opportunities for adaptation responses, and examine the current governance structures. Then the administrative, legal and other issues that may impact on climate change adaptation can be identified.","[Taylor, Michael A.

There is also growing evidence for links between climate change and disaster risks. In response, there have been calls for bringing together climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) policy development, in order to address the risks efficiently and to promote sustainable development pathways. However, progress toward such convergence in the policy arena has been uneven. We report on a group of six research projects awarded in three countries of South Asia to examine progress, research needs and potential mechanisms for improving implementation of CCA and DRR. Some significant localized improvements in CCA-DRR were generated, primarily through facilitating communication across administrative scales and with local communities. We observed a common tendency toward weak institutional coordination between agencies charged with disaster response and those charged with climate change planning (as well as development planning more broadly). The idea that sustainable development requires addressing combined natural and anthropogenic hazards does not yet appear to have penetrated to the institutional levels where disaster response planning commonly takes place. We close by identifying further knowledge needs and proposing recommendations for steps toward convergence of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.","[Seidler, Reinmar; Bawa, Kamaljit S.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Dietrich, Katie; Schweizer, Sarah] START Int Inc, 2000 Florida Ave NW Suite 200, Washington, DC 20008 USA; [Chopde, Shashikant] Inst Social & Environm Transit, 948 North St 7, Boulder, CO 80304 USA; [Zaman, Farrukh] World Wide Fund Nat Pakistan, PECHS, 46-K,Block 6, Karachi, Pakistan; [Sharma, Anshu] SEEDS Tech Serv, 15-A Inst Area, New Delhi, India; [Bhattacharya, Sumana] Intercooperat Social Dev India, Delhi Off, ISS Bldg 8,Nelson Mandela Marg, New Delhi 110070, India; [Devkota, Laxmi P.] Nepal Dev Res Inst, Lalitpur 8975,EPC 2201, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Khaling, Sarala] Ashoka Trust Res Ecol & Environm, Dev Area, Gangtok 737101, Sikkim, India",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Seidler, R (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",reinmar.seidler@gmail.com; kdietrich@start.org; sschweizer@start.org; kamal.bawa@gmail.com; schopde@i-s-e-t.org; fzaman@wwf.org.pk; anshu@saferworld.in; sumana.bhattacharya@intercooperation.org.in; lpdevkota@ndri.org.np; sarala.khaling@atree.org,"Chopde, Shashikant/AAM-5805-2020","Devkota, Dr Laxmi Prasad/0000-0003-4092-4307",UK Department for International Development (DFID) [RSAS-0013]; START International Inc.,UK Department for International Development (DFID); START International Inc.,This paper is an output from projects funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) for the benefit of developing countries through the Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN Project RSAS-0013).

However, adaptation is being increasingly recognized as a necessary action to respond to changes in the climate as societies concurrently mitigate to minimize future anthropogenic climatic forcing. Environmental planners will play a leading role in assisting communities as they face the challenge of preparing for a changing and uncertain future. This research uses a self-assessment survey and workshop to provide a perspective of planner knowledge of climate change adaptation. It also explores climate impacts in communities across the province of British Columbia, Canada, and barriers to effective adaptation. The results indicate that planners do not have a high level of knowledge regarding climate change adaptation. The top impacts that planners believe will affect British Columbia are related to forests, agriculture and river flooding. Planners want adaptation incorporated into existing documents (such as community, regional and provincial plans) rather than separate adaptation plans.

Yet it left several gaps with regards to the impacts, implications and responses to climate change in small island developing states (SIDS). SIDS are recognized as a special grouping of developing countries. Located in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, Caribbean, and Pacific regions, they comprise 58 countries that are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change and its impacts. With adaptation to climate change viewed as a viable and necessary complement to mitigation, academic interest in adaptation in these complex geographies is increasing. Despite this, not enough is known about the body of knowledge relating to adaptation in SIDS. This article systematically reviews 208 articles, books, book chapters, conference papers, and notes, and synthesizes the nature and extent of the research evidence before and after AR5 (i.e., from 1990 to 2014, and from 2015 to 2018). It specifically explores shifts in (a) when, where and by what means knowledge is being produced (e.g., subject areas, methodologies), and the ways in which adaptation is being framed (i.e., conceptually, operationally), (b) the narratives, consensuses, and tensions across the key emerging themes in the literature, and (c) the knowledge gaps that exist. It also outlines a future research agenda, which is an important consideration not only for multi-scale actors working to help solve the global climate challenge, but also for the scholars preparing the Small Islands Chapter of the Sixth Assessment Report due in 2021.

This paper proposes that indigenous people have developed and actively maintained resilience strategies, encoded in social practices and farming techniques, designed out of long experience with climatic variability. Through case studies, indigenous resilience strategies are explored, with emphasis on the anarchistic, improvisational nature of traditional ecological knowledge.

This goal is usually approached from the perspective of increasingly universal adaptation methodologies, tools and services that are grounded in Western scientific thought and knowledge. Questions of (in-)justices and new or reproduced vulnerabilities play a marginal role in adaptation interventions. In this paper, we argue that a failure to acknowledge, let alone address, the intricate linkages between knowledge and power risks creating fundamental injustices as part of well-intended adaptation processes and their outcomes. Using the Kiribati Adaptation Project (KAP) as a case study, we examine how knowledge hegemonies lead to unsatisfactory adaptation processes and outcomes when viewed from a justice perspective. Environmental justice lenses provide a useful framework for applying distributional, procedural and epistemic notions of injustice to tackle and interrogate the knowledge-power relations, which we identify as a profound part of adaptation interventions.","[Klepp, Silja; Fuenfgeld, Hartmut] Univ Kiel, Dept Geog, Social Dynam Coastal & Marine Areas, Kiel, Germany; [Fuenfgeld, Hartmut] Freiburg Univ, Dept Geog, Geog Global Change, Freiburg, Germany",University of Kiel; University of Freiburg,"Klepp, S (corresponding author), Ludewig Meyn Str 8, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",klepp@geographie.uni-kiel.de,"Funfgeld, Hartmut/C-5962-2011","Funfgeld, Hartmut/0000-0003-0359-8207; Klepp, Silja/0000-0001-9837-362X",,,,,94,2,2,6,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Previous studies contend that conflicting priorities, insufficient institutional incentives and knowledge of risks, and inadequate resources all impede local climate adaptation. Though the importance of local political support in enabling climate adaptation is widely acknowledged, the views of local politicians have rarely been analysed. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with local politicians in Sweden, we explore what affects their engagement in climate adaptation. The study claims that climate adaptation contrary to mitigation is not viewed as political beyond directing attention and sanctioning guidelines set by officials. A limited number of interviewees claim a more strategic political role in adaptation. The combined effect of institutional incentives (e.g. fragmented national guidelines, unappealing goals, and lack of funding), relative weight in local politics, and ability to exercise political leadership (e.g. campaign value, public and media pressure, and lack of ideology) is perceived as too insignificant to trigger strong political engagement.

Methods: We reviewed the literature on the impact of climate change on health. The proposals for adaptation to climate change identified in the framework of the European project coordinated by the WHO/Europe on Climate, Environment and Health action plans and information systems were analyzed. Results: The effects of climate change on health include: 1) an increase in the impacts of extreme weather events; 2) an increase of the frequency of respiratory diseases due to changes in air quality and pollen distribution; 3) an increase in the incidence of food-borne, zoonotic and waterborne diseases; and 4) a change in the distribution of infectious diseases and/or their vectors. In Spain, the morbidity and mortality due to heat waves are expected to increase. The main impact related to atmospheric contamination is a predicted increase in fine particles and ozone. There is also a risk of an increase in the geographical distribution of vector borne diseases that are already established in Spain or the establishment of new subtropical vectors. Spain is one of the first European countries to have developed a climate change adaptation plan. This plan provides a framework for coordination among public institutions on activities to evaluate the impacts of climate change, as well as vulnerability and adaptation to this phenomenon, and makes reference to the health sector. Conclusions: Policy options to reduce the impacts of climate change on health include: 1) integrating health in all policies, strategies and interventions to mitigate and adapt to climate change; 2) strengthening health systems and public health systems to improve their ability to prevent, prepare and respond to the impacts of climate change; 3) raising awareness among all sectors to promote the co-benefits to health of adaptation and mitigation strategies; and 4) promoting research, technological development, data sharing and information exchange across sectors.

Using social-cognitive theory, we examine how three forms of environmental concern egoistic (e.g., concern for oneself; one's health or life), social-altruistic (e.g., concern for others; future generations or country), and biospheric (e.g., concern for plants and animals; nature) influence concurrent ecological stress and ecological coping strategies. Further, we examine how ecological stress and coping are associated with both depressive symptoms and pro-environmental behaviors. In an online survey of 342 U.S. adults we found unique patterns of the three forms of environmental concern. Only individuals higher in biospheric environmental concern perceived ecological stress and engaged in ecological coping. In contrast, individuals higher in social-altruistic concern did not perceive ecological stress, but did engage in ecological coping. Those higher in egoistic concern neither perceived ecological stress, nor engaged in coping. In addition, perceived ecological stress was positively associated with depressive symptoms; ecological coping negatively predicted depressive symptoms, while positively predicting pro-environmental behaviors. In sum, with the exception of those high in biospheric concern, study participants did not seem to perceive climate change threats as having a profound effect on their own or their family's life. Differentiating three forms of environmental concern provides a nuanced view on their association with ecological stress and coping, and in turn depressive symptoms and pro-environmental behaviors. Results indicate that current public policy approaches that often focus on the natural environment when depicting or explaining the effects of climate change, may limit the effectiveness of interventions to those people who already show high concern for all living creatures, while failing to affect those motivated by egoistic or altruistic concern, increasing the risks associated with delaying climate change adaptation and the potential for large-scale negative mental health effects in our society.","[Helm, Sabrina V.; Barnett, Melissa A.; Curran, Melissa A.; Craig, Zelieann R.] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA; [Pollitt, Amanda] Univ Texas Austin, Populat Res Ctr, 305 E 23rd St, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Arizona; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Helm, SV (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Retailing & Consumer Sci, POB 210078, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",helm@email.arizona.edu,"Pollitt, Amanda M./I-8141-2019","Pollitt, Amanda M./0000-0001-5428-2283; Curran, Melissa/0000-0002-2652-6030; Craig, Zelieann/0000-0002-9886-416X; Barnett, Melissa/0000-0002-8182-4620",,,,,70,86,87,6,42,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

An understanding of the social dimension profoundly shapes the way in which policy-makers develop adaptation policies. This paper investigates the influence of components of social capital on the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies using data from rural households in Ethiopia. First, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the dataset of components of social capital to construct composite indicators for measuring farmers' social capital. Second, the logit model was employed to investigate the influence of components of social capital on adopting climate change adaptation strategies. The results suggest that institutional trust positively influences climate change adaptation decisions. On the contrary, bonding social capital negatively affects the adoption decision. The following implications are worthy of consideration for improving farmers' adoption of adaptation strategies: improving the institutions' communication and sharing of information with farmers and investing in programmes that build links across groups in communities and up to those in authority.","[Belay, Daniel] Ambo Univ, Dept Econ, Ambo, Ethiopia; [Fekadu, Gutema] Madda Walabu Univ, Dept Econ, Bale Robe, Ethiopia",Ambo University,"Belay, D (corresponding author), Ambo Univ, Dept Econ, Ambo, Ethiopia.",danbelay@gmail.com,,"Belay, Daniel/0000-0003-0755-1123",,,,,46,5,5,2,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Most of these discussions deal with the distribution of responsibility for climate change mitigation at the international level. The aim of this paper is to investigate if and how these principles can be used to inform the search for a fair distribution of responsibility for climate change adaptation on the local level. We found that the most influential distribution principles on the international level were in turn built on one or more of seven basic principles: (P1) equal shares, (P2) desert, (P3) beneficiary pays, (P4) ability, (P5) self-help, (P6) limited responsibility for the worst off, and (P7) status quo preservation. It was found that all the basic principles, but P1, P3, and P7, are to some extent translatable to local climate adaptation. Two major problems hamper their usefulness on the local level: (1) several categories of agents need to take on responsibility; and (2) emissions do not work as a base for all principles. P4, P5, and P6 are applicable to local adaptation without changes. P4 is of particular importance as it seems to solve the first problem. P2 is applicable only if the second problem is solved, which can be achieved by using risk of harm instead of emissions as the basis for desert.","[Persson, Erik] Lund Univ, Dept Philosophy, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Eriksson, Kerstin] RISE Res Inst Sweden, SE-22370 Lund, Sweden; [Knaggard, Asa] Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; RISE Research Institutes of Sweden; Lund University,"Persson, E (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Philosophy, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",erik.persson@fil.lu.se; kerstin.eriksson@ri.se; asa.knaggard@svet.lu.se,,"Persson, Erik/0000-0002-5000-948X; Eriksson, Kerstin/0000-0002-0494-0089","FORMAS (Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning) [FR-2018/0006]","FORMAS (Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning)","The project was supported by a grant from FORMAS (Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning), grant number FR-2018/0006.",,61,2,2,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2409-9287,,PHILOSOPHIES,Philosophies,SEP,2021,6,3,,,,,,,68,10.3390/philosophies6030068,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/philosophies6030068,,,16,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,UY5TK,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000701585800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Social capital is important for climate change adaptation, but institutions and social networks at multiple scales (e.g., household, community, and institution) have been overlooked in studying agricultural climate change adaptation. We combine data from 13 sites in 11 low-income countries in East Africa, West Africa, and South Asia to explore how multiple scales of social capital relate to household food security outcomes among smallholder farmers. Using social network theory, we define three community organizational social network types (fragmented defined by lack of coordination, brokered defined as having a strong central actor, or shared defined by high coordination) and examine household social capital through group memberships. We find community and household social capital are positively related, with higher household group membership more likely in brokered and shared networks. Household group membership is associated with more than a 10% reduction in average months of food insecurity, an effect moderated by community social network type. In communities with fragmented and shared organizational networks, additional household group memberships is associated with consistent decreases in food insecurity, in some cases up to two months; whereas in brokered networks, reductions in food insecurity are only associated with membership in credit groups. These effects are confirmed by hierarchical random effects models, which control for demographic factors. This suggests that multiple scales of social capital-both within and outside the household-are correlated with household food security. This social capital may both be bridging (across groups) and bonding (within groups) with different implications for how social capital structure affects food security. Efforts to improve food security could recognize the potential for both household and community level social networks and collaboration, which further research can capture by analyzing multiple scales of social capital data.","[Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Food Sci & Food Syst Program, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT USA; [Rudnick, Jessica; Lubell, Mark] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Cramer, Laura] Alliance Biovers Int & Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of California System; University of California Davis; CGIAR,"Niles, MT (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Food Sci & Food Syst Program, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",mtniles@uvm.edu,"Cramer, Laura/R-6499-2019","Cramer, Laura/0000-0003-1559-3497",CCAFS; University of California Davis; University of Vermont,CCAFS; University of California Davis(University of California System); University of Vermont,"We thank CCAFS, the University of Vermont, and the University of California Davis for their support funding the personnel on this project.",,76,6,6,3,12,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

Many were originally designed to protect agricultural land, yet now protect valuable infrastructure. The purpose of this project was to develop a comprehensive digital atlas incorporating historical plans, shore protection, coastal geomorphology and LiDAR to serve as a basis for climate change adaptation planning in the Bay of Fundy. 110 paper plans were scanned, geo-referenced and features such as current and historical dykes, aboiteaux (tide gates), armouring, ditches, creeks, property boundaries, foreshore marsh, and geodetic elevations were digitized using ArcGIS. Attributes included age of structure, material, dimensions, and ownership. Dyke elevations were surveyed using an RTK GPS, and individual sections were identified as being vulnerable to storm surge and sea level rise. Erosion rates and width of foreshore marsh were calculated per dyke segment. At present, 55% of dykes within Nova Scotia are within 0.5 m of critical elevations established in the 1960s, 2% are more than 0.5 m below critical and all are below the predicted rates of SLR by 2055. There is also a strong relationship between the placement of armouring along the dyke toe and foreshore erosion.

In addition, the lack of downscaled, or local, climate information makes it very difficult to compare how individual communities and households adapt to severe and extreme weather events and, more importantly, what actions local governments can carry out to increase resilience in poor urban areas. Based on a conceptual and operational framework developed in recent years by the authors in collaboration with partners in the global South, this paper illustrates how bottom-up community asset planning for climate change adaptation can help to address this gap and be mainstreamed into top-down citywide strategic and operational planning. The paper describes the process by which community members and representatives of local government, the private sector and NGOs working in the city of Cartagena, Colombia, set up a dialogue space that enables them to identify, negotiate and agree climate change adaptation solutions that are legally, financially, socially and technically feasible.","[Stein, Alfredo] Univ Manchester, GURC, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Moser, Caroline] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Moser, Caroline] GURC, Austin, TX USA; [Moser, Caroline] UCL, Dev Planning Unit, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Moser, Caroline] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Moser, Caroline] World Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Moser, Caroline] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Manchester; University of Manchester; University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; The World Bank; Brookings Institution,"Stein, A (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, GURC, HBS Room 1-23,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",alfredo.stein@manchester.ac.uk; cmoser@carolinemoser.co.uk,"Stein, Alfredo/P-7515-2019","Stein Heinemann, Alfredo/0000-0001-5952-8262",,,,,20,17,19,1,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

Addressing this deficit (and building the institutional and financial capacity to do so) is also important for building resilience to climate change impacts. Eighty per cent of the city's population lives in informal settlements, but there is little effective land use management and a number of these settlements are on sites that flood regularly. Climate change impacts include sea level rise, rising temperatures and increased occurrence of extreme weather, including rainstorms and droughts, all of which present challenges to city and municipal governments that are struggling to reduce the development deficit.

This article applies components of the framework developed by Moser and Ekstrom (2010) onto empirical qualitative data to diagnose institutional barriers to climate change adaptation in the Municipality of Beirut, Lebanon. Our approach reveals the presence of two vicious cycles influencing each other. In the first cycle, the root cause barrier is major political interference generating competing priorities and poor individual interest in climate change. A second vicious cycle is derived from feedbacks caused by the first and leading to the absence of a dedicated department where sector specific climate risk information is gathered and shared with other departments, limited knowledge and scientific understanding, as well as a distorted framing or vision, where climate change is considered unrelated to other issues and is to be dealt with at higher levels of government. The article also highlights the need to analyze interlinkages between barriers in order to suggest how to overcome them. The most common way to overcome barriers according to interviewees is through national and international support followed by the creation of a data bank. These opportunities could be explored by national and international policy-makers to break the deadlock in Beirut.","[Zea-Reyes, Leonardo] Imperial Coll London, Fac Nat Sci, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England; [Zea-Reyes, Leonardo] Conclave Consultora, Res Area, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico; [Olivotto, Veronica] New Sch, Milano Sch Policy Management & Environm, New York, NY USA; [Olivotto, Veronica] New Sch, Urban Syst Lab, New York, NY USA; [Bergh, Sylvia I.] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands; [Bergh, Sylvia I.] The Hague Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Expertise Global Governance, The Hague, Netherlands",Imperial College London; The New School; The New School; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Bergh, SI (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands.;Bergh, SI (corresponding author), The Hague Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Expertise Global Governance, The Hague, Netherlands.",bergh@iss.nl,,"Olivotto, Veronica/0000-0002-7289-1100; Bergh, Sylvia I./0000-0002-0651-6732; Zea-Reyes, Leonardo/0000-0002-6635-2098",National Council for Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACYT); Bank of Mexico through the Fondo para el Desarrollo de Recursos Humanos (FIDERH),National Council for Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Bank of Mexico through the Fondo para el Desarrollo de Recursos Humanos (FIDERH),"The authors wish to thank the following individuals and institutions for their support and cooperation: our interviewees, the National Council for Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACYT), the Bank of Mexico through the Fondo para el Desarrollo de Recursos Humanos (FIDERH), Ghaleb Faour, Line Rajab, Hala Abi Saad and Leonardo Zea Choy.",,92,2,2,2,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

This is particularly so for Nepal where the agriculture sector - the mainstay of the country's economy - is highly vulnerable to climate change. As a country that loses much from climate change, local communities here have been adapting to climate change impacts using localized knowledge and practices. However, few studies have systematically reviewed the adaptation strategies of Nepalese farmers. We conduct such a review using the RepOrting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) guidelines. The relevant literature is retrieved using Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. The adaptation strategies of the Nepalese farmers are broadly categorized under seven themes and twenty-nine sub-themes: (a) access to financial resources and risk transfer; (b) diversification of livelihoods, income sources and agricultural practices; (c) spatial adaptation; (d) climate smart agriculture; (e) common pooling of resources and social action; (f) traditional and local knowledge; and (g) food and water storage and security. Diversification of livelihoods, income sources and agricultural practices are the most common adaptation strategies employed. All the strategies practiced are autonomous, have a short term orientation and reactive in nature rather than being sustainable and proactive. The outputs of this study explore the significance of the local adaptation strategies and to what extent they should be integrated into the mainstream of national and local level development plans. These findings of Nepal - are relevant to neighbouring countries such as Bhutan, Bangladesh and India. Key policy insights This study finds that locally practiced adaptation strategies have a short term and reactive focus rather than being sustainable and proactive solutions. Farmers are confronting weak institutions and financial and managerial difficulties in coping with climate change and adapting to its impacts; hence, local-level adaptation strategies alone cannot cope with the harsh impacts of climate change. The research findings indicate the urgency and need to integrate or mainstream local adaptation strategies into national and local level development planning to strengthen adaptation practice and make it sustainable.","[Rijal, Sushila] Prince Songkla Univ, Dept Environm Management, Hat Yai, Thailand; [Gentle, Popular] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW, Australia; [Khanal, Uttam] Agr Victoria, Dept Jobs Precincts & Reg, Horsham, Vic, Australia; [Wilson, Clevo] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Rimal, Bhagawat] Tribhuvan Univ, Coll Appl Sci, CAS Nepal, Kathmandu, Nepal",Prince of Songkla University; Charles Sturt University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Tribhuvan University,"Rijal, S (corresponding author), Prince Songkla Univ, Dept Environm Management, Hat Yai, Thailand.",sushilarijal2001@gmail.com,,"Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495",,,,,93,7,7,7,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Urban green infrastructure has emerged as an important tool for climate change adaptation and resilience given their capacity to provide ecosystem services such as local temperature regulation, stormwater mitigation, and air purification. However, realizing the benefits of ecosystem services for climate adaptation depend on where they are locally supplied. Few studies have examined the potential spatial mismatches in supply and demand of urban ecosystem services, and even fewer have examined supply-demand mismatches as a potential environmental justice issue, such as when supply-demand mismatches disproportionately overlap with certain socio-demographic groups. We spatially analyzed demand for ecosystem services relevant for climate change adaptation and combined results with recent analysis of the supply of ecosystem services in New York City (NYC). By quantifying the relative mismatch between supply and demand of ecosystem services across the city we were able to identify spatial hot- and coldspots of supply-demand mismatch. Hotspots are spatial clusters of census blocks with a higher mismatch and coldspots are clusters with lower mismatch values than their surrounding blocks. The distribution of mismatch hot- and coldspots was then compared to the spatial distribution of socio-demographic groups. Results reveal distributional environmental injustice of access to the climate-regulating benefits of ecosystem services provided by urban green infrastructure in NYC. Analyses show that areas with lower supply-demand mismatch tend to be populated by a larger proportion of white residents with higher median incomes, and areas with high mismatch values have lower incomes and a higher proportion of people of color. We suggest that urban policy and planning should ensure that investments in nature-based solutions such as through urban green infrastructure for climate change adaptation do not reinforce or exacerbate potentially existing environmental injustices.","[Herreros-Cantis, Pablo; McPhearson, Timon] New Sch, Urban Syst Lab, 79 5th Ave 16, New York, NY 10003 USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Box AB, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-11419 Stockholm, Sweden",The New School; Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies; Stockholm University,"Herreros-Cantis, P (corresponding author), New Sch, Urban Syst Lab, 79 5th Ave 16, New York, NY 10003 USA.",herrerop@newschool.edu,,"McPhearson, Timon/0000-0002-9499-0791; Herreros Cantis, Pablo/0000-0002-2278-0648","U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Urban Resilience to Extreme Weather-Related Events Sustainability Research Network [1444755]; U.S. NSF Accel-Net program NATURA [1927167]; U.S. NSF Convergence program [1934933]; BiodivERsA COFUND; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences, and Spatial Planning; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; German Aerospace Center; National Science Centre; Research Council of Norway; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; SMARTer Greener Cities project through the Nordforsk Sustainable Urban Development and Smart Cities grant program","U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Urban Resilience to Extreme Weather-Related Events Sustainability Research Network(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. NSF Accel-Net program NATURA; U.S. NSF Convergence program; BiodivERsA COFUND; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences, and Spatial Planning(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; German Aerospace Center(Helmholtz AssociationGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR)); National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); SMARTer Greener Cities project through the Nordforsk Sustainable Urban Development and Smart Cities grant program","Research was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Urban Resilience to Extreme Weather-Related Events Sustainability Research Network (NSF grant SES 1444755), the U.S. NSF Accel-Net program NATURA (grant 1927167), and U.S. NSF Convergence program (grant 1934933).

The paper sets out a framework for analysing adaptation to the direct and indirect impacts of climate change in business organisations with new evidence presented from empirical research into adaptation in nine case-study companies. It argues that adaptation to climate change has many similarities with processes of organisational learning. The paper suggests that business organisations face a number of obstacles in learning how to adapt to climate change impacts, especially in relation to the weakness and ambiguity of signals about climate change and the uncertainty about benefits flowing from adaptation measures. Organisations rarely adapt 'autonomously', since their adaptive behaviour is influenced by policy and market conditions, and draws on resources external to the organisation. The paper identifies four adaptation strategies that pattern organisational adaptive behaviour.","Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Fac Earth & Life Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Sussex, SPRU, Sci & Technol Policy Res, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Inovat Studies Ctr, Tanaka Business Sch, London SW7 2AZ, England",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Sussex; Imperial College London,"Berkhout, F (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Fac Earth & Life Sci, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",frans.berkhout@ivm.vu.nl,"Berkhout, Frans/N-4196-2013","Berkhout, Frans/0000-0001-8668-0470; Gann, David/0000-0002-8245-3948",,,,,43,270,272,3,60,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Transformative adaptation, i.e. fundamental systems' changes that address root causes of vulnerability may be needed. However, we have a limited understanding of what transformative adaptation looks like in social-ecological systems and when it can be implemented. We applied an interdisciplinary perspective to describing social-ecological shifts driven by climate change. We reviewed 80 recent conceptual publications about responses of social, ecological, and social-ecological systems to climate change. Our review suggests that transformative adaptation is characterized as being restructuring, path-shifting, innovative, multiscale, systemwide, and persistent. Despite several barriers to implement transformative adaptation, policy makers and practitioners should consider this option in adaptation plans to help societies to anticipate, guide, or recover from radical climate change impact. Using transformative adaptation to navigate shifts driven by climate change can increase the efficiency and sustainability of climate solutions.","[Fedele, Giacomo; Donatti, Camila I.; Harvey, Celia A.; Hannah, Lee; Hole, David G.] Conservat Int HQ, Betty & Gordon Moore Ctr Sci, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Donatti, Camila I.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640China, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Donatti, Camila I.] Monteverde Inst, Monteverde Santa Elena, Puntarenas, Costa Rica; [Hannah, Lee] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Northern Arizona University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Fedele, G (corresponding author), Conservat Int HQ, Betty & Gordon Moore Ctr Sci, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",gfedele@conservation.org,"Donatti, Camila I./AAV-2324-2020; Fedele, Giacomo/AAP-4308-2020; Donatti, Camila/AAF-3605-2020","Harvey, Celia A./0000-0001-8015-703X","Ann and Tom Friedman Fellowship for Science at Conservation International, Arlington, VA","Ann and Tom Friedman Fellowship for Science at Conservation International, Arlington, VA","GF was supported by the Ann and Tom Friedman Fellowship for Science at Conservation International, Arlington, VA.",,108,104,104,7,49,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Increasingly the need to mainstream this adaptation into development planning, sectoral decision-making and policy making is being recognised. This paper explores the challenges faced in trying to mainstream climate change adaptation policy in the context of other priorities, specifically biodiversity conservation. By investigating the case study of recent efforts by Defra and the England Biodiversity Group to embed climate change adaptation principles into their biodiversity conservation work and the insights gained into the barriers faced, we propose specific strategies that may be employed to overcome these barriers and speculate about the transferability of the lessons into other policy contexts. Key barriers include uncertainty about the future of funding and climate change as a policy priority, organisational silos leading to insufficient communication of the relevance of adaptation to conservation, and legacy of policies that deliver sub-optimal outcomes in the event of a changing climate. ECosystem-based climate change adaptation and mitigation may serve to overcome some of these barriers by delivering on multiple priorities simultaneously, and embedding adaptation in job descriptions/standard operating procedures may help to build new modes of practice.

To comply with the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), hospitals should be on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Although hospitals contribute to climate change by emitting greenhouse gases, they are also affected by the health consequences of climate change. Despite all the guidance provided, hospitals need more radical measures to confront climate change. The current study was carried out to examine the components of hospitals' adaptation to climate change and to review measures to confront climate change in hospitals. Method This systematic review was designed and carried out in 2020. The required information was collected from international electronic databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Moreover, Iranian datasets such as Scientific Database (SID), Irandoc, Magiran, and IranMedex were reviewed. No restriction was considered in the methodology of the study. For the relevant thesis, the ProQuest database was also explored. The related sources were examined and the Snowball method was applied to find additional related studies. The research team also reviewed other accessible electronic resources, such as international guidelines and academic websites. The checklist of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI, 2017) was employed in order to evaluate the quality of the included papers. The studies published until June1, 2020, were included in the study. Results Of 11,680 published documents in the initial search, the full-texts of 140 were read after evaluating the titles and abstracts, of which 114 were excluded due to lack of sufficient information related to countermeasures in hospitals. Finally, the full-texts of 26 studies were reviewed to extract the required components. Two strategies were found, including climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, with 13 components including water, wastewater, energy, waste, green buildings, food, transportation, green purchasing policy, medicines, chemicals and toxins, technology, sustainable care models, and leadership in hospitals were identified as affecting these measures and strategies. Conclusion Considering the significance of climate change and strategies to confront it as one of the current challenges and priorities in the world, it is necessary to develop a framework and model to reduce the effects of climate change and adapt to climate changes in hospitals and other health centers. The identification and classification of the measures and components, influencing hospital adaptability and solutions for reducing the climate change impacts could be the first stage in developing this strategy. This is because it is impossible to create this framework without identifying these factors and their mutual impacts at the first. In the present study, through a systematic review using a comprehensive approach, the related components were explored and divided into two categories, including measures to reduce the effects and measures to adapt to climate change. The results of this study can be useful in developing a comprehensive action model to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt hospitals to climate change.","[Mashallahi, Alireza; Ardalan, Ali; Nejati, Amir; Ostadtaghizadeh, Abbas] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Emergencies & Disasters, Ghods Ave, Tehran, Iran; [Mashallahi, Alireza; Ardalan, Ali; Ostadtaghizadeh, Abbas] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Inst Environm Hlth Res, Tehran, Iran; [Nejati, Amir] Imam Khomeini Hosp Tehran Univ Med Sci, Pre Hosp & Hosp Emergency Res Ctr, Dept Emergency Med, Emergency Med, Tehran, Iran; [Ostadtaghizadeh, Abbas] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Poursina Ave,Qods St,Enqelab Sq, Tehran, Iran",Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences,"Ostadtaghizadeh, A (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Emergencies & Disasters, Ghods Ave, Tehran, Iran.;Ostadtaghizadeh, A (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Inst Environm Hlth Res, Tehran, Iran.",Ostadtaghizadeh@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","mashallahi, alireza/0000-0003-1031-5383","School of Environmental Research and Public Health (IER), Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS)","School of Environmental Research and Public Health (IER), Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS)","We would like to appreciate the School of Environmental Research and Public Health (IER), Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), for supporting the present study.",,70,0,0,6,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,2052-336X,,J ENVIRON HEALTH SCI,J.

J,"Kiem, AS",,,,"Kiem, Anthony S.",,,Drought and water policy in Australia: Challenges for the future illustrated by the issues associated with water trading and climate change adaptation in the Murray-Darling Basin,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Water trading; Adaptation; Limits; Uncertainty; Barriers; Disconnect; Climate variability,GOVERNANCE; PRINCIPLES,"This paper reviews historical and existing drought and water policy in Australia in order to gain a sense of the strengths and weaknesses in enabling effective adaptation to climate change. In particular, (a) the social, economic, and environmental costs and benefits of water trading and (b) the limitations of using 'market-based' instruments (MBIs), like water trading, for adapting to drought and water security related climate change impacts are investigated. It was found that water trading has potential as a climate change adaptation strategy with many benefits experienced in previous and current versions of water trading. However, there are also limitations and those negatively impacted by water trading are hit hard. These social impacts of water trading have not been thoroughly investigated and are not well understood. Significant uncertainty also exists around the impacts of water trading on the environment (e.g. changed hydrological regimes, underestimation of sustainable environmental flows etc.). Proper quantification of these impacts is needed, however, it is a complex task given Australia's large hydroclimatic variability and the current lack of understanding as to how to optimise water needs of the environment, humans, agriculture and other industries. It appears that 'cap and trade' quantity-based MBIs such as water trading will eventually do what they are designed to do (i.e. reallocate a resource to 'high value' users). However, given that the low value' users in this case are agriculture and town/urban water supply (not including drinking water) and the 'high value' users are mining, manufacturing, and electricity production (i.e. high greenhouse gas emissions), do we really want the water trading MBI to achieve its objective? And, what would the social and environmental ramifications of such a shift in water use within Australia be? These questions, along with the limitations and potential implications of using water trading (and MBIs in general) as a climate change adaptation tool, must be carefully considered if past Australian drought and water policy failures are not to be repeated.

Since available funds are not meeting adaptation needs, the question of how to allocate scarce resources becomes pressing. Universal adaptation metrics promise to facilitate the allocation process ex ante and the evaluation of projects ex post. Two such metrics have been proposed recently: Saved Wealth (SW), measured in terms of money, and Saved Health (SH), gauged in terms of disability adjusted life-years (DALYs). The paper analyzes this SWSH approach and shows that it is replete with unresolved conceptual and normative-ethical problems, which are exemplary for universal metrics seeking to combine concerns for equity and efficiency at once. The paper's aim is to uncover these issues, and its conclusion is modest: universal metrics such as SW and the DALY have to be designed and used with great caution and further research is necessary.","[Klonschinski, Andrea] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Fac Philosophy, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Klonschinski, A (corresponding author), Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Fac Philosophy, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",klonschinski@philsem.uni-kiel.de,,,"state government of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany","state government of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany","The Open Access publication of this paper was funded by the state government of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.",,35,0,0,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2021,13,16,,,,,,,9428,10.3390/su13169428,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13169428,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UH3FC,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000689820400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Findings - The results revealed that pastoralists using of IF only more likely to be non-farm enterprises and livestock sales as adaptation strategies. Pastoralists using both SF and IF were more likely to practise livestock migration. Research limitations/implications - Other factors found to be important included land ownership, land tenure, gender, education level, non-farm and productive assets, climate-related risks and agricultural extension access. Practical implications - Increasing the number of weather stations in pastoral areas would increase the predictive accuracy of scientific climate information, which results in better adaptive capacity of pastoralists. Active participation of pastoral households in national meteorological dissemination processes should be explored. Social implications - A two-prong approach that supports both mobile and sedentary pastoralism should be adopted in rangeland development policies.

This study examines climate changemigration nexus in Ghana by using data collected from 500 maize farmers. Observed errors in the data were corrected through a propensity score matching (PSM) technique. Location was endogenously related to migration, with the unobserved errors corrected by implementing a twostage Heckit probit model. The results show that drought and decrease in rainfall are climatic conditions likely to trigger migration. However, floods and decline in soil fertility are less likely to induce migration. Also, farming experience, access to credit, participation in climate-smart agriculture training, access to extension services, and information from extension agents influenced the present location of maize farmers. These push factors identified were corroborated in focus group discussions. The study recommends that policymakers, development partners, and other relevant stakeholders should first understand and appreciate the deafferented roles of diverse climatic conditions on migrations, and then support farmers to adopt appropriate longterm climate change adaptation strategies to address perennial climatic factors that affect livelihoods. While doing so, short-term measures such as scaling up access to climate services should be devised to adapt to climate change.","[Azumah, Shaibu Baanni] Univ Dev Studies, POB TL 1882, Tamale, Ghana; [Azumah, Shaibu Baanni] Asdev Consult, Tamale, Ghana; [Ahmed, Abubakari] SD Dombo Univ Business & Integrated Dev Studies, Dept Planning, Wa, Ghana",University for Development Studies,"Azumah, SB (corresponding author), Univ Dev Studies, POB TL 1882, Tamale, Ghana.",raszumah1983@gmail.com,"Ahmed, Abubakari/AAM-7972-2020","Ahmed, Abubakari/0000-0001-5574-614X; BAANNI AZUMAH, SHAIBU/0000-0001-9046-5079",DAAD; Federal Ministry of Education and Research [57544689],DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was supported by DAAD within the framework of the climapAfrica programme with funds from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, under grant number 57544689.

The influence exerted by cognitive situations and climate - driven stress on farmers' decisions to migrate and the socioeconomic attributes of migrating and non-migrating farm families are examined. The emphasis is the function of migration in accessing climate and agricultural extension services as well as the contribution made by migration to promote farmers' climate change coping capacity. Methodology: Survey was articulated using farming households in three agricultural zones of Delta State, Nigeria. Perceptions of farmers about alterations in climate were examined with the use of mental map technique. Binary logistic regression model was applied to assess the function of socioeconomic attributes of farm families while descriptive statistics was employed in evaluating the adaptive capacities of the migrating farming households. Findings: Climate - driven livelihood variables form part of the main propellers of migration among farmers. Migration as well as the socioeconomic attributes is influenced by perception of farmers about climate change. There appears significant difference between migrating and non -migrating farm families with respect to utilization of information, technology and knowledge emanating from agricultural and climate extension services. The gains from remittances, knowledge and social networks from host communities or zones raise migrating farm families capacity to adapt to climate change. Theoretical Implications: This paper contributes to the progressively dynamic body of knowledge by pointing out migration as an alternative climate change adaptation strategy to promote agriculture food security in any part of the world. Originality/Value: Micro - evidence is offered by this study with respect to contribution made by migration to adaptive capacity of farmers and their ability to have access to agricultural and climate extension services. This will be useful in the analysis of climate - driven migration in other nations that are agricultural economies. Insight is also offered regarding policy needs for the scaling down of farmers' vulnerability to climate change.","[Ukaro, Ofuoku Albert; Davina, Okompu] Delta State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Extens, Asaba Campus, Asaba, Delta State, Nigeria",,"Ukaro, OA (corresponding author), Delta State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Extens, Asaba Campus, Asaba, Delta State, Nigeria.",albertofuoku@gmail.com,,,,,,,68,0,0,6,8,AGENZIA ITALIANA COOPERAZIONE SVILUPPO-ITALIAN DEV COOP AGENCY,FLORENCE,"VIA ANTONIO COCCHI 4, FLORENCE, 50131, ITALY",2240-2802,,,J AGRIC ENVIRON INT,J.

Using Ostrom's institutional analysis and development framework, we aimed to identify : (1) the critical and distinctive characteristics of the forest resource and institutional context that may determine how climate change-adaptive forest management measures are implemented and (2) the opportunities for implementing the planned adaptation measures. The analysis is performed on ten European case study regions which differed in many resource-dependent factors, policy arena factors and incentives for changes. The main factors influencing the adaptation are the ownership pattern, the level of policy formation and the nature of forest goods and services. Opportunities for adaptation are driven by the openness of the forest management planning processes to the stakeholders participation, the degree to which business as usual management is projected to be non-satisfactory in the future, and by the number and nature of obstacles to adaptation. Promoting local self-governance mechanisms and the participation of the external stakeholders in forest management planning or in the regional forest or climate change policy adaptation may be a way of overcoming path dependency, behavioural obstacles and potential policy failures in implementing adaptation. The study argues that both climate change belief systems and political participation are important to explain adaptation to climate change when multiple decision-making levels are at stake.","[Bouriaud, Laura; Nichiforel, Liviu; Duduman, Gabriel] Univ Stefan Cel Mare Suceava, Suceava 720229, Romania; [Marzano, Mariella; Taylor, Philip; Bathgate, Stephen; Nicoll, Bruce; Ray, Duncan; Sing, Louise] Forestry Commiss Roslin, No Res Stn, Forest Res, Roslin EH25 9SY, Midlothian, Scotland; [Lexer, Manfred; Maroschek, Michael; Rammer, Werner] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Silviculture, Vienna, Austria; [Reyer, Christopher] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Temperli, Christian; Elkin, Che] ETH, Forest Ecol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Temperli, Christian; Zell, Juergen; Hanewinkel, Marc] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurich, Switzerland; [Peltola, Heli; Kellomaki, Seppo] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Fac Sci & Forestry, Joensuu, Finland; [Elkin, Che] Univ No British Columbia, Prince George, BC V2L 5P2, Canada; [Taylor, Philip] CEH, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Borges, Jose G.; Garcia-Gonzalo, Jordi; Tome, Margarida] Univ Lisbon, Forest Res Ctr, Sch Agr ISA, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Clerkx, Sandra; Hengeveld, Geerten; Nabuurs, Gert-Jan; Schelhaas, Mart-Jan] Wageningen Univ & Res, Alterra, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Gracia, Carlos] CREAF, Barcelona, Spain; [Gracia, Carlos] Univ Barcelona Diagonal, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, Barcelona, Spain; [Kostov, Georgi] Forestry Univ, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Muys, Bart] European Forest Inst, Mediterranean Reg Off, Barcelona, Spain; [Palahi, Marc] European Forest Inst, Joensuu, Finland; [Hanewinkel, Marc] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Freiburg, Germany","Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Eastern Finland; University of Northern British Columbia; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); Universidade de Lisboa; Forest Research Centre; Wageningen University & Research; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; University of Forestry - Bulgaria; University of Freiburg","Bouriaud, L (corresponding author), Univ Stefan Cel Mare Suceava, Str Univ 13, Suceava 720229, Romania.",bouriaud@usv.ro,"Temperli, Christian/A-5853-2015; Muys, Bart/ABN-3906-2022; Zell, Jürgen/G-5267-2013; hanewinkel, marc/E-5639-2011; Garcia-Gonzalo, Jordi/H-9221-2013; Kostov, Georgi G./T-4624-2017; Bouriaud, Laura/N-7156-2014; Tomé, Margarida/F-5776-2010; Nicoll, Bruce/D-4858-2011; Reyer, Christopher P.O./A-5515-2013; Hengeveld, Geerten/O-8943-2019; Nabuurs, Gert-Jan/D-8048-2015; Borges, Jose/A-4131-2008; Muys, Bart/A-3194-2015; Taylor, Philip/E-5143-2015","Temperli, Christian/0000-0003-1161-9864; Zell, Jürgen/0000-0002-2035-2789; hanewinkel, marc/0000-0003-4081-6621; Garcia-Gonzalo, Jordi/0000-0001-9946-5753; Bouriaud, Laura/0000-0002-3111-9261; Tomé, Margarida/0000-0002-6242-8593; Nicoll, Bruce/0000-0002-5891-0555; Reyer, Christopher P.O./0000-0003-1067-1492; Borges, Jose/0000-0002-0608-5784; Duduman, Gabriel/0000-0002-6936-5791; Sing, Louise/0000-0002-0717-7103; Hengeveld, Geerten/0000-0002-9592-3080; Maroschek, Michael/0000-0003-1032-9806; Muys, Bart/0000-0001-9421-527X; Nichiforel, Liviu/0000-0002-9332-9379; Taylor, Philip/0000-0003-1663-9426; Schelhaas, Mart-Jan/0000-0003-4525-2677",MOTIVE (models for adaptive forest management) [226544]; INTEGRAL (future-oriented integrated management of European forest landscapes) [282887]; HubforClimate (UEFISCDI) [PN-II-RU-TE-2011-3-0222]; Natural Environment Research Council [ceh020002] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [ceh020002] Funding Source: UKRI,"MOTIVE (models for adaptive forest management); INTEGRAL (future-oriented integrated management of European forest landscapes); HubforClimate (UEFISCDI)(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This study was founded by MOTIVE (models for adaptive forest management, Grant No. 226544), by INTEGRAL (future-oriented integrated management of European forest landscapes, Grant No. 282887) and by HubforClimate (UEFISCDI Grant PN-II-RU-TE-2011-3-0222).

The 4 per 1,000 Initiative: Soils for food security and climate was launched in 2015 to increase soil organic carbon sequestration with three objectives: mitigation of climate change, adaptation to climate change and improved food security. One of the challenges of the Initiative relates to its feasibility in contrasted biophysical, social and economic environments, questioning the adoption rate of required new practices. We conducted participatory multi-stakeholder workshops in France and Senegal to collect knowledge and perception of farmers, NGOs, agro-industries, administrations, donors and researchers on barriers and coping strategies for 4 per 1,000 innovations. Results in both countries reveal the predominance of social and economic barriers such as lack of knowledge or training, increased difficulties of fieldwork, workload, risk handling, funding and social pressure. Biophysical constraints such as limited potential of soil organic matter storage or rainfall scarcity and variability appear more important in Senegal. Identified actions to foster the sequestration of soil carbon call for an improved policy context leading to innovations in land planning, stakeholder communication, demonstration facilities, capacity building or financial support. Fewer constraints and coping strategies mention technical issues, showing that fostering agricultural soil carbon sequestration is more a question of enabling environment than technical innovations or farmers' willingness for change. We conclude that actions to support the 4 per 1,000 Initiative need to include a variety of stakeholders such as extension services, private sector, civil society, local institutions, policy makers, consumers, and not only farmers.","[Demenois, Julien; Torquebiau, Emmanuel; Assouma, Mohammed Habibou; Blanfort, Vincent] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Demenois, Julien; Torquebiau, Emmanuel] Univ Montpellier, AIDA, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Arnoult, Matthieu H.] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading, Berks, England; [Eglin, Thomas] Agence Environm & Maitrise Energie, Angers, France; [Masse, Dominique; Chapuis-Lardy, Lydie] Univ Montpellier, Eco & Sols, CIRAD, INRAE,Inst Agro,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Assouma, Mohammed Habibou; Blanfort, Vincent] UMR Syst Delevage Mediterraneens & Tropicaux CIRA, Montpellier, France; [Assouma, Mohammed Habibou; Blanfort, Vincent] Univ Montpellier, SELMET, CIRAD, INRAE,Inst Agro, Montpellier, France; [Chenu, Claire] AgroParisTech Inst Sci & Ind Vivant & Environm, SIAFEE Dept, Paris, France; [Chapuis-Lardy, Lydie] LMI IESOL, IRD, Dakar, Senegal; [Medoc, Jean-Michel] Univ Montpellier, Recyclage & Risque, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Medoc, Jean-Michel] LMI IESOL, CIRAD, Dakar, Senegal; [Sall, Saidou Nourou] Gaston Berger Univ, Dept Crop Prod & Agron, St Louis, Senegal",CIRAD; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; University of Reading; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Universite de Montpellier; AgroParisTech; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD,"Demenois, J (corresponding author), Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, Montpellier, France.;Demenois, J (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, AIDA, CIRAD, Montpellier, France.",julien.demenois@cirad.fr,"LARDY, Lydie/B-5324-2009; Demenois, Julien/P-1020-2019; Masse, Dominique/A-7603-2011","LARDY, Lydie/0000-0003-0393-3239; Demenois, Julien/0000-0002-2271-8465; Masse, Dominique/0000-0002-3165-1469; BLANFORT, VINCENT/0000-0002-9280-9119; Arnoult, Matthieu/0000-0001-7001-4318",EIT Climate-KIC [180507],EIT Climate-KIC,"This work was funded through the EIT Climate-KIC project no. 180507 Action plan to scale out the 4 per 1,000 Initiative.",,40,12,12,1,24,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

A criterion is developed to differentiate these frameworks in recent adaptation projects. The criterion features six key hallmarks as follows: (1) use of climate model information; (2) analysis of metrics/units; (3) socio-economic knowledge; (4) stakeholder engagement; (5) adaptation of implementation mechanisms; (6) tier of adaptation implementation. The paper then tests the validity of this approach using adaptation projects on the Suffolk coast, UK. Fourteen adaptation plans were identified in an online survey. They were analysed in relation to the hallmarks outlined above and assigned to an adaptation framework. The results show that while some adaptation plans are primarily SL, VL or DC, the majority are hybrid, showing a mixture of DC/VL and DC/SL characteristics. Interestingly, the SL/VL combination is not observed, perhaps because the DC framework is intermediate and attempts to overcome weaknesses of both SL and VL approaches. The majority (57 %) of adaptation projects generated a risk assessment or advice notes. Further development of this type of framework analysis would allow better guidance on approaches for organisations when implementing climate change adaptation initiatives, and other similar proactive long-term planning.","[Armstrong, J.; Wilby, R.] Univ Loughborough, Dept Geog, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Nicholls, R.

This study explores the effect of ambiguity aversion on adaptation behaviors in the context of climate change. We conduct a field survey among 230 rice farmers in northeastern Thailand to examine the association between elicited ambiguity aversion and the implementation of climate change adaptation. We find that ambiguity aversion does not encourage farmers' adaptation behaviors and can even discourage the uptake of adaptation strategies. The role of ambiguity aversion varies depending on the characteristics of the adaptation strategy: ambiguity-averse farmers are less likely to adopt adaptation strategies that entail shifts from the status-quo. A deliberate approach is needed to understand farmers' adaptation behaviors outside the laboratory setting and to reduce ambiguity in the results concerning adaptation to increasing climate risk.,"[Shiiba, Nagisa] Inst Global Environm Strategies, 2108-11 Kamiyamaguchi, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan; [Yokoo, Hide-Fumi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Saengavut, Voravee; Bumrungkit, Siraprapa] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Econ, 123 Mittraphap Rd, Khon Kaen, Thailand",Hitotsubashi University; Khon Kaen University,"Shiiba, N (corresponding author), Inst Global Environm Strategies, 2108-11 Kamiyamaguchi, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan.",shiiba@iges.or.jp; hidefiemi.yokoo@r.hit-u.ac.jp; cvorav@kku.ac.th; sirabu@kku.ac.th,,"Yokoo, Hide-Fumi/0000-0001-7923-4587",JSPS KAKENHI [17K18343]; Ocean Policy Research Institute of Sasakawa Peace Foundation,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Ocean Policy Research Institute of Sasakawa Peace Foundation","This research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (grant number 17K18343).

A total of 612 farmers (328 females and 284 males) were interviewed using purposive sampling technique. Our results indicate that adaptation strategies are gendered with men mostly resorting to on-farm agronomic practices such as the use of artificial fertilizers and also moving into new cash crops. Female farmers also use similar on-farm agronomic practices particularly artificial fertilizers to boost crop production but most importantly resorted to petty trading in agricultural and consumable goods, an off-farm strategy. This shows women's resilience which has also subsequently improved their decision-making role at the household level, which is an indicator of empowerment. We recommend that institutions that support climate change adaptation initiatives at the local level must take gender differences into consideration and support particularly women to strengthen their resilience and consolidate their empowerment.","[Wrigley-Asante, Charlotte; Owusu, Kwadwo] Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, POB LG 59, Legon, Ghana; [Egyir, Irene S.] Univ Ghana, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Legon, Ghana; [Owiyo, Tom Mboya] African Dev Bank, Immeuble Ctr Commerce Int Abidjan, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire",University of Ghana; University of Ghana; African Development Bank Group (AfDB),"Wrigley-Asante, C (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, POB LG 59, Legon, Ghana.",cwrigley-asante@ug.edu.gh,"Owusu, George/AAI-3380-2020","Owusu, Kwadwo/0000-0003-1322-0566; Wrigley-Asante, Charlotte/0000-0002-7538-7452","United States Agency for International Development (USAID) by Tetra Tech ARD, through a Task Order under the Prosperity, Livelihoods, and Conserving Ecosystems (PLACE) Indefinite Quantity Contract Core Task Order [AID-EPP-I-00-06-00008, AID-OAA-TO-11-0006]","United States Agency for International Development (USAID) by Tetra Tech ARD, through a Task Order under the Prosperity, Livelihoods, and Conserving Ecosystems (PLACE) Indefinite Quantity Contract Core Task Order","This work was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) by Tetra Tech ARD, through a Task Order under the Prosperity, Livelihoods, and Conserving Ecosystems (PLACE) Indefinite Quantity Contract Core Task Order [USAID Contract No. AID-EPP-I-00-06-00008, Order Number AID-OAA-TO-11-0006].",,40,32,32,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1937-6812,2163-2642,,AFR GEOGR REV,Afr.

Developing tailored, place based, and culturally appropriate solutions will be necessary. Yet finding cultural and institutional 'fit' within and between competing values-based climate and environmental management governance regimes remains an ongoing challenge. This paper reports on a collaborative research project with the Arabana people of central Australia, that resulted in the production of the first Indigenous community-based climate change adaptation strategy in Australia. We aimed to try and understand what conditions are needed to support Indigenous driven adaptation initiatives, if there are any cultural differences that need accounting for and how, once developed they be integrated into existing governance arrangements. Our analysis found that climate change adaptation is based on the centrality of the connection to 'country' (traditional land), it needs to be aligned with cultural values, and focus on the building of adaptive capacity. We find that the development of climate change adaptation initiatives cannot be divorced from the historical context of how the Arabana experienced and collectively remember colonisation. We argue that in developing culturally responsive climate governance for and with Indigenous peoples, that that the history of colonisation and the ongoing dominance of entrenched Western governance regimes needs acknowledging and redressing into contemporary environmental/climate management.","[Nursey-Bray, Melissa] Univ Adelaide, Fac Arts, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Palmer, Robert] Univ Adelaide, Fac Arts, Dept Media, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide,"Nursey-Bray, M (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Fac Arts, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",Melissa.Nursey-Bray@adelaide.edu.au,"Nursey-Bray, Melissa/J-8183-2019","Nursey-Bray, Melissa/0000-0002-4121-5177","National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Australia at the Griffith University, Queensland","National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Australia at the Griffith University, Queensland","This project was funded by the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Australia, based at the Griffith University, Queensland.",,85,19,19,4,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,MAR,2018,4,3,,,,,,,e00565,10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00565,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00565,,,28,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,GF5US,29862336,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000432033900021,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, the effectiveness of six passive climate change adaptation measures applied at the level of building components is assessed using building energy simulations for three generic residential buildings as commonly built in - among others - the Netherlands: (1) detached house; (2) terraced house; (3) apartment. The study involves both residential buildings that are built according to the regulations and common practice in 2012, and residential buildings that were constructed in the 1970s, with a lower thermal resistance of the opaque and transparent parts of the building envelope. The climate change adaptation measures investigated are: (i) increased thermal resistance; (ii) changed thermal capacity; (iii) increased short-wave reflectivity (albedo); (iv) vegetation roofs; (v) solar shading; and (vi) additional natural ventilation. This paper quantifies the effectiveness of these climate change adaptation measures for new residential buildings as well as for renovation of the current building stock. The performance indicator is the number of overheating hours during a year. It is shown that exterior solar shading and additional natural ventilation are most effective for this performance indicator. Furthermore, increasing thermal insulation to reduce energy use for heating demands additional measures to prevent overheating. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It examines the logic and rationality of making vulnerable groups resilient in the context of climate change. It shows how adaption projects tend to understand vulnerability as the result of a series of external threats that arise due to global climate change and are expressed primarily as lost income. Using the example of Knaing village in Mondolkiri province this article shows that when it comes to vulnerability, it is often unhelpful to separate between capitalist relations, state territorialization and climate change. Economic, political, and cultural relations that people in the village find themselves imbedded in are co-produced through the interaction of climatic forces, the expansion of capitalist relations and state territorialization. This article thus tries to sketch out a conception of vulnerability based on villager's changing agricultural practices and livelihood trajectories in the context of the expansion of Economic Land Concessions, logging of surrounding forests, and settlement of adjacent lands and state conservation efforts.",,,,timothy.frewer@sydey.edu.au,,,,,,,59,0,0,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1467-2715,1472-6033,,CRIT ASIAN STUD,Crit.

Particularly in the Red River Delta Biosphere Reserve (RRDBR), farmers change the crop structure and diversify agricultural systems to adapt to the changing climate. The paper deals with a quantitative approach combined with behavior theories and surveyed data to analyze farmers' intention to climate change adaptation in agriculture. Based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), seven constructs are developed to a questionnaire surveying 526 local farmers: risk perception, belief, habit, maladaptation, subjective norm, adaptation assessment, and adaptation intention. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is implemented to extract eight factors and to quantify the relationship between protective behavior factors with the adaptation intention of the surveyed farmers. Two bootstrap samples of sizes 800 and 1200 are generated to estimate the coefficients and standard errors. The SEM result suggests a regional and three local structural models for climate change adaptation intention of farmers living in the RRDBR. Farmers show a higher adaptation intention when they perceive higher climate risks threatening their physical health, finances, production, social relationships, and psychology. In contrast, farmers are less likely to intend to adapt when they are subject to wishful thinking, deny the climate risks, or believe in fatalism.","[The Anh Luu] VNU, Cent Inst Nat Resources & Environm Studies CRES, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam; [An Thinh Nguyen; The Kien Nguyen] VNU, Univ Econ & Business, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam; [Quoc Anh Trinh; Pham, Ha T.

Building on C. Steinitz' Framework for Alternative Futures Studies, a framework for participatory scenario-based landscape planning (SLP) is developed and used in a three-month climate adaptation planning process involving up to 37 local actors in Gartow, Germany. The evaluation of social learning outcomes follows the premise of action research and employs a mixed-method approach. The research shows that SLP can successfully generate social learning outcomes among participants. Observed social learning outcomes include gains in substantive knowledge (e.g. on climate change impacts), procedural knowledge (e.g. on alternative adaptation strategies), understanding of different perspectives, as well as social and technical skills. Participants named several potential impacts of social learning outcomes on their future decision-making, including enhanced awareness, altered agendas, and better social relations. The SLP process and its results formed the basis and inducement for further collaboration of local actors and external consultants in the development of a coordinated mission statement (Leitbild) for climate change adaptation.

However, there are few, if any, global assessments of adaptation taking place across cities. This study develops and applies a framework to track urban climate change adaptation policy using municipal adaptation reporting. From 401 local governments globally in urban areas with >1 m people, we find that only 61 cities (15%) report any adaptation initiatives, and 73 cities (18%) report on planning towards adaptation policy. We classified cities based on their adaptation reporting as extensive adaptors, moderate adaptors, early stage adaptors, and non-reporting. With few exceptions, extensive adaptors are large cities located in high-income countries in North America, Europe, and Oceania, and are adapting to a variety of expected impacts. Moderate adaptors usually address general disaster risk reduction rather than specific impacts, and are located in a mix of developed and developing countries. Early stage adaptors exhibit evidence of planning for adaptation, but do not report any initiatives. Our findings suggest that urban adaptation is in the early stages, but there are still substantive examples of governments taking leadership regardless of wealth levels and institutional barriers.

Here we examine (a) whether techno-optimism is found among Midwestern corn and soybean farmers and (b) how this confidence in human ingenuity influences their support for climate change adaptation. By examining data from a survey of nearly 5,000 grain farmers in the Midwestern United States, we found that greater techno-optimism can reduce farmers' support for climate change adaptation and increase their propensity to express a preference to delay adaptation-related actions.

In response, this study aimed to advance and operationalize a typology of learning in an environmental governance context, and examined if a participatory decision-making process (adaptive co-management) for climate change adaptation fostered learning. Three types of learning were identified: cognitive learning, related to the acquisition of new or the structuring of existing knowledge; normative learning, which concerns a shift in viewpoints, values or paradigms, and relational learning, referring to an improved understanding of others' mindsets, enhanced trust and ability to cooperate. A robust mixed methods approach with a focus on quantitative measures including concept map analysis, social network analysis, and self-reflective questions, was designed to gauge indicators for each learning type. A participatory decision-making process for climate change adaptation was initiated with stakeholders in the Niagara region, Canada. A pseudo-control group was used to minimize external contextual influences on results. Clear empirical evidence of cognitive and relational learning was gained; however, the results from normative learning measures were inconclusive. The learning typology and measurement method operationalized in this research advances previous treatments of learning in relation to participatory decision-making processes, and supports adaptive co-management as a governance strategy that fosters learning and adaptive capacity.

Such a phenomenon affects communities across the globe. One of these communities is that of small-scale fishermen. Past studies have shown poor understanding of climate change and low progress in development among fishermen because of the failure among stakeholders in understanding the mindset of beneficiaries such as their attitudinal setting. Much of the top-to-bottom development is impromptu, and most of the time, this makes them disorientated and may open them to the risks associated with climate change. Therefore, a better understanding of their attitude in relation to climate change will provide an important foundation for future planning for climate change mitigation and engagement of fishermen communities with stakeholders. In general, this paper aims to determine the attitude of small-scale fishermen towards adaptation to climate change. The nature of this study is quantitative and the study uses a set of questionnaires and involves a total of 300 respondents from two fisheries districts in Peninsular Malaysia. The fishermen surveyed had a high level of adaptation with regards to attitude towards climate change, while their level of education, catching area, fishing technology, type of vessel and income are confirmed as influential factors.","[Muhammad, Mahazan; Idris, Khairuddin; Shaffril, Hayrol Azril Mohamed; Sulaiman, Abdul Hadi] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Social Sci Studies, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Abu Samah, Bahaman; Suandi, Turiman] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Educ Studies, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Muhammad, M (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Social Sci Studies, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",mahazanmuhammad@gmail.com; kidin@upm.edu.my; hayrol82@gmail.com; abdulhadi_mutual@yahoo.com; basfmi@yahoo.com; turiman55@gmail.com,"Shaffril, Hayrol Azril Mohamed/I-2463-2019; Muhammad, Mahazan/AAD-6001-2020","Muhammad, Mahazan/0000-0003-0001-7702",Universiti Putra Malaysia [GP-IPB/2014/9441301],Universiti Putra Malaysia,This study would like to thank Universiti Putra Malaysia for providing the research grant GP-IPB/2014/9441301.,,29,2,2,1,8,UNIV PUTRA MALAYSIA PRESS,SELANGOR,"SERDANG, SELANGOR, 00000, MALAYSIA",0128-7702,2231-8534,,PERTANIKA J SOC SCI,Pertanika J.

Research on preconditions for organizational adaptation to climate change has produced two parallel lines of inquiry, one focusing on macro-level norms, rules, and expectations and the other on meso-level culture, design, and structure within the organization. Drawing on the meta-theory of institutional logics, this study proposes a configurational approach to link institutionally aware top managers with the combination and reconciliation of macro- and meso-level logics. We identify government authority, professionalism, and market as macro-level institutional logics, and risk-based logic and capacity-based logic as critical meso-level institutional logics. Our theory proposes that (1) the macro- and meso-level institutional logics co-exist in systematic ways as to produce identifiable configurations, (2) the configurations are differentially associated with climate adaptation, and (3) the effects of each logic differ across the configurations. Using a 2019 national survey on approximately 1000 top managers in the largest U.S. transit agencies, we apply latent profile analysis to identify three distinct clusters: forerunner, complacent, and market-oriented. Only the forerunner cluster is adaptive to climate change, whereas the two others are maladaptive. Findings from the multigroup structural equation model also demonstrate varied effects of each institutional logic on adaptation across the clusters, confirming institutional work at play to reconcile and integrate co-existing and potential contradictory logics.","[Zhang, Fengxiu] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Welch, Eric W.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",George Mason University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Zhang, FX (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",fzhang22@gmu.edu,,"Zhang, Fengxiu/0000-0001-5784-9708","Federal Transit Administration, US Department of Transportation","Federal Transit Administration, US Department of Transportation","This research was made possible through generous support by the Federal Transit Administration, US Department of Transportation.",,104,0,0,19,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1053-1858,1477-9803,,J PUBL ADM RES THEOR,J.

Based on a social learning process focusing on development of local climate-change scenarios, villagers from Qiziltepa district identified adaptation options and agreed on a common purpose to restore rangelands through collective governance systems.

Apart from efforts to achieve a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases so as to mitigate the problem, there is a perceived need for adaptation initiatives urgently. Ecosystems are known to play an important role in climate change adaptation processes, since some of the services they provide, may reduce the impacts of extreme events and disturbance, such as wildfires, floods, and droughts. This role is especially important in regions vulnerable to climate change such as the African continent, whose adaptation capacity is limited by many geographic and socio-economic constraints. In Africa, interventions aimed at enhancing ecosystem services may play a key role in supporting climate change adaptation efforts. In order to shed some light on this aspect, this paper reviews the role of ecosystems services and investigates how they are being influenced by climate change in Africa. It contains a set of case studies from a sample of African countries, which serve the purpose to demonstrate the damages incurred, and how such damages disrupt ecosystem services. Based on the data gathered, some measures which may assist in fostering the cause of ecosystems services are listed, so as to cater for a better protection of some of the endangered Africa ecosystems, and the services they provide.

It opens a new narrative on how the geographic concept of place is conceptualized in smallholder farmers and climate change adaptation literature in Sub-Saharan Africa. The review suggested that place is not only the 'where' of a location but a location geographically connected and interdependent to illustrate how smallholder farmers' experiences in adapting to climate shocks interact with global efforts such as improving food security, eliminating poverty and building sustainable rural livelihood. Through the various climate change adaptation strategies exhibited by different farmer groups, the paper demonstrated that people in places have the agency to make choices that control their destinies irrespective of whatever global force overwhelms them. The paper argues sense of place expressed through ecological place meaning shapes people's intuition, beliefs, actions and experiences as illustrated by smallholders' perception of the determinant and barriers to effective adaptation strategies. The ecological place meaning also influences the 'glocalization' of climate impact on agroecological-based livelihoods at different locations and how maladaptive outcomes are perceived. Place gives people identity by (re)shaping actions and experiences and vice versa. There is an undeviating relationship between power, place and people's experience. Further exploration of the relationship between lifeworld experiences, people, and power is central in understanding the meaning of place in smallholder farmers and climate change interaction.","[Quarshie, Philip Tetteh] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1H 2W1, Canada; [Quarshie, Philip Tetteh] Univ Guelph, Guelph Inst Dev Studies, Guelph, ON, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"Quarshie, PT (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1H 2W1, Canada.",pquarshi@uoguelph.ca,,"Quarshie, Philip Tetteh/0000-0003-0319-3226",,,,,82,1,1,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0373-6245,2151-2418,,S AFR GEOGR J,S.

Nevertheless, this sector has faced emerging challenges from increased climate variability during recent decades, negatively influencing its out-comes. This paper utilized farm-level data surveyed in 2019 to investigate the mechanisms behind households' decisions to adopt three primary climate change adaptation practices: upgrading pond dikes, lining ponds with plastic sheets, and having settling ponds. This study demonstrates the effects of adopting these strategies on shrimp farming performance. An endogenous switching regression model was employed to deal with potential selection bias and heterogeneity in the decision to adopt or not. We find that the adoption of upgrading pond dikes and having a settling pond result in higher productivity in shrimp farming, and both adopters and non- adopters of these strategies would benefit from the adaptation. As well, education of the farm operators and farmers' belief on changes in climatic conditions and their impacts on shrimp farming are the main drivers behind the adoption behavior. This study, therefore, provides empirical evidence for policymakers to promote specific climate change adaptation strategies that would improve the welfare of shrimp farmers.","[Huu-Luat Do] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City UEH, Sch Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Thong Quoc Ho] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City UEH, Econ & Environm Partnership Southeast Asia EEPSEA, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics,"Ho, TQ (corresponding author), 279 Nguyen Tri Phuong,Dist 10, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",luatdh@ueh.edu.vn; thonghq@ueh.edu.vn,"Ho, Thong/AAU-8696-2021; Do, Luat/AIC-4730-2022","Ho, Thong/0000-0002-5398-2795; Do, Luat/0000-0001-5106-5398",National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [502.01-2020.340],National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)(National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED)),This work was supported by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant Number 502.01-2020.340.

The fundamental aim of scientific knowledge in environmental studies is to reconcile climate change and environmental sustainability with developmental goals. Therefore, information on impact adaptation to climate change and vulnerability research is required to develop specific, action-oriented, interdisciplinary, successful, sociopolitical and democratic reform for the entire population of a country. This condition requires large inclusion of environmental researchers, institutions, re-inventing of research structures and ideas to dominate the global environmental change research and the critical analysis of present decision making, power, structure and related information structures. This review presents the effect of climate change in Nigeria and encourages adaptation research with challenging innovation, such as the use of energy-efficient renewable energy sources to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This paper also highlighted the need for researchers to become detailed, action oriented and multiscalar and to attend communications structure problems in enhancing the environmental activity.","[Odey, Emmanuel Alepu; Abo, Bodjui Olivier; Li, Zifu; Zhou, Xiaoqin] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Energy & Environm Engn, Beijing Key Lab Resource Oriented Treatment Ind P, Xueyuan 30, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Giwa, Abdulmoseen Segun] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Science & Technology Beijing; Tsinghua University,"Odey, EA (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Energy & Environm Engn, Beijing Key Lab Resource Oriented Treatment Ind P, Xueyuan 30, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",lordodey1@yahoo.com,"Giwa, Abdulmoseen Segun/ABG-4844-2021; Li, Zifu/AAF-4991-2020","Giwa, Abdulmoseen Segun/0000-0001-9905-0312; Odey, Emmanuel/0000-0002-2330-1864",,,,,50,0,0,5,34,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0048-7554,2191-0308,,REV ENVIRON HEALTH,Rev.

More adaptation options are available for vegetation than for any other resource category, allowing vegetation management to be applied across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Good progress has been made in strategic development and planning for climate change adaptation in the Northwest, although on-the-ground implementation is in the early stages. However, recent regulatory mandates plus the increasing occurrence of extreme events (drought, wildfires, insect outbreaks) provide motivation to accelerate the adaptation process in planning and management on federal lands and beyond.

There are, however, a range of factors that, unless recognized and dealt with effectively, can prevent or disrupt adaptation efforts by farmers. Barriers to climate change adaptation in Iran, and their characteristics, are under-researched. They need to be identified and investigated both to inform policymaking and to provide assistance to farmers. This study uses a qualitative approach to identify and explore such barriers in the Susa county, a historic region of Khuzestan Province in southwestern Iran. The data required for this research were obtained from a series of focus group discussions (n = 50) and semi-structured interviews with key informants (n = 50). Our results explored and categorized numerous responses to barriers to adaptation, such as social and cultural, economic, technological, informational, and market-based. It is important to note that, in reality, the margins between classifications are much subtler than many of the typologies indicate.

Our current understanding on the state of adaptation is limited, however, both globally and in Africa in particular. This study examines the status of adaptation in the Sahel by reviewing the primary peer review literature that reports concrete climate change adaptation actions. Based on an analysis of 70 peer review papers that document 414 discrete adaptations, we create a snap shot of adaptations developed between 1975 and 2015, and also calculate the percentages of adaptation. The results show that from a country to country perspective, Kenya has the highest number of reported adaptation actions (75 or 18.1%). The percentages indicate that the adaptive capacity of the entire study area is generally low for all the countries being that the highest country-level percentage is recorded in Kenya and it is 18%. Regionally, West Africa has more adaptation actions (261 or 63%) when compared to other regions of the Sahel. Regional level percentages suggest a higher level of adaptation at the regional level being that the percentage falls within the high scale range. The most commonly used adaptation actions reported are income diversification and water harnessing respectively. When categorized, technically related adaptation actions dominate the adaptation charts. The decade 2008-2016 recorded the highest number of adaptations (65.2%). Adaptation actions are also reported to be triggered by climatic and non-climatic drivers which both record high frequencies but the climatic drivers (98%) of adaptation are slightly dominant relative to the non-climatic drivers (95%). These results should be viewed as proxies of climate change adaptation as much information may be found in grey literature and non-peer review national communications which are left out here because of their relative low standardization and acceptability due to the absence of peer review.","[Epule, Terence Epule; Ford, James D.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke St West,Burnside Hall 614, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Lwasa, Shuaib] Makerere Univ, Dept Geog, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda; [Lepage, Laurent] Univ Quebec Montreal, Inst Sci Environm, Case Postale 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",McGill University; Makerere University; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Epule, TE (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke St West,Burnside Hall 614, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",terence.epule@mail.mcgill.ca,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013; Lwasa, Shuaib/G-3723-2014; Epule, Terence Epule/AAU-8878-2020","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Lwasa, Shuaib/0000-0003-4312-2836; ",Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada [756-2016-0003],Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by a grant from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada grant number 756-2016-0003.

As the risk of climate change impacts become more imminent, pressure for adaptation within transportation agencies to address these impacts continues to rise. The most logical strategy is to integrate consideration of adaptation projects into the long-range transportation planning (LRTP) process. To do this, tools and experience are needed to assist transportation agencies. The Climate Change Adaptation Tool for Transportation (CCATT) is a step-by-step method to evaluate climate change scenarios and impacts, inventory at-risk existing and proposed infrastructure, and assess mitigation practices to identify supporting adaptation efforts. This paper focuses on the application of CCATT to the Mid-Atlantic region using a case study on the Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO), the Metropolitan Planning Organization for northern Delaware.

Current water-management practices may not adequately cope with the impacts of climate change on the reliability of water supply, flood risk, health, agriculture, energy generation and aquatic ecosystems. Water managers can adapt to climate variability by structural change, such as increasing the size or number of dams, building desalination plants and transferring water between catchments; however, a broader set of alternatives with multiple beneficial outcomes for society and the environment should be explored. We discuss how modifying dam operations, 'dam reoperation', can assist with adaptation to climate change and help restore ecosystems. The main operating purpose of a dam (e. g. flood management, hydropower or water supply) will influence dam reoperation strategies. Reoperation may require integration across sectors or involve multiple dams, enhancing benefits such as water supply or hydropower while simultaneously achieving ecosystem restoration. We provide examples of lessons learned during extreme scenarios (e. g. floods and droughts), where operational flexibility has been demonstrated.

The eight adaptations including irrigation, nitrogen fertilizer application rates, transplanting date shifting were first assessed by the CERES-Rice model for the two rice cultivars (TDK8 and TDK11). These adaptations with the projected rice yields were used to design the climate change adaptation survey to investigate farmers' preference. One hundred smallholder farmers in Dongbung, Napork, Nakhaow, Hardvieng, and Parlai in Vientiane province, Laos were interviewed. For the rice yield projection, the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 were collected from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment-South Asia. The simulation results showed that the two adaptations (irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application rates) were beneficial to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on rice yields under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. On the other hand, the effects of the shifting transplanting dates were inconsistent, revealing that the transplanting date shifting may not be a sufficient adaption for this region to cope with climate change. The results from a climate change adaptation survey to investigate rice farmers' preference in Vientiane Capital showed that the farmers preferred installing an irrigation system and applying the doubling nitrogen fertilizer application rate (120 kg-N ha(-1)). However, many farmers replied that they are still indifferent to the adverse impacts of climate change on rice yields that can be reduced by implementing adaptation technologies, suggesting a further study to raise the farmers' awareness of climate change. It is concluded that this study can be useful to enhance food security of Lao PDR by providing efficacious agricultural managements which reflect farmers' preference.","[Chun, Jong Ahn; Lee, Eun-Jeong] APEC Climate Ctr, 12 Centum 7 Ro, Busan 48058, South Korea; [Kim, Daeha] Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea; [Lim, Youngah; Lee, Hyunjung] Korea Rural Econ Inst, 601 Bitgaram Ro, Jeollanam Do 58217, South Korea; [Kim, Chang-Gil] Seoul Natl Univ, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Inthavong, Thavone] Minist Agr & Forestry, Natl Agr & Forestry Res Inst, Vientiane, DEM REP CONGO; [Thammavong, Phomma] Natl Univ Laos, Fac Agr, Vientiane Capital, DEM REP CONGO",Jeonbuk National University; Jeonbuk National University Hospital; Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, D (corresponding author), Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea.;Lim, Y (corresponding author), Korea Rural Econ Inst, 601 Bitgaram Ro, Jeollanam Do 58217, South Korea.",daeha.kim@jbnu.ac.kr; limy@krei.re.kr,,,,,,,29,0,0,2,4,SOC AGRICULTURAL METEOROLOGY JAPAN,KOCHI,"C/O NISHIMURA TOSHADO CO LTD, 1-6-4 KAMIMACHI, KOCHI, JAPAN",0021-8588,1881-0136,,J AGRIC METEOROL,J.

In this paper, the effectiveness of six passive climate change adaptation measures applied at the level of building components is assessed using building energy simulations for three generic residential buildings as commonly built in - among others - the Netherlands: (1) detached house; (2) terraced house; (3) apartment. The study involves both residential buildings that are built according to the regulations and common practice in 2012, and residential buildings that were constructed in the 1970s, with a lower thermal resistance of the opaque and transparent parts of the building envelope. The climate change adaptation measures investigated are: (i) increased thermal resistance; (ii) changed thermal capacity; (iii) increased short-wave reflectivity (albedo); (iv) vegetation roofs; (v) solar shading; and (vi) additional natural ventilation. This paper quantifies the effectiveness of these climate change adaptation measures for new residential buildings as well as for renovation of the current building stock. The performance indicator is the number of overheating hours during a year. It is shown that exterior solar shading and additional natural ventilation are most effective for this performance indicator. Furthermore, increasing thermal insulation to reduce energy use for heating demands additional measures to prevent overheating. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This vulnerability raises concerns about rural households' well-being. Adapting to this vulnerability could mitigate some of the negative effects, agricultural shocks, and catastrophic risks associated with agricultural ecosystem destruction. Thus, the goal of this paper is to assess the impact of climate change adaptation strategies on rural households' sorghum productivity in Cameroon's semi-arid zone. On 721 households' secondary data, we used the endogenous switching regression model and the matching method. The results show that adopting adaptation strategies increases sorghum productivity in adapted households by approximately 21,99% more than in non-adapted households. In the absence of coping strategies, these households will lose 11,22% of their sorghum productivity. The importance of these findings adds to the debate about the need to implement climate change adaptation programmes and policies that address the concerns of all households.","[Tene, Nelson Sergeo Tagang] Univ Yaounde II, Fac Econ & Management, BP 1365, Yaounde, Cameroon",,"Tene, NST (corresponding author), Univ Yaounde II, Fac Econ & Management, BP 1365, Yaounde, Cameroon.",sergeo.tagang@yahoo.com,,"TAGANG TENE, Nelson Sergeo/0000-0002-7269-4000",,,,,67,0,0,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1886,,,COGENT SOC SCI,Cogent Soc.

Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative fieldwork was conducted on a small, remote island in the north of Fiji, during 2012. Interviews with community members on this island looked at their experiences and perceptions of disaster response and aid, and their expectations for the future. The perspectives of government and aid organisations involved in disaster response were compared with the remote community views. Findings - There is a prevalent view in Fiji of communities as having very high expectations of disaster relief aid, and being dependent on it. However, on a remote island where the community counts the wait for help in weeks rather than days, such expectations and dependence must be viewed in a different light. There is much to be learned from the resilience and self-help these communities have no choice but to exhibit. Originality/value - This paper helps to fill a gap in the disaster and climate change adaptation literature, by providing some insight into the experiences and perceptions of a remote outer island community, within the remote small island developing state of Fiji.","Univ Tasmania, Sch Social Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Johnston, I (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Social Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",ingrid.johnston@utas.edu.au,,,,,,,33,19,19,2,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0965-3562,1758-6100,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

Using a literature review, we examine issues climate adaptation education raises for the field of EE. We then describe example programs that integrate climate mitigation and adaptation, drawing from EE programs in New York City following devastating floods brought about by Hurricane Sandy.

This study further investigated whether the climate change adaptation strategies offered by the park manager would have a positive influence on travel intention of tourists. The results of this study showed that except for heat waves, events related to climate change such as stronger typhoon, heavy rain, unusual cold weather condition, mud sliding, forest fire, and the appearance of mosquitos would have a negative influence on travel intention, especially for the tourists with a low degree of place attachment.

This paper reviews various types of renewable energy technologies and their status, potential for adoption, relationship to climate change, and mitigative and adaptive roles in Nepal. Nepal has installed micro-hydro projects, solar power, improved cooking stoves, biogas technology, improved water mills, and wind energy to mitigate and adapt to climate change. There is a growing potential for renewable energy development in Nepal, such as hydropower, solar, wind energy, biogas, and improved cooking stoves. Roughly 70% of Nepal's energy consumption is generated from traditional energy sources while renewable energy accounts for approximately three percent. The gradual increase in the use of renewable energy has reduced greenhouse gas emissions and enhanced carbon sequestration. By adopting renewable energy technologies, Nepal has reduced emissions by 221,129 tCO(2)e from 2017 to 2018. Nepal's second Nationally Determined Contribution targets a 15% increase in national energy use from renewables with a reduction of 23% of CO2 emissions by 2030 using biogas and improved cooking systems. Furthermore, a significant increase in the adoption of renewable energy has become a pivotal strategy in adaptation to climate change in social, health, and economic sectors resulting in time savings, alternative income sources, improved health and educational status, local job opportunities, and the promotion of social capital. The benefits of adapting to climate change and mitigating CO2 emissions via renewable energy are significant at the local, national, and international levels. This study recommends that the government of Nepal focus work on energy policy reviews to address local energy demand and climate change issues by utilizing renewable energy resources at the local level, which has global implications.","[Suman, A.] Univ Maine, Dept Anthropol, Anthropol & Environm Policy, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Suman, A.] Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Suman, A.] Himalayan Conservat & Res Inst, Dolpa 21400, Nepal",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Suman, A (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Dept Anthropol, Anthropol & Environm Policy, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",suman.acharya@maine.edu,,,,,,,122,26,27,7,27,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

This review synthesizes research exploring the justice and equity issues inherent in climate change adaptation planning to lay the foundation for critical assessment of climate action plans from an equity perspective. The findings presented illuminate the ways in which inequity in adaptation planning favours certain privileged groups while simultaneously denying representation and resources to marginalized communities. The review reveals the specific ways inequity is experienced by disadvantaged groups in the context of climate change and begins to unpack the relationship between social inequity, vulnerability, and adaptation planning. This information provides the necessary background for future research that examines whether, and to what extent, urban adaptation plans prioritize social vulnerability relative to economic and environmental imperatives.","[Swanson, Kayleigh] Univ Waterloo, Sch Planning, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Swanson, K (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Sch Planning, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",kayleigh.swanson@uwaterloo.ca,,"Swanson, Kayleigh/0000-0003-2277-4413",,,,,60,1,1,23,30,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-7635,,,URBAN PLAN,Urban Plan.,,2021,6,4,,,,,287,297,,10.17645/up.v6i4.4399,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v6i4.4399,,,11,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,YH7RW,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000743361500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on a feminist political ecology framework and a mixed method approach, this research performs an empirical analysis of two case studies in the northern of India, one in the Himalayan Mountains and another in the Indian-Gangetic plains. It explores context-specific (i) influence of gender roles and responsibilities on on-farm agrobiodiversity management (ii) gendered expertise and knowledge related to agrobiodiversity and (iii) gendered preferences for practices and institutional arrangements for agrobiodiversity conservation linked to adaptation to climate change. In the Himalayan mountains women actively participate in crop and seed management decisions and tasks, and maintain informal institutions for seed and services exchanges in the case of crisis, which simultaneously favours high levels of agrobiodiversity and enhances women's social status. By contrast, in the Indio-Gangetic plains, where women from better-off households are socially secluded and women from poorer households work mainly as labourer to respond to high out-migration of men, they exercise less public control over agrobiodiversity, with their role being mainly invisible at the homestead and related to post-production tasks. We finally discuss as improved understanding of the links between gendered spaces, crops, tasks, social status, and agrobiodiversity management can facilitate the design of gender-sensitive policy interventions for conservation and adaptation to climate change.","[Ravera, Federica] Univ Cent Catalunya UVic UCC, Univ Vic, Chair Agroecol & Food Syst, C Laura 13, Vic 08500, Spain; [Ravera, Federica] FRACTAL Collect, San Remigio 2, Madrid 28022, Spain; [Ravera, Federica; Tarrason, David] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Pascual, Unai] Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change, Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor,Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Pascual, Unai] Basque Fdn Sci, Kerbasque, Maria Diaz de Haro 3,6th Floor, Bilbao 48013, Bizkaia, Spain; [Pascual, Unai] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Mittelstr 43, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Drucker, Adam G.; Bellon, Mauricio R.] Biovers Int, Via Tre Denari 472-A, I-00057 Rome, Italy",Universitat de Vic - Universitat Central de Catalunya (UVic-UCC); Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); ICREA; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of Basque Country; Basque Foundation for Science; University of Bern; Alliance; Bioversity International,"Ravera, F (corresponding author), Univ Cent Catalunya UVic UCC, Univ Vic, Chair Agroecol & Food Syst, C Laura 13, Vic 08500, Spain.;Ravera, F (corresponding author), FRACTAL Collect, San Remigio 2, Madrid 28022, Spain.;Ravera, F (corresponding author), CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain.",Federica.ravera@gmail.com,"Tarrason, David/B-7962-2019; Bellon, Mauricio/L-9546-2019; /C-4552-2008","Ravera, Federica/0000-0001-6282-6236; /0000-0002-2914-8055","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Fund Donors; Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (Spain) [IJCI-2015-25586]; AXA Research Fund","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR); Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (Spain)(Spanish Government); AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund)","This work was carried out in collaboration with Bioversity International and the Basque Centre for Climate Change.

Understanding how policies account for current and future risks becomes crucial to assess whether they will effectively contribute to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience. Exploiting the synergies between the well-established discipline of disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation may be an interesting option. In this paper we develop an Adaptation-Risk Policy Alignment (ARPA) framework to assess whether (and how) climate change adaptation policies integrate risk knowledge and information. ARPA displays a set of risk-based metrics that we test in four early adapters cities: Copenhagen, Durban, Quito and Vancouver. These cities are considered pioneer cities in the design and implementation of adaptation plans and have the potential to show the full applicability of ARPA. The framework is easy to apply and allows to systematically assess whether and how policies appropriately account for major risks and properly integrate risk management into the policy-making process. We propose that the framework can be used for self-evaluation and learning as well as in large-scale adaptation tracking exercises.","[Sainz de Murieta, Elisa; Galarraga, Ibon; Olazabal, Marta] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Leioa 48940, Basque Country, Spain; [Sainz de Murieta, Elisa] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AZ, England",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"de Murieta, ES (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Leioa 48940, Basque Country, Spain.",elisa.sainzdemurieta@bc3research.org; ibon.galarraga@bc3research.org; marta.olazabal@bc3research.org,"Olazabal, Marta/AFT-6957-2022; Sainz de Murieta, Elisa/D-4946-2012","Olazabal, Marta/0000-0002-3381-0654; Sainz de Murieta, Elisa/0000-0001-8120-3392","Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program; Spanish State Research Agency through Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation 2018-2022 [MDM-20170714]; Fundacion Biodiversidad, from the Spanish Ministry of Ecological Transition , through the project PROCESA; AXA Research Fund [4771]; Basque Government [POS_2018_2_0027]","Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program(Basque Government); Spanish State Research Agency through Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation 2018-2022; Fundacion Biodiversidad, from the Spanish Ministry of Ecological Transition , through the project PROCESA; AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Basque Government(Basque Government)","This research is funded by the Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program and by the Spanish State Research Agency through Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation 2018-2022 (Ref.

CCA literature provides little insight into understandings of manifestations of power that can create negative effects, especially in the context of South Asia. This review answers the question: How can CCA policy actors deal with the negative effects of power during the policy-making process? We used a two-layered systematic literature review to identify various manifestations of power that are responsible for negative effects in CCA policy-making in South Asia and to determine power-sensitive design principles (PDPs) to address these manifestations of power. We conclude that although the four PDPs are no panacea for dealing with the negative manifestations of power, they are useful considerations when engaged in long-term CCA policy processes.","[Vij, Sumit; Biesbroek, Robbert; Termeer, Katrien] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Stock, Ryan] Northern Michigan Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Geog Sci, Marquette, MI USA; [Gardezi, Maaz] South Dakota State Univ, Sociol & Rural Studies, Brookings, SD USA; [Ishtiaque, Asif] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Groot, Annemarie] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Environm Res, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Northern Michigan University; South Dakota State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Wageningen University & Research,"Vij, S (corresponding author), POB 8130,Hollandseweg 1, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",sumit.vij@wur.nl,"Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022; Vij, Sumit/AAV-6617-2021","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Termeer, Catrien/0000-0001-7396-1476; Ishtiaque, Asif/0000-0002-2196-9764; Stock, Ryan J./0000-0002-6218-3725; Gardezi, Maaz/0000-0003-0915-2652","Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) consortium under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa; Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada","Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) consortium under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa; Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR)","This work was carried out by the Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) consortium under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) with financial support from the UK Government's Department for International Development and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada.

This vulnerability is expressed in several ways, from exposure to sea level rises, to salt intrusion, and extensive droughts in some areas. Despite this rather negative trend, there are examples of initiatives where the vulnerability of SIDS can be reduced, and their resilience may be increased. Based on the paucity of the literature on concrete examples of successful climate change adaptation initiatives on SIDS, this paper presents an overview of pertinent challenges faced, and introduces two case studies from the Solomon Islands, which illustrate how much can be achieved by systematically pursuing adaptation strategies. The lessons learned from these case studies are outlined and some useful insights are provided, which may help SIDS to better foster the development opportunities with climate change adaptation offers to them.","[Filho, Walter Leal] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Filho, Walter Leal] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Chester St Manchester, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Ha'apio, Michael Otoara] Univ South Pacific, Pacific Ctr Environm & Sustainable Dev, Suva, Fiji; [Lutz, Johannes M.] CHC Higher Educ, Sch Social Sci, Carindale, Qld 4152, Australia; [Lutz, Johannes M.] Univ New South Wales UNSW, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Inst Global Innovat & Dev, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; Manchester Metropolitan University; University of the South Pacific; University of New South Wales Sydney; East China Normal University; East China Normal University,"Li, CL (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Inst Global Innovat & Dev, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Li, CL (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",w.leal@mmu.ac.uk; mhaapio@gmail.com; jluetz@chc.edu.au; 15598022233@163.com,"Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022; Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; Luetz, Johannes M./AAH-5131-2019","Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Luetz, Johannes M./0000-0002-9017-4471",,,,,57,12,12,5,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Climate change affects a wide demographic of the population in Bangladesh, and among those affected, women are more vulnerable to climate change impacts, as is evident from the history of climate-induced disasters in the country. Climate change increases women's socio-economic vulnerabilities by directly impacting their family's food security, water consumption, and livelihood. Hence, their roles and contributions are critical in responding through adaptation. Nonetheless, in Bangladesh, challenges remain to incorporate women as distinct actors and active agents in climate adaptation programs considering the gender power dynamics that exist.

Consideration can be given to their indigenous knowledge systems for an integrated approach to education, one which is more holistic and applicable to their context. This paper presents a systematic review of the indigenous knowledge systems (IKSs) deployed for climate change adaptation in the developing world and advances implications for climate change education. A set of inclusion criteria was used to screen publications derived from two databases and grey literature searches, and a total of 39 articles constituted the final selection. Postcolonial theory's lens was applied to the review of the selected publications to highlight indigenous people's agency, despite IKSs' marginalization through colonial encounters and the ensuing epistemic violence. The categories of social adaptation, structural adaptation, and institutional adaptation emerged from the IKS-based climate change adaptation strategies described in the articles, with social adaptation being the most recurrent. We discussed how these strategies can be employed to decolonise climate change education through critical, place-based, participatory, and holistic methodologies. The potential outcome of this is a more relatable and effective climate change education in a developing world context.","[Mbah, Marcellus; Ajaps, Sandra] Nottingham Trent Univ, Inst Educ, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England; [Molthan-Hill, Petra] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Business, Nottingham NG1 4FQ, England",Nottingham Trent University; Nottingham Trent University,"Mbah, M (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Inst Educ, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England.",marcellus.mbah@ntu.ac.uk; sandra.ajaps@ntu.ac.uk; petra.molthan-hill@ntu.ac.uk,,"Molthan-Hill, Petra/0000-0002-4425-1800; Ajaps, Sandra/0000-0003-2298-6897; Mbah, Marcellus F./0000-0002-4199-0819",Nottingham Trent University's QR GCRF,Nottingham Trent University's QR GCRF,This research and APC were funded by Nottingham Trent University's QR GCRF.,,63,13,13,8,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2021,13,9,,,,,,,4811,10.3390/su13094811,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13094811,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SC8FX,,"gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000650900700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analysis pointed out that floods and storms were perceived as major climate events affecting solar power plants in Thailand, followed by lightning and fires. Several countermeasures were taken, including hard countermeasures that require extensive investment. Following policy recommendations were derived from the climate-proofing investment scenario study. Policy support in terms of enabling regulations or financial incentives is needed for implementation of climate-proofing countermeasures. Public and private sectors need to secure sufficient budget for fast recovery after severe climate incidents. Measures must be taken to facilitate selection of climate-resilient sites by improving conditions of power purchase agreement or assisting winning bidders in enhancing climate adaptability of their sites.

Adaptation to climate change has become an important policy priority in the international negotiations on climate change in recent years. However, it has yet to become a major policy issue within developing countries, especially the LDCs. This article focuses on two LDCs, namely Bangladesh and Mali, where progress has been made regarding identifying potential adaptation options. For example, Bangladesh already has effective disaster response systems, and strategies to deal with reduced freshwater availability, and Mali has a well-developed programme for providing agro-hydro-meteorological assistance to communities in times of drought. However, much remains to be done in terms of mainstreaming adaptation to climate change within the national policyrnaking processes of these countries.

Climate change adaptation has proven to be more effective on a local scale, contributing to a bottom-up approach to the problems related to the changing climate. Portugal has approximately 2000 km of coastline, with 75% of the population living along the coast. Therefore, this research had the main objective of understanding adaptation processes at a local scale, using Portuguese coastal municipalities as a case study. To achieve this goal, document analysis and a questionnaire to coastal municipalities were applied, and the existence of measures rooted in nature-based solutions, green infrastructures, and community-based adaptation was adopted as a variable. The main conclusion from this research is that 87% of the municipalities that answered the questionnaire have climate change adaptation strategies implemented or in development. Moreover, it was possible to conclude that 90% of the municipalities are familiar with the concept of nature-based solutions and all the municipalities with adaptation strategies include green infrastructure. However, it was also possible to infer that community-based adaptation is a concept that most municipalities do not know about or undervalue.","[Ramalho, Margarida; Ferreira, Jose Carlos; Santos, Catarina Joia] NOVA Univ Lisbon, NOVA Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Campus Capar, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Ferreira, Jose Carlos; Santos, Catarina Joia] MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, ARNET Aquat Res Network, Campus Capar, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Ramalho, M (corresponding author), NOVA Univ Lisbon, NOVA Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Campus Capar, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal.",mf.ramalho@campus.fct.unl.pt,,"Ferreira, Jose Carlos/0000-0001-7917-7252; Joia Santos, Catarina/0000-0002-3012-1343",,,,,64,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

An endogeneity corrected stochastic frontier model which account for the endogeneity of adoption of adaptation strategies that is likely to depend on inefficiency was employed for the study. The result of the study revealed that adoption of adaption strategies is endogenously determined with rice productivity and hence, failure to account for endogeneity, the parameter efficiency estimates would be inconsistent The empirical results from the model show that quantity of labour, herbicides and the interaction of labour with both farm size and insecticides were statistically significant in explaining the variations in the efficiency of rice production in the study area. In addition, the study identified the combined effects of climate change adaptation strategies and some socioeconomic characteristics such as age, gender, education, farming experience, access to credit, access to information, membership of farmers in agricultural based cooperative and location of rice farmers as sources of technical inefficiencies. The study concluded that increase implementation of climate change adaptation strategies could enhance rice productivity and technical efficiency of rice farmers through timely access to climate change information and other related institutional support.

This article aims to seek stakeholders' opinions regarding how research and policy development can be bridged within the Cambodian water resources and agriculture sectors. The study used institutional ethnography methods with informants from government organizations, local academia, and development partners (DPs). This article identifies a number of challenges, and barriers for narrowing research policy development gaps, including: limited effectiveness of governmental policies and planning; lack of relevant information required to promote evidence-based planning and policy development; and communication barriers. Evidence-based planning is valued by government officials most when there is actual and effective implementation of policies and plans. In practice, this often implies that governmental policies and plans need be scoped and scaled down to meet the available budget, and thus be achievable. In the long term, it also means building the capacity for policy-relevant research on climate change adaptation within Cambodia. Engaging policy stakeholders in research process for co-producing adaptation knowledge, and introducing knowledge intermediaries are suggested by informants as means to narrowing gaps between research and policy development. The presence of the Cambodia's Prime Minister in research policy dialogues is recommended as important for attracting the attention of high-level policy makers.","[Dany, Va; Bajracharya, Bhishna; Regan, Michael] Bond Univ, Inst Sustainable Dev & Architecture, Gold Coast, Qld 4229, Australia; [Dany, Va] Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Dept Environm Sci, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Lebel, Louis] Chiang Mai Univ, Unit Social Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Taplin, Ros] Univ New S Wales, Australian Ctr Sustainable Min Practices, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",Bond University; Chiang Mai University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Dany, V (corresponding author), Bond Univ, Inst Sustainable Dev & Architecture, Gold Coast, Qld 4229, Australia.;Dany, V (corresponding author), Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Dept Environm Sci, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.",dva@bond.edu.au,"Bajracharya, Bhishna/ABC-6656-2021; Lebel, Louis/D-4130-2014","Bajracharya, Bhishna/0000-0003-2560-468X; Lebel, Louis/0000-0001-6187-6418; Regan, Michael/0000-0003-3415-6786",,,,,32,14,14,1,45,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

This study, therefore, examines approaches of a set of European Union (EU) member states (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (England)) to pursue a more coordinated approach to CCA policy. It specifically addresses the co-ordination approaches that the selected countries use for the development and implementation of their national CCA policies in the immediate period following the publication of the EU's 2013 Adaptation Strategy. The analysis demonstrates that while useful coordination processes have been established in the analyzed EU member states, they have difficulty in challenging existing institutional hierarchies and decision rules. Consequently, longer-term opportunities for managing CCA conflicts and synergies among sectoral policies have to date been limited.","[Russel, Duncan; den Uyl, Roos] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Stocker Rd, Exeter EX4 4PY, Devon, England; [Castellari, Sergio] Natl Inst Geophys & Volcanol, I-46128 Bologna, Italy; [Castellari, Sergio] European Environm Agcy, DK-1050 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Capriolo, Alessio] ISPRA Italian Natl Inst Environm Protect & Res, I-00144 Rome, Italy; [Dessai, Suraje] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Woodhouse, Leeds LS29, W Yorkshire, England; [Dessai, Suraje] Univ Leeds, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Sch Earth & Environm, Woodhouse, Leeds LS29, W Yorkshire, England; [Hilden, Mikael] Finnish Environm Inst, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Jensen, Anne; Orsted Nielsen, Helle] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Karali, Eleni] Hellen Minist Environm & Energy, Athens 11523, Greece; [Karali, Eleni] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Makinen, Kirsi] Minist Agr & Forestry, Helsinki 00023, Finland; [Weiland, Sabine] Catholic Univ Lille, European Sch Polit & Social Sci ESPOL, F-59800 Lille, France; [den Uyl, Roos] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, IVM, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Troeltzsch, Jenny] Ecol Inst, D-10717 Berlin, Germany",University of Exeter; Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV); Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA); University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Leeds; Finnish Environment Institute; Aarhus University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Russel, D (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Stocker Rd, Exeter EX4 4PY, Devon, England.",d.j.russel@exeter.ac.uk; sergio.castellari@ingv.it; alessio.capriolo@isprambiente.it; S.Dessai@leeds.ac.uk; mikael.hilden@ymparisto.fi; aj@envs.au.dk; ekarali8@gmail.com; Kirsi.makinen@mmm.fi; hon@envs.au.dk; sabine.weiland@univ-catholille.fr; rdenuyl@hotmail.com; jenny.troeltzsch@ecologic.eu,"Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009","Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364; Troltzsch, Jenny/0000-0003-0234-0781; CASTELLARI, Sergio/0000-0002-7809-2123; Nielsen, Helle Orsted/0000-0003-0486-9662; Jensen, Anne/0000-0001-8311-8693",European Community [308337],European Community(European Commission),"Funding for this research was received from the European Community's Seventh Framework Program under grant agreement 308337 (Project BASE).

As climate change has all the characteristics of a wicked problem, conventional strategies of governance do not seem to work. However, most conventional governance institutions are poorly equipped to enable, or at least tolerate, innovative strategies. This paper analyses the various strategies used to cope with the wicked problem of climate adaptation across scales, and the institutional conditions that enable or constrain such strategies. For this, it relies on a theoretical framework consisting of five governance capabilities that are considered crucial for coping with wicked problems: reflexivity, resilience, responsiveness, revitalization and rescaling. This framework is used to analyse the governance of adaptation to climate change at three different levels: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its activities to assist adaptation; the European Union and its climate adaptation strategy; and the Netherlands and its Delta Program. The results show that conventional governance strategies are rather absent and that mixtures of reflexive, resilient, responsive, revitalizing and rescaling strategies were visible at all levels, although not equally well developed and important. In contrast to the literature, we found many examples of enabling institutional conditions. The constraining conditions, which were also present, tend to lead more to postponement than to obstruction of decision-making processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Termeer, C. J.

However, some important sources of uncertainty will fall over time as more climate data become available. This paper investigates the effect on optimal investment decision-making of learning that reduces uncertainty. It develops a simple real options method to value options that are found in many climate-change adaptation contexts. This method modifies a binomial tree model frequently applied to climate-change adaptation problems, incorporating gradual learning using a Bayesian updating process driven by new observations of extreme events. It is used to investigate the timing, scale, or upgradable design of an adaptation project. Recognition that we might have more or different information in the future makes flexibility valuable. The amount of value added by flexibility and the ways in which flexibility should be exploited depend on how fast we learn about climate change. When learning will occur quickly, the value of the option to delay investment is high. When learning will occur slowly, the value of the option to build a small low-risk project instead of a large high-risk one is high. For intermediate cases, the option to build a small project that can be expanded in the future is high. The approach in this paper can support efficient decision-making on adaptation projects by anticipating that we gradually learn about climate change by the recurrence of extreme events.","[Guthrie, Graeme] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Guthrie, G (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",graeme.guthrie@vuw.ac.nz,,"Guthrie, Graeme/0000-0002-8497-0148",,,,,32,12,12,5,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

We examine the governance landscape at county level and evaluate bridges and barriers to integration that are mediated by linkages across scales within Kenya's multi-level governance system. Based on analysis of qualitative data collected through key informant interviews and workshop discussions in three counties, we argue that subnational governance in Kenya has achieved elements of convergence among CCA, DRR, and LR. We refer to the interconnections among these three agendas and the synergies that can be realized through greater integration among them as the CDR nexus. The analysis indicates a highly decentralized stakeholder landscape, with a diverse mix ofnational, county, and civil society organizations providing leadership and funding that drives emergent CDR priorities. Convergence has been enabled by informal working platforms for inter-sectoral collaboration that have brought together national government, county government and civil society organizations, rather than through formal mechanisms of policy integration established in law.

Vulnerability assessments address this need and are common across a range of disciplines and geographies; however, the practice of vulnerability assessment has revealed challenges that warrant further examination in a specific context. The U.S. Forest Service, a national forest-management agency in charge of 78 million hectares, has developed a collection of climate change vulnerability assessments to support adaptation by forest managers. We conducted a qualitative document analysis, informed by a series of research interviews with scientists, of 44 vulnerability assessments developed for the U.S. Forest Service. We found that partnerships between research scientists and land managers were central to the development of vulnerability assessments in the U.S. Forest Service. Assessment processes vary across settings. As the practice has developed, vulnerability assessments increasingly cover larger spatial extents and a broader range of resources associated with forest management. We identified ways in which vulnerability assessments can support decision-making, including approaches already in use and opportunities to improve practice. In particular, we discuss how vulnerability assessments are well-positioned to support the development of land-management plans, which set strategic management direction for periods of at least a decade. This paper provides baseline knowledge on a fundamental aspect of a large national forestry agency's climate change adaptation strategy, with many findings transferable to the study of other forest-management organizations.","[Timberlake, Thomas J.; Schultz, Courtney A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA",Colorado State University,"Timberlake, TJ (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA.",thomas.j.timberlake@gmail.com; courtney.schultz@colostate.edu,,"Schultz, Courtney/0000-0002-9972-7802; Timberlake, Thomas/0000-0003-3998-2657",USDA Forest Service Office of Sustainability and Climate,USDA Forest Service Office of Sustainability and Climate,This research was funded by the USDA Forest Service Office of Sustainability and Climate.,,69,6,6,1,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,NOV,2019,10,11,,,,,,,1030,10.3390/f10111030,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10111030,,,22,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Forestry,JV3JO,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000502262700096,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, it is hydro-meteorological hazards that affect an increasing number of people and cause increasingly large economic losses. Arising from the realisation that these four communities have been largely working in isolation and enjoyed only limited success in reducing vulnerability, there is an emerging perceived need to strengthen significantly collaboration and to facilitate learning and information exchange between them.

Surveys of 232 individuals showed a diversity of formal and informal institutions that relate to most aspects of rural life. Although direct activities related to climate change adaptation were limited, the activities and density of membership in rural local institutions could increase the community's adaptive capacity. Twenty-six semistructured interviews were also conducted with representatives of diverse local institutions who had some responsibility for agriculture, forests, conservation, or development. Local governmental institutions had not received any information from the national level and were limited in their knowledge of how to help communities respond to climate change. Although limited in their direct action on climate change, local nongovernmental organizations and international institutions act as bridging institutions with rural communities and could facilitate sharing of knowledge and innovation, thereby fostering resilience. Planning for climate change adaptation in Cameroon needs to build the capacity of diverse local institutions and improve the relationships between local and national-level adaptation planning.","[Brown, H.

This study aims to evaluate the overall progress of climate change adaptation in China during 2010-2018 in a quantitative manner. The Index for Climate Change Adaptation in China (ICCAC) has been thus developed by adopting the analytic hierarchy process weighting and expert scoring method. Namely, ICCAC is composed of national climate change impacts, adaptation actions in key sectors, adaptation progress in key sectors, and the national adaptation policy framework. Overall, the ICCAC and its four sub-indexes increased significantly from 2010 to 2018, on a yearly-basis. Each sub-index implied that the socio-economic impacts caused by climate change in China have been alleviated gradually; specifically, the mainstream endeavor of key sectors has witnessed remarkable progress, however, it is worth noting that the gap between individual adaptation actions and policies still exists; the implementation effect of policies in key sectors is not as affluent as that of actions; the current adaptation endeavor in key areas is still closely related to the mainstream business of corresponding competent ministries rather than adaptation-aimed actions; the national adaptation policy framework has been primarily formed, but there are still some deficiencies. As a result, the gap in China's adaptation process could be mainly manifested in the following five aspects: i) adaptation effectiveness assessment in forestry and urban infrastructure is urgently needed; ii) policies in marine and water resources sectors need structural reforms; iii) evaluation criteria for national adaptation are not necessarily sufficient; iv) the improvement of adaptive management efficiency has stagnated recently; and v) the adaptation works of relevant Ministries should be coordinated and put forward the corresponding strategies. Finally, this study presents four proposals: conducting an evaluation of adaptation actions in all key sectors, integrating climate change impacts into sectoral planning decisions, launching concrete action plans for adaptation, establishing a complete policy framework on adaptation.","[Fu Lin; Cao Ying; Kuang Shu-Ya] Natl Ctr Climate Change Strategy & Int Cooperat, Beijing 100035, Peoples R China; [Guo Hao] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Climate Change & Sustainable Dev, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Cao, Y (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Climate Change Strategy & Int Cooperat, Beijing 100035, Peoples R China.",caoying@ncsc.org.cn,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2017YFA0605301],"Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)","This research was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China under the project The Design of Framework and Mechanisms of Global Stocktake (2017YFA0605301).

This is mostly due to the declining global wild fish stock. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), similar to many other countries, has witnessed declining per capita fish availability in the last three decades due to such decreasing fish catch. The goal of this research is to study the benefits and socio-economic implication of adopting sustainable practices in face of climatic uncertainty in the UAE. More specifically, the study undertakes impact analyses of efforts made to sustain such valuable natural resource endowment, i.e., the fish stock. The sustainable practices of the fisheries sector include both hard and soft measures. Hard measures include construction of artificial fish habitats in the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Meanwhile, soft measures include enforcement of regulations that protect and conserve the fisheries' stocks. The economic impacts of these practices are evaluated assuming targeted shiftsbased on assumned scenarios of adaptations measures. To achieve the research objective empirical UAE economic data and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model used to perform the analysis. Results show that prices of fishery products and of other related commodities will decline which will benefit the consumers the most. Producers in all relevant directly and indirectly related economic sectors gain due to more sales, which offsets economic losses caused by the lower fish prices. Returns to factors of production, such capital, and labor, also change from sustainable practices. To measure these impacts this study measures the changes in consumer and producer welfare in the UAE due to the simulated targeted interventions. The limitation of such proposed climate change adaptation impact is that fishermen are profit maximizers and so they may underinvest in sustainable adaptations to climate change which implies that public sector (e.g. government) should play a positive role to sustain fisheries sectors practices in the long-term.","[Fathelrahman, Eihab; Muhammad, Safdar; Ullah, Rafi Ullah Tasbih] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Agribusiness, Coll Food & Agr, POB 15551, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Siddig, Khalid] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Al-Qaydi, Saif] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Geog & Urban Planning, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, POB 1555, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",United Arab Emirates University; Humboldt University of Berlin; United Arab Emirates University,"Fathelrahman, E (corresponding author), United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Agribusiness, Coll Food & Agr, POB 15551, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",Eihab.Fathelrahman@uaeu.ac.ae,"Siddig, Khalid/J-8789-2019; Fathelrahman, Eihab/V-5119-2019; Fathelrahman, Eihab/AAR-4533-2021; Siddig, Khalid/O-7829-2014","Fathelrahman, Eihab/0000-0002-4818-7041; Siddig, Khalid/0000-0003-1339-4507",,,,,25,3,3,0,5,UNITED ARAB EMIRATES UNIV,AL AIN,"P.

Climate information often remains underutilized and even when used, its influence on policy making is far from clear. In the Netherlands, climate stress tests were introduced to inform and stimulate climate adaptation policy on a municipal level. In the stress tests, risks and vulnerabilities were estimated for scenarios of extreme precipitation, heat stress, drought, and flooding. This article examines whether and how this new tool has effectuated mainstreaming of climate adaptation information into municipal policy. Based on interviews with municipal officials and document analysis we show that the stress tests did so along two general pathways. In the 'applied' pathway, the stress tests were used in an instrumental way to influence policy goals and measures. In the 'configuring' pathway, stress tests were primarily used for learning and persuasion, and mostly influenced problem perceptions and actor involvement. In the 'applied' pathway, the accuracy and resolution of the information were key factors; in the 'configuring' pathway, its influence depended on the accessibility of information and the kind of interaction during policy formulation. Which of the pathways predominated depended on how an adaptation problem fitted with existing policy arrangements. The findings show that stress tests are a promising tool for policy mainstreaming and for promoting local climate adaptation. They also highlight the importance of identifying the pathways of information use, in order to increase the impact of climate information.","[de Klerk, Ivo] MSG Sustainable Strategies, Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 330, NL-1012 RW Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Koppen, Kris; van Staveren, Martijn] Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"van Staveren, M (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",martijn@watermatters.nl,,,Dutch Research Council (NWO) [P15-21],Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"Martijn van Staveren's involvement in this work has been made possible through the Perspectief research program All-Risk with project number P15-21, which is partly financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) .",,63,1,1,3,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

We assess the factors influencing farmers' choice of climate change adaptation practices and associated impacts on household food security and poverty in Pakistan using comprehensive data from 950 farmers from its major provinces. A probit model was used to investigate the factors influencing the use of climate-change adaptation practices; the censored least absolute deviation (CLAD) was used to analyze the determinants of the number of adaptation practices used; and a propensity score matching (PSM) approach was employed to evaluate the impact of adaptation practices on food security and poverty levels. Adjustment in sowing time (22% households), use of drought tolerant varieties (15%) and shifting to new crops (25%) were the three major adaptation practices used by farmers in the study area. Results show that younger farmers and farmers with higher levels of education are more likely to use these adaptation practices, as do farmers that are wealthier, farm more land and have joint families. The number of adaptation practices used was found to be positively associated with education, male household heads, land size, household size, extension services, access to credit and wealth. Farmers adopting more adaptation practices had higher food security levels (8-13%) than those who did not, and experienced lower levels of poverty (3-6%). Climate change adaptation practices at farm level can thereby have significant development outcomes in addition to reducing exposure to weather risks. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the last decades, increasing evidence of growing land degradation are made apparent. A limited and depleting resource base, the reliance on climate-sensitive sectors and its large population, make South Asia highly vulnerable to climate change. Observed changes in climate include increases in temperature and increased monsoon variability and rainfall pattern leading to drought and flooding. Projected changes include increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, increasing cyclonic activity and higher variability of rainfall, all having enormous impacts on farming communities. At the same time, the region is rich in traditional agricultural knowledge (TAK), specialized in managing local agroecosystems to ensure food availability, tackling climatic risks and other ecological uncertainties. Particularly relevant is TAK related to land management to preserve soil fertility and avoid soil erosion. Ethnographic research is a valuable source of TAK, although this is rarely analysed with a climate change perspective. Based on a qualitative systematic review, and an expert's on-line survey, in this paper we review land management TAK and assess its potential for climate change adaptation.

Predominated by discourses on REDD + (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries) with little emphasis on adaptation there is a risk of lack of policy measures in addressing climate change in the Congo Basin. Forest products and ecosystem services provide security portfolios for the predominantly rural communities, and play major roles in national development programmes in both revenue and employment opportunities. Thus, raising the profile of forests in the policy arena especially in the twin roles of addressing climate change in mitigation and adaptation and achieving resilient development is crucial. Within the framework of the Congo Basin Forests and Climate Change Adaptation project (COFCCA) project, science policy dialogue was conducted to identify and prioritize forest based sectors vulnerable to climate change but important to household livelihoods and national development. The goal of the prioritization process was for the development of intervention in forest as measures for climate change adaptation in Central Africa. Participants constituted a wide range of stakeholders (government, Non Governmental Organizations, research institutions, universities, community leaders, private sectors etc.) as representatives from three countries directly involved in the project: Cameroon, Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo. Building on national priorities, four forest related sectors were identified as common priorities at the regional level for focus on climate change adaptation. These sectors included: (1) energy with emphasis on fuel wood and Charcoal; (2) Water principally quality, quantity, accessibility, etc.; (3) Food with emphasis on Non Timber Forest Products, and (4) Health linked to healthcare products (medicinal plants). Using these prioritized sectors, the project focused on addressing the impacts of climate change on local communities and the development of adaptation strategies in the three pilot countries of the Congo Basin region. The four sectors constitute the key for development in the region and equally considered as priority sectors in the poverty reduction papers. Focused research on these sectors can help to inject the role of forests in national and local development and their potentials contributions to climate change adaptation in national and public discourses. Mainstreaming forest for climate change adaptation into national development planning is the key to improve policy coherence and effectiveness in forest management in the region.","[Sonwa, Denis J.; Bele, Mekou Y.; Jum, Cyprain] Cent African Reg Off, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Nkem, Johnson N.] United Nations Dev Programme, Nairobi, Kenya; [Idinoba, Monica E.] African Union Commiss, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); African Union (AU),"Sonwa, DJ (corresponding author), Cent African Reg Off, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, POB 2008, Yaounde, Cameroon.",dsonwa@cgiar.org,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,Canadian Government through the International Development Research Center (IDRC); Department for International Development (DFID) of UK,Canadian Government through the International Development Research Center (IDRC); Department for International Development (DFID) of UK,This paper has been produced with financial contributions from the Canadian Government through the International Development Research Center (IDRC) and the Department for International Development (DFID) of UK to the Adaptation to Climate Change in Africa (ACCA) program.

Over the last decade we have witnessed many attempts to enhance the climate robustness of agriculture, urban development, water systems, and nature to an increase in flood and drought risks due to a higher variability in rainfall patterns and sea level rise. In the vulnerable Dutch delta, regional authorities have developed adaptation measures that deal with flood risk, the availability of fresh water, subsidence, and salt water intrusion. In view of all the uncertainties that surround climate change, scientists emphasize that it should be possible to make changes when conditions change or insights evolve. The concept of adaptive governance has been introduced to facilitate the process of climate adaptation. Adaptive governance requires the availability of governance arrangements that facilitate adaptiveness by being flexible to enable adjustment. Although flexible arrangements for adaptation to climate change make sense from an adaptive governance perspective, from a more bureaucratic, political, and legal perspective, there might be good reasons to make arrangements as solid and robust as possible. In this article we answer the question to what extent the arrangements used to implement various adaptation measures are really adaptive and what mechanisms play a role in obstructing the accomplishment of adaptive arrangements. By analyzing and comparing nine adaptation cases, dealing with different climate issues, and the arrangements used to implement them from both a governance and a legal perspective, we are able to get more detailed insight into the main characteristics of the selected arrangements, their degree of adaptiveness, and the main hampering mechanisms for the creation or functioning of adaptive arrangements.","[van Buuren, Arwin; van Leeuwen, Corniel; Eshuis, Jasper] Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Keessen, Andrea M.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Ctr Water Oceans & Sustainabil Law, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Ellen, Gerald Jan] Deltares, Urban Water & Subsurface Management, Delft, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Utrecht University; Deltares,"van Buuren, A (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,"Eshuis, Jasper/B-4547-2014; van Buuren, Arwin/I-6240-2013","Eshuis, Jasper/0000-0002-6000-0809; van Buuren, Arwin/0000-0002-8504-0495",Knowledge for Climate; Dutch Province of Noord-Brabant,Knowledge for Climate; Dutch Province of Noord-Brabant,This research was part of a research project within the Knowledge for Climate project: HSDR 3.5 Adaptive Implementation Arrangements.

Climate change adaptation is characterised as identifying and taking advantage of new business opportunities plus reducing physical risks. For adaptation strategies to be sustainable they should consider the environment, economy and society. While several adaptive ski industry strategies have been identified, not all can fulfil these criteria; some adaptive strategies could be perceived as unsustainable, or maladaptive. This paper provides a qualitative, perceptual study of ski industry stakeholders in Queenstown, New Zealand, addressing perceptions of climate change adaptation by the core industry, wider industry actors, local community and tourists. It answers two research questions: What are perceived as the main climate change adaptation strategies for Queenstown's ski industry? How do ski industry stakeholders perceive current adaptation strategies in terms of sustainability? It finds snowmaking central to addressing both current weather variability and medium/long-term future climate change. Ski-field operators use snowmaking to ensure the industry's economic sustainability, to extend seasons even beyond traditional norms, but with little consideration for environmental or social sustainability. It finds some local people questioning snowmaking on ethical and environmental grounds, and skier acceptance of snowmaking connected to activity preference.","Univ Otago, Dept Tourism, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Hopkins, D (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Tourism, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",debbie.hopkins@otago.ac.nz,,"Hopkins, Debbie/0000-0002-7778-8989",,,,,49,57,58,1,104,CHANNEL VIEW PUBLICATIONS,CLEVEDON,"FRANKFURT LODGE, CLEVEDON HALL, VICTORIA ROAD, CLEVEDON, BS21 7HH, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

However, relocation is among the costliest individual-level adaptation measures, meaning that it may be cost prohibitive for disadvantaged groups. As climate change continues to worsen, it is important to better understand how existing socioeconomic inequalities affect climate migration and how they may be offset. In this study we use network regression models to look at how internal migration patterns in the United States vary by disaster-related property damage, household income, and local-level disaster resilience. Our results show that post-disaster migration patterns vary considerably by the income level of sending and receiving counties, which suggests that income-based inequality impacts both individuals' access to relocation and the ability of disaster-afflicted areas to rebuild. We further find evidence that income-based inequality in post-disaster outmigration is attenuated in areas with higher disaster resilience, not due to increased relocation out of poorer areas but instead because there is decreased relocation from richer ones. This finding suggests that, as climate adaptation measures, relocation and resilience-building are substitutes, with the implication that resilience incentivizes in situ adaptation, which can be a long term drain on individual wellbeing and climate adaptation resources.","[Chen, Ted Hsuan Yun] Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Unioninkatu 37, Helsinki 00170, Finland; [Chen, Ted Hsuan Yun] Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Konemiehentie 2, Espoo 02150, Finland; [Lee, Boyoon] Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",University of Helsinki; Aalto University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Chen, THY (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Unioninkatu 37, Helsinki 00170, Finland.;Chen, THY (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Konemiehentie 2, Espoo 02150, Finland.",ted.hsuanyun.chen@gmail.com,,", Boyoon Lee/0000-0002-0052-0327; Chen, Ted Hsuan Yun/0000-0002-3279-8710","Academy of Finland [SA-320780, SA-320781]; Helsinki University Library",Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Helsinki University Library,"We thank Thomas Birkland, Louise Comfort, Lukas Fesenfeld, Vally Koubi, Isabelle Stadelmann-Steffen, Omer Yalcin, panel participants at PolNet 2021, APSA 2021, ECPR 2021, and ISA 2021, and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback.

We focus on the conditions under which actors participate in policy forums operating at higher or lower levels than the actors' own level. We draw upon theories of network science and transaction costs to formulate and test predictions about the overall prevalence of such cross-level linkages as well as the conditions under which policy actors engage in these linkages. We estimate an exponential random graph model using data collected from a survey of climate change adaptation policy actors participating in decision-making forums operating at different spatial levels within the Lake Victoria region in East Africa. Within this governance system, efforts to improve adaptive capacity across national boundaries and diverse vulnerable populations hinge on how well policy forums operating at regional and higher levels attract the participation of actors with access to information about local conditions, the efficiency with which actors can disseminate funding and technical resources through more local policy forums, as well as other processes that occur via cross-level linkages. We find that actors are less likely to engage in cross-level linkages compared to within-level linkages. Conditioning on this general tendency, actors are even less likely to participate in forums operating at lower levels in which their collaborators also participate. By contrast, actors are more likely to participate in forums operating at lower levels when influential actors jointly participate. These findings, which highlight distinct roles of social and political capital in cross-level forum participation, have implications for efforts to improve climate change adaptation governance in the Lake Victoria region, as well as other multilevel governance systems.","[Hamilton, Matthew] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lubell, Mark] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Namaganda, Emilinah] Makerere Univ, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Climat Sci, Kampala, Uganda",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Davis; Makerere University,"Hamilton, M (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Hamilton, Matt/HJP-9671-2023","Hamilton, Matthew/0000-0003-0509-4467; Lubell, Mark/0000-0001-5757-7116; Namaganda, Emilinah/0000-0003-3095-5484",NSF Division of Graduate Education (DGE) [0801430]; Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT; UC Davis,NSF Division of Graduate Education (DGE)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)); Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT; UC Davis,"We thank Shuaib Lwasa, Paul Onyango, and Charles Mundia for valuable recommendations and logistical assistance preceding and during fieldwork.

This will have a significant impact on the design of buildings, how they are kept cool and how they are weathered against more extreme climatic conditions. The residential sector is already a significant environmental burden with high associated operational energy. Climate change, and a growing population requiring residence, has the potential to exacerbate this problem seriously. New paradigms for residential building design are required to enable low-carbon dioxide operation to mitigate climate change. They must also face the reality of inevitable climate change and adopt climate change adaptation strategies to cope with future scenarios. However, any climate adaptation strategy for dwellings must also be cognisant of adapting occupant needs, influenced by ageing populations and new technologies. This paper presents concepts and priorities for changing how society designs residential buildings by designing for adaptation. A case study home is analysed in the context of its stated aims of low energy and adaptability.

Even though adaptation is not treated as a salient issue in most of the municipalities studied, regional level coordination efforts are creating a hybrid management space that aids mediation between local knowledge and expert adaptation knowledge.

Men and women farmers equally experience climate-change related effects, including drought, short rainy seasons and increased pest and disease incidence. Our study relies on exploratory data analysis of 1001 households surveyed in four sites in 2016. Farmers surveyed preferred early-maturing, heat-tolerant, high-yielding, and pest- and disease-resistant varieties, all important climate-adaptive traits. Seed systems of the focus crops studied are largely informal-overall, 68% women and 62% men use their own seed, indicating women's higher reliance on 'informal' seed and information sources. Only 21% of respondents reported interacting with seed experts who are affiliated with formal organizations. Both formal and informal organizations play a key role in providing access to climate-adapted seed/information, with access for men and women varying across the countries studied. There is a need to support further development of those connections, building on existing social networks. We conclude that inclusive and gender-responsive context- and country-specific seed interventions will ensure equitable outcomes, increase women's empowerment and strengthen both formal and informal seed systems for more effective climate-change adaptation.","[Marimo, Pricilla; Otieno, Gloria] Alliance Biovers Int & Int Ctr Trop Agr, POB 24384, Kampala, Uganda; [Njuguna-Mungai, Esther] Int Livestock Res Inst, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Vernooy, Ronnie] Alliance Biovers Int & Int Ctr Trop Agr, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Halewood, Michael] Alliance Biovers Int & Int Ctr Trop Agr, Via San Domenico, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Fadda, Carlo] Alliance Biovers Int & Int Ctr Trop Agr, POB 30677, Nairobi 001001, Kenya; [Mulumba, John Wasswa] Natl Agr Res Org, POB 40, Entebbe, Uganda; [Nyamongo, Desterio Ondieki] Kenya Agr & Livestock Res Org, Genet Resources Res Inst, POB 781, Kikuyu 00902, Kenya; [Mollel, Margaret] Trop Pesticides Res Inst, POB 3024, Arusha, Tanzania",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Marimo, P (corresponding author), Alliance Biovers Int & Int Ctr Trop Agr, POB 24384, Kampala, Uganda.",p.marimo@cgiar.org; g.otieno@cgiar.org; E.Njuguna@cgiar.org; r.vernooy@cgiar.org; m.halewood@cgiar.org; C.Fadda@cgiar.org; john.mulumba@naro.go.ug; desterio.nyamongo@kalro.org; mjk_mollel@yahoo.com,,"Vernooy, Ronnie/0000-0002-8864-4892; MARIMO, PRICILLA/0000-0003-3754-7176",International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) through the Benefit-Sharing Fund [W2B-PR26]; CGIAR Trust Fund; National Science Foundation [SMA-1950766],International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) through the Benefit-Sharing Fund; CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was funded by the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) through the Benefit-Sharing Fund under Grant No. W2B-PR26.

UKCIP has been operating since 1997 to support decision-makers' assessments of their vulnerability to climate change so that they can plan how to adapt. Whilst stakeholder engagement is now generally regarded as vital to ensure that research meets the needs of decision-makers for information, this usually means that stakeholders are positioned in a 'consultative' role in research. In contrast, the UKCIP aims to bridge the gap between research and policy so that decision-makers take control to produce research in ways that are useful to them. The Programme has been flexible and was developed incrementally, with increased scientific understanding, taking advantage of collaborative funding and facilitating long-standing partnerships. Whilst the core framework of scenarios and tools has been developed centrally, most studies have been stakeholder-funded and led. The Programme's results suggest that if decision-makers are supported, capacity is built for assessments, and crucially, research outputs are directly applicable to their ongoing work and strategic planning. This capacity-building has worked across scales and sectors and is an effective route to mainstreaming climate change adaptation. The implication, therefore, is that more support should be given by funding agencies to develop institutional capacity to support adaptation to climate change in both the private and public sectors.","Environm Agcy, Bristol BS32 4UD, Avon, England; Acclimatise, Nottingham NG25 0BY, England; Govt Off London, London SW1P 4RR, England",,"Hedger, MM (corresponding author), Environm Agcy, Rio House,Waterside Dr,Aztec W, Bristol BS32 4UD, Avon, England.",mmhedger@mycos.demon.co.uk,,,,,,,66,50,50,0,25,JAMES & JAMES SCIENCE PUBLISHERS LTD/EARTHSCAN,LONDON,"8-12 CAMDEN HIGH STREET, NW1 0JH LONDON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

A study conducted in the urban local government authorities of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, revealed low levels of knowledge and skills related to policies, plans and strategies pertinent to climate change and vulnerability assessments. As an entry point for climate change adaptation and mitigation interventions to be included in the local authority plans and budgets, there is a need to build capacity of the technical cadres.

This study assesses the impact of the Nepal government's efforts to promote its Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) and its applicability to other least developed countries (LDCs). Based on data gathered from two field studies in Nepal, the research shows that the Nepal's LAPA has succeeded in mobilizing local institutions and community groups in adaptation planning and recognizing their role in adaptation. However, the LAPA approach and implementation have been constrained by sociostructural and governance barriers that have failed to successfully integrate local adaptation needs in local planning and increase the adaptive capacity of vulnerable households. This paper describes the mechanisms of suitable governance strategies for climate change adaptation specific to Nepal and other LDCs. It also argues the need to adopt an adaptive comanagement approach, where the government and all stakeholders identify common local- and national-level mainstreaming strategy for knowledge management, resource mobilization, and institutional development, ultimately using adaptation as a tool to handle global change.","[Regmi, Bimal Raj; Star, Cassandra] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Social & Policy Studies, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England",Flinders University South Australia; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Leal, W (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England.",w.leal@mmu.ac.uk,"Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022; Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021","Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Star, Cassandra/0000-0003-2648-6603",,,,,46,25,25,6,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

These losses are anticipated to grow substantially, in part as a result of the impacts of climate change. In this paper, we investigate the process of translating climate risk data into action for the city level. We apply a commonly used decision-framework as our backdrop and explore where in this process climate risk assessment and normative political judgements intersect. We use the case of flood risk management in Cork city in Ireland to investigate what is needed for translating risk assessment into action at the local city level. Evidence presented is based on focus group discussions at two stakeholder workshops, and a series of individual meetings and phone-discussions with stakeholders involved in local decision-making related to flood risk management and adaptation to climate change, in Ireland. Respondents were chosen on the basis of their expertise or involvement in the decision-making processes locally and nationally. Representatives of groups affected by flood risk and flood risk management and climate adaptation efforts were also included. The Cork example highlights that, despite ever more accurate data and an increasing range of theoretical approaches available to local decision-makers, it is the normative interpretation of this information that determines what action is taken. The use of risk assessments for decision-making is a process that requires normative decisions, such as setting 'acceptable risk levels' and identifying 'adequate' protection levels, which will not succeed without broader buy-in and stakeholder participation. Identifying and embracing those normative views up-front could strengthen the urban adaptation process-this may, in fact, turn out to be the biggest advantage of climate risk assessment: it offers an opportunity to create a shared understanding of the problem and enables an informed evaluation and discussion of remedial action.

These systems, however, are acutely sensitive to climate change. In Andean water towers, which supply freshwater to more than 100million people, climate change adaptation planning is critical. Adaptation plans, however, are more than just documents; they inform and are informed by sociopolitical processes with major implications for hydrosocial relations in mountain water towers. Noting the inadequate scholarly attention to climate change in relation to the hydrosocial cycle, we draw on the hydrosocial literature to examine and compare climate change adaptation plans from mountain water tower regions of Piura, Peru, and the Santiago metropolitan region in Chile. Through a hydrosocial lens, we find that these plans reinforce hydrosocial relations such as upstream-downstream disparities that tend to exclude those who access water informally, have differing ontologies of water, or have livelihoods outside of dominant economic sectors. Our analysis suggests that the Andean plans reinforce current water access patterns, missing a key opportunity to reenvision more inclusive hydrosocial relationships in the context of a changing climate. This study encourages further engagement between the climate change adaptation and hydrosocial literature within and beyond mountain water tower regions. Critical hydrosocial analysis of adaptation plans reveals gaps that must be addressed in future planning and implementation efforts if adaptation is going to provide meaningful pathways for change.","[Mills-Novoa, Megan; Borgias, Sophia L.; Crootof, Arica; Thapa, Bhuwan; Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Mills-Novoa, Megan; Borgias, Sophia L.; Crootof, Arica; Thapa, Bhuwan; Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Thapa, Bhuwan] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Kathmandu, Nepal; [de Grenade, Rafael] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [de Grenade, Rafael] Univ Arizona, Southwest Ctr, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Mills-Novoa, M (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.;Mills-Novoa, M (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.",mmillsnovoa@email.arizona.edu; sborgias@email.arizona.edu; acrootof@email.arizona.edu; bthapa@email.arizona.edu; rdegrenade@email.arizona.edu; cascott@email.arizona.edu,,,"Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research project [CRN3056]; U.S. National Science Foundation [NSF] [GEO-1128040]; U.S. Agency for International Development; U.S. National Academies of Sciences Project PEER II [2-359]; NSF [DEB-101049]; International Water Security Network - Lloyd's Register Foundation; CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems; International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development under its Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience program; Directorate For Geosciences; ICER [1128040] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research project; U.S. National Science Foundation [NSF](National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); U.S. National Academies of Sciences Project PEER II; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); International Water Security Network - Lloyd's Register Foundation; CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems; International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development under its Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience program; Directorate For Geosciences; ICER(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","This work would not have been possible without the generous support of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research project CRN3056 (which is supported by U.S. National Science Foundation [NSF] Grant GEO-1128040); U.S. Agency for International Development and U.S. National Academies of Sciences Project PEER II 2-359 (linked to NSF Grant DEB-101049); the International Water Security Network funded by Lloyd's Register Foundation (a charitable foundation in the United Kingdom helping to protect life and property by supporting engineering-related education, public engagement, and the application of research); the CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems; and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development under its Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience program.",,38,13,13,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2469-4452,2469-4460,,ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR,Ann.

The results of the multinomial logit model indicate that the mode of access to land, access to information on climate change, agricultural extension, agricultural experience and access to credit constitute the main endogenous strategies developed by the producers to counteract the impacts of climate change. Finally, in order to consolidate these different strategies developed by farmers, increased awareness campaigns among farmers on the importance of adapting to climate change should be encouraged.","[Soumaoro, Tiemoko] Gaston Berger Univ, Econ & Management, St Louis, Senegal",,"Soumaoro, T (corresponding author), Gaston Berger Univ, Econ & Management, St Louis, Senegal.",soumaoro.tiemoko@ugb.edu.sn,,"SOUMAORO, Tiemoko/0000-0003-0182-2914",,,,,28,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0343-2521,1572-9893,,GEOJOURNAL,GeoJournal,DEC,2022,87,6,,,,,5413,5424,,10.1007/s10708-021-10516-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10516-0,,OCT 2021,12,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,5Z2SK,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000703358600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The use of the territory and its environmental resources at levels capable of ensuring the regeneration and resilience of populations and ecosystems, as well as the structuring of international and national environmental governance capable of equating environmental vulnerabilities under different prisms, has become a challenge to be shared by many countries. The sharing this challenge is reflected in a number of international legal instruments such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The purpose of this article is to analyze how the Climate Change Conventions have been internalized in Brazil and to what extent climate change adaptation policy is translated into legislative instruments related to the prevention of climatic risks. The study, based on a qualitative document analysis, shows that Brazil has built a robust legislative framework for the management of natural resources and risk management.

However, there has been limited analysis of the extent to which urban planning policy documents addresses climate change adaptation and or mitigation. There is a need to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, and to be well adapted to this change (in line with the Paris Agreement). Achieving this goal will assist in limiting damage and loss to humans and the natural environment. This paper presents a detailed qualitative and quantitative evaluation of urban planning documents (policy, regulation and law) in the state of Victoria, Australia, and the degree to which climate change mitigation and adaptation (with a focus on sea level rise) are addressed and integrated. Two scales of government (state and local) were analysed across three policy disciplines (urban planning, climate change and flood management). The evaluation framework contributes to the few tools for analyzing legislation, regulation and strategic policies for climate change adequacy. The findings reveal limited climate change adaptation and mitigation actions in urban planning documents. Additionally, there is limited integration of adaptation and mitigation actions. Important opportunities for better alignment of policies across disciplines and government levels in line Paris Agreement goals are identified, to ensure implementation in decisions made about land use and development. The analysis finds that urban planning policy must do more to include and integrate climate change adaptation and mitigation actions.","[Hurlimann, Anna; Browne, Geoffrey R.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Moosavi, Sareh] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Fac Architecture, Brussels, Belgium",University of Melbourne; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Hurlimann, A (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",anna.hurlimann@unimelb.edu.au; sareh.moosavi@ulb.ac.be; geoffrey.browne@unimelb.edu.au,,"Moosavi, Sareh/0000-0002-4819-2772; Browne, Geoffrey R/0000-0003-1990-3050","Faculty of Architecture Building and Planning Strategic Research Initiative Grant 2018-2019 at the University of Melbourne, Australia","Faculty of Architecture Building and Planning Strategic Research Initiative Grant 2018-2019 at the University of Melbourne, Australia","Funding for this research was provided by a Faculty of Architecture Building and Planning Strategic Research Initiative Grant 2018-2019 at the University of Melbourne, Australia.",,74,38,37,29,90,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,FEB,2021,101,,,,,,,,105188,10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105188,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105188,,JAN 2021,9,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PQ8WG,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000606823100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we present seven recommended practices intended to help scientists, managers, funders and other stakeholders carry out a coproduction project, one recommended practice to ensure that partners learn from attempts at coproduction, and two practices to promote coproduction at a programmatic level. The recommended practices focus research on decisions that need to be made, give priority to processes and outcomes over stand-alone products, and allocate resources to organizations and individuals that engage in coproduction. Although this article focuses on the coproduction of actionable science for climate change adaptation and natural resource management, the approach is relevant to other complex natural-human systems.","[Beier, Paul] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Hansen, Lara J.] EcoAdapt, POB 11195, Bainbridge Isl, WA 98110 USA; [Helbrecht, Lynn] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, 1111 Washington St SE, Olympia, WA 98501 USA; [Behar, David] San Francisco Publ Util Commiss, 525 Golden Gate Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102 USA",Northern Arizona University; Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW),"Beier, P (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",paul.beier@nau.edu,,,,,,,37,179,179,3,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1755-263X,,,CONSERV LETT,Conserv.

We used a geographic information system and statistical analysis to compare the spatial relationships among single-family residential water use patterns, land use characteristics, and temperature in Portland, Oregon and Phoenix, Arizona. We developed mean water use patterns at the census block group level using data from 2002 to 2009 in Portland and from 2000 to 2008 in Phoenix. These mean values were used to estimate the localized temperature sensitivity of water use in each census block group through an ordinary least squares regression with summer average air temperature. Taking the slopes of regression estimates as our dependent variable, we examined spatial relationships among temperature-sensitive water use patterns, housing density, impervious surfaces, low vegetation, and tree canopy extent. Temperature sensitive water use was found to be positively correlated with low vegetation and negatively correlated with impervious surfaces in both cities. Tree canopy coverage tends to increase with sensitivity in Portland, while the reverse relationship is found for Phoenix. Regression analysis indicates that building density explained the most variation in the dependent variable in Portland whereas, in Phoenix, the strongest correlations related to vegetation patterns. A comparative approach highlights the complex, localized correlations that exist among local climate regimes, urban landscapes, and water use patterns. Census block group-level water use analyses equips water providers with detailed information on the sensitivity of local water use to temperature variation, which could prove valuable to developing a viable municipal climate change adaptation strategy.

Each of these approaches has clear benefits as well as significant limitations. This review considers concepts and approaches that support the potential for different disciplines to complement each other in developing a more in-depth understanding of farming systems and their adaptive potential. For this purpose, a Mixed Methods Framework is presented, using examples from a pilot study of a New Zealand dairy farm to illustrate the complementarities between the two current approaches.

By this decision the COP, requested the SBSTA to develop a structured 5-year programme of work of the SBSTA on the scientific, technical and socio-economic aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change. Consequently, the COP, by its decision 2/CP.11, adopted the Five-year programme of work of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change Finally during COP12 this programme was approved as Nairobi Work Programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change. This programme has fundamental significance not only for developing countries, but also for industrialized nations in which some sectors of the or social life are particularly vulnerable to climate change, specifically, inter alia EIT countries and new EU Member States. Further development of this adaptation programme economy should contain steps that provide optimum economic and social effectiveness, risk management, identification of vulnerable sectors and gaps in knowledge, preparation of a list of policy options, including an analysis of cost effectiveness, selection of the most effective policies, and a preparedness implementation plan. In Poland the preliminary adaptation programme covered agriculture, water management, and coastal zone management. For the time being, gaps in knowledge and preparedness measures have been identified. An estimation of possible impact on these areas was based on chosen GCMs, and sea level rise IPCC scenarios. In conclusion, it was stated that the results achieved should be seen as a first step forward and a more comprehensive study is necessary to update the results and cover other sectors of the economy, such as health protection, spatial planning, ecosystems and forestry, and to develop specific guidelines and recommendations for policy-makers.","Inst Environm Protect, PL-00548 Warsaw, Poland",Institute of Environmental Protection - National Research Institute,"Sadowski, M (corresponding author), Inst Environm Protect, Krucza Str 5-11D, PL-00548 Warsaw, Poland.",Maciej.Sadowski@ios.edu.pl,,,,,,,12,3,4,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Socio-economic drivers also increase exposure to natural hazards, accelerate environmental degradation, and require adaptive governance structures to moderate negative impacts. Here, we use a social network analysis (SNA) combined with further qualitative information to identify barriers and enablers of adaptive governance in the Barcelona metropolitan area. By analyzing how climate change adaptation is mainstreamed between different administrative scales as well as different societal actors, we can determine the governance structures and external conditions that hamper or foster strategical adaptation plans from being used as operational adaptation tools. We identify a diverse set of stakeholders acting at different administrative levels (local to national), in public administration, science, civil society, and the tourism economy. The metropolitan administration acts as an important bridging organization by promoting climate change adaptation to different interest groups and by passing knowledge between actors. Nonetheless, national adaptation planning fails to take into account local experiences in coastal protection, which leads to an ineffective science policy interaction and limits adaptive management and learning opportunities. Overcoming this is difficult, however, as the effectiveness of local adaptation strategies in the Barcelona metropolitan area is very limited due to a strong centralization of power at the national level and a lack of polycentricity. Due to the high touristic pressure, the legal framework is currently oriented to primarily meet the demands of recreational use and tourism, prioritizing these aspects in daily management practice. Therefore, touristic and economic activities need to be aligned to adaptation efforts, to convert them from barriers into drivers for adaptation action. Our work strongly suggests that more effectively embedding adaptation planning and action into existing legal structures of coastal management would allow strategic adaptation plans to be an effective operational tool for local coastal governance.","[Sauer, Inga J.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegraphenberg A 56, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Sauer, Inga J.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Roca, Elisabet; Villares, Miriam] Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Jordi Girona 1-3, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Sauer, IJ (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegraphenberg A 56, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.;Sauer, IJ (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",inga.sauer@pik-potsdam.de; elisabet.roca@upc.edu; miriam.villares@upc.edu,"Roca, Elisabet/L-5141-2014","Roca, Elisabet/0000-0001-9432-0029",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MINECO/AEI/FEDER) [CTM2017-83655-C2-1-R]; Area Metropolitana de Barcelona; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the research project SLICE [FKZ: 01LA1829A],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MINECO/AEI/FEDER); Area Metropolitana de Barcelona; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the research project SLICE(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This research was performed in the framework of the M-CoastAdapt project (CTM2017-83655-C2-1-R), funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MINECO/AEI/FEDER), the Governance Map of the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona project funded by rea Metropolitana de Barcelona and supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the research project SLICE (FKZ: 01LA1829A).",,60,4,4,2,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Theoretically, insurance premiums signal the level of risk faced by each household, and incentivize homeowners to invest in adaptive action, such as retrofitting, or drainage work, to reduce premiums. Where risk is considered too high by insurance markets, housing is devalued, in theory leading to retreat from risky areas. In this review article, we evaluate the suitability of private insurance as a mechanism for climate adaptation at a household and community level. We find a mismatch between social understandings of responsibility for climate risks, and the technocratic, market-based home insurance products offered by private insurance markets. We suggest that by constructing increasingly individualized, technical, and calculative evaluations of risk, market-based models of insurance for extreme weather events erode the solidaristic and collective discourses and practices that support adaptive behavior.

The study site is one of the climate change prone areas affected by climate variability and extreme events. Therefore, a better understanding of area-specific and adaptation is crucial to develop and implement proper adaptation strategies that can alleviate the adverse effects of climate change. Therefore, this work was aimed to identify determinants of farmers' adoption of climate change adaptation strategies in Gondar Zuria District of northwestern Ethiopia. Primary data were collected through semi-structured questionnaires, observation, and interviews. Besides, the secondary data were also obtained from journal articles, reports, governmental offices, and the internet. The Multinomial and Binary logistic regression models with the help of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (21th edition) were used to analyze the data. The multinomial logistic regression model was used to estimate the influence of the socioeconomic characteristics of sample households on the farmer's decision to choose climate change adaptation strategies. The result showed that age, gender, family size, farm income, and farm size had a significant influence on the farmers' choice of climate change adaptation strategies. The result also revealed that crop failure, severe soil erosion and shortages of water are major climate change-related problems than others. In order to alleviate these problems, farmers have implemented mixed farming, mixed cropping, early and late planting (changing sowing period), use of drought-resistant crop varieties, application of soil and water conservation techniques, shifting to non-farm income activities and use of irrigation. In contrast, access to climate information, total annual farm income, and market access variables are significant adoption determinants of climate change adaptation strategies by farmers' in the study site. Therefore, we recommend future adaptation-related plans should focus on improving climate change information access, improving market access and enhancing research on the use of rainwater harvesting technology.","[Marie, Mequannt; Yirga, Fikadu] Oda Bultum Univ, Coll Nat Resource & Environm Sci, Chiro, Ethiopia; [Haile, Mebrahtu; Tquabo, Filmon] Mekelle Univ, Coll Dryland Agr & Nat Resources, Mekelle, Ethiopia",Mekelle University,"Haile, M (corresponding author), Mekelle Univ, Coll Dryland Agr & Nat Resources, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",mebrahtu.haile@yahoo.com,"Haile, Mebrahtu/V-8695-2019; Gebremariam, Filmon Tquabo FT/D-6459-2019","Haile, Mebrahtu/0000-0002-7043-0976; Gebremariam, Filmon Tquabo FT/0000-0002-1076-9644","Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Ethiopia","Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Ethiopia","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Ethiopia.",,44,50,50,4,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,APR,2020,6,4,,,,,,,e03867,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03867,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03867,,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,LI9MM,32373748,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000529800500181,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adaptation is about risk reduction, the pursuit of opportunity and rethinking investments, planning and behaviour, which is also in many ways what development is about. Yet a distinction between the two is necessary for the existing funding architecture, and to ensure that adaptation is more than just business as usual. We summarise a debate held at the Adaptation Futures 2018 conference to explore whether global development is adapting to climate change, with one side arguing for, the other arguing against. The outcome suggests no obvious winner, in part because there is no clear distinction between what qualifies as exclusively adaptation or development, since some dimensions of each put them in opposition to one another, while other dimensions are mutually reinforcing. Yet, to say that adaptation will take place through development does not sufficiently underscore the need for development to be rethought. Adaptation will require transformative development - that is, development that takes everyone into account and places issues of equity and justice in the centre and adheres to principles of sustainability.","[Schipper, E.

Research into adaptation to climate change in smallholder agriculture has often used capital-based indicator frameworks, with only limited consideration of the cognitive dimensions influencing adaptation motivation. In this study, we interviewed 327 farmers in far-western Nepal and the responses were used in structural equation modelling to quantify determinants of adaptation motivation. Results indicate that farmers with a higher level of adaptation appraisal are motivated to adapt, whereas the higher level of threat appraisal exhibited a weak influence. Social drivers such as incentives and subjective norms had a weak effect. Risk experience influenced adaptation motivation negatively. Adaptation cost was negatively related to the adaptation appraisal. Determinants of adaptation motivation varied across agroecosystems. These results suggest that effective adaptation policies must emphasise on the factors that positively contribute to adaptation motivation (e. g., adaptation efficacy) and target interventions that break down the barriers to adaptation (e.g., adaptation cost), while boosting trust and confidence in farmers to adaptation measures. Findings can inform adaptation policies in similar smallholder contexts of Asia/South Asia, while the research approach can be used to generate insights into farmers' adaptation motivation globally.","[Lamichhane, Prahlad; Miller, Kelly K.; Hadjikakou, Michalis; Bryan, Brett A.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic, Australia; [Lamichhane, Prahlad] Deaken Univ, Bldg HH1 102-W23,221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic, Australia",Deakin University,"Lamichhane, P (corresponding author), Deaken Univ, Bldg HH1 102-W23,221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic, Australia.",PrahladDeakin@outlook.com; kelly.miller@deakin.edu.au; m.hadjikakou@deakin.edu.au; b.bryan@deakin.edu.au,"Hadjikakou, Michalis/F-1820-2014","Hadjikakou, Michalis/0000-0002-3667-3982","Deakin University, Australia","Deakin University, Australia","Funding for this research was provided by Deakin University, Australia.

This increase has been largely assigned to climate change [Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), 2010, http://www.emdat.be/Database/Trends/trends.html], that is, with climate-related hazards being major triggers for the majority of disasters. Consequently, there is obvious concern about how a changing climate will exacerbate the situation in the future (McBean and Ajibade in Curr Opin Environ Sustain 1:179-186, 2009). However, the attribution of a single hazard event or specific losses to climate change is still difficult, if not impossible, due to the complexity of factors that generate disaster losses. Disaster risk is a product of the interaction of the hazard (event) and the vulnerability conditions of the society or elements exposed. As a result, the need for a systematic linkage between disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) to advance sustainable development, and finally human security is being discussed within the ongoing climate change negotiations as well as within the disaster risk community, for example, in the framework of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on 'Managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation'. However, crucial differences between DRR and CCA exist that have widely limited or hampered their integration in practice. A review of existing literature on the topic and current national and local adaptation strategies, as well as 38 expert interviews conducted between April and May 2009, have led the authors to hypothesise that most of these differences and challenges can be categorised with respect to different spatial and temporal scales, the knowledge base, and norm systems. This paper examines the reasons for the practical barriers when linking CCA and DRR according to these three aspects. Finally, we outline recommendations and measures that need to be adopted in order to overcome existing barriers. In addition, quality criteria are formulated that should be applied in order to constantly monitor and evaluate adaptation strategies designed to simultaneously meet DRR requirements and vice versa.","[Birkmann, Jorn] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [von Teichman, Korinna] CUBE Engn GmbH, D-34119 Kassel, Germany",,"Birkmann, J (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, Hermann Ehlers Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",birkmann@ehs.unu.edu; k.vonteichman@cube-engineering.com,"Birkmann, Joern jb/J-5736-2015; McLean, Laurence JA/C-7367-2014; Ahluwalia, Tarun/A-2762-2012","Birkmann, Joern/0000-0001-8733-3964",,,,,61,345,349,8,148,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

Commencing in the early 2000s, the literature detailed the emergence of community-based adaptation (CBA), driven by a number of factors: recognition of the human dimensions of changes; appreciation of the role of local knowledge for strengthening adaptive capacity; and a push to focus on the scale at which impacts are felt and link this action with pro-poor development outcomes. A more substantial body of work emerged in the literature from 2010 onwards, defining a series of key enablers for effective CBA, which included: use participatory approaches; recognise that adaptation is a social process; and support CBA at multiple scales.

However, this has led to a tendency to marginalise indigenous knowledge as it is considered unimportant in this process (Belfer et al., 2017; Lesperance, 2017; Whitfield et al., 2015). Yet, knowledge systems rarely develop in isolation as they normally tend to cross-fertilize and benefit from each other. In this regard, we think that indigenous knowledge is just as important as scientific knowledge and the two must be integrated through multiple evidence base approach for climate change adaptation and mitigation. In this paper, focussing on African traditional society, we combine oral history with the available literature to examine traditional knowledge and awareness of climate change and related environmental risks. Interesting themes emerge from the knowledge holders themselves and our analysis uncovers a wide range of adaptive coping strategies applied with mixed success. From spotting and reading the position and shape of the 'new moon' to the interpretative correctness of its symbolism in applied traditional climatology, and from rainmaking rituals to conservation of wetlands and forests. Generally, findings seem to suggest that traditional African knowledge of environmental change may be as old as the society itself, with local knowledge transmitted from one generation to the next. Based on the perceived vulnerability of indigenous communities, many scholars tend to argue generically for the integration of indigenous knowledge into climate change policies and implementation (Ross, 2009; Maldonado et al., 2016; Etchart, 2017). In this paper however, we attempt to supplement these arguments by providing specific and context-ualised evidence of indigenous knowledge linked to climate change adaptation. It is demonstrated that indigenous knowledge is neither singular nor universal, but rather, a voluminous, diverse and highly localised source of wisdom. We conclude that integration of such unique and specific indigenous knowledge systems into other evidence bases of knowledge, could be one of the best ways to the more effective and sustainable implementation of climate change adaptation strategies among target indigenous communities.","[Makondo, Cuthbert Casey] St Catherines Coll, Oxford, England; [Makondo, Cuthbert Casey] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Thomas, David S.

ACC calls for the renewal of spatial planning with constant appeals to the need to adequately prepare for extreme climate events. GIs deliver ecosystem services (ES), which consist of beneficial functions to living beings in terms of, for example, helping people adapt to climate change. An effective implementation of adaptation measures at the regional and sub-regional scale is based on an efficient and prompt spatial planning system and GIs management. In this paper, we aim at comparing the attitudes of Italian and Polish spatial planning systems with respect to the integration of concepts related to ACC and GIs. We describe commonalities and differences between the two spatial planning frameworks by scrutinizing regional plans adopted in Sardinia (Italy) and Wielkopolska (Poland). We found out a scarce consideration of both ACC and GIs planning and management. The findings suggest that the regional spatial planning tools need to be updated to be fully satisfactory in terms of ACC and GIs concepts.","[Ledda, Antonio; Calia, Giovanna; Serra, Vittorio; De Montis, Andrea] Univ Sassari, Dept Agr Sci, Viale Italia 39A, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Kubacka, Marta; Brodka, Sylwia] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Landscape Ecol Res Unit, B Krygowskiego 10, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland",University of Sassari; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Serra, V (corresponding author), Univ Sassari, Dept Agr Sci, Viale Italia 39A, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",vserra@uniss.it,"De Montis, Andrea/J-6244-2013; Ledda, Antonio/J-7822-2015","De Montis, Andrea/0000-0002-3849-2595; Kubacka, Marta/0000-0001-9849-4069; Ledda, Antonio/0000-0003-2351-5544","National Biodiversity Future Center (Italian National Plan of Recovery and Resilience); Fund for Research, University of Sassari; National Science Centre, Poland (NCN) [2020/39/D/HS4/00460]","National Biodiversity Future Center (Italian National Plan of Recovery and Resilience); Fund for Research, University of Sassari; National Science Centre, Poland (NCN)(National Science Centre, Poland)","A.D.M. acknowledges contribution from the National Biodiversity Future Center(Italian National Plan of Recovery and Resilience).

An exacerbation and increase in meteorological hazards has in part been attributed to climate change. Climate change also contributes to noticeable seasonal fluctuations that severely affect natural resource based livelihoods. In response, a need in development policy has been identified to address climate change at the community level by helping those most affected through 'climate change adaptation' (CCA) strategies. This paper explores the differences or, rather, the similarities between DRR and CCA through analysing climate-related DRR in Papua New Guinea (PNG) within the context of wider development policies. Ways forward are identified for international development policy supporting all forms of risk reduction through integrating DRR and CCA strategies.

The networks that link these different institutions, and the relationships among people within these networks, are therefore critical influences on the nature of adaptive responses to climate change in the health sector. This study uses social network research to identify key organisational players engaged in developing health-related adaptation activities in Cambodia. It finds that strong partnerships are reported as developing across sectors and different types of organisations in relation to the health risks from climate change. Government ministries are influential organisations, whereas donors, development banks and non-government organisations do not appear to be as influential in the development of adaptation policy in the health sector. Finally, the study highlights the importance of informal partnerships (or 'shadow networks') in the context of climate change adaptation policy and activities. The health governance 'map' in relation to health and climate change adaptation that is developed in this paper is a novel way of identifying organisations that are perceived as key agents in the decision-making process, and it holds substantial benefits for both understanding and intervening in a broad range of climate change-related policy problems where collaboration is paramount for successful outcomes.","[Bowen, Kathryn J.] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Bowen, Kathryn J.; Miller, Fiona] Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia; [Alexander, Damon] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia; [Miller, Fiona] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Dany, Va] Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Dept Environm Sci, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Dany, Va] Bond Univ, Inst Sustainable Dev & Architecture, Gold Coast, Qld 4227, Australia",Australian National University; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; Macquarie University; Bond University,"Bowen, KJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",kathryn.bowen@anu.edu.au; dta@unimelb.edu.au; Fiona.miller@mq.edu.au; danyenvironment@gmail.com,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022","alexander, damon/0000-0003-0837-1677; Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4427-6466; Bowen, Kathryn/0000-0002-2125-1963","Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), through its Australian Development Research Awards (ADRA)","Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), through its Australian Development Research Awards (ADRA)","The study was partly funded by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), through its Australian Development Research Awards (ADRA).",,43,11,11,1,36,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

A comparison of crop productivity between farms employing autonomous adaptations and those not adopting provides an empirical means of resolving this question. This study assesses the climate change adaptation practices used by rice farmers in the Tanahun district of Nepal, their impact on rice productivity, and the factors that affect farmers' decisions to adopt adaptation practices. Adaptation practices used by rice farmers include adjustment in timing of farm operations, selection of varieties, crop rotation, improved irrigation, and fertilizer management. Rice productivity was found to be significantly higher among adopting farmers compared to non-adopting farmers. The findings further suggest that age of the household head, family size, migration of family members outside their village, number of plots under rice cultivation, land holding, and farmers' access to information on climate change all influence farmers' adaptation decisions. This study provides empirical evidence indicating the need for policy makers to take into consideration autonomous adaptations when designing planned adaptations against likely impacts of climate change.","[Khanal, Uttam; Wilson, Clevo; Hoang, Viet-Ngu; Lee, Boon L.] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Level 8,Z Block,Gardens Point,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Khanal, U (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Level 8,Z Block,Gardens Point,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",uttam.khanal@hdr.qut.edu.au,"; Lee, Boon/I-9858-2012","Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495; Lee, Boon/0000-0002-3594-0575; Hoang, Viet-Ngu/0000-0002-9742-2378",,,,,65,15,15,2,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Using a policy mixes approach to address this challenge, we characterize adaptation policy based on a general model of how governments govern issues of societal interest. We argue that this approach allows for context-sensitive measurement of adaptation policy, while being both comparable and parsimonious. This approach is tested in a study of adaptation policies adopted by 125 local governments located in Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK. Using a systematic data collection protocol, a total of 3328 adaptation policies were identified from local council archives between the periods of January 2010 and May 2017. Results of this analysis suggest that there is structured variation emerging in how local governments govern climate change adaptation, which justifies calls for comparative adaptation research to use measurements that capture the totality of adaptation policies being adopted by governments rather than focusing on specific types of adaptation policy. We conclude with a discussion of key issues for further developing of this approach.","[Lesnikowski, Alexandra] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Rue Sherbrooke O, Montreal, PQ H3A0B, Canada; [Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Off 10-23,Priestley Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Biesbroek, Robbert] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",McGill University; University of Leeds; Wageningen University & Research,"Lesnikowski, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Rue Sherbrooke O, Montreal, PQ H3A0B, Canada.",alexandra.lesnikowski@mail.mcgill.ca; j.ford2@leeds.ac.uk; robbert.biesbroek@wur.nl; l.berrangford@leeds.ac.uk,"Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022; Biesbroek, Robbert/ABE-3686-2021; Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,68,23,23,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Cross-sectional survey design was employed for data collection. Data were analysed using both descriptive and econometric approaches. Results showed that the most common climate change adaptation strategies used by smallholders related to varietal adjustments including planting different crop varieties each time, drought-resistant varieties, early maturing varieties, improved seeds and changing the time of planting. Yield comparisons between adapters and non-adapters for the three major crops showed that adapters realized significantly higher yields than non-adapters for most of the climate change adaptation strategies.

Two critical issues are to what extent these factors play a role, and how to enhance local adaptation through government support. We investigated these issues through a case study of two pastoral communities on the Tibetan Plateau in China employing an analytical framework to understand local climate adaptation processes. We concluded that LEK and community-based institutions improve adaptation outcomes for Tibetan pastoralists through shaping and mobilizing resource availability to reduce risks. Higher-level institutions and policies contribute by providing resources from outside communities. There are dynamic interrelationships among these factors that can lead to support, conflict, and fragmentation. Government policy could enhance local adaptation through improvement of supportive relationships among these factors. While central government policies allow only limited room for overt integration of local knowledge/institutions, local governments often have some flexibility to buffer conflicts. In addition, government policies to support market-based economic development have greatly benefited adaptation outcomes for pastoralists. Overall, in China, there are still questions over how to create innovative institutions that blend LEK and community-based institutions with government policy making.","[Yang, Yong-Ping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Fu, Yao; Grumbine, R.

This study employed descriptive statistics, multivariate probit (MVP) model and endogenous switching regression model (ESRM), to analyze the data collected using a survey questionnaire from four provinces in South Africa. The study estimated the determining factors influencing the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies and credit access among smallholder farmers in the study areas. The empirical results of the multivariate probit model showed that location, access to extension, non-farm income, farming experience, crop and livestock production, susceptibility, agricultural training and access to credit variables influenced the smallholder decision to adopt climate change adaptation strategies. On the other hand, the ESRM showed that location, age, marital status, gender among others, influenced the decision to adopt climate change adaptation strategies. The variables such as location, education, drought experience affected the smallholder farmers' access to credit. Thus, to improve the adaptive capacity of farmers, stakeholders and government must cooperate and collaborate to improve the conditions under which farmers can gain access to climate change information and suitable agricultural credit as well as policy incentives to ensure overall sustainability of the agricultural sector.

In April 2009, the European Commission released a White Paper outlining a proposed framework for action to reduce vulnerability and adapt to climate change (European Commission, 2009). The White Paper refers to the importance of a climate adaptation strategy and sustainability that integrates all areas of regional and municipal development including agriculture, forestry, fishery, energy, public infrastructure (incl. building, transport, energy and water supply), tourism, human, animal and plant health, water resources and ecosystem loss (including marine ecosystems and biodiversity). One of the main issues is how to and why integrating the green developments into urban policies. In this paper we show the main objectives of London's greening program, and some possible elements of the green developments in Csomor's adaptation strategy. Comparing the two examined cities there are differences according to their size, population, greening possibilities and financial backgrounds. However, it can be seen that the focus points of the adaptation strategies are more close to each other.","[Horvath, L.] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Adaptat Climate Change Res Grp, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary; [Csete, M.] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest; Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Horvath, L (corresponding author), Corvinus Univ Budapest, Adaptat Climate Change Res Grp, Villanyi Ut 29-43, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary.",levente.horvath@uni-corvinus.hu,"Csete, Maria/AAP-1198-2021; Csete, Maria/H-8204-2012","Csete, Maria/0000-0001-7170-9402; ",New Szechenyi Plan [TAMOP-4.2.1/B-09/1/KMR-2010-0005],New Szechenyi Plan,This work is connected to the scientific program of the Development of quality-oriented and harmonized R+D+I strategy and functional model at BME project.

Together with economic and technological development they are important for building social capacities. However, there are almost no methodologies for the systematic assessment of social factors. After reviewing existing methodologies we identify the Adaptive Capacity Wheel (ACW) by Gupta et al. (2010), developed for assessing the adaptive capacity of institutions, as the most comprehensive and operationalised framework to assess social factors. The ACW differentiates 22 criteria to assess 6 dimensions: variety, learning capacity, room for autonomous change, leadership, availability of resources, fair governance. To include important psychological factors we extended the ACW by two dimensions: adaptation motivation refers to actors' motivation to realise, support and/or promote adaptation to climate; adaptation belief refers to actors' perceptions of realisability and effectiveness of adaptation measures. We applied the extended ACW to assess adaptive capacities of four sectors - water management, flood/coastal protection, civil protection and regional planning - in northwestern Germany. The assessments of adaptation motivation and belief provided a clear added value. The results also revealed some methodological problems in applying the ACW (e.g. overlap of dimensions), for which we propose methodological solutions.","[Grothmann, T.; Grecksch, K.; Winges, M.; Siebenhuener, B.] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Sch Comp Sci Business Adm Econ & Law, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Grothmann, T (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Sch Comp Sci Business Adm Econ & Law, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",torsten.grothmann@uni-oldenburg.de,"Grecksch, Kevin/AAA-1826-2021","Grecksch, Kevin/0000-0002-1913-0134",Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany,Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This paper is part of the ongoing research project nordwest2050 - Prospects for Climate-Adapted Innovation Processes in the Model Region Bremen-Oldenburg in northwestern Germany, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany in the research program Creating Climate Change-Ready Regions (KLIMZUG).",,55,52,52,1,57,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

This paper argued challenges of agriculture in developing countries in general and Ethiopia in particular, are highly diversified, and thus any intervention requires embarrassing the specific agroecosystems. Cognizant of this fact, the research investigated locally viable climate change adaptation strategies (CCAS) specific to Rib watershed in Ethiopia by using agroecosystem analysis framework. The study used primary data collected from 383 randomly selected farm-households complemented with data collected with key-informant interviews and focus group discussions. The study area was characterized and mapped in two groups of agroecosystems: Fogera plain and Libo-Farta highlands. The finding portrayed that across agroecosystems, there were considerable differences in terms of productivity potential, inherit constraints, crop varieties, income level and soil type. The study found the blanket application of similar CCAS irrespective of the heterogeneities. Farmers in the plain land witnessed less income inequality that stood at a Gini coefficient of 38.3 as compared to the highlanders of 42.8. The study further identified prioritized CCAS for the respective agroecosystems. It is imperative to consider local diversities before any intervention efforts.","[Adego, Tsega] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Environm & Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Adego, T (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Environm & Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",tsega.adego@aau.edu.et,,,"Ethiopian Ministry of Education (Addis Ababa University), Ethiopia; Ethiopian Ministry of Education (Aksum University), Ethiopia","Ethiopian Ministry of Education (Addis Ababa University), Ethiopia; Ethiopian Ministry of Education (Aksum University), Ethiopia","This work was funded by Ethiopian Ministry of Education (Addis Ababa University and Aksum University), Ethiopia.

Drawing on the literature on policy design, we highlight institutional arrangements as elements of policy design spaces and contend that they fall into four categories that either stress the political or problem orientation of this activity: optimal, technical, political, and sub-optimal. We use original data on 44 major economies and greenhouse gas-emitting countries to test this expectation. These data capture various properties of national coordination arrangements, including the types of coordination instruments in place, the degree of hierarchy, the lead government agency responsible for coordination, and the scope of cross-sectoral policy coordination. The dataset also captures the degree to which non-state actors are involved in coordination and whether coordination processes are supported by scientific knowledge. Using cluster analysis, we show that the institutional arrangements for the horizontal coordination of climate policy do indeed fall into the four above-mentioned categories. The cluster analysis further reveals that a fifth, hybrid category exists. Interestingly, the political orientation dominates in the institutional arrangements for the horizontal coordination of climate change mitigation, whereas the problem orientation is more important in the arrangements for the horizontal coordination of climate change adaptation.","[von Luepke, Heiner] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Leopold, Lucas] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Res Peace & Dev, Pk Str 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Tosun, Jale] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; KU Leuven; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Tosun, J (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",Hluepke@diw.de; lucas.leopold@kuleuven.be; jale.tosun@ipw.uni-heidelberg.de,,"Tosun, Jale/0000-0001-9367-5039; von Luepke, Heiner/0000-0001-9842-5522",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,51,1,1,4,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-2687,1573-0891,,POLICY SCI,Policy Sci.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11077-022-09484-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-022-09484-0,,NOV 2022,20,"Public Administration; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,6N2VL,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000889416600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

United Nations and the European Commission promote their research as a cornerstone in the changeover to the Ecological Transition. In the Sierra Nevada range (Spain) and the Andean Cordillera, there is a paradigmatic and ancestral example of NbS-IWRM known as careo channels and amunas, respectively. They recharge slope aquifers in mountain areas and consist of an extensive network of channels that infiltrate the runoff water generated during the snow-thawing and rainy season into the upper parts of the slopes. The passage of water through the aquifers in the slope is used to regulate the water resources of the mountain areas and thus ensure the duration of water availability for the downstream local population and generate multiple ecosystem services. This form of water management is known as Water Sowing and Harvesting (WS&H). As shown in this work, it is a living example of a resilience and climate change adaptation tool that can be qualified as a nature-based solution.","[Jodar, Jorge; Javier Lamban, Luis] CSIC, Inst Geol & Minero Espatia IGME, Zaragoza 50006, Spain; [Martos-Rosillo, Sergio; Gonzalez-Ramon, Antonio; Zakaluk, Thomas] CSIC, Inst Geol & Minero Espana IGME, Granada 18006, Spain; [Custodio, Emilio] Univ Politecn Calalunya, Dept Ingn Civil & Ambiental, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Mateos, Luciano] CSIC, Inst Agr Sostenible IAS, Cordoba 14004, Spain; [Cabello, Javier; Casas, Jesus; Jacoba Salinas-Bonillo, Maria] Univ Almeria, Ctr Andaluz Evaluac & Seguimiento Cambio Global C, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Maria Martin-Civantos, Jose] Univ Granada, MEMOLab, Lab Arqueol Biocultural, Granada 18071, Spain; [Herrera-Lameli, Christian; Urrutia, Javier] Univ Bernardo OHiggins, Ctr Invest & Desarrollo Ecosistemas Hidr, Santiago 8370993, Chile",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Agricultura Sostenible (IAS); Universidad de Almeria; University of Granada; Universidad  Bernardo O'Higgins,"Jodar, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Geol & Minero Espatia IGME, Zaragoza 50006, Spain.",j.jodar@igme.es,"Jódar, Jorge/E-6457-2017; SALINAS, MARIA-JACOBA/K-1193-2012; Mateos, Luciano/GZM-7246-2022; Cabello, Javier/N-5799-2014; Mateos, Luciano/B-2309-2013","Jódar, Jorge/0000-0001-8708-0303; SALINAS, MARIA-JACOBA/0000-0001-6931-6677; Cabello, Javier/0000-0002-5123-964X; Mateos, Luciano/0000-0002-3046-6448; Casas Jimenez, Jose Jesus/0000-0003-0928-0080","Organismo Autonomo Parques Nacionales from the Ministerio para la Transicion Ecologica y el Reto Demografico [SPIP202102741, 2768/2021]; Ibero-American Science and Technology for Development Programme (CYTED) [419RT0577]; Severo Ochoa extraordinary grants for excellence IGME-CSIC [AECEX2021]",Organismo Autonomo Parques Nacionales from the Ministerio para la Transicion Ecologica y el Reto Demografico; Ibero-American Science and Technology for Development Programme (CYTED); Severo Ochoa extraordinary grants for excellence IGME-CSIC,"This work was undertaken as part of the projects Impact, monitoring and assessment of global and climate change on water resources in high-mountain National Parks (CCPM) (SPIP202102741) and Soluciones basadas en la naturaleza para la gestion resiliente del ciclo hidrologico en zonas de montana: los sistemas tradicionales de gestion del agua de Sierra Nevada (NBS4WATER, Ref 2768/2021) funded by Organismo Autonomo Parques Nacionales from the Ministerio para la Transicion Ecologica y el Reto Demografico.

Appropriate solutions will depend on the effective promotion, monitoring and evaluation of changes in farming practice. Conservation agriculture (CA) is an important example of sustainable intensification and climate-smart agriculture, increasing the productivity and reliability of grain production while reducing agricultural inputs and future climate risks when adopted comprehensively. But to understand its implementation and benefits, researchers often rely on simplified measures of CA adoption (e.g., single proxies, binary measures, broad self assessments, expert estimates). Here we use a national survey of South Africa's commercial grain farmers (n = 441), contextualized by previous interviews, to investigate common measures of adoption and their implications for CA's promotion, monitoring and evaluation. These farmers are unusually informative, because they are unsubsidized but have the capacity, incentive and willingness to adapt to climate change. We find that they are adopting CA autonomously, but that their implementation is highly variable and their interpretation of farming practice differs from that of local experts. Single proxies, binary adoption variables and broad farmer self-assessments suggest that between 40 and 80% of farmers have adopted CA. However, when evaluated across the three CA principles using UN-defined adoption thresholds, the comprehensive adoption rate is only 14%. Farmers' definition of conservation differs substantially from that of the local experts most likely to be asked to contribute adoption estimates to global monitoring efforts, creating the potential for miscommunication. There is therefore substantial cause for concern in how CA is currently promoted, monitored and evaluated. Inaccurate adoption estimates jeopardize CA's potential as a climate change adaptation strategy, creating illusory progress that may disincentivize further substantive efforts towards agricultural sustainability and climate resilience.","[Findlater, K.

We present a methodology for estimating partial global and regional adaptation costs for raw industrial and domestic water supply, for a limited number of adaptation strategies, and apply the method using results of two climate models. In this paper, adaptation costs are defined as those for providing enough raw water to meet future industrial and municipal water demand, based on country-level demand projections to 2050. We first estimate costs for a baseline scenario excluding climate change, and then additional climate change adaptation costs. Increased demand is assumed to be met through a combination of increased reservoir yield and alternative backstop measures. Under such controversial measures, we project global adaptation costs of $12 bn p.a., with 83-90% in developing countries; the highest costs are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, adaptation costs are low compared to baseline costs ($73 bn p.a.), which supports the notion of mainstreaming climate change adaptation into broader policy aims. The method provides a tool for estimating broad costs at the global and regional scale; such information is of key importance in international negotiations.","[Ward, Philip J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Fac Earth & Life Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Strzepek, Kenneth M.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hughes, Gordon A.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Econ, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Edinburgh,"Ward, PJ (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Fac Earth & Life Sci, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",philip.ward@ivm.vu.nl,"Aerts, Jeroen Cjh/M-8431-2013; Ward, Philip/E-6208-2010","Pauw, Pieter/0000-0002-9323-2577; Brander, Luke/0000-0002-5862-4030; Ward, Philip/0000-0001-7702-7859",Governments of the Netherland; Governments of the Switzerland; Governments of the United Kingdom,Governments of the Netherland; Governments of the Switzerland; Governments of the United Kingdom,"We would like to thank the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia for providing climate data, and two anonymous reviewers for their useful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

The first is the extent to which collaboration among policy actors depends upon their joint participation in policy forums. The second is how the scales at which these forums operate conditionally affect the likelihood of collaboration. We address these questions using data from a recent survey on actors' collaborative interactions as well as their participation in climate change adaptation policy forums in the Lake Victoria region in East Africa. Exponential random graph models show that actors are more likely to collaborate if they jointly participate in policy forums. However, this effect weakens at progressively higher spatial levels at which forums operate. Similarly, collaboration is less likely among actors jointly participating in forums that sponsor decision making at the higher collective choice level rather than lower operational choice level. While policy forums may catalyze collaboration, our findings suggest that their capacity to do so may be subject to scale-dependent transaction costs of political contracting.","[Hamilton, Matthew] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lubell, Mark] Univ Calif Davis, Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lubell, Mark] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Environm Policy & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Hamilton, M (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Hamilton, Matt/HJP-9671-2023","Hamilton, Matthew/0000-0003-0509-4467; Lubell, Mark/0000-0001-5757-7116",NSF Division of Graduate Education (DGE) [0801430]; Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT; UC Davis,NSF Division of Graduate Education (DGE)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)); Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT; UC Davis,"The authors thank Emilinah Namaganda, Shuaib Lwasa, Paul Onyango, and Charles Mundia for valuable recommendations and logistical assistance preceding and during fieldwork.

The impacts on human societies, and societies' ability to mitigate and adapt to these changes and to adhere to ethical principles are influenced by various factors, including gender. Therefore, this study aimed to design a model of climate change adaptation behavior among rice farmers in Mazandaran Province, northern Iran, based on gender analysis (IUCN, UNDP and GGCA in Training manual on gender and climate change, 2009) and using the developed model of protection motivation theory (Bockarjova and Steg in Glob Environ Change 28:276-288, 2014). For this purpose, 173 female and 233 male rice farmers in Mazandaran Province were selected through stratified random sampling. The results showed that threat and coping appraisal had positive and significant effects on climate change adaptation behavior in both groups. Additionally, men's and women's perceived severity had the greatest impact on threat appraisal, and response costs had the greatest impact on their coping appraisal of climate change. Given that climate change adaptation behavior has been largely dependent on the development of ethical principles and the behavior of men and women toward climate change and based on the research findings, some suggestions are recommended at the mega (international), macro (governmental and legislative), meso (related organizations) and micro (rice farmers) levels for male and female rice farmers to adapt to the climate change phenomenon.","[Goli, Imaneh; Najafabadi, Maryam Omidi; Lashgarara, Farhad] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Econ Agr Extens & Educ, Tehran Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University,"Najafabadi, MO (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Econ Agr Extens & Educ, Tehran Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran.",Imaneh.Goli@srbiau.ac.ir; M.Omidi@srbiau.ac.ir; F.lashgarara@srbiau.ac.ir,"Goli, Imaneh/ABI-4781-2020; Omidi Najafabadi, Maryam/AAU-1669-2021","Goli, Imaneh/0000-0002-5252-3300; Omidi Najafabadi, Maryam/0000-0003-1830-7660",,,,,122,10,10,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1187-7863,1573-322X,,J AGR ENVIRON ETHIC,J.

The paper proposes two perspectives to analyze the level of mainstreaming and five factors that may affect such a level. The results show that there is a significant difference in the success of their mainstreaming efforts: mainstreaming is relatively advanced in Bangladesh, limited in Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Maldives, and Nepal, and still minimal in Bhutan and Cambodia. Among the factors, the study finds that the inter-ministerial coordination supported by the highest levels of government is most relevant to the success of mainstreaming, which is measured by the integration of climate adaptation consideration into development priorities and a country's own initiatives, particularly those involving budget allocation. Recognition of the need for mainstreaming and monitoring and evaluation also affect the success of mainstreaming efforts in LDCs. Another important factor is to make adaptation plans compatible with national development plans in terms of their time horizon, and SPCRs effectively facilitate this process. As all countries still require external support for advancing mainstreaming, the role of development partners is instrumental. The paper points to issues that need to be incorporated in the relevant NAPAs including updating to facilitate mainstreaming.","Ibaraki Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Hitachi, Ibaraki 3168511, Japan",Ibaraki University,"Saito, N (corresponding author), Ibaraki Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, 4-12-1 Nakanarusawa, Hitachi, Ibaraki 3168511, Japan.",nsaito@adb.org,,,,,,,31,40,40,1,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Therefore, it is critically important to assess the performance of conservation mechanisms, particularly marine protected areas (MPAs) to moderate the risks of climate-related impacts. In this study, sea surface temperature trends of Australian Commonwealth MPAs are assessed against climate change management criteria, as defined in Adapting to Climate Change: Guidance for Protected Area Managers and Planners. Monthly sea surface temperature trends between 1993 and 2017 were statistically assessed using the Mann-Kendall trend test and management plans were subject to a thematic analysis. Temperature trends showed variable SST changes among the regions, with the northern reserves all showing statistically significant increases in temperature, and the Southwest Network having the least number of reserves with statistically significant increases in temperature. The thematic analysis shows that management plans address approximately half of the climate change adaptation criteria. Several management strategies, such as dynamic MPAs, replication, and translocations, are currently absent and have been suggested as necessary tools in supporting the climate readiness of Australian MPAs. This study is significant because it helps to identify and synthesize regions most vulnerable to the impacts of ocean warming and provides management suggestions make MPAs climate ready.","[Tan, Jia Sheng Danny; Fischer, Andrew M.] Univ Tasmania, Coll Sci & Engn, Ecol & Biodivers Ctr, Inst Marine & Antarct Studies, Locked Bag 1370, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Tan, JSD (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Coll Sci & Engn, Ecol & Biodivers Ctr, Inst Marine & Antarct Studies, Locked Bag 1370, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia.",jsdtan@outlook.com; andy.fischer@utas.edu.au,,", Jia Sheng Danny/0000-0003-0526-5254; Fischer, Andrew/0000-0001-5284-6428",CAUL,CAUL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions,,117,0,0,8,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Variations in climate change adaptation practice and research account for such social-ecological relations to varying degrees. Advocates of ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation (EbA) claim that it delivers social co-benefits to marginalised groups, although scant empirical evidence supports such claims. I investigate these claims in two EbA interventions in Sri Lanka, interpreting social benefits through an empowerment lens. I use qualitative methods such as focus groups and narrative interviews to study the conduct and context of the interventions. In both cases, marginalised people's own empowered adaptive strategies reflect how power relations and vulnerabilities relate to dynamic ecologies. The findings show that EbA enabled social benefits for marginalised groups, especially through support to common-pool resource management institutions and the gendered practices of home gardens. Such conduct was embedded within, but mostly peripheral to, broader and deeper contestations of power. Nevertheless, projects acted as platforms for renegotiating these power relations, including through acts of resistance. The results call for greater recognition of the ways that marginalised groups relate to ecology within empowered adaptive strategies, whilst also highlighting the need to recognise the diverse interests and power relations that cut across the conduct and contexts of these nominally ecosystem-based interventions.","[Woroniecki, Stephen] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, POB 170, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Woroniecki, S (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, POB 170, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",stephen.woroniecki@lucsus.lu.se,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Woroniecki, Stephen/0000-0003-1894-2859",Linnaeus Centre LUCID - Swedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Association for Anthropology and Geography (SSAG),Linnaeus Centre LUCID - Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Association for Anthropology and Geography (SSAG),"The work was financially supported by the Linnaeus Centre LUCID, funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas, and by the Swedish Association for Anthropology and Geography (SSAG).",,81,22,22,2,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 1,2019,11,3,,,,,,,772,10.3390/su11030772,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11030772,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HL7NY,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000458929500217,View Full Record in Web of Science

For Austrian cities, depending on location and topography, heavy rainfall events, storms and heat waves in particular could become increasingly relevant in the tourism context. For medium-sized and large cities, heat is the most frequently discussed topic in connection with possible adaptation potentials. The analysis of challenges shows a strong overlap of adaptation targets in city tourism with adaptation challenges for city planning including connection to the sub-urban surrounding areas to confront climate change impacts. Covid-19 pandemic, additionally, offered the opportunity to discuss a new re-start of the city-tourism against the experience during the shutdown period in spring 2020. The paper argues that we can learn from the current health crisis for coping with climate change related extreme events and to increase achievements in climate change mitigation. Firstly, the pandemic provides a strong ability to discuss the impact of city tourism due to short-term air travel and options to enhance more climate-friendly options on the other hand. Secondly, Covid-19 emphasized the need to reconsider the role of free spaces in metropolitan areas as well as their accessibility. Herewith synergies with climate change adaptation are likely when questioning the availability and accessibility of green and blue infrastructure as well as their capacities. Challenges including crowding and impacts by over tourism on public free spaces will require joint strategies involving all public and private institutions (including local communities and businesses) responsible for the maintenance of green and blue free spaces. Thirdly, the strong interactions between urban and suburban areas became evident once more, which will also be very relevant for city tourism in the future (e.g. in times of heat waves). Reflection on the transferability of coping with such crowding effects, related to the adaptive behaviour of residents and tourists in times of severe heat waves, might be relevant for both city tourism and summer tourism destinations near metropolitan areas.

This paper uses a semi-quantitative method based on cognitive mapping to demonstrate how new knowledge emerges when combining knowledge from diverse agents. For the case of heatwaves in the city of Madrid (Spain) we elicit knowledge about climatic impacts across urban sectors and potential adaptation options. Knowledge is elicited in individual interviews and then aggregated using fuzzy cognitive maps. We observe that the individual maps vary considerably in size and structure and fend evidence of diverse and even contradictory perceptions. There is no super-stakeholder, who theoretically could provide full knowledge about mechanisms operating in this urban system: the maximum percentage of the final aggregated map explained by a single individual is 26% in terms of concepts and 13% in terms of connections. We illustrate how the emergence of new knowledge can be sustained by combining scientific and policy expertise.

Multi use of green infrastructure has the potential of contributing to climate change adaptation in various scales and regions. Climate change as a result of historical emissions of greenhouse gases would jeopardize cities. The deficiency of existing urban systems to cope with the risks resulting from these changes such as floods, droughts and extreme temperatures (intensification of the urban island heat effect), render residents of cities vulnerable to these changes. Green infrastructure by providing a range of ecosystem services has a significant role to play in helping to combat climate change. In this paper, it is investigated how and in what function and services, Green infrastructure strategy can help us in adopting to climate change in urban landscape context.

This is even more pressing for communities in remote contexts where access to resources and support services is limited. This study used thematic analysis to identify key insights from a 20-year old community-based resource management and development initiative on a remote island in Fiji. Four themes emerged relating to: perceptions of environmental change, links between conservation initiatives and people's livelihoods, balance between external support and community-driven efforts, and the continuity of initiatives. Whilst acknowledging that every community in the Pacific has unique capacities for dealing with climate change, the four identified themes are considered applicable to other subsistence-dominated peripheral communities within Fiji, the Pacific Islands region and beyond. This has the potential to improve planning processes and ensure both continuity and efficacy of efforts towards supporting sustainable livelihoods in communities already experiencing the impacts of climate change.","[Medina Hidalgo, Daniela; Nunn, Patrick D.; Beazley, Harriot] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia; [Medina Hidalgo, Daniela] CSIRO, 306 Carmody Rd, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Sovinasalevu, Joji Sivo; Veitayaki, Joeli] Univ South Pacific, Sch Marine Studies, Inst Appl Sci, Laucala Campus, Suva, Fiji",University of the Sunshine Coast; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of the South Pacific,"Hidalgo, DM (corresponding author), CSIRO, 306 Carmody Rd, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia.;Hidalgo, DM (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia.",daniela.medina@research.usc.edu.au,"Nunn, Patrick D./C-7864-2011; Nunn, Patrick/ABA-2943-2021; Hidalgo, Daniela Medina/AAP-6674-2020; Beazley, Harriot/AAJ-2960-2020","Nunn, Patrick D./0000-0001-9295-5741; Nunn, Patrick/0000-0001-9295-5741; Hidalgo, Daniela Medina/0000-0002-7064-0455; Beazley, Harriot/0000-0002-0491-5350","Australian Government, Department of Education and Training; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)","Australian Government, Department of Education and Training(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO))","This work was supported by Australian Government, Department of Education and Training [grant number Research Training Program Scholarship]; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) [grant number Postgraduate Scholarship.].",,70,3,3,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

In recent years, the limitations of risk assessment and adaptation planning based on the prediction results of climate models have become increasingly acknowledged. The uncertainties embodied in the model specifications, model parameterizations, prediction results, decision implementation process, and context changes bring significant risks to decision-making far beyond the general recognition of uncertainty drawn from historical data. Such combined and future-looking uncertainty is termed deep uncertainty. Researchers have applied robust decision-making (RDM) theory, adaptation pathways (AP) method, and engineering options analysis (EOA) method to climate change adaptation decision-making research. These theories and techniques can help scientists and policy makers to couple systematic analysis with thoughtful deliberation, typically in coordination with stakeholders, to consider the implications of choices under likely and unlikely future conditions, and thus to better grasp the impact of deep uncertainty on climate change decision-making. The literature on RDM, AP, and EOA is huge and in this review paper, we focus on their advancements and applications in the field of coastal flood control, and review the main strengths and interconnections of these three methods. The RDM method combines the traditional control theory with modern management decision-making theory, focuses on future scenario generation, cost-benefit comparisons of multiple adaptation measures under different future scenarios, and conducts the comparative static screening of the large numbers of scenarios-adaptation measure combinations. The AP method pays more attention to the most plausible scenario-adaptation measure combinations as time goes towards the future, rather than giving the full consideration of all future scenarios, and promotes the consideration of solutions that are adaptable through time. The EOA method is based on the framework of the AP method, with a focus on the specific engineering design. As a consequence, it may lack consideration for larger-scale application and implications. This paper considers how these three methods can be integrated to serve the decision-making process which is characterized by multiple decision goals, large number of plausible future scenarios, and large number of feasible mitigation and adaptation measures. A demonstrative case study of Shanghai is presented for this purpose. This case study proposes a framework to serve the mission of dynamic adaptation planning and engineering designs by combining the strengths of RDM, AP and EOA. We expect that the integration can help researchers to identify low-regret and even no-regret solutions that are beneficial over a broad set of potential future situations. Because the integration must depend on the continuous and effective dialogues among scientists, policymakers, local experts, and other stakeholders, it is bound to be a co-production process of the decision-making knowledge and such a process has the potential to improve public confidence on the proposed policies and solutions. Finally, we argue that the integrated application of these three methods and the process of knowledge co-creation in the integration process are the key direction for future development in the field of climate change adaptation decision-making under the context of deep uncertainty.","[Tian, Zhan; Wu, Wenxian; Liu, Junguo] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Sun, Laixiang] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Southern University of Science & Technology; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Liu, JG (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",liujg@sustech.edu.cn,,,,,,,61,0,0,6,6,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",0023-074X,2095-9419,,CHIN SCI B-CHIN,Chin.

Nepal recognizes that it needs to integrate climate change adaptation into various policies, but limited understanding of how to make these policies coherent is among the factors that hinder effective adaptation action. This can lead to wasted resources and lost opportunities. This paper applies concepts from policy coherence for development frameworks and policy content analysis to examine coherence in Nepal's climate and forest policies-and discusses the factors hindering effective implementation. The policies are analyzed at the horizontal/external level at three layers-motivation, measures, and planned implementation process. The paper finds that policies are more consistent on motivation level and adaptation measures, but are less coherent on implementation. The National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) is more explicit in identifying institutions, organizations, roles and responsibilities, resource allocation (financial), and a monitoring and evaluation plan for climate change adaptation while other policies such as Climate Change Policy 2011, National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 2014-2020, Forest Policy 2015, and Forest Sector Strategy 2016 have critical gaps in this area. This paper conclude that formulation of a policy, articulating targets, and mobilizing financial resources are in themselves not sufficient to effectively address climate change adaptation. Policy-based legislation is required, together with development of a supportive collaborative multi-stakeholder approach at different levels of governance, backed up by effective, collaborative monitoring and enforcement.","[Ranabhat, Sunita; Ghate, Rucha; Bhatta, Laxmi Dutt; Agrawal, Nand Kishor] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Tankha, Sunil] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Ranabhat, S (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Kathmandu, Nepal.",sunita.ranabhat@icimod.org,,,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway; Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA); ICIMOD by the Governments of Afghanistan; ICIMOD by the Governments of Australia; ICIMOD by the Governments of Austria; ICIMOD by the Governments of Bangladesh; ICIMOD by the Governments of Bhutan; ICIMOD by the Governments of China; ICIMOD by the Governments of India; ICIMOD by the Governments of Myanmar; ICIMOD by the Governments of Nepal; ICIMOD by the Governments of Norway; ICIMOD by the Governments of Pakistan; ICIMOD by the Governments of Switzerland; ICIMOD by the Governments of United Kingdom","Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway; Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA); ICIMOD by the Governments of Afghanistan; ICIMOD by the Governments of Australia; ICIMOD by the Governments of Austria; ICIMOD by the Governments of Bangladesh; ICIMOD by the Governments of Bhutan; ICIMOD by the Governments of China; ICIMOD by the Governments of India; ICIMOD by the Governments of Myanmar; ICIMOD by the Governments of Nepal; ICIMOD by the Governments of Norway; ICIMOD by the Governments of Pakistan; ICIMOD by the Governments of Switzerland; ICIMOD by the Governments of United Kingdom","This study was undertaken by the Himalayan Climate Change Adaptation Program (HICAP) at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).

The study used severity and problem confrontation index estimations to examine the farmers' perceptions of climate warming and barriers to climate adaptation. The results indicated that the farmers were cognizant of climate change and its adverse impacts on their livelihood. It was evident that most surveyed rice farmers perceived changes in climatic conditions to affect rice production adversely. The farmers claimed that unpredictable weather conditions, limited farm size, inadequate farm labor, scarce water resources, high cost of farm inputs, and insufficient information on weather conditions had impeded their adoption of climate change adaptive strategies. Based on the results of the principal component analysis, economic resources, physical resources, information, human resources, and technology significantly influence smallholder farmers' responsive ability to climate warming. Therefore, policymakers must design policy frameworks and measures that consider these significant factors explaining farmers' constraints to climate change adaptation.","[Pickson, Robert Becker; He, Ge] Sichuan Agr Univ, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University,"He, G (corresponding author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Management, 211 Huimin Rd, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",hege01@126.com,"PICKSON, ROBERT BECKER/ABC-8549-2020","PICKSON, ROBERT BECKER/0000-0003-4084-3427",,,,,130,6,6,7,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2158-2440,,,SAGE OPEN,SAGE Open,JUL,2021,11,3,,,,,,,2.15824402110326E+016,10.1177/21582440211032638,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440211032638,,,16,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,UI7JF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000690777800001,View Full Record in Web of Science
