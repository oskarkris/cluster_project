To ensure rapid, widespread and equitable adaptation to these risks, government policy must be enacted to support community-wide adaptation. Public support for adaptation policy will be key to its passage. To date, few studies have focused on what factors motivate public support for adaptation policy, especially at the subnational level. To address these gaps, we develop a conceptual model that draws on and synthesizes past conceptual frameworks and literature related to environmental behavior and adaptation specifically. Using structural equation modeling with latent variables, we examine this model, drawing on data from a statewide survey of over 2700 individuals from the state of Indiana in the Midwestern United States. We assess the drivers of two distinct measures of policy support: support for climate adaptation policy and support for climate adaptation taxes. We find that threat appraisal, climate risk perception, perceived efficacy of government, respondent's climate change beliefs, perceived descriptive and dynamic norms around policy support, and social structural characteristics such as political affiliation are important drivers of support for adaptation policy, but that their effects differ across our two outcome measures. These findings point to opportunities to better engage the public in policy discourse, while also suggesting that distinct motivations shape support for policy compared to the taxes likely needed to support these new programs.","[Houser, Matthew] Nature Conservancy, Maryland DC Chapter, 114 S Washington St,Suite 102, Easton, MD 21601 USA; [Gazley, Beth] Indiana Univ, ONeil Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Reynolds, Heather] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Browning, Elizabeth Grennan] Indiana Univ, Environm Resilience Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Browning, Elizabeth Grennan; Sandweiss, Eric] Indiana Univ, Dept Hist, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Shanahan, James] Indiana Univ, Media Sch, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Houser, Matthew] Univ Maryland, Horn Point Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, 2020 Horns Point Rd, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science,"Houser, M (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, Maryland DC Chapter, 114 S Washington St,Suite 102, Easton, MD 21601 USA.;Houser, M (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Horn Point Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, 2020 Horns Point Rd, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA.",matthew.houser@tnc.org,,,Environmental Resilience Institute - Indiana University's Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative,Environmental Resilience Institute - Indiana University's Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative,"This work was supported by the Environmental Resilience Institute, funded by Indiana University's Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative.",,87,4,4,4,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

This paper uses the Swedish and the Norwegian electricity grid sector, as providers of a vital public good under strict public regulation, to analyse reforms' effects on adaptive capacity in this area. The paper shows that transformational changes in both sectors during the 1990s shifted both the formal organisational structure (rules and regulations), as well as the organisational culture, in the direction of economic efficiency. These two dimensions individually reduced adaptive capacity to climate change, although differently in the two countries. However, the formal structure and organisational culture also yielded substantial influence on each other. This leads to the conclusion that when designing public regulations and implementing reforms, organisational culture must be considered in the design. Also the paper contests previous findings in the literature by showing that under given conditions there exist some substitution between the two dimensions in influencing adaptive capacity, implying that both dimensions should be included when analysing adaptation since analysing them in isolation is likely to lead to wrong conclusions.","[Inderberg, Tor Hakon] Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, European Programme, POB 326, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway",,"Inderberg, TH (corresponding author), Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, European Programme, POB 326, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway.",thin@fni.no,"Inderberg, Tor Håkon Jackson/B-2942-2015","Inderberg, Tor Håkon Jackson/0000-0002-1838-3834",,,,,60,1,1,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2015,20,4,,,SI,,424,441,,10.1080/13549839.2013.869200,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2013.869200,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,V79WX,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000212146200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In its most radical form, adaptation accepts as a given fundamental changes to our environment caused by a warming climate and consequently demands similarly fundamental adaptations in our ways of life. Those adaptations could entail widespread and severe environmental impacts, complementing and enhancing the primary environmental consequences of climate change. While environmental law has, if haltingly, moderated our environmental impacts in the recent past, this Article suggests that we should not assume that its successes will be repeated in a warmer world. Climate change threatens to exacerbate some of the problems of capacity that have limited environmental law, particularly the inability to plan comprehensively to minimize environmental effects Climate change may also undermine the public support that has been integral to the creation and sustenance of environmental law by reorienting human relationships with the natural-world. The environmental changes caused by a warming climate may convert the environment from an endowment to be protected to a hostile and unpredictable force to be controlled and from which we demand protection. Although pessimistic about the prospects for environmental protection in a world of unchecked climate change, the Article concludes with some optimism about our ability to avoid the worst of adaptation's consequences through a policy of climate change mitigation.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Boalt Hall Sch Law, Calif Ctr Environm Law & Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Zinn, MD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Boalt Hall Sch Law, Calif Ctr Environm Law & Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,162,16,16,0,15,UNIV CALIFORNIA  BERKELEY SCH LAW,BERKELEY,"BOAT HALL, 588 SIMON HALL, BERKELEY, CA 94720-7200 USA",0046-1121,,,ECOL LAW QUART,Ecol.

As an instrumental-technical intervention, planning is mainly used to improve the physical environment (through concepts such as regulating waterproof facades of architecture, setting buffering zones, and designing green-blue corridors). However, the implementation of the proposed physical interventions is often challenging and necessitates assistance from practices such as climate assessment, policy disciplines, civil societies, and economic resources. These extensive perspectives have spawned many new research domains in the realm of spatial planning. This paper provides a review of the recent developments in flood resilience, risk management, and climate adaptation; based on this, it positions planning research and practice within these works of literature. Four clusters of thought are identified, mainly in the European and American scholarship of the last two decades. They are environmental concerns, disaster management concerns, socio-economic concerns, and institutional concerns. Current planning research concentrates on disaster management in the underlying belief that planning is functionally efficient. The attention to environmental concerns, socio-economic concerns, and institutional concerns of planning research remains insufficient but has been growing. This, in turn, enlarges the scope of planning research and indicates future directions for study. These new concerns relate to spatial planning's ability to operate effectively in a multi-sectoral setting, despite limited resources and in the face of uncertain risk.","[Meng, Meng; Dabrowski, Marcin; Stead, Dominic] Delft Univ Technol TU Delft, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Urbanism, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands",,"Meng, M (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol TU Delft, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Urbanism, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",m.meng@tudelft.nl; m.m.dabrowski@tudelft.nl; D.Stead@tudelft.nl,"Stead, Dominic/O-8029-2014","Stead, Dominic/0000-0002-8198-785X; meng, meng/0000-0002-7306-0544",,,,,123,8,8,9,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2020,12,19,,,,,,,7864,10.3390/su12197864,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12197864,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ON5ZC,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000586777700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

First the paper explains the abstract human rights arguments about displacement in climate change and disaster. In contrast, management and claims under lawsuits about climate change and displacement are place-based. The paper then draws on data about knowledge and management strategies in a particular place in the United States, and on a close reading of legal reasoning in a post-disaster domestic housing case in the United States. The paper relies on interpretive methods. Although legal reasoning is often represented as distinctive in how it transforms stories into decisions, it shares characteristics with other forms of policy reasoning. Institutional reasoning transforms the existential threat of climate change into managed parts. The paper argues that intervening concerning climate change and displacement requires shifting from broad claims in the drama of climate change and rights to following tactics logical within particular institutions.","[Sterett, Susan M.] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Sch Publ Policy, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Sterett, SM (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Sch Publ Policy, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.",ssterett@umbc.edu,,,"NSF [1821912, 1721745]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I am grateful to the International Institute for the Sociology of Law for hosting the workshop in July 2017.

This study shows that the stakeholder groups agree that the climate is clearly changing, attribute this change mostly to man-made causes and expect the negative effects to either prevail or be unevenly geographically distributed. The large majority of all three groups consider unmitigated climate change a major threat even by 2050 and agree that preparing in advance is the best sectoral strategy. Importantly, while investment in adaptation measures is considered the most efficient tool for accelerating the implementation of adaptation measures, the CAP and EU rules (as valid in 2016) are believed to hinder such measures.

However, key landscape dynamic transfer processes that can affect land surface temperature (LST) and regional thermal environment (RTE) remain poorly understood, especially in the context of urban agglomerations. Hence we selected one of the world's most rapidly urbanized regions - the Pearl-River-Delta Metropolitan Region (PRDR) located in southern China as the case. With the help of Google Cloud Computing, Markov model, and spatial analyses, we have further quantified the strong contributions of urbanization and urban agglomeration development to RTE dynamics and evolution. Specifically, we revealed (1) the cooling effects of ecological land loss and gain are significantly different, which provides evidence that the existing natural ecosystems (especially forests) are valuable for climatic adaptation because newly constructed ecological land does not provide the same cooling effect. (2) We found that the RTE is not only influenced by land cover patterns and process but also significantly dominated by the specific land conversion processes.

In this study, we used the projections derived from four global gridded crop models (GGCropMs) to assess the effects of future climate change on the yields of the major crops (i.e., maize, rice, soybean and wheat) in China. The GGCropMs were forced with the bias-corrected climate data from five global climate models (GCMs) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, which were made available through the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP). The results show that the potential yields of the crops would decrease in the 21st century without carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization effect. With the CO2 effect, the potential yields of rice and soybean would increase, while the potential yields of maize and wheat would decrease. The uncertainty in yields resulting from the GGCropMs is larger than the uncertainty derived from GCMs in the greater part of China. Climate change may benefit rice and soybean yields in highaltitude and cold regions which are not in the current main agricultural area. However, the potential yields of maize, soybean and wheat may decrease in the major food production area. Development of new agronomic management strategies may be useful for coping with climate change in the areas with a high risk of yield reduction.","[Yin, Y.; Tang, Q.; Liu, X.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Tang, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",tangqh@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Liu, Xingcai/R-3510-2018; Tang, Qiuhong/ABA-2194-2021; Tang, Qiuhong/AAD-9832-2022","Liu, Xingcai/0000-0001-5726-7353; Tang, Qiuhong/0000-0002-0886-6699; ","National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB955403]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41425002, 41171031]; Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LS1201A]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (grant no. 2012CB955403), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41425002 and 41171031), and the Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

We further assess the role that a citizen science climate service could play as a boundary object in knowledge co-production. We draw on experiences from a co-design process that included municipal stakeholders from different sectors as well as municipal employees and civil society end-users involved in campaigns. This study identified a set of barriers and enablers for the co-design process and concludes that the CitizenSensing application can fulfil the role of a boundary object, but that the co-design process is a balancing act between navigating time constraints, including stakeholders' different and changing demands and perspectives while retaining a high level of flexibility and reflexivity.","[Neset, T-S; Wilk, J.] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Cruz, S.; Graca, M.] Univ Porto, Res Ctr Terr Transports & Environm CITTA, Fac Engn, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; [Rod, J.

However, we know little about how these changes are dealt with locally. This article aims to fill this gap by examining climate change impacts and adaptation in a non-Indigenous community of experts and sets out to 1) describe observed changes and perceived societal impacts of climate change and 2) discuss adaptation measures and related understandings of adaptation. The research consists of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with planners, engineers, architects, scientists, construction workers and local politicians. The research finds that climate change impacts the built environment in Longyearbyen, and that there is vast awareness of and concern related to these impacts. There is a substantial knowledge base for adaptation, and a special trust in scientific knowledge, skills and experts. The interview partners consider adaptation as necessary and feasible. Adaptation is understood and implemented as technical responses to physical problems, rooted in a modernist understanding of the environment as separated from humans, who can control it through technical means. This suggests a narrow understanding of adaptation that might fail to address more socially transformative processes.","[Meyer, Alexandra] Univ Vienna, Dept Social & Cultural Anthropol, Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Meyer, A (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Social & Cultural Anthropol, Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",Alexandra.meyer@univie.ac.at,,"Meyer, Alexandra/0000-0003-0753-4569",,,,,61,2,2,4,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0032-2474,1475-3057,,POLAR REC,POLAR REC.,SEP 1,2022,58,,,,,,,,e29,10.1017/S0032247422000079,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0032247422000079,,,13,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4E9XY,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000848172600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thereby, conflicts between distributive and allocative objectives arise, which threaten the overall performance of such transfer schemes. Given the severity of the climate change problem, this study aims to raise concerns about whether the world can afford climate transfer schemes that do not focus on prevention of (and adaptation to) climate change but might be considered as a vehicle of rent-seeking by many agents. Design/methodology/approach Future designs of international transfer schemes within the framework of the Paris Agreement are to be based on experience gained from existing mechanisms. Therefore, the authors examine different existing schemes using a graphical technique first proposed by David Pearce and describe the conflicts between allocative and distributional goals that arise. Findings In line with the famous Tinbergen rule, the authors argue that other sustainability problems and issues of global fairness should not be primarily addressed by climate finance but should be mainly tackled by other means. Research limitations/implications As there is still ongoing, intense discussion about how the international transfer schemes addressed in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement should be designed, the research will help to sort some of the key arguments. Practical implications There are prominent international documents (like the Paris Agreement and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development) seeking to address different goals simultaneously. While synergies between policies is desirable, there are major challenges for policy coordination. Addressing several different goals using fewer policy instruments, for example, will not succeed as the Tinbergen Rule points out. Social implications The integration of co-benefits in the analysis allows for taking into account the social effects of climate policy. As the authors argue, climate finance approaches could become overstrained if policymakers would consider them as tools to also solve local sustainability problems. Originality/value In this paper, the authors will not only examine what can be learnt from the clean development mechanism (CDM) for future schemes under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement but also observe the experiences gained from a non-CDM scheme. So the authors pay attention to the Trust Fund of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) which was established with global benefit orientation, i.e. - unlike the CDM - it was not regarded as an additional goal to support local sustainable development. Yet, despite its disregard of local co-benefits, the authors think that it is of particular importance to include the GEF in the analysis, as some important lessons can be learnt from it.","[Buchholz, Wolfgang] Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ, Regensburg, Germany; [Buchholz, Wolfgang] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Rubbelke, Dirk] Tech Univ Bergakademie, Fac Business Adm, Freiberg, Germany; [Rubbelke, Dirk] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Ctr Environm Management Resources & Energy, Fac Econ & Management, Bochum, Germany",University of Regensburg; Ifo Institut; Technical University Freiberg; Ruhr University Bochum,"Buchholz, W (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ, Regensburg, Germany.;Buchholz, W (corresponding author), CESifo, Munich, Germany.",wolfgang.buchholz@wiwi.uni-regensburg.de; dirk.ruebbelke@vwl.tu-freiberg.de,"Rübbelke, Dirk/M-5604-2013","Rübbelke, Dirk/0000-0002-9934-8570",,,,,57,0,0,1,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

The national legal system of countries can play an important role in creating and encouraging such a shift. In this study, we explore the potentials and shortcomings of national laws in managing flood risk and increasing flood resilience in the context of climate change. We analyze 139 laws from 33 countries collected from the Climate Change Laws of the World and Disaster Law databases and underpin this with case studies to gain insights on the interplay between national laws and resilience processes. We find: (1) a shift in flood laws from focusing on flooding as a natural resource and water resource management issue towards a broader consideration of disaster risk management (DRM) and climate adaptation policy; (2) a significant lack of climate change recognition in laws regulating decisions and actions for future flood risks, especially in DRM; (3) a prevailing focus on response and recovery strategies and a lack of recognition of risk reduction strategies and proactive flood risk governance approaches; and (4) little recognition of natural capital (comparing to physical capital) and its role in increasing flood resilience. Key policy insights Flood-related laws around the world lack consideration of future risks. Disaster risk management and climate change are often considered as separate issues in national laws, which can lead to gaps in institutional ownership, responsibilities, and allocated budgets. Flood-related laws are mainly created after major events, most of which are focused on reactive strategies (i.e. response and recovery). Laws can facilitate the shift from post-event response to anticipatory actions by encouraging proactive flood risk management (FRM) activities (i.e. risk reduction). Nature-based solutions often remain unrecognized in national laws due to the dominant focus on hard engineering measures. FRM should be treated as a holistic concept in laws: ensuring all the necessary human, social, physical, natural and financial systems are in place to support it.","[Mehryar, Sara; Surminski, Swenja] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Mehryar, S (corresponding author), LSE, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.mehryar@lse.ac.uk,"Mehryar, Sara/GSE-2683-2022",,ESRC [ES/R009708/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,73,14,14,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Therefore, the safety, serviceability and durability of concrete infrastructure may decline at a faster rate than expected. Carbonation-induced deterioration to concrete structures constructed in Sydney, Australia and Kunming, China under a changing climate is investigated in this paper. Two emissions scenarios are considered - RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, representing high and medium greenhouse gas emissions scenarios respectively. The spatial time-dependent reliability analysis includes time-dependent climate scenarios and deterioration processes, as well as a large number of random variables and spatial random fields of material properties and dimensions. The surface of concrete structures is discretised into a large number of elements and the likelihood and extent of corrosion damage is calculated by tracking the evolution of the corrosion process of each element using Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that a changing climate could cause the extent of damage to increase by up to 6% for reinforced concrete infrastructure in Kunming. The findings may be used to assess climate adaptation measures in the design stage, as well as a cost-benefit analysis of climate adaptation measures.","[Peng, Lizhengli; Stewart, Mark G.] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Infrastruct Performance & Reliabil, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Peng, LZL (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Ctr Infrastruct Performance & Reliabil, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",,,"Stewart, Mark/0000-0001-6887-6533",,,,,61,23,23,2,25,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",0024-9831,1751-763X,,MAG CONCRETE RES,Mag.

This vulnerability is now further raised by the threat of climate change and accelerated sea level rise. The potentially severe impacts force policy-makers to also consider long-term planning for climate change and sea level rise. For reasons of efficiency and effectiveness this long-term planning should be integrated with existing short-term plans, thus creating an Integrated Coastal Zone Management programme. As a starting point for coastal zone management, the assessment of a country's or region's vulnerability to accelerated sea level rise is of utmost importance. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has developed a common methodology for this purpose. Studies carried out according to this Common Methodology have been compared and combined, from which general conclusions on local, regional and global vulnerability have been drawn, the latter in the form of a Global Vulnerability Assessment. In order to address the challenge of coping with climate change and accelerated sea level rise, it is essential to foresee the possible impacts, and to take precautionary action. Because of the long lead times needed for creating the required technical and institutional infrastructures, such action should be taken in the short term.

The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) is a key ecological functional area and hotspot of carbon sequestration in China due to the high degree of forest coverage. We used a process-based ecosystem model to project terrestrial NPP and analyzed the response to climate change over the 21st century in the YREB under two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios using the regional climate model. The results show that the projection of NPP generally increased by 13.5% under RCP4.5 and 16.4% under RCP8.5 in the middle of the century, by 23% under RCP4.5, and by 35% under RCP8.5 in the late term of the century compared with that from a reference period of current climate conditions (1985-2006). The rate of NPP change under the RCP8.5 scenario is higher than that under the RCP4.5 scenario. Similarly, the NPP is also projected to increase both with 1.5 and 2 degrees C global warming targets in the YREB. The magnitudes of NPP increment are approximately 14.7% with 1.5 degrees C and 21% with 2 degrees C warming targets compared with the current climate, which are higher than the average increments of China. Although NPP is projected to increase under the two scenarios, the tendency of NPP increasingly exhibits a slowdown after the 2060 s under the RCP4.5 scenario, and the growth rate of NPP is projected to drop in more than 31% of regional areas with the additional 0.5 degrees C warming. In contrast, under the RCP8.5 scenario, the trend in NPP keeps rising substantially, even above 2 degrees C global warming. However, the NPP in some provinces, including Jiangxi and Hunan, is projected to reduce at the end of the 21st century, probably because of temperature rises, precipitation decreases, and water demand increases. Generally, the NPP is projected to increase due to climate change, particularly temperature increase. However, temperature rising does not always show a positive effect on NPP increasing; the growth rate of NPP will slow down under the RCP4.5 scenario in the mid-late 21st century, and NPP will also reduce by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario in some places, probably presenting some risks to terrestrial ecosystems in these areas, in terms of reduced functions and service decline, a weakened capacity of carbon sequestration, and reduced agricultural production.","[Yu, Li; Xu, Yuqing; Zhang, Yongxiang] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Botao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteo, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Gu, Fengxue] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Key Lab Dryland Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development in Agriculture, CAAS","Gu, FX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Key Lab Dryland Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yuli@cma.cn; zhoubt@nuist.edu.cn; xuyq@cma.cn; zhangyx@cma.cn; gufengxue@caas.cn,,"zhou, Botao/0000-0002-5995-2378",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41991285],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China grant number [41991285].,,57,2,2,7,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,MAY,2022,14,5,,,,,,,327,10.3390/d14050327,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14050327,,,16,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1Q3ML,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000802595900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper we examine how knowledge construction and risk perception on water-related disaster risks and vulnerabilities affects decision-making and implementation in urban governance networks, specifically looking at some of the reasons behind high levels of risk tolerance and the lack of decision-making initiatives in putting adaptation and/or preventive measures in place. New forms of metropolitan governance have constructed spatial knowledge about water-related vulnerabilities using inclusive scenario-building processes. These unpack complexities, uncertainties and spatial inequalities in water governance, making them visible by mapping and spatial representations as strategic instrument for social and policy learning. This article analyzes two case studies, which either already are or can become disasters (scenario building). The first, concerns the long-term plausible scenario of water scarcity and droughts analyzing population growth rates, water distribution and consumption through the Chance2Sustain research project and presenting spatial representations. The maps were used to define possible spatial intervention priorities to deal with future water vulnerabilities in Lima. The second, refers to short term extreme weather events that already manifest as mudslides and floods and El Nino in Chosica, eastern Lima. We investigate the first at the metropolitan city scale level and the second at the scale of vulnerable communities. The cases illustrate iterative spatial knowledge construction, in which processes of risk prioritization, normalization and tolerance occur, and the resulting [in-]action by a variety of actors so far. The methodology used collective and iterative mapping processes, using technical, organizational and geographical knowledge from a variety of governance, experts and practitioner networks in Lima. The main outcome is the social learning derived from bringing together different kinds of knowledge and integrating several dimensions through spatial representations. This has raised awareness, increased capacities for dealing with uncertainty and contributed to the approved metropolitan Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, but not implemented by the Lima Municipality yet. The main conclusions are two: 1) spatial planning is a quite political process (c.f. Flyvbjerg 1998), in which knowledge is contested or even when acknowledged, does not necessarily steer decision-making processes, either by local communities, authorities and private institutions. And 2) existing models linking knowledge construction to risk framing, risk tolerance and how these influence decision-making processes and actions to prevent disaster may ignore the issues of risk tolerance, through normalization and prioritization at their peril.

Here we show from computational modelling that hydropower regulation is a key driver of flow regime change in snow-dominated regions and is more important than future climate changes. This implies that climate adaptation needs to include regulation schemes. The natural river regime in snowy regions has low flow when snow is stored and a pronounced peak flow when snow is melting. Global warming and hydropower regulation change this temporal pattern similarly, causing less difference in river flow between seasons. We conclude that in snow-fed rivers globally, the future climate change impact on flow regime is minor compared to regulation downstream of large reservoirs, and of similar magnitude over large landmasses. Our study not only highlights the impact of hydropower production but also that river regulation could be turned into a measure for climate adaptation to maintain biodiversity on floodplains under climate change.","[Arheimer, B.; Donnelly, C.; Lindstrom, G.] SMHI, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Arheimer, B (corresponding author), SMHI, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.",berit.arheimer@smhi.se,,"Arheimer, Berit/0000-0001-8314-0735; Donnelly, Chantal/0000-0002-0086-4453",EU FP7 [603587]; Knowledge Center for Climate Change Adaptation at SMHI; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (HaV),EU FP7(European Commission); Knowledge Center for Climate Change Adaptation at SMHI; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (HaV),"The study was performed within the EU FP7-funded project SWITCH-ON (grant agreement 603587), which explores the untapped potential of Open Data to tackle changes in the Hydrosphere.

The State-Pressure-Response-Adaptation model is used to organize the review. The major findings are: Constant or declining food prices are expected for at least the next 25 yr, although food security problems will persist in many developing countries as those countries deal with population increases, political crisis, poor resource endowments, and steady environmental degradation. Most economic model projections suggest that low relative food prices will extend beyond the next 25 yr, although our confidence in these projections erodes farther out into the 21st century. Although deforestation rates may have decreased since the early 1990s, degradation with a loss of forest productivity and biomass has occurred at large spatial scales as a result of fragmentation, non-sustainable practices and infrastructure development. According to United Nations estimates, approximately 23% of all forest and agricultural lands were classified as degraded over the period since World War II. At a worldwide scale, global change pressures (climate change, land-use practices and changes in atmospheric chemistry) are increasingly affecting the supply of goods and services from forests. The most realistic experiments to date - free air experiments in an irrigated environment - indicate that C-3 agricultural crops in particular respond favorably to gradually increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations (e.g., wheat yield increases by an average of 28%), although extrapolation of experimental results to real world production where several factors (e.g., nutrients, temperature, precipitation, and others) are likely to be limiting at one time or another remains problematic. Moreover, little is known of crop response to elevated CO2 in the tropics, as most of the research has been conducted in the mid-latitudes. Research suggests that for some crops, for example rice, CO2 benefits may decline quickly as temperatures warm beyond optimum photosynthetic levels. However, crop plant growth may benefit relatively more from CO2 enrichment in drought conditions than in wet conditions. The unambiguous separation of the relative influences of elevated ambient CO2 levels, climate change responses, and direct human influences (such as present and historical land-use change) on trees at the global and regional scales is still problematic. In some regions such as the temperate and boreal forests, climate change impacts, direct human interventions (including nitrogen-bearing pollution), and the legacy of past human activities (land-use change) appear to be more significant than CO2 fertilization effects. This subject is, however an area of continuing scientific debate, although there does appear to be consensus that any CO2 fertilization effect will saturate (disappear) in the coming century. Modeling studies suggest that any warming above current temperatures will diminish crop yields in the tropics while up to 2-3 degrees C of warming in the mid-latitudes may be tolerated by crops, especially if accompanied by increasing precipitation. The preponderance of developing countries lies in or near the tropics; this finding does not bode well for food production in those countries. Where direct human pressures do not mask them, there is increasing evidence of the impacts of climate change on forests associated with changes in natural disturbance regimes, growing season length, and local climatic extremes. Recent advances in modeling of vegetation response suggest that transient effects associated with dynamically responding ecosystems to climate change will increasingly dominate over the next century and that during these changes the global forest resource is likely to be adversely affected. The ability of livestock producers to adapt their herds to the physiological stress of climate change appears encouraging due to a variety of techniques for dealing with climate stress, but this issue is not well constrained, in part because of the general lack of experimentation and simulations of livestock adaptation to climate change. Crop and livestock farmers who have sufficient access to capital and technologies should be able to adapt their farming systems to climate change. Substantial changes in their mix of crops and livestock production may be necessary, however, as considerable costs could be involved in this process because investments in learning and gaining experience with different crops or irrigation. Impacts of climate change on agriculture after adaptation are estimated to result in small percentage changes in overall global income. Nations with large resource endowments (i.e., developed countries) will fare better in adapting to climate change than those with poor resource endowments (i.e., developing countries and countries in transition, especially in the tropics and subtropics) which will fare worse. This, in turn, could worsen income disparities between developed and developing countries. Although local forest ecosystems will be highly affected, with potentially significant local economic impacts, it is believed that, at regional and global scales, the global supply of timber and non-wood goods and services will adapt through changes in the global market place. However, there will be regional shifts in market share associated with changes in forest productivity with climate change: in contrast to the findings of the SAR, recent studies suggest that the changes will favor producers in developing countries, possibly at the expense of temperate and boreal suppliers. Global agricultural vulnerability is assessed by the anticipated effects of climate change on food prices. Based on the accumulated evidence of modeling studies, a global temperature rise of greater than 2.5 degrees C is likely to reverse the trend of falling real food prices. This would greatly stress food security in many developing countries.","Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Pacific Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Victoria, BC, Canada",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service,"Easterling, W (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",easter@gis.psu.edu,,,,,,,90,76,82,3,282,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

It is thus imperative to identify agro-climate wise, area-specific adaptation options to ensure food security. This study, therefore, evaluated some feasible adaptation options for two staple food grain crops, rice and wheat, in different agro-climatic regions (ACRs) of Eastern India. Alteration in transplanting date, seedling age, and fertilizer management (rate and split of fertilizer) for rice; and sowing date, fertilizer management, and deficit irrigation scheduling for wheat, are assessed as adaptation options. Crop environment and resource synthesis (DSSAT) model is used to simulate the crop yield using different plausible adaptation options to projected climate scenarios. Findings show that shifting transplanting/sowing date, and nitrogen fertilizer application at 120% of recommended nitrogen dose with four splits could be an effective adaptation for rice and wheat crops. Results also emphasize that transplanting of 18 days older seedlings may be beneficial in rice cultivation. In contrast, irrigation at a 30-40% deficit of maximum available water would sustain the wheat yield under climate change conditions. This study suggests the best combination of adaptation options under climate change conditions in diverse ACRs, which may assist agriculturists in coping with climate change.","[Dubey, Madhuri; Mishra, Ashok; Singh, Rajendra] Indian Inst Technol, Agr & Food Engn Dept, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Mishra, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Agr & Food Engn Dept, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",amishra@agfe.iitkgp.ac.in,,,"project, 'Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Climate Change studies' at IIT Kharagpur; Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India under Climate Change Programme (SPLICE)","project, 'Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Climate Change studies' at IIT Kharagpur; Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India under Climate Change Programme (SPLICE)","This work is partially supported by the project, 'Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Climate Change studies,' established at IIT Kharagpur and funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India under Climate Change Programme (SPLICE).",,50,0,0,11,16,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",2040-2244,2408-9354,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

To understand how farmers adapt their livelihoods to climatic variability, this mixed methods study explored their perceptions and climate adaptability strategies implemented in Huayhuay, Peru. Twenty farmers participated in semi-structured interviews, and 103 completed a survey questionnaire. The results indicated that most farmers perceive changes in temperature, precipitation, and drought that negatively affect agricultural production and local natural resources. To deal with CC, farmers are implementing twenty-six climate adaptation strategies. Diversifying agricultural products and practices, and exploring new economic activities were adaptability strategies identified in this study that the literature has previously documented as having positive implications for agricultural livelihoods. However, some farmers reported that adaptability strategies are failed attempts at local climate action. The results, along with the adaptability literature, revealed that farmers implement locally accessible adaptability strategies based on their climate variability perceptions. Therefore, this study recommends exploring CC perceptions and adaptability strategies with a site-based approach. It is also recommended that future research, local climate planning, and action must focus on the efficiency and inclusiveness of strategies rather than their frequency or levels of adoption.

By selecting the city of Ravenna and the cultural heritage site of the Santa Croce Church and archaeological area as a case study, the paper aims at providing an insight into the role that urban planning tools have when it comes to improving the resilience of historical areas, coping with climate change through improvements to the disaster risk management of cultural heritage. Starting from a deep analysis of the existing spatial and urban planning tools that operate at different scales on the Ravenna territory, the adaptive capacity of the historical area toward the identified risks was assessed. The results may lead, on the one hand, to improving the integration of cultural heritage risk management into urban planning tools; on the other hand, they contribute to improving the scope and the governance of the heritage management plans in order to cope with climate change risks and their effects.","[Rosa, Angela; Santangelo, Angela; Tondelli, Simona] Univ Bologna, Alma Mater Studiorum, Dept Architecture, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; [Santangelo, Angela; Tondelli, Simona] Univ Bologna, Alma Mater Studiorum, CIRI Bldg & Construct, I-40136 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Santangelo, A (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Alma Mater Studiorum, Dept Architecture, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.;Santangelo, A (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Alma Mater Studiorum, CIRI Bldg & Construct, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",angela.rosa2@studio.unibo.it; angela.santangelo@unibo.it; simona.tondelli@unibo.it,,"SANTANGELO, ANGELA/0000-0002-6488-3872; Tondelli, Simona/0000-0003-0891-7852",European Union [821282],European Union(European Commission),This research has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement no 821282.

This high-input, intensive system must become more efficient to meet food demands while reducing its environmental footprint. Futuristic tall and narrow compact beds were designed with an aim to improve the plasticulture system by increasing or maintaining yield while decreasing system input requirements. Using a whole-systems approach, compact geometries were evaluated on an example crop, eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), in the ecologically sensitive but highly productive sub-tropical Everglades region of Florida. Two compact beds, 61 cm (width) x 25 cm (height) and 45 cm x 30 cm, were evaluated against a conventional short and wide bed, 91 cm x 15 cm. The conventional bed used two drip tapes for irrigation and fertigation. The compact beds needed only one tape but produced equivalent yields as the conventional bed. Irrigation, nitrogen, and phosphorus application rates were respectively reduced by 50%, 14%, and 19% in the compact beds. Water and nutrient productivities with the compact beds increased by at least $43 per 10 kL irrigation, $6 per kg nitrogen, and $8 per kg phosphorus applied, representing respective gains of 92%, 11%, and 8% over the conventional bed. Productivity increases highlight how compact beds can make plasticulture more efficient. Shifting to compact beds also brings non-water co-benefits, including reductions in the system's production costs by $560 to $670 ha(-1), carbon footprint by 5% to 10% (reduced fumigant and plastic usage), agricultural plastic waste, and potential detrimental impacts from changed climate. Compact beds provide flood and disease protection by decreasing impervious (mulched) surface area and having extra bed height above the ground. Use of compact beds at the study farm would decrease rainfall intensity in the row middles by 34% and increase the farm's soil water storage capacity by 52% (1.4 cm). Increased storage and infiltration of rainfall will decrease flooding frequency and runoff volume, thereby reducing peak flows in downstream environments. Compact beds also have an added economic benefit for farmers who pay to lease land, as production can be increased through a higher plant population density without changing total mulched surface area. A cultural shift to taller and narrower compact beds makes plasticulture more sustainable as water, nutrient, cost, and energy inputs are reduced without sacrificing yields. Compact beds provide the impetus to transform plasticulture to a futuristic, further-optimized system that is more automated (e.g., chemigation), less labor intensive, and better adapted to climate change for continued economic and environmental viability.","[Holt, N.; Shukla, S.] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Immokalee, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Shukla, S (corresponding author), 29 State Rd North, Immokalee, FL 34142 USA.",sshukla@ufl.edu,,,Southwest Florida Water Management District; CB Farms,Southwest Florida Water Management District; CB Farms,"Funds for this study were provided by the Southwest Florida Water Management District and C&B Farms.

The Paris Agreement has noted that adaptation is a key component of the global response to climate change. Nations with lower incomes and greater vulnerability to climate change have and will continue to suffer from the potential or actual impacts of climate change due to their limited and fragmented adaptation. Here, we consider Central Asia as a case study due to its increasing temperature, increasing rainfall variability, worsening drought, rapid institutional changes after independence, and uneven economic investment in adaptation. This paper identifies five urgent fields (including the theoretical basis, technology and measure, law and regulation, funding, and the political system) and analyzes the gap between ideal and real adaptation, finds the direction for future adaptation, and provides adaptation strategies for similar nations by using CiteSpace, which is based on the Web of Science Core Collection from 1990 to 2019. The detailed strategies present four mainstream development directions: (1) improve the theoretical basis of adaptation and increase investment in research; (2) encourage research and development into targeted approaches of adaptation and acquire technology transfer from developed countries; (3) integrate adaptation into medium- and long-term plans for national sustainable development, widely involving non-government agencies in the process; and (4) obtain financial support from international organizations.","[Liu, Wanlu; Liu, Lulu; Gao, Jiangbo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wanlu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Gao, JB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liuwl.18b@igsnrr.ac.cn; liull.16b@igsnnr.ac.cn; gaojiangbo@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20020202]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1508900, 2018YFC1508801]",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Key R&D Program of China,"This work was financially supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA20020202) and National Key R&D Program of China, No. 2018YFC1508900, No. 2018YFC1508801.",,99,4,4,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Yet, reservoirs have yet to be commonly integrated into earth system models. This deficiency influences model processes such as evaporation and runoff, which are critical for accurate simulations of the coupled climate system. This study describes the development of a generalized reservoir model capable of reproducing realistic reservoir behavior for future integration in a global land surface model (LSM). Equations of increasing complexity relating reservoir inflow, outflow, and storage were tested for 14 California reservoirs that span a range of spatial and climate regimes. Temperature was employed in model equations to modulate seasonal changes in reservoir management behavior and to allow for the evolution of management seasonality as future climate varies. Optimized parameter values for the best-performing model were generalized based on the ratio of winter inflow to storage capacity so a future LSM user can generate reservoirs in any grid location by specifying the given storage capacity. Model performance statistics show good agreement between observed and simulated reservoir storage and outflow for both calibration (mean normalized RMSE = 0.48; mean coefficient of determination = 0.53) and validation reservoirs (mean normalized RMSE = 0.15; mean coefficient of determination = 0.67). The low complexity of model equations that include climate-adaptive operation features combined with robust model performance show promise for simulations of reservoir impacts on hydrology and climate within an LSM.","[Solander, Kurt C.; Famiglietti, James S.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, 3200 Croul Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Reager, John T.; Thomas, Brian F.; David, Cedric H.; Famiglietti, James S.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Famiglietti, James S.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Famiglietti, JS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, 3200 Croul Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jfamigli@uci.edu,"Famiglietti, James/G-7383-2017","Famiglietti, James/0000-0002-6053-5379; David, Cedric/0000-0002-0924-5907; Thomas, Brian/0000-0003-0080-7958","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NESSF); Jenkins Fellowship; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology; NASA","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NESSF); Jenkins Fellowship; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","The authors are particularly grateful for the generous financial support received from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NESSF) and the Jenkins Fellowship for this research.

Climate models, constructed based on long-term trends, show that extreme weather events such as storms, cloudbursts and a large rise in sea level will be significant in the coming decades. Moreover, even the frequency and intensity of normal rainfall events, such as microbursts, are expected to be remarkably higher than today in some regions. The efficiency of urban drainage systems is affected by the land use in its whole catchment. In addition to the climate stress, there is ongoing continuous densification of urban space, resulting in more buildings and larger areas being covered with impervious surfaces. Planning decisions today approving such compaction do not consider the impacts beyond the close proximity of the land parcel. As a result, by following the current planning practices, cities are becoming extremely vulnerable to stormwater flooding (flash floods). This study presents a holistic and dynamic planning method - the Extreme Weather Layer (EWL) - that makes it possible to analyse the impact of a single development (e.g. paving a gravel parking lot with asphalt or turning an area of urban greenery into a shopping centre) on the performance of the urban drainage system and therefore on the flooding risk of the whole catchment. The EWL is based on a widely accepted drainage modelling engine coupled with GIS system and other databases which provide spatial information. Thus, the EWL combined with the systemic approach of turning from grey to green infrastructure could be a smart tool for implementing NBS solutions for stormwater management in climate adaptation in urban areas. This smart tool could indicate how much more green infrastructure is needed and which places in the city the mitigative NBS measures would help significantly.","[Fitobor, Karolina; Kolecka, Katarzyna; Zima, Piotr; Kalinowska, Dominika; Wielgat, Pawel; Gajewska, Magdalena] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Water & Wastewater Technol, Narutowicza St 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland; [Ulanczyk, Rafal] Inst Environm Protect, Natl Res Inst, Kolektorska St 4, PL-01692 Warsaw, Poland; [Ramm, Klara; Wlodarek, Iwona] Econ Chamber Polish Waterworks, Jana Kasprowicza St 2, PL-85073 Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Mikulska, Malgorzata; Antonczyk, Danuta; Krzaczkowski, Krzysztof; Lyszyk, Remigiusz] Water Supply Co Slupsk, Elizy Orzeszkowej St 1, PL-76200 Slupsk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; Institute of Environmental Protection - National Research Institute,"Kolecka, K (corresponding author), Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Water & Wastewater Technol, Narutowicza St 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",katkolec@pg.edu.pl,,"Ramm, Klara/0000-0003-1707-4228; Ulanczyk, Rafal/0000-0002-1416-2372","NOAH project - INTERREG BSR [R093 ?]; program of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education Republic of Poland ?

The study seeks to answer that how local people perceive climate change and its impact on their household income and to what extent value chain development of mountain products prove to be a potential strategy for building climate resilience among local people? This study contributes to the existing scholarship on climate adaptation by proposing non-conventional and innovative livelihood strategies for enhancing climate resilience of local communities in four valleys of northern Pakistan. The research relies on both primary and secondary data. A field survey was carried out to collect data from 443 households using a structured questionnaire. This study shows that the mountain communities consider climate-induced natural hazards as major causes of change in households' income. To enhance the socioeconomic resilience against these climate vulnerabilities, cultivating sea buckthorn, breeding yak and developing value chains for related products has been suggested. Breeding yaks are both less labor intensive and climate resilient. Products made from yak hair and dung have the potential for high return if their value chains are established. Likewise, sea buckthorn is also considered less labor intensive and insensitive to extreme weather conditions. It could generate by-products used for food, medicine, cosmetics and construction. In order to improve socioeconomic resilience of local communities and enhance their adaptive capacity against effects of climate change, a value chain approach for yak and sea-buckthorn products has been proposed.","[Baig, Saranjam M.] Karakorum Int Univ, Dept Econ, Gilgit, Pakistan; [Khan, Aftab A.] Karakorum Int Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Gilgit, Pakistan; [Ali, Amjad] Karakorum Int Univ Hunza Campus, Dept Dev Studies, Gilgit, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Zafar] Karakorum Int Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Gilgit, Pakistan; [Ahmed, Sultan] French Med Inst Mothers & Children FMIC, Kabul, Afghanistan; [Shah, Ghulam M.; Ali, Ghulam] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Lalitpur, Nepal",,"Ali, A (corresponding author), Karakorum Int Univ Hunza Campus, Dept Dev Studies, Gilgit, Pakistan.",saranjam.baig@kiu.edu.pk; aftab.ahmed@kiu.edu.pk; amjad.eco@kiu.edu.pk; zafar.khan@kiu.edu.pk; rajasultan.ahmed@gmail.com; GhulamMuhammad.Shah@icimod.org; Ghulam.Ali@icimod.org,"Shah, Dr. Ghulam Mustafa/AAZ-1981-2021; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Ali, Amjad/0000-0002-5840-8848; Baig, Saranjam/0000-0003-2407-3776",European Union (EU),European Union (EU)(CGIAREuropean Commission),"The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers of this paper.

Temperature increases and SLR-induced groundwater rise have been shown to cause premature pavement failure in many roadway structures. Hybrid bottom-up/top-down (hybrid) adaptation approaches have shown promise by initially investigating an asset's response to incremental environmental change and then identifying the timing of critical effects for budgetary planning. This improves practitioners' understanding of the asset's climate resiliency and informs adaptation-plan development to minimize both cost and risk. In this study, a hybrid approach to pavement adaptation with climate-change-induced temperature and groundwater rise is demonstrated at a case-study site in coastal New Hampshire. The hot-mix-asphalt (HMA) thickness that achieves a minimum of 85% reliability is calculated for 70 combinations of incremental temperature and groundwater rise. Increasing the base-layer thickness improves resiliency against rising temperatures, but rising groundwater diminishes this improvement demonstrating that both HMA and base-layer thickness increases are needed. Thirteen adaptation pathways are evaluated for pavement performance, life-cycle costs, and road-surface inundation over a 60-year pavement management period. A stepwise and flexible adaptation plan is developed that includes HMA overlays with prescribed thickness and application timing, base-layer rehabilitation options, and re-evaluation opportunities.","[Knott, Jayne E.] JFK Environm Serv LLC, Upton, MA 01568 USA; [Jacobs, Jennifer M.; Sias, Jo E.; Dave, Eshan, V] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Kirshen, Paul] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Knott, JE (corresponding author), JFK Environm Serv LLC, Upton, MA 01568 USA.",jfknott@jfkenviroserv.com,"Knott, Jayne/GQP-2309-2022; Dave, Eshan/G-2937-2010","Jacobs, Jennifer/0000-0003-3824-6439; Knott, Jayne/0000-0002-3663-107X; Dave, Eshan/0000-0001-9788-2246; Sias, Jo/0000-0001-5284-0392",University of New Hampshire (UNH) Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering; UNH Center for Infrastructure Resilience to Climate (UCIRC); Infrastructure and Climate Network (ICNet) - U.S. National Science Foundation via the RCN-SEES: Engineering Research Collaboratory for Sustainable Infrastructure in a Changing Climate [CBET 1231326],University of New Hampshire (UNH) Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering; UNH Center for Infrastructure Resilience to Climate (UCIRC); Infrastructure and Climate Network (ICNet) - U.S. National Science Foundation via the RCN-SEES: Engineering Research Collaboratory for Sustainable Infrastructure in a Changing Climate,This research was funded in part by the University of New Hampshire (UNH) Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering; and the UNH Center for Infrastructure Resilience to Climate (UCIRC).

This study reviews the complementarity and comparability between the two, looking first at the global level and then at the national-to-local domain. At the global level, the review finds differing definitions and viewpoints exist in the literature. Much of the economic literature reports that global mitigation and adaptation are substitutes (in economic terms). In contrast, the scientific literature considers them to be complementary (in policy terms), as they address different risks that vary temporally and spatially. The degree of complementarity and comparability therefore depends on the perspective taken, although there is a policy space where the two can overlap. However, the governance, institutional, and policy-based literature identifies that even if a global mitigation and adaptation mix could be defined, it would be highly contentious and extremely difficult to deliver in practice. The review then considers the complementarity and comparability of mitigation and adaptation at the national-to-local domain, in national policy and at sector level. The review finds there is greater potential for complementarity at this scale, although possible conflicts can also exist. However, the institutional, governance, and policy literature identifies a number of barriers to practical implementation, and as a result, complementary mitigation and adaptation action is unlikely to happen autonomously. Finally, the lessons from the review are drawn together to highlight policy relevant issues and identify research gaps.

Yet, in addition to providing means to minimise the impact of climate variability and change on livelihoods, climate adaptation strategies might exacerbate environmental change and cause negative social impacts. Systematic research has not addressed the impacts of adaptation on environmental change. In this paper, I focus on land use change as a specific type of environmental change and on three adaptation strategies: diversification, pooling and out-migration. I analyse the influence of adaptation strategies on land use change by drawing on interviews with the managers of 56 internationally adjoining protected areas in 18 countries in the Americas. The findings indicate that the impact of adaptation depends on the adaptation strategy people choose. When people out-migrate, land use change increases. Community elite control for decision-making, shorter distances between communities and markets and more communities in and around the protected areas also increase land use change. These findings show that adaptation can be a driver of further environmental change, and thus further study is needed to understand the likely impacts of adaptation on conservation.","[Solorzano, Claudia Rodriguez] Dartmouth Coll, Environm Studies Program, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Solorzano, Claudia Rodriguez] Texas A&M Univ, Ecosyst Sci & Management Dept, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Solorzano, Claudia Rodriguez] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Solorzano, Claudia Rodriguez] Indiana Univ, Workshop Polit Theory & Policy Anal, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Dartmouth College; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Solorzano, CR (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Environm Studies Program, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.;Solorzano, CR (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Ecosyst Sci & Management Dept, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.;Solorzano, CR (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Solorzano, CR (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Workshop Polit Theory & Policy Anal, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",claudiars@dartmouth.edu,"Solorzano, Claudia Rodriguez/G-8817-2011",,"Mexican Council of Science and Technology, University of Michigan, Indiana University; Division Of Chemistry; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1313932] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Mexican Council of Science and Technology, University of Michigan, Indiana University; Division Of Chemistry; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS))","I am grateful for the support provided by the Mexican Council of Science and Technology, University of Michigan, Indiana University, Arun Agrawal, Maria Carmen Lemos, Ashwini Chhatre, Forrest Fleischman and Catherine Benson for the development of this manuscript.",,50,4,4,0,16,WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,MUMBAI,"WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA",0972-4923,0975-3133,,CONSERV SOC,Conserv.

It is quite complex and difficult to quantify the consequences of climate change on railway infrastructure because of the inherent nature of the railway itself. Hence, the main aim of this work is to qualitatively identify and assess the impact of climate change on railway infrastructure with associated risks and consequences. A qualitative research methodology is employed in the study using a questionnaire as a tool for information gathering from experts from several municipalities in Sweden, Swedish transport infrastructure managers, maintenance organizations, and train operators. The outcome of this questionnaire revealed that there was a lower level of awareness about the impact of climate change on the various facets of railway infrastructure. Furthermore, the work identifies the challenges and barriers for climate adaptation of railway infrastructure and suggests recommended actions to improve the resilience towards climate change. It also provides recommendations, including adaptation options to ensure an effective and efficient railway transport service.","[Garmabaki, A. H.

As a preliminary stage, we are suggesting a physical risk taxonomy derived from climate model databases and an adaptation project taxonomy using a text analysis. The second stage, consisting of an evaluation metric using a correspondence analysis between adaptation projects and risk classes, was inspired by the analogy with adaptation mechanisms in living organisms-assessing the correct correspondence between threats from the environment and adaptive solutions. It allowed us to develop a coefficient ranging from 0 to 1, expressing the degree of correspondence between adaptive measures' categories and hazard levels, which we refer to as fitness. Our coefficient would make it possible to compare project classes with each other ex-ante or, conversely, to deduce the most relevant adaptation solutions from climate-change-related hazards.

Optimal prioritization of adaptation investments requires the assessment of various possible adaptation options and their uncertainties; successful adaptations of agriculture to climate change should not only help farmers deal with current climate risks, but also reduce negative (or enhance positive) impacts associated with climate change using robust climate projections. Here, we use two well-validated crop models (APSIM v7.5 and SARRA-H v3.2) and an ensemble of downscaled climate forcing from the CMIP5 models to assess five possible and realistic adaptation options for the production of the staple crop sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench.): (i) late sowing, (ii) intensification of seeding density and fertilizer use, (iii) increasing cultivars' thermal time requirement, (iv) water harvesting, and (v) increasing resilience to heat stress during the flowering period. We adopt a new assessment framework to account for both the impacts of proposed adaptation options in the historical climate and their ability to reduce the impacts of future climate change, and we also consider changes in both mean yield and inter-annual yield variability. We target the future period of 2031-2060 for the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5), and compare with the historical period of 1961-1990. Our results reveal that most proposed adaptation options are not more beneficial in the future than in the historical climate (-12% to +4% in mean yield), so that they do not really reduce the climate change impacts. Increased temperature resilience during the grain number formation period is the main adaptation that emerges (+4.5%). Intensification of fertilizer inputs can dramatically benefit yields in the historical/current climate (+50%), but does not reduce negative climate change impacts except in scenarios with substantial rainfall increases. Water harvesting contributes to a small benefit in the current climate (+1.5% to +4.0%) but has little additional benefit under climate change.

We describe and analyse aspects of the implementation process to identify key factors that enable or constrain adaptation action among different groups of actors. We find that adaptation measures that are objectively effective and supported by residents are most appropriate for implementation. Where residents evince scepticism about adaptation measures, information about their effectiveness and usefulness should be disseminated. Early and targeted involvement of relevant stake-holders, careful communication and the establishment of climate adaptation as a permanent interdepartmental task at municipal level can promote successful implementation of heat adaptation measures.","[Westermann, Janneke R.; Schuenemann, Christoph; Ehnert, Franziska; Grunewald, Karsten; Ortlepp, Regine] Leibniz Inst Okol Raumentwicklung eV, Dresden, Germany; [Bolsius, Jens; Kunze, Stefanie; Naumann, Thomas] Hsch Techn & Wirtschaft Dresden, Dresden, Germany; [Sinning, Heidi] Fachhochschule Erfurt, Inst Stadtforschung Planung & Kommunikat ISP, Erfurt, Germany; [Ziemann, Astrid; Goldberg, Valeri] Tech Univ Dresden, Prof Meteorol, Dresden, Germany; [Baldin, Marie-Luise] Hsch Mittweida, Mittweida, Germany; [Brueggemann, Kurt] Landesamt Umweltschutz Sachsen Anhalt, Halle, Germany; [Brzoska, Patrycia] Bundesamt Naturschutz, Leipzig, Germany; [Grossmann, Lena] Bayer Landesamt Umwelt, Augsburg, Germany; [Reinfried, Franziska] Umweltamt, Landeshauptstadt Dresden, Dresden, Germany; [Richter, Benjamin] Kassenarztliche Vereinigung Rheinland Pfalz, Mainz, Germany; [Spohr, Guido] Landeshauptstadt Erfurt Umwelt & Naturschutzamt, Erfurt, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Westermann, JR (corresponding author), Techn Univ Berlin, Landschaftsplanung, Berlin, Germany.",j.westermann@ioer.de,"Ortlepp, Regine/C-2861-2008","Ortlepp, Regine/0000-0002-2109-7468",,,,,57,0,0,0,2,OEKOM VERLAG GMBH,MUNICH,"WALTHERSTR 29, MUNICH, 80337, GERMANY",0940-5550,2625-5413,,GAIA,GAIA,,2021,30,4,,,,,257,267,,10.14512/gaia.30.4.9,http://dx.doi.org/10.14512/gaia.30.4.9,,,11,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XY3MB,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000736879800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We propose here that tipping points (sharp increases) in adaptation costs may emerge as key warming levels are exceeded, with important implications for policymakers and planners. We explore this proposition using selected African agriculture and ecosystem-based livelihoods examples, considering how adaptation responses might progress from a coping phase (with low-cost efforts), through a tipping point into a phase of proactive or planned ('incremental') adaptation that requires a sharp increase in adaptation investment, and through a further tipping point into a technology and capital-intensive ('transformative') phase requiring a further sharp increase in investment. Tipping points in adaptation costs may result as a series of limits to adaptation are breached, but the associated sharp cost transitions are not well recognized in the literature. Adaptation research could usefully focus on identifying the likely timing of these tipping points and in what sectors they may occur.

In this study, yields of maize, beans, wheat, soybean, sorghum, barley and potato were modeled with 28 future climate change scenarios. Our results reduce the information gap that is frequently reported for Mexico and will contribute to better knowledge on spatial impact of climate change. We applied FAO AquaCrop model for 22 case studies located in 14 states of Mexico. Climate change scenarios were: CNRM, GFDL, HADGEM, MPI and Ensemble REA, with two radiative forcing concentrations (4.5 and 8.5 W m(-2)) and three time horizons (2015-2039, 2045-2069, and 2075-2099). The results show decreases in yields of most of the case studies as a consequence of a decrease in the amount and distribution of precipitation. Maize yield in warm dry climates could decrease up to 84% in the most severe scenarios. Beans could decrease from 10 to 40% in the north of the country, while in the northwest a 15% decrease in wheat yield is predicted. Soybeans could benefit, with increases from 15 to 40%. Sorghum and potatoes are expected to decrease for all the case studies, while barley would have increases and decreases. The results suggest differentiated impacts according to crops and regions studied. We concluded that agriculture requires better focused strategies and policies (attention on crop and spatial distribution).","[Romero, Antonio Arce] Wageningen Univ & Res, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Monterroso Rivas, Alejandro Ismael; Gomez Diaz, Jesus David; Palacios Mendoza, Miguel Angel] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Dept Suelos, Km 38-5 Carretera Mexico Texcoco, Texcoco 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Navarro Salas, Elda Nohemi] Inst Nacl Ecol & Cambio Climat, Direcc Gest Riesgos & Adaptac Cambio Climat, Perifer Sur 5000, Ciudad De Mexico 04530, Mexico; [Lopez Blanco, Jorge] Environm Change Consulting, Sanchez de la Barquera 13-B509, Ciudad De Mexico 03930, Mexico; [Conde Alvarez, Ana Cecilia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Atmosfera, Circuito Invest Cient S-N,Ciudad Univ, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico",Wageningen University & Research; Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Rivas, AIM (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Dept Suelos, Km 38-5 Carretera Mexico Texcoco, Texcoco 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico.",aimrivas@correo.chapingo.mx,"Rivas, Alejandro Ismael Monterroso/ABB-3809-2020; Monterroso Rivas, Alejandro Ismael/GRE-7561-2022","Rivas, Alejandro Ismael Monterroso/0000-0003-4348-8918; ","Instituto Nacional de Ecologia y Cambio Climatico (INECC); Departamento de Suelos and CIRENAM of the Universidad Autonoma Chapingo; Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Climate Change and Green Growth Cooperation Platform","Instituto Nacional de Ecologia y Cambio Climatico (INECC); Departamento de Suelos and CIRENAM of the Universidad Autonoma Chapingo; Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico(Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico); Climate Change and Green Growth Cooperation Platform","We thank the following institutions that supported this study in different ways: Instituto Nacional de Ecologia y Cambio Climatico (INECC), Departamento de Suelos and CIRENAM of the Universidad Autonoma Chapingo, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, as well as the Climate Change and Green Growth Cooperation Platform between Canada and Mexico, coordinated by INECC-PNUD.

This fact, which is associated with the specificities of each of the territories, leads to the need to implement adaptive measures to address the new reality imposed by climate change and to create more resilient territories and communities capable of facing this new paradigm. The more these measures are adjusted to the specificities of the territories and their communities, the more efficient they will be. Thus, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the evolution of the climate on the local scale and the real needs of the resident populations. To identify these needs, a survey was conducted, and it was found that the dominant opinion of all respondents, comprising citizens residing in Portugal, was that climate change can affect geographically close territories in different ways. In the present work, the municipality of Guimaraes, located in the north of Portugal, was used as a case study, where a comparative analysis was carried out to assess the period between the current climate, characterized by the period of 1971-2021, and the climate of 100 years ago, characterized by the decade of 1896-1905, to determine trends for the variables of air temperature and precipitation. It was found that the temperature in the winter months increased, with less uniformity in the distribution of precipitation throughout the year. These differences in the air temperature and precipitation, as variables, lead to the need to plan adaptive measures that can be implemented so that the territory and its communities become more resilient to climate change.","[Nunes, Leonel J.

The schematic design stage matters a lot for building energy efficiency, while most architects nowadays are less likely to make energy efficiency design decisions in this stage due to the lack of necessary means and methods for analysis. An integrated multi-objective multivariate framework for optimization analysis is proposed for the schematic design stage in the paper. Here, the design parameters of the building morphology and the design parameters of the building envelope are integrated for analysis, and an integrated performance prediction model is established for low-rise and medium-rise residential buildings. Then, a comparison of the performance indicators of low-rise and medium-rise residential buildings under five typical urban climatic conditions is carried out, and the change patterns of the lighting environment, thermal environment, building energy demand, and life cycle cost of residential buildings in each city under different morphological parameters and design parameters of the building envelope are summarized. Specific analysis methods and practical tools are provided in the study for architectural design to ensure thermal comfort, lighting comfort, low energy consumption, and low life-cycle cost requirement, and this design method can inspire and guide the climate adaptation analysis and design process of low-rise and medium-rise residential buildings in China, improve architects' perception of energy-saving design principles of low-rise and medium-rise residential buildings on the ontological level, as well as provide them with a method to follow and a case to follow in the actual design process.","[Li, Zhixing; Tian, Mimi; Ying, Yuxi] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Sch Design & Architecture, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yafei] Solearth Architecture Res Ctr, Bldg Informat Technol Innovat Lab BITI Lab, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhao] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",Zhejiang University of Technology; University of Technology Sydney,"Li, ZX (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ Technol, Sch Design & Architecture, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China.",zxlee910@zjut.edu.cn; tmm518@zjut.edu.cn; yzh@solearth.com; henry.zhaozhang@gmail.com; 2111915071@zjut.edu.cn,,"Li, zhixing/0000-0002-2580-5169",,,,,46,6,6,8,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,DEC,2021,14,24,,,,,,,8223,10.3390/en14248223,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14248223,,,44,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,XZ4QU,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000737638700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This rule is named after C.W.L. Gloger who was one of the first to summarise the associations between climatic variation and animal colouration, noting in particular that birds and mammals seemed more pigmented in tropical regions. The term 'Gloger's rule' was coined by B. Rensch in 1929 and included different patterns of variation from those described by Gloger. Rensch defined the rule in two ways: a simple version stating that endothermic animals are predicted to be darker in warmer and humid areas due to the increased deposition of melanin pigments; and a complex version that includes the differential effects of humidity and temperature on both main types of melanin pigments - eu- and phaeo-melanin. The blackish eu-melanins are predicted to increase with humidity, and decrease only at extreme low temperatures, while the brown-yellowish phaeomelanins prevail in dry and warm regions and decrease rapidly with lower temperatures. A survey of the literature indicates that there is considerable variation/confusion in the way Gloger's rule is understood (based on 271 studies that define the rule). Whereas the complex version is hardly mentioned, only a quarter of the definitions are consistent with the simple version of Gloger's rule (darker where warm and wet), and most definitions mention only the effects of humidity (darker where wet). A smaller subset of studies define the rule based on other correlated climatic and environmental variables such as vegetation, latitude, altitude, solar radiation, etc., and a few even contradict the original definition (darker where cold). Based on the literature survey, I synthesised the qualitative (N = 124 studies) and quantitative (meta-analytically, N = 38 studies, 241 effects) evidence testing the simple version of Gloger's rule (I found no tests of the complex version). Both lines of evidence supported the predicted effects of humidity (and closely linked variables) on colour variation, but not the effects of temperature. Moreover, humidity effects are not restricted to birds and mammals, as the data indicate that these effects also apply to insects. This suggests that the simple version of Gloger's rule as originally defined may not be valid, and possibly that the rule should be re-formulated in terms of humidity effects only. I suggest, however, that more data are needed before such a reformulation, due to potential publication biases. In conclusion, I recommend that authors cite Rensch when referring to Gloger's rule and that they make clear which version they are referring to. Future research should concentrate on rigorously testing the validity and generality of both versions of Gloger's rule and establishing the mechanism(s) responsible for the patterns it describes. Since humidity seems to be the core climatic variable behind Gloger's rule, I suggest that the two most plausible mechanisms are camouflage and protection against parasites/pathogens, the latter possibly through pleiotropic effects on the immune system. Understanding the processes that lead to climatic effects on animal colouration may provide insights into past and future patterns of adaptation to climatic change.","[Delhey, Kaspar] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 25 Rainforest Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Delhey, K (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 25 Rainforest Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",kaspar.delhey@monash.edu,"Delhey, Kaspar/AAZ-5362-2020","Delhey, Kaspar/0000-0001-5190-5406",,,,,343,65,66,6,89,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1464-7931,1469-185X,,BIOL REV,Biol.

This study investigated the implementation of mitigation and adaptation practices in smallholder farms in Ethiopia, estimated GHG emissions associated with mitigation practices, and identified potential mitigation options and barriers and enabling factors for implementation. Twenty-five smallholder farmers were selected by a local development agency and interviewed in the field about their land use and land management practices and the Mitigation Options Tool (MOT) was used to estimate GHG emissions, to identify mitigation options and co-benefits, and as a platform for promoting learning and knowledge exchange across different types of stakeholders. All farmers interviewed in the field acknowledged changes in the climate, but only some were implementing adaptation practices to cope with such changes, namely, crop rotations, planting new crop types, and the early sowing of crops. Fewer mitigation practices were implemented, namely reduced tillage and application of manure in cereal crops and potatoes. These practices were mainly implemented because of their benefits for soil conservation (e.g. fertility, soil water holding capacity, yield stabilization, erosion avoidance) rather than for mitigation (carbon sequestration) purposes. Greenhouse gas emissions from the application of synthetic fertilizer to crops, and from livestock production varied widely across farmers depending on the amount of fertilizer applied and the number and type of livestock raised. Tenancy rights and extension services were identified as potential enablers of the adoption of climate change mitigation and adaptation practices by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia, and competing uses for straw was a potential barrier for the incorporation of residues in the soil. Barriers and enabling factors should be assessed thoroughly through further engagement with farmers as well as data on the amount of organic matter added to the soil, as these practices have co-benefits in terms of soil conservation, which are especially relevant for climate change adaptation in semi-dry climates. The MOT could be used in the future as a facilitator for knowledge exchange between researchers and practitioners in Ethiopia, and in other developing countries where data availability is low, to support the identification of effective climate change mitigation and adaptation actions. Key policy insights Climate change mitigation practices in agriculture can provide co-benefits for adaptation and food security, including the stabilization of crop yields, especially in semi-dry climates; more evidence about these co-benefits is needed. The systematic collection of data on manure and crop residues should be supported as a priority as well as the identification of implementation barriers for mitigation and adaptation practices. Smallholder farmers need to be engaged throughout any assessment of climate change mitigation potential to raise awareness, identify co-benefits of possible actions, and to identify and address barriers for implementation. Tenancy rights and extension services are potential enabling factors for the adoption of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. In developing countries, user-friendly tools such as the MOT can promote learning and knowledge exchange across diverse stakeholder groups about the impact of land use and management options on climate change mitigation and adaptation.","[Feliciano, Diana; MacSween, Kirsten] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Sch Biol Sci, 23 St Machar Dr, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; [Recha, John] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, CGIAR Res Programme Climate Change Agr & Food Sec, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ambaw, Gebermedihin] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, CGIAR Res Programme Climate Change Agr & Food Sec, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Solomon, Dawit] Cornell Univ, CGIAR Res Programme Climate Change Agr & Food Sec, Ithaca, NY USA; [Solomon, Dawit] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Wollenberg, Eva] Univ Vermont, CGIAR Res Programme Climate Change Agr & Food Sec, Burlington, VT USA",University of Aberdeen; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Cornell University; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); University of Vermont,"Feliciano, D (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Sch Biol Sci, 23 St Machar Dr, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland.",diana.feliciano@abdn.ac.uk,,"Feliciano, Diana/0000-0002-5466-4879",CCAFS; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/N005619/1]; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); United States Development of Agriculture (USDA); CGIAR Fund [C-003-17]; NERC [NE/N005619/1] Funding Source: UKRI,CCAFS; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIAR); United States Development of Agriculture (USDA); CGIAR Fund(CGIAR); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The Mitigation Options Tool was developed by the University of Aberdeen and CCAFS with support from CCAFS, The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), project number NE/N005619/1, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the United States Development of Agriculture (USDA).

These initiatives, however, often ask Indigenous peoples to provide knowledge and resources to assist with adaptation efforts beyond their communities, which can limit their capacity to act locally. Trusting their expertise, we utilize a participatory research approach that asks tribal government employees, agriculturalists, researchers, and outreach professionals to prioritize the climate information and data they perceive as necessary to enhance the climate resilience of water resources of Indigenous communities. In doing so, this study provides empirical evidence specific to the climate adaptation needs of Indigenous communities on reservation lands in the arid southwestern USA. Study respondents prioritize climate information and data that serve to assess local climate change impacts, enhance food security, and integrate and protect the traditional knowledge of their communities. In this arid and predominantly rural region, respondents prioritize water quality data as their highest need followed by streamflow and air temperature data. They most frequently access their respective tribal government sources of climate information and data. These results indicate that localized climate data and information are highly prioritized. Future research and action to alleviate information and data gaps should account for the relevance, accessibility, and protection of these resources while prioritizing methods that ensure Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination rather than knowledge extraction.","[Fillmore, Helen; Singletary, Loretta] Univ Nevada, Extens, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Singletary, Loretta] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Singletary, L (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Extens, Reno, NV 89557 USA.;Singletary, L (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",fillmoreh@unr.edu; singletaryl@unr.edu,"Fillmore, Helen/GRO-3818-2022","Singletary, Loretta/0000-0002-7118-7998",U.S. Department Availability of data and material,U.S. Department Availability of data and material,This research is funded by the U.S. Department Availability of data and material,,71,1,1,3,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Scientific prediction of energy consumption carbon emissions based on influencing factors is of great significance to the determination of carbon control aim and emission reduction strategies. Given the lack of previous studies on county-level carbon emissions, this paper proposed a systematic approach to study the influencing factors of county-level energy consumption carbon emissions and to predict future emissions. Firstly, the annual energy consumption carbon emissions were calculated based on the method proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Then the expanded Kaya equation and existing research were combined to select influencing factors for the establishment of the optimal Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model, which was used to quantitatively analyze the influencing factors of carbon emissions from energy consumption at the county level. Finally, the emission reduction aims and low-carbon strategies were determined based on scenario analysis. The method was applied to Changxing, a typical county with large energy consumption and carbon emissions. Based on 16 years of data, the STIRPAT carbon emission prediction model was established and the forecast results of future emissions under three different scenarios were obtained. The results indicated that population size, industrial structure, and affluence degree were the three most influential factors, and the influence degree of each factor was quantified to support targeted low-carbon strategies for county-level cities.","[Liu, Hongjiang; Yan, Fengying] Tianjin Univ, Sch Architecture, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Yan, FY (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Architecture, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",fengying@tju.edu.cn,,"Liu, Hongjiang/0000-0001-5373-8875",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC0704700]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51878441],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant number 2018YFC0704700, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 51878441.",,36,0,0,33,43,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1543-5075,1543-5083,,INT J GREEN ENERGY,Int.

Many of these behaviors focus on actions to protect oneself or one's household in response to immediate hazards rather than ones that may achieve longer-term adaptation goals. We conducted a content analysis of 75 publications identified through a systematic literature review to learn how researchers from a range of disciplines conceptualize adaptive behavior in the context of climate change and what kinds of specific actions they describe. Based on this review, we propose a comprehensive definition of personal and household adaptation behavior that considers its purpose (i.e., preventing harm or gaining benefits), timing (i.e., proactive or reactive), time scale (i.e., short-term or long-term), as well as who acts (i.e., the individual alone or with others) and who is affected by those actions (i.e., the individual, other people, or the environment). We classify specific individual adaptation behaviors into civic engagement, consumption, coping, household protection, learning, lifestyle changes, migration, and self-protection. Research is needed to better understand the personal and societal benefits of adaptation behaviors and how to more equitably support these actions in different contexts.","[Carman, Jennifer P.; Zint, Michaela T.] Univ Michigan, Sch Sustainabil & Environm, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zint, Michaela T.] Univ Michigan, Coll Literature Sci & Arts, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zint, Michaela T.] Univ Michigan, Sch Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Carman, JP (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Sustainabil & Environm, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jpcarman@umich.edu,,"Carman, Jennifer P./0000-0002-9580-8322","Dow Chemical Company Foundation; University of Michigan, through the Dow Sustainability Fellows Program at the University of Michigan","Dow Chemical Company Foundation; University of Michigan, through the Dow Sustainability Fellows Program at the University of Michigan","The authors would like to thank Rosina Bierbaum, Victoria Campbell-Arvai, Thomas Logan, Richard Norton, Kaitlin Toner Raimi, and Timothy Williams for their valuable insights.

Using panel quantile regression analysis, the paper empirically tests the effect of adaptation readiness on climate change vulnerability in 51 African countries over the period 1995 to 2018. The findings show that adaptation readiness has a significant negative effect on vulnerability to climate change in the region. The results also demonstrate that Central Africa is the most vulnerable sub-region to climate change with high exposure, high sensitivity, and low adaptive capacity. Whereas Southern and North Africa are the least vulnerable sub-regions to climate change in Africa. The differences in climate change vulnerability and adaptation readiness across Africa imply that blanket allocation of climate adaptation support and resources is unlikely to be effective.

Using the Chinese city of Guangzhou as a case study, this study explores the long-term disadvantaged conditions of urban planning in flood governance and how this situation is shaped. The findings show that, in comparison to the increasingly dominant position of water management in flood affairs, the urban planning system has had weak powers, limited legitimate opportunities, and insufficient fiscal incentives from the 2000s to the late 2010s. Those conditions have been shaped by organizational structures, institutional rules, and financial allocation in urban governance, whose changes did not bring benefits to urban planning. The emergence of the Sponge City Program in China in 2017 and its implementation at the municipal level is deemed to be a new start for urban planning, considering the encouragement of nature-based solutions and regulatory tools in land use for flood resilience.

Regional climate models (RCMs) generate high-resolution projections by dynamically downscaling GCM outputs. However, evidence of where and when downscaling provides new information about both the current climate (added value, AV) and projected climate change signals, relative to driving data, is lacking. Seasons and locations where CORDEX-Australasia ERA-Interim and GCM-driven RCMs show AV for mean and extreme precipitation and temperature are identified. A new concept is introduced, 'realised added value', that identifies where and when RCMs simultaneously add value in the present climate and project a different climate change signal, thus suggesting plausible improvements in future climate projections by RCMs. ERA-Interim-driven RCMs add value to the simulation of summer-time mean precipitation, especially over northern and eastern Australia. GCM-driven RCMs show AV for precipitation over complex orography in south-eastern Australia during winter and widespread AV for mean and extreme minimum temperature during both seasons, especially over coastal and high-altitude areas. RCM projections of decreased winter rainfall over the Australian Alps and decreased summer rainfall over northern Australia are collocated with notable realised added value. Realised added value averaged across models, variables, seasons and statistics is evident across the majority of Australia and shows where plausible improvements in future climate projections are conferred by RCMs. This assessment of varying RCM capabilities to provide realised added value to GCM projections can be applied globally to inform climate adaptation and model development.","[Di Virgilio, Giovanni; Evans, Jason P.; Di Luca, Alejandro] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Evans, Jason P.; Di Luca, Alejandro] Univ New South Wales, Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Australian Res Council, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Grose, Michael R.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Round, Vanessa; Thatcher, Marcus] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Di Virgilio, G (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",giovanni@unsw.edu.au,"Grose, Michael/AAV-1119-2021; Evans, Jason P./F-3716-2011; Thatcher, Marcus J/G-4010-2011; Round, Vanessa/C-1772-2019","Evans, Jason P./0000-0003-1776-3429; Thatcher, Marcus J/0000-0003-4139-5515; Di Virgilio, Giovanni/0000-0001-7014-8412; Round, Vanessa/0000-0001-5392-5347; Di Luca, Alejandro/0000-0002-1481-2961",Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program,Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program,This project is supported through funding from the Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program.

In the workplace, such thresholds can be used to trigger reductions in work intensity and/or duration. In regions that routinely exceed proposed thresholds, however, this approach can be deeply problematic and raises critical questions about how frequently exposed populations already manage and mitigate the effects of extreme heat. Drawing on social practice theories, this paper repositions everyday engagements with extreme heat in terms of practices of work. It finds that bodies absorb and produce heat through practices, challenging the view that extreme heat is an external risk to which bodies are exposed. This theoretical starting point also challenges the utility of threshold-based adaptation strategies by demonstrating how heat is actively coproduced by living, performing bodies in weather. This argument is exemplified through a case study of outdoor, manual workers in Australia's monsoon tropics, where work practices were adapted to reduce thermal load. More specifically, we find that workers weather work and work the weather to enable work to be done in extreme conditions. Our analysis of everyday heat adaptation draws attention to the generative capacities of bodies and unsettles two established separations: 1) that between climatic exposure and sensitivity, calling for a more embodied, experiential, and performed perspective and 2) that between climatic impacts and (mal)adaptation, calling for an understanding of climate adaptation, as located in everyday practices, in the management of bodies in weather.","[Oppermann, Elspeth] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Strengers, Yolande; Maller, Cecily; Rickards, Lauren] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Brearley, Matt] Thermal Hyperformance, Howard Springs, NT, Australia",Charles Darwin University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Oppermann, E (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT, Australia.",elspeth.oppermann@cdu.edu.au,"Oppermann, Elspeth/N-2181-2013","Oppermann, Elspeth/0000-0001-9775-8763; Rickards, Lauren/0000-0001-6088-3448; Brearley, Matt/0000-0002-6655-3914","Faculty of Law, Education, Business and Arts at Charles Darwin University","Faculty of Law, Education, Business and Arts at Charles Darwin University","The authors thank the organization and interview participants who made time in their busy schedules to participate in this project.

An assessment of the extent to which the GGP has altered the vegetation cover and ecological functions in these regions is much needed. The present study initially analyzed land use and cover change of forests and grasslands over western China between 2000 and 2015. A variety of satellite-based ecological indicators, including net primary productivity, normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, carbon use efficiency, and water use efficiency, were used to reflect the biophysical consequences of the GGP in western China. Results indicated that the spatial extent of forests and grasslands increased by 13.97 x 10(3) and 11.13 x 10(3) km(2), respectively, which were mainly converted from deserts and croplands. The ecosystem functions of forests and grasslands showed an asymmetric response in northwestern and southwestern China. The normalized difference vegetation index and water use efficiency of forests, as well as the net primary productivity and water use efficiency of grasslands, increased significantly over this period. The GGP also has led to an increase in leaf area index and carbon use efficiency of forests and grasslands. The Loess Plateau and the Three Rivers Source area represent the most effectively recovered regions in western China. Rising precipitation rates have contributed to vegetation recovery to some extent, especially in northwestern China, whereas the GGP was the prominent reason for the improvement of ecosystem functions across the entire region of western China. Plain Language Summary Land degradation has caused severe environmental problems in many areas worldwide and severely restrains the sustainable development of numerous local economies. Land degradation also undermines the livelihoods and food security of people, especially in the economically underprivileged regions. Western China has experienced land degradation because of both its geological location and climatic conditions. To combat and mitigate this situation, the Chinese government implemented a series of national-scale ecological policies and programs during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Nearly 20 years have passed since the implementation of these projects. Therefore, it is appropriate to comprehensively assess the biophysical consequences of these programs. The present study aims to evaluate the extent to which the vegetation of western China recovered during the 2000-2015 period based on a variety of remotely sensed data streams. Results indicated that the spatial extent of forests and grasslands have expanded. The ecosystem functions of forests and grasslands showed an asymmetric response in the southwest and northwest regions of western China. These findings may provide guidelines for government agencies and policy makers involved in initiating adaptation strategies designed to adapt to climate change and to manage vegetation production.","[Gang, Chengcheng; Gao, Xuerui; Peng, Shouzhang; Guo, Liang; Jin, Jingwei] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Gang, Chengcheng; Gao, Xuerui; Peng, Shouzhang; Guo, Liang; Jin, Jingwei] Chinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Gang, Chengcheng] Auburn Univ, Int Ctr Climate & Global Change Res, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Chen, Mingxun] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Ministry of Water Resources; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Northwest A&F University - China","Gang, CC (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Gang, CC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Gang, CC (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Int Ctr Climate & Global Change Res, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",gangcc@ms.iswc.ac.cn,"Gang, Chengcheng/Z-4286-2019","Gang, Chengcheng/0000-0002-2804-5636; Peng, Shouzhang/0000-0002-2358-6329","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31602004]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0501707]; CAS Light of West China program [XAB2016B05]; Special Foundation for State Basic Research Program of China [2014YF210100]; Key Cultivation Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences The promotion and management of ecosystem functions of restored vegetation in Loess Plateau, China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2452017184]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; CAS Light of West China program; Special Foundation for State Basic Research Program of China; Key Cultivation Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences The promotion and management of ecosystem functions of restored vegetation in Loess Plateau, China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 31602004), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant 2016YFC0501707), the CAS Light of West China program (grant XAB2016B05), the Special Foundation for State Basic Research Program of China (grant 2014YF210100), the Key Cultivation Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences The promotion and management of ecosystem functions of restored vegetation in Loess Plateau, China, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant 2452017184).

The future of this region will be determined in large part by how global climatic changes impact regional conditions and by actions taken to mitigate or adapt to climate change impacts. One potential mitigation strategy is to promote management practices that have the potential to sequester carbon in the soils. The IPCC estimates that 40 Pg of C could be sequestered in cropland soils worldwide over the next several decades; however, changes in global climate may impact this potential. Here, we assess the potential for soil C sequestration with conversion of a conventional till (CT) continuous wheat system to a wheat-corn double cropping system and by implementing no till (NT) management for both continuous wheat and wheat-corn systems. To assess the influence of these management practices under a changing climate, we use two climate change scenarios (A2 and B2) at two time periods in the EPIC agro-ecosystent simulation model. The applied climate change scenarios are from the HadCM3 global climate model for the periods 2015-2045 and 2070-2099 which projects consistent increases in temperature and precipitation of greater than 5 degrees C and up to 300 mm by 2099. An increase in the variability of temperature is also projected and is, accordingly, applied in the simulations. The EPIC model indicates that winter wheat yields would increase on average by 0.2 Mg ha(-1) in the earlier period and by 0.8 Mg ha(-1) in the later period due to warmer nighttime temperatures and higher precipitation. Simulated yields were not significantly affected by imposed changes in crop management. Simulated soil organic C content was higher under both NT management and double cropping than under CT continuous wheat. The simulated changes in management were a more important factor in SOC changes than the scenario of climate change. Soil C sequestration rates for continuous wheat systems were increased by an average of 0.4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) by NT in the earlier period and by 0.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in the later period. With wheat-corn double cropping, NT increased sequestration rates by 0.8 and 0.4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) for the earlier and later periods, respectively. The total C offset due to a shift from CT to NT under continuous wheat over 16 million hectares in the Huang-Hai Plain is projected to reach 240 Tg C in the earlier period and 180 Tg C in the later period. Corresponding C offsets for wheat-corn cropping are 675-495 Tg C. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Fresh air supply in buildings can improve indoor air qualities and become a concern due to sick building syndrome (SBS) and the outbreak of the SARS. The most common method of cooling or heating fresh air is to use air handling units. However, there is often a large enthalpy difference between outdoor fresh air and indoor air, which leads to a large amount of energy consumption by fresh air systems. In order to achieve the goal of zero energy building, passive waste heat recovery equipment, active waste heat recovery systems and earth-air heat exchangers have been developed to handle fresh air. This paper presents a comprehensive review on energy conservation technologies for fresh air supply, including theoretical, experimental and simulation works. The advantages and disadvantages, economy and climate adaptability of different energy conservation technologies for fresh air supply in buildings are analyzed and discussed. And then challenges and future research directions of fresh air supply technologies are discussed.

Accordingly, knowledge on storm surge monitoring has progressed significantly in recent years, and this review, focused on monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of storm surges, responds to the need for a synthesis. Three main components are presented in the review: (1) monitoring storm surges from the viewpoint of three effective approaches; (2) understanding the challenges faced by the three monitoring approaches to increase our awareness of monitoring storm surges; (3) identifying three research priorities and orientations to provide new ideas in future storm surge monitoring. From the perspective of monitoring approaches, recent progress was achieved with respect to tide gauges, satellite altimetry and numerical simulation. Storm surge events can nowadays be identified accurately, and the surge heights can be calculated based on long-term tide gauge observations. The changing frequency and intensity of storm surge activity, combined with statistical analysis and climatology, can be used to enable a better understanding of the possible regional or global long-term trends. Compared with tidal observation data, satellite altimetry has the advantage of providing offshore sea level information to an accuracy of 10 cm. In addition, satellite altimetry can provide more effective observations for studying storm surges, such as transient surge data of the deep ocean. Simultaneously, the study of storm surges via numerical simulation has been further developed, mainly reflected in the gradual improvement of simulation accuracy but also in the refinement of comprehensive factors affecting storm surge activity. However, from the above approaches, storm surge activity monitoring cannot fully reflect the spatial and temporal variability of storm surges, especially the spatial changes at a regional or global scale. In particular, compared to global storm surge, tide gauges and satellite altimeters are relatively sparse, and the spatial distribution is extremely uneven, which often seriously restricts the overall understanding of the spatial distribution features of storm surge activity. Numerical models can be used as a tool to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings for storm surge monitoring, as they provide real-time spatiotemporal features of storm surge events. But long-term numerical hindcast of tides and surges requires an extremely high computational effort. Considering the shortcomings of the above approaches and the impact of climate change, there is no clear approach to remedy the framework for studying the spatial and temporal characteristics of global or regional storm surge activity at a climatic scale. Therefore, we show how new insights or techniques are useful for the monitoring of future crises. This work is especially important in planning efforts by policymakers, coastal managers, civil protection managers and the general public to adapt to climate change and rising sea levels.","[Ji, Tao; Li, Guosheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ji, Tao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Li, GS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",ligs@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"ji, tao/0000-0002-6157-2606","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41871026, 41571041]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 41871026, 41571041].",,104,11,11,3,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-1333,1477-0296,,PROG PHYS GEOG,Prog.

In this paper, an index system for evaluating regional flood disaster resilience is constructed based on a review of the literature regarding natural disaster resilience and with full consideration of the five dimensions (i.e., nature, society, economy, technology and management) which have a great influence on flood disaster resilience. Subsequently, the overall level and five dimensions of flood disaster resilience in the Chaohu Lake Basin can be evaluated quantitatively by adopting analytic network process to dynamically analyze the influencing relationships of factors. The results obtained in this research indicate that: (1) overall, the majority of the Chaohu Lake Basin exhibits intermediate to high flood disaster resilience, but there are distinct variations within the basin. The resilience is clearly influenced by the natural dimension indexes, the highest resilience levels are mainly located in the hilly, mountainous regions, and the lowest resilience levels mainly occur in the south-southeast plain of the Chaohu Lake Basin and the river estuary of the Chaohu Lake. Considering the administrative regions, the regions with the greatest areas of intermediate and high resilience are Hefei Municipal District, Chaohu City, Feidong County, Feixi County, Lujiang County, Hanshan County, Shucheng County, most parts of He County, Wuwei County and Jiujiang District of Wuhu City. (2) Preliminary validation indicates that evaluation results regarding flood disaster resilience in the Chaohu Lake Basin are consistent with the actual conditions. Therefore, the evaluation results and method can provide a valuable approach to the rapid diagnosis of weak links in the construction of flood disaster resilience infrastructure and will ultimately improve the level of flood disaster resilience in the Chaohu Lake Basin.","[Sun, Honghu; Cheng, Xianfu; Dai, Mengqin] Anhui Normal Univ, Sch Terr Resources & Tourism, Anhui Key Lab Nat Disaster Proc & Prevent, Wuhu 241003, Peoples R China",Anhui Normal University,"Cheng, XF (corresponding author), Anhui Normal Univ, Sch Terr Resources & Tourism, Anhui Key Lab Nat Disaster Proc & Prevent, Wuhu 241003, Peoples R China.",xianfucheng@sina.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41271516]; Anhui Normal University Graduate Student Research and Innovation Project [2014yks090],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Anhui Normal University Graduate Student Research and Innovation Project,"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41271516), the Anhui Normal University Graduate Student Research and Innovation Project (Grant No. 2014yks090).",,31,34,39,22,126,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Spatiotemporal associations between proximity to the canal and mortality were estimated using linear mixed models, unadjusted and adjusted for small-area measures of deprivation. The results showed an overall decrease in mortality over time (beta = -0.032, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.046, -0.017]) with a closing of the gap in mortality between less and more affluent areas. The annual rate of decrease in mortality rates was largest in the 0-500 m buffer zone closest to the canal (-3.12%, 95% CI [-4.50, -1.73]), with smaller decreases found in buffer zones further removed from the canal (500-1000 m: -3.01%, 95% CI [-6.52, 0.62]), and 1000-1500 m: -1.23%, 95% CI [-5.01, 2.71]). A similar pattern of results was found following adjustment for deprivation. The findings support the notion that regeneration of disused blue and green assets and climate adaptions can have a positive impact on health and health inequalities. Future studies are now needed using larger samples of individual-level data, including environmental, socioeconomic, and health variables to ascertain which specific elements of regeneration are the most effective in promoting health and health equity.","[Tieges, Zoe; McGregor, Duncan; Georgiou, Michail; Smith, Niamh; Chastin, Sebastien] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Hlth & Life Sci, 70 Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; [McGregor, Duncan] JCMB, Biomath & Stat Scotland, Kings Bldg,Peter Guthrie Tait Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Saunders, Josie; Millar, Richard] Scottish Canals, Canal House,1 Applecross St, Glasgow G4 9SP, Lanark, Scotland; [Morison, Gordon] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Built Environm, 70 Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; [Chastin, Sebastien] Univ Ghent, Dept Movement & Sport Sci, Watersportlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Glasgow Caledonian University; James Hutton Institute; University of Edinburgh; Glasgow Caledonian University; Ghent University,"Tieges, Z (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Hlth & Life Sci, 70 Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",Zoe.Tieges@gcu.ac.uk; Duncan.McGregor@gcu.ac.uk; Michail.Georgiou@gcu.ac.uk; Niamh.Smith@gcu.ac.uk; Josie.Saunders@scottishcanals.co.uk; richard.millar@scottishcanals.co.uk; Gordon.Morison@gcu.ac.uk; Sebastien.Chastin@gcu.ac.uk,"Tieges, Zoe/ABA-2817-2020; Chastin, Sebastien/ABF-1455-2020","Chastin, Sebastien/0000-0003-1421-9348; Georgiou, Michail/0000-0002-7652-8683; Tieges, Zoe/0000-0002-3820-3917; Smith, Niamh/0000-0002-9255-2528",Data Lab,Data Lab,This research was funded by The Data Lab (Principal Investigator: S.C.).,,41,11,11,5,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

These conditions place pressure on municipalities and local residents to consider a range of new disaster risk reduction programs, climate resilience initiatives, and in some cases transformative adaptation strategies (e.g., managed retreat and relocation from highly vulnerable, low-elevation locations). Researchers have increasingly understood that these climate risks and adaptation actions have significant impacts on the quality of life, well-being, and mental health of urban coastal residents. We explore these relationships and define conditions under which adaptation practices will affect communities and residents. Specifically, we assess climate and environmental stressors, community change, and well-being by utilizing the growing climate change literature and the parallel social science literature on risk and hazards, environmental psychology, and urban geography work, heretofore not widely integrated into work on climate adaptation.","[Solecki, William] CUNY Hunter Coll, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Friedman, Erin] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Solecki, W (corresponding author), CUNY Hunter Coll, New York, NY 10065 USA.",wsolecki@hunter.cuny.edu; efriedman2@gradcenter.cuny.edu,,,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Regional Integrated Science Assessment (RISA) [NA15OAR4310147],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Regional Integrated Science Assessment (RISA),This article was supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Regional Integrated Science Assessment (RISA) under grant NA15OAR4310147 to the Consortium for Climate Risk in the Urban Northeast (CCRUN).

The goal of this research, based on six years of collaborative work with Adi tribal peoples from 14 villages of East and Upper Siang districts of Arunachal Pradesh, was to record Adi knowledge and experiences relating to biocultural resources and their interactions with climate change and livelihood sustainability. Data were collected using conventional interviews and village workshops. A total of 700 Adi people participated in these workshops, while two elderly Adi women were observed and interviewed over the course of 7 days, to document their deep knowledge on the subject. Results indicated that Adi people are rich ill knowledge relating to biocultural resources that play a pivotal role in coping with weather anomalies and any abrupt climatic changes in order to sustain their livelihoods. People are aware about climate change and its potential to threaten heir biocultural resources and livelihoods. To combat future climate change and ensure sustainable lifeways, they are interested in establishing 'community reserve forests' (CRF) within undisturbed community forest landscapes. These could be either at an individual or community level or even at both levels, provided that environmental agencies are able to link these 'CRFs' with REDD programs and that rewards and incentives are given to Adi tribe. The future of the Adi tribe's biocultural resources and livelihood sustainability depends very much on their TEK and their active role in research, planning and policy implementation for climate change mitigation and adaptation.","[Singh, Ranjay K.] Cent Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry, Pasighat 791102, Arunachal Prade, India; [Singh, Ranjay K.; Pandey, C.

The fishery started during the mid 1950s, and since then it has been highly dependent on natural stock fluctuations, due to the sensitivity of anchovy stocks to ocean-climate variability. The main driver of anchovy stock variability is the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and three extreme ENSO warm events were recorded in 1972-1973, 1983-1984 and 1997-1998. This study investigates the evolution of coping strategies developed by the anchovy fisheries to deal with climate variability and extreme ENSO events. Results showed eight coping strategies to reduce impacts on the fishery. These included: decentralized installation of anchovy processing factories; simultaneous ownership of fishing fleet and processing factories; use of low-cost unloading facilities; opportunistic utilization of invading fish populations; low cost intensive monitoring; rapid flexible management; reduction of fishmeal price uncertainty through controlled production based on market demand; and decoupling of fishmeal prices from those of other protein-rich feed substitutes like soybean. This research shows that there are concrete lessons to be learned from successful adaptations to cope with climate change-related extreme climatic events that impact the supply of natural resources. The lessons can contribute to improved policies for coping with climate change in the commercial fishery sector.","[Schreiber, Milena Arias] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Schreiber, Milena Arias] Univ Bremen, Bremen Int Grad Sch Marine Sci GLOMAR, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Niquen, Miguel; Bouchon, Marilu] Inst Mar Peru Esq, Chucuito, Callao, Peru",Leibniz Zentrum fur Marine Tropenforschung (ZMT); University of Bremen; Instituto del Mar del Peru,"Schreiber, MA (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, Fahrenheitstr 6, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",milena@zmt-bremen.de; mniquen@imarpe.gob.pe; mbouchon@imarpe.gob.pe,"Schreiber, Milena Arias/AAK-4524-2021",,program Global Change in the marine realm (GLOMAR) of the Bremen International Graduate School for Marine Sciences at the University of Bremen,program Global Change in the marine realm (GLOMAR) of the Bremen International Graduate School for Marine Sciences at the University of Bremen,"We would like to acknowledge the program Global Change in the marine realm (GLOMAR) of the Bremen International Graduate School for Marine Sciences at the University of Bremen, to kindly provide the financial support to carry out the interviews and documentary analysis involved in the present research.

Fire managers contend with the direct effects of climate change on resources in addition to climate-induced disruptions to fire regimes and subsequent ecosystem effects. In systems stressed by warming and drying, increased fire activity amplifies the pace of change and scale of severe disturbance events, heightening the urgency for management action. Fire managers are asked to integrate information on climate impacts with their professional expertise to determine how to achieve management objectives in a changing climate with altered fire regimes. This is a difficult task, and managers need support as they incorporate climate adaptation into planning and operations. We present a list of adaptation strategies and approaches specific to fire and climate based on co-produced knowledge from a science-management partnership and pilot-tested in a two-day workshop with natural resource managers and regional stakeholders. This menu is a flexible and useful tool for fire managers who need to connect the dots between fire ecology, climate science, adaptation intent, and management implementation.

Selecting the right policy decisions and timing is difficult given the vested interests of communities and stakeholder groups and requires careful balancing of the benefits and risks associated with each management alternative. State and federal agencies often employ single-objective optimization frameworks such as cost-benefit analysis to analyze coastal relocation alternatives, but such methods are limited in their ability to balance competing value considerations and stakeholder demands. The use of a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methodology allows for such considerations to be quantified and evaluated, thereby improving planning and decision-making for coastal retreat policies. This paper provides a strategic MCDA framework to evaluate coastal retreat policy that could be leveraged by at-risk coastal communities. The MCDA is applied to a hypothetical coastal retreat scenario to visualize policy preferences and differing value considerations among stakeholders. This model can be used by government agencies to foster more sound, acceptable, and implementable coastal retreat policies and streamline the incorporation of this climate adaptation mechanism, which may be necessary for the near future.

Some cities have created civil service positions focused on climate resilience. We conducted interviews with six such individuals in four U.S. Atlantic coast cities to investigate how they think about and negotiate communication challenges associated with implementation of climate resilience strategies. We grounded our study in the Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF), which despite its longevity and wide usage has rarely been used to understand the role of government actors. We found substantial complexity in how these government representatives develop both amplifying and attenuating communication strategies as they often simultaneously reach multiple audiences holding different perspectives. They are familiar with and employ risk communication practices. However, they report needing to modify their efforts as climate adaptation issues and goals evolve over time, and experiment in situations, such as discussions of retreat, where established communication practices provide insufficient guidance. In order to develop a deeper understanding of the governmental risk communication actors, we suggest four potential avenues for taking advantage of the strengths of SARF as a framework for connecting and integrating with other models and theories. We also propose several directions for research based on the challenges these practitioners are finding in their work to facilitate adaptation to climate risks. The activity of government actors is rich in its applied risk communication practice and its challenges offer new questions to expand our thinking about the SARF and risk communication more broadly.","[Dow, Kirstin] Univ South Carolina, Dept Geog, Callcott Bldg, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Tuler, Seth] Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Integrat & Global Studies, Worcester, MA 01609 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Dow, K (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Dept Geog, Callcott Bldg, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",KDow@sc.edu,,,,,,,48,1,1,7,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0272-4332,1539-6924,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,JUL,2022,42,7,,,SI,,1440,1454,,10.1111/risa.13819,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.13819,,SEP 2021,15,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",3E8GN,34585415,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000700648500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are, however, several reasons why optimal levels of adaptation may not be attainable. This paper investigates the effects of suboptimal levels of adaptation caused by different types of adaptation restrictions, on the composition and level of climate change costs and on welfare. We find that especially restrictions to the effectiveness of adaptation at more extreme levels of climate change can be very harmful. Furthermore we show that the potential of mitigation to offset suboptimal adaptation varies from being essential in case adaptation becomes ineffective at higher temperature increases, to being largely ineffective in case of short-term inaction. However, in all cases the short-term recommendation is to increase mitigation levels slightly above what is normally recommended, and to keep mitigation policies flexible enough to be able to respond when adaptation restrictions become more prominent. It is clear that by reducing adaptation restrictions, in combination with adjusting the optimal level of mitigation may keep the costs of adaptation restrictions limited, and thus generally it is very harmful to ignore existing restrictions on adaptation when devising (efficient) climate policies.

It was only well after the turn of the century, with impacts of climate change increasingly being observed, that adaptation was added to the policy agenda and EU Member States started to develop National Adaptation Strategies (NASs). This paper reviews seven National Adaptation Strategies that were either formally adopted or under development by Member States at the end of 2008. The strategies are analysed under the following six themes. Firstly, the factors motivating and facilitating the development of a national adaptation strategy. Secondly, the scientific and technical support needed for the development and implementation of such a strategy. Thirdly, the role of the strategy in information, communication and awareness-raising of the adaptation issue. Fourthly, new or existing forms of multi-level governance to implement the proposed actions. Fifthly, how the strategy addresses integration and coordination with other policy domains. Finally, how the strategy suggests the implementation and how the strategy is evaluated. The paper notes that the role of National Adaptation Strategies in the wider governance of adaptation differs between countries but clearly benchmarks a new political commitment to adaptation at national policy levels. However, we also find that in most cases approaches for implementing and evaluating the strategies are yet to be defined. The paper concludes that even though the strategies show great resemblance in terms of topics, methods and approaches, there are many institutional challenges, including multi-level governance and policy integration issues, which can act as considerable barriers in future policy implementation.

To do this, we bring examples from a case study of salmon habitat restorationists in the Columbia River Basin into conversation with concepts from previous work on change and stability in knowledge infrastructures and scientific practice. In order to adapt, ecological restorationists are increasingly relying on predictive modeling tools, as well as initiating broader changes in the interdisciplinary nature of the field of ecological restoration itself. We explore how the field of ecological restoration is shifting its conceptual gaze from restoring to past, historic baselines to anticipating a no-analog future and consider what this means in terms of understanding the adaptive capacity of knowledge infrastructures and epistemic communities more broadly. We argue that identifying how scientists themselves conceptualize drivers of change and respond to these changes is an important step in understanding what adaptive capacity in science might entail. We offer these examples as a provocation for thinking about adaptive epistemologies and how adaptation by scientists themselves can facilitate or hinder particular environmental or sociotechnical futures.","[Hirsch, Shana Lee] Univ Washington, Human Ctr Design & Engn, 428 Sieg Hall, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Long, Jerrold] Univ Idaho, Coll Law, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Hirsch, SL (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Human Ctr Design & Engn, 428 Sieg Hall, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",slhirsch@uw.edu,,"Hirsch, Shana/0000-0003-3131-1701","National Science Foundation (NSF) [1249400, 1655884]; United States Geological Survey (USGS) Northwest Climate Science Center",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); United States Geological Survey (USGS) Northwest Climate Science Center(United States Geological Survey),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: We are grateful for financial support for this research that was provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF) award #1249400 and award #1655884.

Understanding how maize potential yield has changed over the past few decades and how large the gaps between potential and actual maize yields are is essential for increasing maize yield to meet increased food demand in Northeast China. In this study, the spatial and temporal dynamics of maize potential yield in Northeast China from 1990 to 2015 were simulated using the Global Agro-ecological Zones (GAEZ) model at the pixel level firstly. Then, the yield gaps between actual and potential yields were analyzed at city scale. The results were the following. (1) The maize potential yield decreased by about 500 kg/ha and the potential production remained at around 260 million tonnes during 1990-2000. From 2000 to 2015, the maize potential yield and production increased by approximately 1000 kg/ha and 80 million tonnes, respectively. (2) The maize potential yield decreased in most regions of Northeast China in the first decade, such as the center area (CA), south area (SA), southwest area (SWA), and small regions in northeast area (NEA), due to lower temperature and insufficient rainfall. The maize potential yield increased elsewhere. (3) The maize potential yield increased by more than 1000 kg/ha in the center area (CA) in the latter 15 years, which may be because of the climate warming and sufficient precipitation. The maize potential yield decreased elsewhere and Harbin in the center area (CA). (4) In 40 cities of Northeast China, the rates of actual yield to potential yield in 17 cities were higher than 80%. The actual yields only attained 50-80% of the potential yields in 20 cities. The gaps between actual and potential yields in Hegang and Dandong were very large, which need to be shrunk urgently. The results highlight the importance of coping with climate change actively, arranging crop structure reasonably, improving farmland use efficiency and ensuring food security in Northeast China.","[Pu, Luoman; Bai, Shuting] Jilin Univ, Coll Earth Sci, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Pu, Luoman; Zhang, Shuwen; Yang, Jiuchun; Chang, Liping; Bai, Shuting] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Pu, Luoman] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Ctr Spatial Anal, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Jilin University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman","Zhang, SW; Yang, JC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Jilin, Peoples R China.",puluoman@sina.com; zhangshuwen@neigae.ac.cn; yangjiuchun@iga.ac.cn; lpchang@iga.ac.cn; baist2018@163.com,"蒲, 蒲罗曼/HHN-8497-2022",,Research of Gully Erosion and Prevention Mechanism of the Northeast Black Soil Area [2017YFC0504202]; Technological Basic Research Program of China [2017FY101301]; China Scholarship Council,Research of Gully Erosion and Prevention Mechanism of the Northeast Black Soil Area; Technological Basic Research Program of China; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This research was supported by the Research of Gully Erosion and Prevention Mechanism of the Northeast Black Soil Area (No.2017YFC0504202), Technological Basic Research Program of China (No. 2017FY101301) and China Scholarship Council.

The researched relations are illustrated by the example of Serbia. The Republic of Serbia has been faced with increasingly visible impacts of climate change in recent years-floods, heat waves, droughts and others. During the floods that hit Serbia in 2014, over 30,000 people experienced displacement. These events have triggered numerous efforts, both to repair the incurred damage and to analyze opportunities for prevention. Design/methodology/approach - This research has used document analysis to investigate contemporary approaches defined by policies, programs and research reports regarding climate change and DRR, with special reference to the displacement of people. An analytical framework has been used to evaluate to what extent the planning policy framework in Serbia addresses these issues in the context of achieving resilient development. Secondary analysis of research data has been used to recognize the gaps and identify needs for increasing community resilience. Findings-Based on the growing trends in projections of climate change as a result of induced natural disasters for the region in the future and international trends in coping with these issues, this paper argues that it is necessary to improve the implementation of the planning policy framework and the capacities of professionals and citizens, to reduce future displacement and increase community resilience to climate change. The key weaknesses found within DRR and the emergency management system in Serbia were the lack of an appropriate information base of the cadastre of risk zones and the lack of information and coordination of actors on the local to the national level. During the pre-disaster period, findings stress a weak partnership and capacity development practice at the local level, as well as between local responsible bodies and regional/national entities in charge of emergency management and DRR. The paper singles out the main preconditions for achieving effective resilient planning, so that such a plan can move people away from marginal areas and provide living conditions that are resilient. Originality/value - This paper provides a comprehensive insight analysis of the relations between climate change and DRR, with special reference to the planning policy. Using the lessons learned from the recent climate-induced disaster with its implications on displacement, the paper identifies needs for strengthening capacities to establish more resilient communities in Serbia. The gaps and needs identified, as well as the recommendations provided, may be of value for neighboring countries as well, who face similar challenges in climate change adaptation and who need to increase disaster risk resilience.","[Crncevic, Tijana] Inst Architecture & Urban & Spatial Planning Serb, Belgrade, Serbia; [Lovren, Violeta Orlovic] Univ Belgrade, Fac Philosophy, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Crncevic, T (corresponding author), Inst Architecture & Urban & Spatial Planning Serb, Belgrade, Serbia.",tijana@iaus.ac.rs,,,"Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [TP 36035]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","The paper was prepared within a scientific project in the field of technological development entitled Spatial, Environmental, Energy and Social Aspects of Developing the Settlements and Climate Change - Mutual Impacts (TP 36035), funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia.",,36,10,10,7,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

In order to address the challenge of socio-economic and unique regional geographical setting, a customized methodological framework was developed for application in assessment of climate change vulnerability perception and adaptation options around the East African region. Indicators of climate change and variability most appropriate for the region were derived from focused discussions involving key informants in various sectors of the economy drawn from three East African countries. Using these indicators, a structured questionnaire was developed from which surveys and interviews were done on selected sample of target population of farming communities in the Mt. Kenya region. The key highlights of the questionnaire were vulnerability and adaptation. Data obtained from respondents was standardized and subjected to multivariate and ANOVA analysis. Based on principle component analysis (PCA), two main vulnerability categories were identified namely the social and the bio-physical vulnerability indicators. Analysis of variance using Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant statistical variation (P <= 0.05) in the perceived vulnerability across the spatial distribution of the 198 respondents. Three insights were distinguished and were discernible by agro-ecological zones. Different vulnerability profiles and adaptive capacity profiles were generated demonstrating the need for prioritizing adaptation and mitigation efforts at local level. There was a high correlation between the bio-physical and social factor/livelihood variables that were assessed.","[Adimo, Aggrey Ochieng] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Dept Hort, Nairobi 00200, Kenya; [Claessens, Leaven] Int Potato Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya",Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology; CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP),"Adimo, AO (corresponding author), Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Dept Hort, POB 62000, Nairobi 00200, Kenya.",radimoochg@yahoo.com,"Claessens, Lieven/C-5895-2009","Claessens, Lieven/0000-0003-2961-8990",,,,,26,6,6,0,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

A recognized need exists to adapt suburbs (homes, gardens and public space) physically to mitigate against further climate change and to adapt to inevitable weather patterns. A number of potential adaptation options, addressing different risks, are identified and tested using a range of methods, including modelling, and workshops with residents and professional and institutional stakeholders. The best' solutions are those that reduce the climate risk within the context of local adaptive capacity. Solutions are effective, acceptable and feasible given the type of suburb; its location; microclimate; housing type; the climate risk it faces; the socio-economic composition of its residents and their attitudes; resources; and governance conditions. It is essential to consider both the totality of the suburban environment and the combined effects of mitigation and adaptation measures.

Elevated temperatures driven by climate change affect developmental and physiological plant processes that, ultimately, impact on crop yield and quality. Plant roots are responsible for water and nutrients uptake, but changes in soil temperatures alters this process limiting crop growth. With the predicted variable climatic forecast, the development of an efficient root system better adapted to changing soil and environmental conditions is crucial for enhancing crop productivity. Root traits associated with improved adaptation to rising temperatures are increasingly being analyzed to obtain more suitable crop varieties. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge about the effect of increasing temperatures on root growth and their impact on crop yield. First, we will describe the main alterations in root architecture that different crops undergo in response to warmer soils. Then, we will outline the main coordinated physiological and metabolic changes taking place in roots and aerial parts that modulate the global response of the plant to increased temperatures. We will discuss on some of the main regulatory mechanisms controlling root adaptation to warmer soils, including the activation of heat and oxidative pathways to prevent damage of root cells and disruption of root growth; the interplay between hormonal regulatory pathways and the global changes on gene expression and protein homeostasis. We will also consider that in the field, increasing temperatures are usually associated with other abiotic and biotic stresses such as drought, salinity, nutrient deficiencies, and pathogen infections. We will present recent advances on how the root system is able to integrate and respond to complex and different stimuli in order to adapt to an increasingly changing environment. Finally, we will discuss the new prospects and challenges in this field as well as the more promising pathways for future research.","[Calleja-Cabrera, J.; Boter, M.; Onate-Sanchez, L.; Pernas, M.] Univ Politecn Madrid, Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria, Ctr Biotecnol & Genom Plantas, Madrid, Spain",Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Pernas, M (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria, Ctr Biotecnol & Genom Plantas, Madrid, Spain.",pernas.monica@inia.es,"; Onate-Sanchez, Luis/C-6274-2017","Calleja-Cabrera, Julian/0000-0003-0510-4741; Onate-Sanchez, Luis/0000-0001-7047-5739","Spanish Ministry of Science and Universities [BIO201677840-R]; FP7 FACCE-JPI-ERA-NET C CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE (ERA46-SYBRACLYM); Centre of Excellence Severo Ochoa Program of the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion, Spain [SEV-2016-0672]","Spanish Ministry of Science and Universities(Spanish Government); FP7 FACCE-JPI-ERA-NET C CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE (ERA46-SYBRACLYM); Centre of Excellence Severo Ochoa Program of the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion, Spain","This work was supported with a grant to LO-S by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Universities (BIO201677840-R) and to MP by FP7.

Such organizations have a complex role: engaging with policy-makers, as well as their memberships and the public, to pursue the interests of their specific communities. This paper includes an examination of how farm producer organizations communicate about climate and weather to these various audiences, and the specific needs and recommendations they advance. Of particular interest are commodities related to pasture-based grazing, which is underrepresented in the climate adaptation literature. A collection of 95 publicly available documents is analyzed, representing a snapshot of climate- and weather-related public and policy engagement of Canadian and Albertan farm and livestock producer organizations from 2010 to 2015. Qualitative coding by scale, commodity, and audience revealed three significant patterns within this exploratory study. First, while national umbrella organizations speak climate to government, Alberta-based livestock/forage organizations speak to their members with a focus on weather. Second, while the two national umbrella organizations examined are politically divergent, they appear to be united on the topic of climate change. Third, common ground was also found between climate and weather discourses around on-farm management, specifically rotational grazing.

Climate internal variability (CIV) dominates climate uncertainty over decadal prediction horizons at stakeholders' scales (regional to local). In the literature, CIV has been characterized indirectly using projections of climate change from multi-model ensembles (MME) instead of directly using projections from multiple initial condition ensembles (MICE), primarily because adequate number of initial condition (IC) runs were not available for any climate model. Nevertheless, the recent availability of significant number of IC runs from one climate model allows for the first time to characterize CIV directly from climate model projections and perform a sensitivity analysis to study the dominance of CIV compared to model response variability (MRV). Here, we measure relative agreement (a dimensionless number with values ranging between 0 and 1, inclusive; a high value indicates less variability and vice versa) among MME and MICE and find that CIV is lower than MRV for all projection time horizons and spatial resolutions for precipitation and temperature. However, CIV exhibits greater dominance over MRV for seasonal and annual mean precipitation at higher latitudes where signals of climate change are expected to emerge sooner. Furthermore, precipitation exhibits large uncertainties and a rapid decline in relative agreement from global to continental, regional, or local scales for MICE compared to MME. The fractional contribution of uncertainty due to CIV is invariant for precipitation and decreases for temperature as lead time progresses towards the end of the century.","[Kumar, Devashish; Ganguly, Auroop R.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Sustainabil & Data Sci Lab SDS Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Kumar, D (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Sustainabil & Data Sci Lab SDS Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",devashishkr@gmail.com,"Ganguly, Auroop/AAJ-5591-2020",,US National Science Foundation's (NSF) Expeditions in Computing award [1029711]; NSF CyberSEES award [1442728]; NSF BIGDATA award [1447587],US National Science Foundation's (NSF) Expeditions in Computing award; NSF CyberSEES award; NSF BIGDATA award,"The research was funded by the US National Science Foundation's (NSF) Expeditions in Computing award # 1029711, NSF CyberSEES award # 1442728, and NSF BIGDATA award # 1447587.

Climate adaptive building shells (CABS) are among the most promising alternatives for achieving sustainability goals by reducing energy consumption. Regardless of technological developments, this type of system has a reputation for increasing the distraction of occupants and consequently decreasing their satisfaction level. This research has been developed to focus on the occupant-centric study rather than technological advancements of the system. This study introduces the user-facade interaction scenarios and applies this classification on CABS office buildings. The purpose of this study is to introduce a new multi-domain taxonomy for CABS office buildings and update the database of this system by adding a new variable focusing on occupants. The study was designed on the foundation found with PRISMA methodology which highlights the lack of occupant-centric research on CABS. The research carried on as a qualitative method with an inductive approach which with the literature review introduced the user-facade interaction scenarios and the latest update of the CABS database. Accordingly, the office cases were categorized within different climatic zones, and later as a correlational study, each case was studied based on user-facade interaction scenarios. Analysis of case databases according to user-facade interaction types clears the lack of development in the majority of scenarios. Lastly, the study concluded by introducing a novel multi-domain taxonomy of CABS office buildings by considering user-facade interaction scenarios. The further value of this study is to be a foundation for future studies on CABS office buildings by considering the occupants as a primary element of the research.","[Hafizi, Nazgol; Vural, Sadiye Mujdem] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Architecture, Dept Architecture, Via Mersin 10, TR-99628 Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Hafizi, N (corresponding author), Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Architecture, Dept Architecture, Via Mersin 10, TR-99628 Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey.",nazgol.hafizi@emu.edu.tr; mujdem.vural@emu.edu.tr,"Vural, Sadiye Müjdem/AAW-2311-2021","Vural, Sadiye Müjdem/0000-0001-7271-1846; Hafizi, Nazgol/0000-0003-4028-3749",,,,,56,0,0,6,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JUL,2022,15,14,,,,,,,5268,10.3390/en15145268,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15145268,,,21,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,3K0TV,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000833799500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In response, policy makers and academics are seeking strategies to build public support for coastal adaptation, which requires a deeper understanding of peoples' preferences for coastal adaptation and what motives those preferences. Here, we conduct a systematic literature review to understand preferences for coastal adaptation options and the factors influencing these preferences. Ninety peer-reviewed publications meet the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed that hard protection options were often the most frequently preferred, likely due to a desire to maintain current shoreline, for the protection of recreational spaces and private property, and a perceived effectiveness of hard protection options. Soft protection, including nature-based approaches, accommodation, and no action were the next most preferred options. Finally, retreat options were the least preferred, often due to strong place attachment. We identify twenty-eight factors that could influence preferences, with risk perception, place attachment, and financial considerations occurring most frequently in the literature. In the conclusion, we outline the most significant research gaps identified from our analysis and discuss the implication for adaptation research and practice.","[Mallette, Angela; Smith, Timothy F.; Elrick-Barr, Carmen] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Law & Soc, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia; [Smith, Timothy F.; Blythe, Jessica; Plummer, Ryan] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON LS2 3A1, Canada; [Smith, Timothy F.] Uppsala Univ, SWEDESD, S-75105 Uppsala, Sweden",University of the Sunshine Coast; Brock University; Uppsala University,"Mallette, A (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Law & Soc, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia.",angela.mallette@research.usc.edu.au; tsmith5@usc.edu.au; celrick@usc.edu.au; jblythe2@brocku.ca; rplummer@brocku.ca,"Blythe, Jessica/AAV-7997-2021; Elrick-Barr, Carmen/Q-9861-2019","Blythe, Jessica/0000-0001-7604-6046; Elrick-Barr, Carmen/0000-0001-6868-1373; Smith, Timothy/0000-0002-3991-5211",Australian Government; Australian Research Council [FT180100652]; Australian Research Council [FT180100652] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Government(Australian Government); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This research was supported by the Australian Government through the Research Training Program (RTP) and the Australian Research Council Discovery Projects Funding Scheme (Project FT180100652).

It identifies barriers that may be relevant for all sectors, all along the successive phases of the adaptation process. It additionally identifies the barriers which are most important and how these can be overcome. In order to do this we use an online survey directed to Swiss tourism stakeholders. Our results indicate that both economic and social feasibility barriers are important impediments to the adjustment process, whereas the acceptability among inhabitants and the willingness to act of stakeholders appear less critical. These barriers can be overcome and adaptation facilitated with more and especially better information about the regional consequences of climate change and feasible adaptation measures, by some top-down leadership and coordination, and by providing financial support.","[Matasci, Cecilia; Thalmann, Philippe] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Res Grp Econ & Management Environm REME, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Stn 16, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Kruse, Sylvia] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Res Unit Econ & Social Sci, Res Grp Reg Econ & Dev, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Barawid, Nico] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford, England","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Oxford","Matasci, C (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Res Grp Econ & Management Environm REME, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Stn 16, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",cecilia.matasci@gmail.com,"Thalmann, Philippe/A-6943-2008; Kruse, Sylvia/E-7096-2014","Thalmann, Philippe/0000-0001-7200-3241; Matasci, Cecilia/0000-0002-0693-5339",Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN); Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate) - Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN); Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate) - Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) as well as of the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate) which is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF).

Thus, there is an increasing need for practical examples of such work in the literature. This paper describes a practical application of an integrated framework for climate change impacts on regional surface water resources and the urban water system in the Mamminasata metropolitan region, Indonesia. Two main features of the framework are: the integration of both climate and other physical and social considerations in the assessment; and the high stakeholder involvement before, during and after project implementation. Although the study is concerned with the Mamminasata region, the overall methodology is transferable to any region in Indonesia or internationally. Key outcomes from this study are: (1) creation of information for Mamminasata planners and water resources managers for when, and under what conditions, the water supply may or may not meet the demand; (2) a clear consensus and shared learning of the problems facing the region among cross-institutional stakeholders; and (3) identification of adaptation options for the urban water system and knowledge gaps and strategies for their implementation. Results of stakeholders' surveys conducted at the mid-point and at the end of the study indicate that these outputs will provide valuable guidance for future planning and management of Mamminasata regional water resources.","[Kirono, Dewi G.

However, they are susceptible to clogging causing premature degradation. As part of the Dutch Delta Plan, Dutch municipalities were encouraged to put infiltrating pavements into practice. Disappointing experiences made a significant number of municipalities decide, however, to stop further implementation. A need existed to better understand how infiltrating pavements function in practice. Through 81 full-scale infiltration tests, we investigated the performance of infiltrating pavements in practice. Most pavements function well above Dutch and international standards. However, variation was found to be high. Infiltration rates decrease over time. Age alone, however, is not a sufficient explanatory factor. Other factors, such as environmental or system characteristics, are of influence here. Maintenance can play a major role in preserving/improving the performance of infiltrating pavements in practice. While our results provide the first indication of the functioning of infiltrating pavement in practice, only with multi-year measurements following a strict monitoring protocol can the longer-term effects of environmental factors and maintenance actually be determined, providing the basis for the development of an optimal maintenance schedule and associated cost-benefit assessments to the added value of this type of climate adaptation.","[Veldkamp, Ted Isis Elize; Kluck, Jeroen] Amsterdam Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Expertise Urban Technol, Weesperzijde 190, NL-1097 DZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Boogaard, Floris Cornelis] Hanze Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Appl Res & Innovat Area Dev, NoorderRuimte, Zernikepl 7,POB 3037, NL-9701 DA Groningen, Netherlands; [Boogaard, Floris Cornelis] Energy Acad Europe, Global Ctr Adaptat, Nijenborgh 6, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands; [Boogaard, Floris Cornelis] Deltares, Postbus 177, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Kluck, Jeroen] TAUW BV, Handelskade 37,Postbus 133, NL-7400 AC Deventer, Netherlands",Deltares,"Veldkamp, TIE (corresponding author), Amsterdam Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Expertise Urban Technol, Weesperzijde 190, NL-1097 DZ Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.i.e.veldkamp@hva.nl; f.c.boogaard@pl.hanze.nl; j.kluck@hva.nl,"Boogaard, Floris Cornelis/V-6308-2019","Boogaard, Floris Cornelis/0000-0002-1434-4838","Regieorgaan SIA [RAAK.MKB.08.023, RAAK.PUB07.012]",Regieorgaan SIA,"This research was funded by Regieorgaan SIA, grant numbers RAAK.MKB.08.023 and RAAK.PUB07.012.",,39,2,2,4,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2022,14,13,,,,,,,2080,10.3390/w14132080,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14132080,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,2V5KZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000823886200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

About 1.15 myr ago Homo erectus and an associated Stegodon-Ailuropoda fauna migrated from subtropical China across the Qinling Mountains into the temperate Loess Plateau. This migration may be an evolutionary milestone in human adaptability because it may represent the first occupation of a nontropical environment. Loess-paleosol stable isotope ratios from the last interglacial-glacial cycle provide comparative data for reconstructing the hominid paleoenvironments. The climate during Gongwangling hominid occupation about 1.15 myr ago was influenced by both Siberian-Mongolian winter and Indian summer monsoon systems characterized as a cold/cool, dry winter and warm/mild, semihumid summer and fall. The Gongwangling hominids preyed mainly on warm-climate-adapted animals such as Stegodon-Ailuropoda fauna, suggesting a warm season occupation. The stable isotope ratios also indicate that the Chenjiawo hominids occupied an environment similar to that of the Gongwangling about 650,000 yr ago. The associated fauna, with a mixture of forest and steppe, warm-and cold/cool-climate-adapted animal assemblage's, suggests a permanent occupation by this time.

Assessing historical trends and potential socio-economic impacts is especially difficult in the Arctic given limitations on availability of weather observations and historical impacts. This study utilizes a novel interdisciplinary approach that integrates archival analysis, observational data, and climate model downscaling to synthesize information on historical and projected impacts of extreme weather events in Nome, Alaska. Over 300 impacts (1990-2018) are identified based on analyses of the Nome Nugget newspaper articles and Storm Data entries. Historical impacts centered on transportation, community activities, and utilities. Analysis of observed and ERA5 reanalysis data indicates that impacts are frequently associated with high wind, extreme low temperatures, heavy snowfall events, and winter days above freezing. Downscaled output (2020-2100) from two climate models suggests that there will be changes in the frequency and timing of these extreme weather events. For example, extreme cold temperature is projected to decrease through the 2040s and then rarely occurs afterwards, and extreme wind events show little change before the 2070s. Significantly, our findings also reveal that not all weather-related extremes will change monotonically throughout the twenty-first century, such as extreme snowfall events that will increase through the 2030s before declining in the 2040s. The dynamical nature of projected changes in extreme events has implications for climate adaptation planning.","[Kettle, Nathan P.; Walsh, John E.; Heaney, Lindsey; Thoman, Richard L., Jr.; Redilla, Kyle] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Kettle, Nathan P.; Walsh, John E.; Heaney, Lindsey; Thoman, Richard L., Jr.; Redilla, Kyle] Alaska Ctr Climate Assessment & Policy, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Carroll, Lynneva] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Honors Coll, Fairbanks, AK USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Kettle, NP (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.;Kettle, NP (corresponding author), Alaska Ctr Climate Assessment & Policy, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",nkettle@alaska.edu,,"Kettle, Nathan/0000-0002-0871-1099","Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy (ACCAP); Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA16OAR4310162]; United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project [1018914]","Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy (ACCAP); Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project","This research was financially supported by the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy (ACCAP), a Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Award NA16OAR4310162) and the United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project (1018914).",,70,2,3,6,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The present study aims to provide a speedy but reliable methodology to evaluate the potential impacts of adopting active/passive CABS systems during the preliminary design stage. The proposed methodology allows the evaluation and comparison, when multiple options are considered, of the effects of each solution in terms of the energy needs, thermal comfort and lighting, while reducing the required effort and time for an extensive analysis of the overall building level. This is based on the use of a virtual test room  where different conditions and configurations can be explored. A case study in the city of Bologna is included for demonstration purposes.

However, we lack understanding of how different types of water sources (both improved and unimproved) are affected by climate change, and thus, where to prioritize future investments and improvements to maximize health outcomes. This is due to limited knowledge of the relationships between source water quality and the observed variability in climate conditions. To address this gap, a 20-month observational study was conducted in Tanzania, aiming to understand how water quality changes at various types of sources due to short-term climate variability. Nine rounds of microbiological water quality sampling were conducted for Escherichia coli and total coliforms, at three study sites within different climatic regions. Each round included approximately 233 samples from water sources and 632 samples from households. To identify relationships between water quality and short-term climate variability, Bayesian hierarchical modeling was adopted, allowing these relationships to vary with source types and sampling regions to account for potentially different physical processes. Across water sources, increases in E. coli/total coliform levels were most closely related to increases in recent heavy rainfall. Our key recommendations to future longitudinal studies are (a) demonstrated value of high sampling frequency and temporal coverage (a minimum of 3 years) especially during wet seasons; (b) utility of the Bayesian hierarchical models to pool data from multiple sites while allowing for variations across space and water sources; and (c) importance of a multidisciplinary team approach with consistent commitment and sharing of knowledge. Plain Language Summary It is vital to understand how different types of water sources (both improved and unimproved) are influenced by changing climate conditions. This is needed to appreciate the reliability of these water sources in the future. A 20-month observational study was carried out in Tanzania to explore these relationships. Nine rounds of sampling were conducted across three study sites within different climatic regions, with fecal pathogen levels sampled at both water sources and households. A novel statistical model was developed to link water quality change with types of water quality and climate variability. We found that across different source types, the increases in fecal pathogen levels are most closely related to increases in recent heavy rainfall. We recommend that future studies to include at least 3 years of data collection. The successful study design here shows the value of multidisciplinary teams to ensure that appropriate statistical modeling structure can be used to analyze the data and provide new information for climate change adaptation. In the long term, such studies will provide evidence for decision-makers to prioritize future water investments and improvements to maximize public health outcomes.","[Guo, Danlu] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Thomas, Jacqueline; Lazaro, Alfred; Mahundo, Clarence; Lwetoijera, Dickson; Mrimi, Emmanuel; Matwewe, Fatuma] Ifakara Hlth Inst, Ifakara, Tanzania; [Thomas, Jacqueline] Univ Sydney, Sch Civil Engn, Darlington, WA, Australia; [Johnson, Fiona] Univ New South Wales, Water Res Ctr, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Melbourne; Ifakara Health Institute; University of Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Guo, DL (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",danlu.guo@unimelb.edu.au,"guo, danlu/V-4558-2019; guo, danlu/ABB-6162-2021; Johnson, Fiona/B-4864-2010","guo, danlu/0000-0003-1083-1214; Lazaro, Alfred Boniphace/0000-0002-0584-7599; Johnson, Fiona/0000-0001-5708-1807","Tanzanian Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children; World Health Organization Tanzanian country","Tanzanian Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children; World Health Organization Tanzanian country","The researchers wish to acknowledge the support of the Tanzanian Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children for the ethical clearance to conduct the study in Dar es Salaam, Kilombero, and Kondoa regions, Tanzanian Meteorological Agency for providing us with archived data of climate which we used to develop our models, Internal Drainage Basin Water Office for providing us with real time weather and climate data from Kondoa region, and the Department of Water Resources Engineering at The University of Dar es Salaam for providing us a laboratory space and equipment's to conduct our longitudinal study.

As the real world has already witnessed a 0.5 degrees C global mean surface temperature warming increment, the observed climate changes associated with the half-degree warming may be analogues for future projections. This hypothesis is examined by comparing the heat extreme changes in China derived from the observational records to projections of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) low-warming experiment, which is the first short-term stabilized simulation dedicated for the 1.5 and 2 degrees C warming targets. The results of the CESM historical simulations are also evaluated. From the perspective of spatially aggregated, the heat extreme changes in China under the historical 0.5 degrees C warming are detectable in observations. The nighttime extremes manifest more significant increase than daytime extremes. Heat extreme changes under the past half-degree warming increment are reasonably captured in the historical simulations with slightly weaker magnitudes. The changes in the intensity indices in observations are better reproduced by the historical simulations than the frequency and duration indices. For the heat extreme changes in the future 0.5 degrees C warming, the observational records can serve as conservative analogues in daytime extremes, while the nighttime extreme indices show comparable or weaker changes. The future reduction of anthropogenic aerosol emissions will amplify the increase of heat extremes in comparison to present day especially during daytime in China. Given the possibly intensified extremes associated with future aerosol reductions, more attention should be paid to the currently heavy polluted regions. Plain Language Summary Since the Paris Agreement called for limiting the future global warming under 2 degrees C and pursuing efforts to limit under 1.5 degrees C, great efforts have been devoted to exploring the benefits of the 0.5 degrees C less warming on natural and social systems. Since the world has already witnessed a 0.5 degrees C warming increment, whether the associated observed climate changes can be analogues for future projections is an interesting and important question. Focusing on the heat extreme changes over continental China, we revisit the observational data sets to evaluate the performance of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) historical simulations and then compare the observed changes with the CESM 1.5 degrees C/2 degrees C future projections. We find that the heat extreme changes under the past 0.5 degrees C warming increment are detectable in observations and can be well reproduced by the historical simulations. The changes of intensity indices in the observations are better reproduced by the model than the frequency and duration indices. For the daytime heat extremes, the observations only give the lower boundary for the projected changes in future 0.5 degrees C warming. China may experience severer increase in daytime heat extremes due to possible aerosol reductions in the future. Our results would provide useful information to climate change adaption and risk management.","[Zhao, Siyao; Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Siyao; Zhou, Tianjun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhoutj@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012","ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279; Zhao, Siyao/0000-0002-4179-8691",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1507701]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41775091]; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [134111KYSB20160031]; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change,National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change,"This work is jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1507701), National Natural Science Foundation of China (41775091), and the International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (134111KYSB20160031).

Against rising air temperature, more farmers on direct sales (Type D farmers) than those on sales via the markets (Type M farmers) recognized the delay in fruit maturity as the effect of climate change, specifically temperature rise, (Type D: 62%, Type M: 15%). In response to the delay in maturity, Type D farmers simply delayed the harvest to full maturity by about 10 days than they did 20 years ago. On the other hand, Type M farmers recognized delayed reddening of the fruits as the most salient result of climate change (Type D: 8%, Type M: 46%), and took measures to accelerate the coloring by placing reflective materials on ground and/or picking off leaves around the fruits. The contrasting behaviors can be explained by the difference in the critical trait of the products. For Type M farmers, timing of the shipment is critical to avoid competition with shipments from other apple growing areas, and the good coloring is the prerequisite for the shipment. For Type D farmers, by contrast, full maturity is more important than coloring, since their contract with the customers hinges on the palatability of the fruits rather than the timing. This study has thus identified positioning of the farmers with the sales channel as a determinant in their adaptation behavior and vulnerability to climatic changes.","[Fujisawa, Mariko; Kobayashi, Kazuhiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Kobayashi, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Yayoi 1-1-1, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",aa087098@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp; aclasman@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kobayashi, Kazuhiko/AAN-7096-2020",,,,,,30,15,20,2,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

We integrate information relative to a multidimensional set of physical, geological, and socioeconomic variables, and add to the mainstream literature the consideration of both a reference and a climate change scenario, assuming the representative concentration pathway 8.5 W/m(2)(RCP8.5) for the 21st century in the Mediterranean region. Results report that approximately 1% (similar to 43 km(2)) of the mapped shoreline is classifiable as having a high or very high vulnerability, whereas approximately 80% (4652 km(2)) shows very low vulnerability. As expected, exposure to inundation and erosion is especially relevant in highly developed and urbanized coastal areas. Along the shoreline, while the Nile Delta region is the most prone area to coastal erosion and permanent or occasional inundations (both in the reference and in the climate scenario), results show the Western Desert area to be less vulnerable due to its geological characteristics (i.e., rocky and cliffed coasts, steeper coastal slope). The application of the CCVI to the coast of Egypt can be considered as a first screening of the hot-spot risk areas at the national scale. The results of the analysis, including vulnerability maps and indicators, can be used to support the development of climate adaptation and integrated coastal zone management strategies.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-12.

The implementation of small-scale nature-based solutions (NBS) such as bio(swales), green roofs, and green walls requires the involvement and enthusiasm of multiple stakeholders. This paper discusses how online citizen science platforms can stimulate stakeholder engagement and promote NBS, which is illustrated with the case of ClimateScan. Three main concerns related to online platforms are addressed: the period of relevance of the platform, the lack of knowledge about the inclusiveness and characteristics of the contributors, and the ability of sustaining a well-functioning community with limited resources. ClimateScan has adopted a bottom-up approach in which users have much freedom to create and update content. Within six years, this has resulted in an illustrated map with over 5000 NBS projects around the globe and an average of more than 100 visitors a day. However, points of concern are identified regarding the data quality and the aspect of community-building. Although the numbers of users are rising, only a few users have remained involved. Learning from these remaining top users and their motivations, we draw general lessons and make suggestions for stimulating long-term engagement on online knowledge-sharing platforms.","[Restemeyer, Britta; Boogaard, Floris C.] Univ Appl Sci, Hanzehgsk Groningen, Zernikepl 7,POB 30030, Groningen, Netherlands; [Boogaard, Floris C.] Deltares, Daltonlaan 600,POB 85467, NL-3584 BK Utrecht, Netherlands",Deltares,"Restemeyer, B (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci, Hanzehgsk Groningen, Zernikepl 7,POB 30030, Groningen, Netherlands.",b.restemeyer@pl.hanze.nl; floris@noorderruimte.nl,"Boogaard, Floris Cornelis/V-6308-2019","Boogaard, Floris Cornelis/0000-0002-1434-4838; Restemeyer, Britta/0000-0001-6643-0087",North Sea Region Programme 2014-2021,North Sea Region Programme 2014-2021,ClimateScanwas applied as a tool in the international projectWaterCoG(WaterCo-Governance) co-funded by the North Sea Region Programme 2014-2021.

Cities are particularly susceptible to flooding from downpours because of their large share of impervious surfaces. Minimising pluvial flood risk requires all involved stakeholders to collaborate and overcome various barriers. Although an increase in citizen engagement in climate adaptation is generally preferred, experiences with inclusive decision-making are often limited. The aim of this paper is to obtain a deeper understanding of how the capacity to govern pluvial flood risk can be developed through citizen engagement. We scrutinised the capacity of local actors to govern pluvial flood risk in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands. For the analysis of Utrecht's problem-solving capacity, the Governance Capacity Framework provided a consistent assessment of the key governance components. The results indicate that Utrecht's capacity to govern pluvial flooding is relatively well-developed. Collaboration between public authorities is advanced, sufficient financial resources are available, and smart monitoring enables high levels of evaluation and learning. However, citizen awareness and engagement in policy making is rather low. Accordingly, citizens' willingness to pay for flood adaptation is limited. Stimulating flood risk awareness by combining financial incentives with more advanced arrangements for active citizen engagement is key for Utrecht and other cities.","[Brockhoff, Romy C.; Koop, Steven H.

These plans will have important consequences for urban populations because they are likely to reshape and reconfigure urban infrastructures, services, and decision making processes. It is critical that these adaptation plans are developed in a way that is just. Criteria was developed that can be used to assess justice in adaptation so that the processes, priorities, and impacts address the needs of the most vulnerable urban populations. Further, mechanisms are outlined that have been proposed as responsible for producing urban injustice. The justice criteria are applied to the case of adaptation planning in Delhi and the extent to which poor and informal populations are included and affected by this planning. The analysis shows that adaptation planning in Delhi does not meet the justice criteria in part because of a lack of capacity and the political economy of poverty in the city. The criteria for justice and mechanisms of injustice offer an important step toward developing a greater understanding of not only whether city-level adaptation planning is just, but also why it is or is not.","Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Hughes, S (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",,,"Hughes, Sara/0000-0002-1282-6235",Advanced Study Program; Integrated Science Program of the National Center for Atmospheric Research,Advanced Study Program; Integrated Science Program of the National Center for Atmospheric Research,"This research was supported by funding from the Advanced Study Program and Integrated Science Program of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and assisted by The Energy and Resources Institute.

Despite the obligation to act, local governments are hindered by the absence of applicable guides to adaptation decision-making, especially adaptation to extreme events. In this paper, we describe a framework for prioritising adaptation options that could be locally implemented and illustrate it with a study of flooding in Kochi: a city in southern India. Unlike many demand driven, economics based studies, our new framework also incorporates non-economic dimensions of the extremes and potential adaptation options. Local knowledge is used to tackle data gaps and uncertainty related to extreme events: local experts select adaptation options that offer additional benefits besides those related to climate change. These co-benefits aid decision making under uncertainty by giving weight to community priorities. The Indian case study reveals that, risk evaluation and reduction need to be locally contextualised based on resources available, immediate community requirements, planning periods and local expert knowledge. Although there will be residual damage even after implementing selected options, we argue that, climate response will be most likely to be accepted when it also supports pressing needs.

As actors interact to pursue their individual or collective interests, these struggles turn into dynamic power interplay. In this article, we aim to show how power interplay shapes local adaptation plans of action (LAPAs) in Nepal to be short-term and reactive. We use an interactional framing approach through interaction analyses and observations to analyse how actors use material and ideational resources to pursue their interests. Material and ideational resources that an actor deploys include political authority, knowledge of adaptation science and national/local policy-making processes, financial resources and strong relations with international non-governmental organizations and donor agencies. We find that facilitators and local politicians have a very prominent role in meetings relating to LAPAs, resulting in short-termism of LAPAs. Findings suggest that there is also a lack of female participation contributing to short-term orientated plans. We conclude that such power interplay analysis can help to investigate how decision making on the temporal aspects of climate adaptation policy takes place at the local level.","[Vij, Sumit; Biesbroek, Robbert; Termeer, Katrien] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Groot, Annemarie] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Environm Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Parajuli, Binod Prasad] Tribhuvan Univ, CDES, Kathmandu, Nepal",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Tribhuvan University,"Vij, S (corresponding author), Room 2041,Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",sumit.vij@wur.nl,"Biesbroek, Robbert/ABE-3686-2021; Vij, Sumit/AAV-6617-2021; Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419",International Development Research Centre [107641],International Development Research Centre,This work was supported by International Development Research Centre [grant no. 107641].,,59,17,17,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Remote sensing provides the most effective and efficient means to map AGC(seagrass). This research aimed to assess the accuracy of multispectral images to map AGC in seagrass meadows with different characteristics. Kemujan Island in Indonesia was selected to represent patchy beds with relatively low seagrass percent cover and low water clarity, whereas Labuan Bajo of Indonesia served an example of continuous beds with a relatively high percent cover and water clarity. WorldView-2 is a high-spatial-resolution multispectral image with six visible bands, by which water can be penetrated. Several image processing techniques, including sunglint and water column correction, principal component analysis, and co-occurrence texture analysis, were applied to the atmospherically corrected WorldView-2 images. These datasets were used as inputs in the AGC empirical model using seven regression algorithms, namely, single-band linear regression, band-ratio linear regression, stepwise regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, extreme gradient boosting, and multivariate adaptive regression spline. Seagrass field data collected using photo quadrat technique were used to train the regression model and assess the accuracy of the resulting AGC(seagrass) maps. The results indicated that WorldView-2 can be used to map AGC in different seagrass meadows with a consistent accuracy. The most accurate AGC(seagrass) map for Kemujan Island had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.11 g C m(-2) for the aboveground stock in the range of 0-28.70 g C m(-2), and for Labuan Bajo, the RMSE of the map was 9.73 g C m(-2), with aboveground stock range of 0.31-64.38 g C m(-2). Model cross-validation revealed that the mapping model can be site-specific or robust depending on the characteristics of the field-derived AGC(seagrass) data used to train the regression algorithm. For example, the model developed for Labuan Bajo seagrasses, which had a higher AGC variance, can be successfully applied to Kemujan Island with its lower AGC variance, but not vice versa. This finding is a key factor in the future development of a robust AGC(seagrass) mapping model that is applicable to various seagrass meadows as a stepping stone to accelerating the filling of gaps in the global seagrass dataset.","[Wicaksono, Pramaditya; Arjasakusuma, Sanjiwana] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Geog, Dept Geog Informat Sci, Sleman, Indonesia; [Maishella, Amanda; Harahap, Setiawan Djody] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Geog, Blue Carbon Res Grp, Sleman, Indonesia; [Lazuardi, Wahyu] Geospatial Informat Agcy, Bogor, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University; Gadjah Mada University,"Wicaksono, P (corresponding author), Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Geog, Dept Geog Informat Sci, Sleman, Indonesia.",prama.wicaksono@ugm.ac.id,"Wicaksono, Pramaditya/ACO-7692-2022","Wicaksono, Pramaditya/0000-0001-5797-0284","Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia via the World-Class Research grant [4485/UN1/DITLIT/DITLIT/PT/2021]","Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia via the World-Class Research grant","This work was funded by The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia via the World-Class Research grant, with Contract No. 4485/UN1/DITLIT/DITLIT/PT/2021.",,100,1,1,4,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-1161,1366-5901,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.

J,"Nijhuis, S",,,,"Nijhuis, Steffen",,,FUTURE-PROOFING ESTATE LANDSCAPES A REGIONAL DESIGN APPROACH FOR HISTORICAL COUNTRY ESTATES IN A LANDSCAPE CONTEXT,BULLETIN KNOB,,,Dutch,Article,,,,,,,,"Climate change and urbanization have substantial ramifications for the management and protection of cultural-historical landscapes. This is especially true for historical estate landscapes - landscapes whose character is defined by several historical castles, country houses (along with their gardens and parks), and landed estates - where climate change adaptation constitutes a major task. Issues of concern include an excess or shortage of water and changes to vegetation as a result of rising temperatures. That pressure is compounded by increasing urbanization and the associated recreational needs. These landscapes are also susceptible to spatial fragmentation due to urbanization, changes in ownership, changes in function, and so on. Combatting these pressures calls for a future-oriented design approach that deals sensitively with historically valuable landscape characteristics. It involves safeguarding the spatial quality of estate landscapes by striking a new balance between utility value (economic exploitation), amenity value (identity and familiarity), and future value (ecological sustainability). Such is the complexity of the task that a regional perspective is required in order to fully comprehend the cohesion and systemic relations between individual country estates and to develop a common basis for collaboration. This article proposes a landscape-based regional design approach aimed at understanding and designing future-proof estate landscapes. It details a preservation-through-development strategy based on spatial development in sympathy with historical landscapes structures in a process of meaningful stakeholder involvement. Key to this process is collaboration and co-creation with owners, experts, policy advisers and others. Design-based research is employed as a method for addressing the complex spatial tasks facing estate landscapes in an integrated and creative manner. Spatial design, at every level of scale, becomes an instrument for working out development strategies and principles for context-specific landscape formation. But also for highlighting possible solutions that can contribute to the protection and development of historical estate landscapes. In other words, this is not about opposing change or locking up the existing landscape, but about creating new landscape qualities through well-designed new developments. This coincides with a collaborative process in which stakeholders jointly weigh the pros and cons, learn and come up with solutions. The combination of substance, involvement and process makes the landscape-based regional design approach a powerful method for increasing the resilience and adaptability of the estate landscape and in so doing making this landscape future-proof.","[Nijhuis, Steffen] Techn Univ Delft, Fac Bouwkunde, Afdeling Urbanism, Delft, Netherlands; [Nijhuis, Steffen] Techn Univ Delft, Fac Bouwkunde, Landschapsarchitectuur, Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology,"Nijhuis, S (corresponding author), Techn Univ Delft, Fac Bouwkunde, Afdeling Urbanism, Delft, Netherlands.;Nijhuis, S (corresponding author), Techn Univ Delft, Fac Bouwkunde, Landschapsarchitectuur, Delft, Netherlands.",s.nijhuis@tudelft.nl,,,,,,,41,0,0,2,3,KONINKLIJKE NEDERLANDSE OUDHEIDKUNDIGE BOND-KNOB,DEFT,"POSTBUS 5043, DEFT, 2600 GA, NETHERLANDS",0166-0470,2589-3343,,BULL KNOB,Bull.

Grasslands are considered as natural resources supporting primarily for food production in the past but increasingly for human wellbeing now. The utilization efficiency and productivity of the grassland resources are strongly dependent upon grassland management practices such as grazing and cutting, forage production, vegetation stability, to name a few. The implication, scope, and significance of grassland resources continuously expand with increasing awareness and improved management of human on grassland values. Traditionally, grasslands are used as the important means of production and livelihood for human beings because they can provide sustainable livestock products (such as meat, milk, and wool) and ecological services (such as carbon storage and biodiversity conservation). At present, grasslands are often referred to as a living capital, and such capital benefit of grasslands is determined by grassland characteristics, management mode, and governance, and thereby grassland management is a central issue for grassland ecosystem sustainability. The traditional grassland management is mainly based on control of livestock carrying capacity or stocking rate, aiming at increasing animal and plant productivity. However, it is considerably difficult to determine a realistically achievable carrying capacity, given that natural grasslands are heterogeneous in vegetation and temporal primary production as a result of environmental fluctuations. As the impacts of environmental changes and human activities increase, it is necessary to carry out targeted grassland management (such as climate change adaptation, biodiversity loss, degradation). Adaptive grassland management emphasizes the maintenance of grassland systematical productivity and ecological sustainability by ensuring livestock-vegetation balance. That is, the practice of grassland management should conform to the complexity of frequent climatic stresses and intensively human disturbance. When social demand for grassland products and ecological services continues to increase, adaptive management strategy should transition towards multi-functional management strategy. The core of multi-functional management is to exert synergistic effects on the functions and services of grassland ecosystems. Such management involves vegetation, soil, livestock, environment, economy, and society. Only by optimizing and coupling the structure, process, and function of grassland ecosystem and applying auxiliary energy input and artificial regulation can the multi-functional management be accomplished. The development of grassland management practices needs not only strong multidisciplinary theoretical support but also robust technical foundation.","[Wang, Deli; Wang, Ling] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China,"Wang, DL (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China.",wangd@nenu.edu.cn,,,,,,,28,10,24,7,43,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",0023-074X,2095-9419,,CHIN SCI B-CHIN,Chin.

Methods: For the first time, a cluster of four eddy covariance towers were set up to answer how C fluxes shift among four dominant ecosystems in Mongolia - meadow steppe (MDW), typical steppe (TPL), dry typical steppe (DRT) and shrubland (SHB) during two growing seasons (2014 and 2015). Results: Large variations were observed for the annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from 59 to 193 g C m(-2), though all four sites acted as a C source. During the two growing seasons, MDW acted as a C sink, TPL and DRT were C neutral, while SHB acted as a C source. MDW to SHB and TPL conversions resulted in a 2.6- and 2.2-fold increase in C release, respectively, whereas the TPL to SHB conversion resulted in a 1.1-fold increase at the annual scale. C assimilation was higher at MDW than those at the other three ecosystems due to its greater C assimilation ability and longer C assimilation times during the day and growing period. On the other hand, C release was highest at SHB due to significantly lower photosynthetic production and relatively higher ecosystem respiration (ER). A stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the seasonal variations in NEE, ER and gross ecosystem production (GEP) were controlled by air temperature at MDW, while they were controlled mainly by soil moisture at TPL, DRT and SHB. When air temperature increased, the NEE at MDW and TPL changed more dramatically than at DRT and SHB, suggesting not only a stronger C release ability but also a higher temperature sensitivity at MDW and TPL. Conclusions: The ongoing and predicted global changes in Mongolia likely impact the C exchange at MDW and TPL more than at DRT and SHB in Mongolia. Our results suggest that, with increasing drought and vegetation type succession, a clear trend for greater CO2 emissions may result in further global warming in the future. This study implies that diverse grassland ecosystems will respond differently to climate change in the future and can be seen as nature-based solutions (NBS) supporting climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.","[Shao, Changliang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jiquan; Lafortezza, Raffaele; Abraha, Michael; John, Ranjeet; Ouyang, Zutao; Qi, Jiaguo] Michigan State Univ, CGCEO, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; [Chu, Housen] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lafortezza, Raffaele] Univ Bari, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Dong, Gang] Shanxi Univ, Sch Life Sci, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Batkhishig, Ochirbat] Mongolian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Ulaanbarrtar 210620, Mongolia; [Zhang, Yaoqi] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36949 USA","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Michigan State University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Shanxi University; Mongolian Academy of Sciences; Auburn University System; Auburn University","Chen, JQ (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, CGCEO, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA.",jqchen@msu.edu,"shao, changliang/ACG-3396-2022; Lafortezza, Raffaele/G-2104-2018; John, Ranjeet/Z-1070-2019; Qi, Jiaguo/AAC-4106-2020; Chu, Housen/Q-6517-2016; Chen, Jiquan/D-1955-2009; Ochirbat, Batkhishig/G-2029-2014","Lafortezza, Raffaele/0000-0003-4642-8435; John, Ranjeet/0000-0002-0150-8450; Chu, Housen/0000-0002-8131-4938; Ochirbat, Batkhishig/0000-0001-6012-0395; Chen, Jiquan/0000-0003-0761-9458",LCLUC of NASA [NNX15AD10G]; NSF [1313761]; USCCC,LCLUC of NASA; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USCCC,"This study was supported by the LCLUC program of NASA (NNX15AD10G), the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program of the NSF (#1313761), and the USCCC.

Greening city roofs is part of these strategies. In this context, the GREENROOF module for TEB (town energy balance) has been developed to model the interactions between buildings and green roof systems at the scale of the city. This module, which combines the ISBA model (Interaction between Soil Biosphere and Atmosphere) and TEB, allows for one to describe an extensive green roof composed of four functional layers (vegetation - grasses or sedums; substrate; retention/drainage layers; and artificial roof layers) and to model vegetation-atmosphere fluxes of heat, water and momentum, as well as the hydrological fluxes throughout the substrate and the drainage layers, and the thermal fluxes throughout the natural and artificial layers of the green roof. TEB-GREENROOF (SURFEX v7.3) should therefore be able to represent the impact of climate forcings on the functioning of green roof vegetation and, conversely, the influence of the green roof on the local climate. An evaluation of GREENROOF is performed for a case study located in Nancy (France) which consists of an instrumented extensive green roof with sedums and substrate and drainage layers that are typical of this kind of construction. After calibration of the drainage layer hydrological characteristics, model results show good dynamics for the substrate water content and the drainage at the green roof base, with nevertheless a tendency to underestimate the water content and overestimate the drainage. This does not impact too much the green roof temperatures, which present a good agreement with observations. Nonetheless GREENROOF tends to overestimate the soil temperatures and their amplitudes, but this effect is less important in the drainage layer. These results are encouraging with regard to modelling the impact of green roofs on thermal indoor comfort and energy consumption at the scale of cities, for which GREENROOF will be running with the building energy version of TEB - TEB-BEM. Moreover, with the green roof studied for GREENROOF evaluation being a type of extensive green roof widespread in cities, the type of hydrological characteristics highlighted for the case study will be used as the standard configuration to model extensive green roof impacts at the scale of cities.","[de Munck, C.

While inheriting the characteristics of Chinese traditional building, combined with its unique geographical and climatic environmental conditions, the local residential buildings have unique architectural features of cold climate adaptability. Outstanding insulation technology has become the main feature of the area, and has greatly affected the development of modern vernacular architecture. According to the archaeological reports and documents, this article selects ancient architectural sites from different historical periods as the research objects. Based on building restoration, AIRPAK software is used to simulate and analyze the indoor temperature of the building site, and to explore the effects of active heating measures, such as different forms of fire hypocaust system, and passive cold protection measures, such as different types of wall structures. According to archaeological information and simulation data, this paper summarizes the characteristics of the cold climate adaptability technology of ancient buildings in China's cold border areas over different historical periods. Because of the relatively lagging development background of the Amur River Basin in modern times, the construction of its vernacular buildings continued to use the traditional low-tech insulation technology of ancient buildings to adapt to the cold environment. Therefore, attention and research on insulation technology of ancient buildings can provide a new perspective of architectural heritage protection in cold regions. Establishing a development model that combines archaeology and cultural heritage protection is an effective way to achieve the goals of architectural cultural heritage research and protection.","[Liu, Wenqing] Shantou Univ, Coll Engn, Shantou 515063, Peoples R China",Shantou University,"Liu, WQ (corresponding author), Shantou Univ, Coll Engn, Shantou 515063, Peoples R China.",wqliu@stu.edu.cn,,"wenqing, Liu/0000-0002-9757-9172","Social Science Planning Office of Guangdong Province China [GD21YDXZSH01]; Foundation of Scientific Research of The Shantou University [NTF21028, 470-0441182121]; Foundation of Leading Virtual Simulation Experiment of the Shantou University [140-18122714]; Foundation of Shude Academy of The Shantou University [003-770006]; Social Science Planning Office of Shantou [ST22YB12]",Social Science Planning Office of Guangdong Province China; Foundation of Scientific Research of The Shantou University; Foundation of Leading Virtual Simulation Experiment of the Shantou University; Foundation of Shude Academy of The Shantou University; Social Science Planning Office of Shantou,"This research was funded by Social Science Planning Office of Guangdong Province China [No. GD21YDXZSH01]; Foundation of Scientific Research of The Shantou University [No. NTF21028, 470-0441182121]; Foundation of Leading Virtual Simulation Experiment of the Shantou University [No. 140-18122714]; Foundation of Shude Academy of The Shantou University [No. 003-770006]; Social Science Planning Office of Shantou [No. ST22YB12].",,45,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Although resident microbial communities perform crucial biogeochemical cycles for salt marsh functioning, their response to restoration practices is still understudied. One promising restoration strategy is the placement of sand or sediment onto the marsh platform to increase marsh resiliency. A previous study examined the above- and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in Spartina alterniflora-vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments at varying inundation regimes. Here, we analyzed samples from the same experiment to test the effect of sand-amendments on the microbial communities after 5 months. Along with the previously observed changes in biogeochemistry, sand amendments drastically modified the bacterial communities, decreasing richness and diversity. The dominant sulfur-cycling bacterial community found in natural sediments was replaced by one dominated by iron oxidizers and aerobic heterotrophs, the abundance of which correlated with higher CO2-flux. In particular, the relative abundance of iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria increased in the sand-amended sediments, possibly contributing to acidification by the formation of iron oxyhydroxides. Our data suggest that the bacterial community structure can equilibrate if the inundation regime is maintained within the optimal range for S. alterniflora. While long-term effects of changes in bacterial community on the growth of S. alterniflora are not clear, our results suggest that analyzing the microbial community composition could be a useful tool to monitor climate adaptation and restoration efforts.","[Thomas, Francois; Sievert, Stefan M.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Thomas, Francois] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Integrat Biol Marine Models LBI2M, SBR, Roscoff, France; [Morris, James T.] Univ South Carolina, Belle Baruch Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Wigand, Cathleen] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Atlantic Ecol Div, Narragansett, RI USA",Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Thomas, F; Sievert, SM (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.;Thomas, F (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Integrat Biol Marine Models LBI2M, SBR, Roscoff, France.",fthomas@sb-roscoff.fr; ssievert@whoi.edu,"morris, james/ABC-8111-2020; morris, james/AAQ-5605-2020","morris, james/0000-0002-0511-642X; Thomas, Francois/0000-0003-1896-0774; Sievert, Stefan/0000-0002-9541-2707","NSF [DEB-1050557, OCE-1637630]; WHOI Investment in Science Funds",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); WHOI Investment in Science Funds,"This work was supported by NSF grants DEB-1050557 (SMS) and OCE-1637630 (JM), and WHOI Investment in Science Funds (SMS).

Understanding of climate change impacts can be gained from observational and reconstruction approaches and from numerical models that apply existing knowledge to climate change scenarios. Although modeling approaches are prominent in climate change assessments, observations and reconstructions provide insights that cannot be derived from simulations alone, especially at local to regional scales where climate adaptation policies are implemented. Here, we review the wealth of understanding that emerged from observations and reconstructions of ongoing and past climate change impacts in Switzerland, with wider applicability in Europe. We draw examples from hydrological, alpine, forest, and agricultural systems, which are of paramount societal importance, and are projected to undergo important changes by the end of this century. For each system, we review existing model-based projections, present what is known from observations, and discuss how empirical evidence may help improve future projections. A particular focus is given to better understanding thresholds, tipping points and feedbacks that may operate on different time scales. Observational approaches provide the grounding in evidence that is needed to develop local to regional climate adaptation strategies. Our review demonstrates that observational approaches should ideally have a synergistic relationship with modeling in identifying inconsistencies in projections as well as avenues for improvement. They are critical for uncovering unexpected relationships between climate and agricultural, natural, and hydrological systems that will be important to society in the future.","[Henne, Paul D.] US Geol Survey, Geosci & Environm Change Sci Ctr, Denver Fed Ctr, POB 25046,MS 980, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Henne, Paul D.; Colombaroli, Daniele; Feller, Urs; Heiri, Oliver; Tinner, Willy] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Henne, Paul D.; Colombaroli, Daniele; Feller, Urs; Frank, David; Fuhrer, Jurg; Grosjean, Martin; Heiri, Oliver; Rossler, Ole; Rohr, Christian; Rutishauser, This; Schwikowski, Margit; Stampfli, Andreas; Szidat, Sonke; Weingartner, Rolf; Tinner, Willy] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Bigalke, Moritz; Grosjean, Martin; Mestrot, Adrien; Rossler, Ole; Rutishauser, This; Weingartner, Rolf; Wilcke, Wolfgang] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland; [Buntgen, Ulf] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge, England; [Buntgen, Ulf; Frank, David; Rigling, Andreas] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Buntgen, Ulf] Global Change Res Ctr, Brno, Czech Republic; [Buntgen, Ulf] Masaryk Univ, Brno, Czech Republic; [Conedera, Marco] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Insubr Ecosyst Res Grp, Cadenazzo, Switzerland; [Fuhrer, Jurg] Agroscope, Climate & Air Pollut Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Luterbacher, Juerg] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog Climatol Climate Dynam & Climate Change, Giessen, Germany; [Luterbacher, Juerg] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res, Giessen, Germany; [Rohr, Christian] Univ Bern, Hist Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Rutishauser, This] Swiss Acad Arts & Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Schwikowski, Margit] Paul Scherrer Inst, Villigen, Switzerland; [Stampfli, Andreas] Bern Univ Appl Sci, Sch Agr Forest & Food Sci, Zollikofen, Switzerland; [Szidat, Sonke] Univ Bern, Dept Chem & Biochem, Bern, Switzerland; [Theurillat, Jean-Paul] Univ Geneva, Ctr Alpien Phytogeog Fdn JM Aubert, Geneva, Switzerland; [Theurillat, Jean-Paul] Univ Geneva, Biol Sect, Geneva, Switzerland; [Wilcke, Wolfgang] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Karlsruhe, Germany","United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Cambridge; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Masaryk University Brno; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Justus Liebig University Giessen; Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Bern; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; University of Bern; University of Geneva; University of Geneva; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","Henne, PD (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Geosci & Environm Change Sci Ctr, Denver Fed Ctr, POB 25046,MS 980, Denver, CO 80225 USA.;Henne, PD (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Bern, Switzerland.;Henne, PD (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland.",phenne@usgs.gov,"Stampfli, Andreas/ABC-7644-2021; Bigalke, Moritz/M-6089-2013; Henne, Paul D/B-1748-2010; Heiri, Oliver/A-2403-2008; Rigling, Andreas/B-9665-2013; Col, Dan/A-2851-2009; Feller, Urs/A-1807-2008; Theurillat, Jean-Paul/AAS-4676-2021; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013; Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013; Wilcke, Wolfgang/P-4620-2016; Rössler, Ole K/C-7488-2009; Frank, David/C-7764-2013; Szidat, Sönke/D-6706-2011; Mestrot, Adrien/C-1713-2018","Stampfli, Andreas/0000-0002-5517-1363; Bigalke, Moritz/0000-0002-6793-6159; Henne, Paul D/0000-0003-1211-5545; Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Rigling, Andreas/0000-0003-1944-4042; Col, Dan/0000-0002-9632-2009; Feller, Urs/0000-0001-7858-5721; Theurillat, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-1843-5809; Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144; Wilcke, Wolfgang/0000-0002-6031-4613; Rössler, Ole K/0000-0003-2308-0907; Szidat, Sönke/0000-0002-1824-6207; Schwikowski, Margit/0000-0002-0856-5183; Frank, David/0000-0001-5463-5640; Mestrot, Adrien/0000-0002-4387-3886; Luterbacher, Juerg/0000-0002-8569-0973","Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, Work Package 3, Climate Risks and Natural Hazards","Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, Work Package 3, Climate Risks and Natural Hazards","This paper arose from workshops sponsored by the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, Work Package 3, Climate Risks and Natural Hazards.

This paper focuses on opportunities for climate assessments to be used more effectively to enhance adaptive capacity, particularly drawing from experiences with the third US National Climate Assessment (NCA3). We discuss the evolution of thinking about adaptation as a process and the importance of societal values, as well as the role of assessments in this evolution. We provide a rationale for prioritizing future assessment activities, with an expectation of moving beyond the concept of climate adaptation as an explicit and separable activity from normal planning and implementation in the future. Starting with the values and resources that need to be protected or developed by communities rather than starting with an analysis of changes in climate drivers can provide opportunities for reframing climate issues in ways that are likely to result in more positive outcomes. A critical part of successful risk management is monitoring and evaluating the systems of interest to decision-makers and the effectiveness of interventions following integration of climate considerations into ongoing strategic planning activities and implementation. Increasingly this will require consideration of path dependency and coincident events. We argue that climate adaptation is a transitional process that bridges the gap between historically time-tested ways of doing business and the kinds of decision processes that may be required in the future, and that scientific assessments will be increasingly central to these transitions in decision processes over time.","[Howden, Mark] CSIRO Agr, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Jacobs, Katharine L.] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Arizona,"Howden, M (corresponding author), CSIRO Agr, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",mark.howden@csiro.au; jacobsk@email.arizona.edu,"Howden, Stuart M/C-1138-2008","Howden, Stuart M/0000-0002-0386-9671; Jacobs, Katharine/0000-0002-4427-9045",,,,,51,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

J,"Avordeh, TK; Gyamfi, S; Opoku, AA",,,,"Avordeh, Timothy King; Gyamfi, Samuel; Opoku, Alex Akwasi",,,"Quantitative estimation of the impact of climate change on residential electricity demand for the city of Greater Accra, Ghana",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Residential; Energy sector; Time series analysis; Regression; Least square estimation; Correlation analysis; Demand forecasting; Simulation; Electricity; Demand-side management; Electricity consumption; Temperature; Heating and cooling period; Climate change; Ghana,REGIONAL ENERGY DEMAND; POTENTIAL IMPACT; CONSUMPTION; TEMPERATURE; ADAPTATION; METHODOLOGY; REASONS; PANEL,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of temperature on residential electricity demand in the city of Greater Accra, Ghana. It is believed that the increasing trend of temperatures may significantly affect people's lives and demand for electricity from the national grid. Given the recurrent electricity crisis in Ghana, this study will investigate both the current and future residential energy demands in the light of temperature fluctuations. This will inform future power generation using renewable energy resources mix to find a sustainable solution to the recurrent energy demand challenges in Ghana. This study will help the Government of Ghana to better understand the temperature dependence of residential energy demand, which in turn will help in developing behavioral modification programs aimed at reducing energy consumption. Monthly data for the temperature and residential electricity consumption for Greater Accra Region from January 2007 to December 2018 obtained from the Ghana Meteorological Service (GMS) and Ghana Grid Company (Gridco), respectively, are used for the analysis. Design/methodology/approach This study used monthly time series data from 2007 to 2018. Data on monthly electricity demand and temperature are obtained from the Ghana Grid Company and GMS. The theoretical framework for residential electricity consumption, the log-linear demand equation and time series regression approaches was used for this study. To demonstrate certain desirable properties and to produce good estimators in this study, an analysis technique of ordinary least squares measurement was also applied. Findings This study showed an impact on residential electricity requirements in the selected regions of Greater Accra owing to temperature change. The analysis suggests a substantial positive response to an increase in temperature demand for residential electricity and thus indicates a growth of the region's demand for electricity in the future because of temperature changes. As this analysis projects, the growth in the electricity demand seems too small for concern, perhaps because of the incoherence of the mechanisms used to regulate the temperature by the residents. However, two points should be considered when drawing any conclusions even in the case of Greater Accra alone. First, the growth in the demand for electricity shown in the present study is the growth of demand due only to increasing temperatures that do not consider changes in all the other factors driving the growth of demand. The electricity demand will in the future increase beyond what is induced by temperature, due to increasing demand, population and mechanization and other socioeconomic factors. Second, power consumption understated genuine electricity demand, owing to the massive shedding of loads (Dumsor) which occurred in Ghana from 2012 to 2015 in the analysis period that also applies in the Greater Accra region. Given both of these factors, the growth in demand for electricity is set to increase in response to climate change, which draws on the authorities to prepare more critically on capacity building which loads balancing. The results also revealed that monthly total residential electricity consumption, particularly the monthly peak electricity consumption in the city of Accra is highly sensitive to temperature. Therefore, the rise in temperature under different climate change scenarios would have a high impact on residential electricity consumption. This study reveals that the monthly total residential electricity demand in Greater Accra will increase by up to 3.1%. Research limitations/implications The research data was largely restricted to only one region in Ghana because of the inconsistencies in the data from the other regions. The only climate variable use was temperature because it was proven in the literature that it was the most dominant variable that affects electricity demand, so it was not out of place to use only this variable. The research, however, can be extended to capture the entire regions of the country if sponsorship and accurate data can be obtained. Practical implications The government as the policy and law-making authority has to play the most influential role to ensure adaptation at all levels toward the impact of climate change for residential consumers. It is the main responsibility of the government to arrange enough supports to help residential consumers adapt to climate change and try to make consumers self-sufficient by modification of certain behaviors rather than supply dependent. Government bodies need to carefully define their climate adaptation supports and incentive programs to influence residential-level consumption practices and demand management. Here, energy policies and investments need to be more strategic. The most critical problem is to identify the appropriate adaptation policies that favor the most vulnerable sectors such as the residential sector. Social implications To evaluate both mitigation and adaptation policies, it is important to estimate the effect of climate change on energy usage around the world. Existing empirical figures, however, are concentrated in Western nations, especially the USA. To predict how electricity usage will shift in the city of Greater Accra, Ghana, the authors used regular household electricity consumption data. Originality/value The motivation for this paper and in particular the empirical analysis for Ghana is originality for the literature. This paper demonstrates an adequate understanding of the relevant literature in modern times.","[Avordeh, Timothy King] Univ Profess Studies, Dept Banking & Finance, Accra, Ghana; [Gyamfi, Samuel] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Energy & Environm Engn, Sunyani, Ghana; [Opoku, Alex Akwasi] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Math & Stat, Sunyani, Ghana",,"Avordeh, TK (corresponding author), Univ Profess Studies, Dept Banking & Finance, Accra, Ghana.",researchmethods2018@gmail.com,,,,,,,60,2,2,3,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1750-6220,1750-6239,,INT J ENERGY SECT MA,Int.

A mixed-method approach was employed, consisting of a survey of 400 fisherfolk households and 20 interviews with stakeholders. Changes in rainfall pattern, decreasing rainfall, stronger waves and storms that increase coastal erosion and cause persistent flooding were found to be the main effects of climate change on the livelihoods of small-scale coastal fisherfolk. Transnational fishing practices by fisherfolk in response to climate change contributed to the building of resilience of fishing households, while other adaptation strategies appeared to be insufficient in the long run. Coastal communities are not homogenous with respect to climate change impacts and corresponding adaptation strategies.

All parts of the urban water cycle are managed together instead of separately. IUWM can be part of the solution for cities facing singular or multiple water management stresses under present and future climates. It has particular advantages for adaptation because it can be implemented over time and space as climate and others conditions change with options preserved for future actions, it contains no-regrets and co-benefits actions, and integrates local stakeholders into the planning process. Research was conducted to qualitatively examine how IUWM can be used to manage multiple urban water stresses under present and future climates and land use conditions upon the built, natural, and social systems of Exeter, New Hampshire, a small town located in a semi-rural area of the northeastern United States. With its emphasis on holistic solutions and systems thinking, it is shown that by looking at Exeter's suite of challenges through the lens of IUWM there are opportunities for integrated strategies that may lower overall adaptation costs and also provide wide-scale multi-criteria benefits.","[Kirshen, Paul] Univ Massachusetts, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Aytur, Semra; Burdick, David; Jones, Stephen] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Hecht, Jory] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Walker, Andrew] Weston & Sampson, Portsmouth, NH 03801 USA; [Fennessey, Neil] Univ Massachusetts, Dartmouth, NS 02747, Canada; [Bourdeau, Renee] Horsley Witten Grp, Exeter, NH 03833 USA; [Mather, Lorilee] Cate St Capital, Portsmouth, NH 03801 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Vermont,"Kirshen, P (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",paul.kirshen@umb.edu,,,"US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Estuarine Research Reserve Science Collaborative, NOAA Grant [NA09NOS4190153]","US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Estuarine Research Reserve Science Collaborative, NOAA Grant","This project was funded by a grant from US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Estuarine Research Reserve Science Collaborative, NOAA Grant Number NA09NOS4190153.

Trust aims to implement a water balance modelling tool to support institutions in formulating sustainable water management planning policies and best practices. This paper reviews the development and application of the water balance model that simulates water deficit affecting summer crops using agronomic and climatic data at small spatial and temporal resolution. Remote sensing identification methods were employed to map irrigated crops. Projections on the water deficit as a function of climate change have used future precipitation and evapotranspiration patterns derived from climate simulations (SRES-IPCC scenarios A1B and A2) of the Mediterranean region for the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Model outputs showed that, due to climate change, water deficits for summer crops could be of the order of 400 mm, while the balance model showed that climate change can lead to a reduction of average groundwater resource of about 5-10%, especially in the apical areas of the high plain. However, a significant part of the future water deficit might be recovered through rationalisation of water withdrawal and managed aquifer recharge areas.","[Baruffi, Francesco; Bisaglia, Matteo; Cappelletto, Massimo; Pasini, Sara] Autorita Bacino Fiumi Alto Adriatico, Venice, Italy; [Galli, Alberto; Marsala, Vincenzo; Scarinci, Andrea; Panelli, Cristian] SGI Studio Galli Ingn, Sarmeola Di Rubano, Italy; [Gualdi, Silvio] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, CMCC, Bologna, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"Baruffi, F (corresponding author), Autorita Bacino Fiumi Alto Adriatico, Venice, Italy.",,"Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015","Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935",,,,,33,4,4,1,35,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",1741-7589,1751-7729,,P I CIVIL ENG-WAT M,Proc.

Adaptation to these impacts is increasingly being observed in both physical and ecological systems as well as in human adjustments to resource availability and risk at different spatial and societal scales. We review the nature of adaptation and the implications of different spatial scales for these processes. We outline a set of normative evaluative criteria for judging the success of adaptations at different scales. We argue that elements of effectiveness, efficiency, equity and legitimacy are important in judging success in terms of the sustainability of development pathways into an uncertain future. We further argue that each of these elements of decision-making is implicit within presently formulated scenarios of socio-economic futures of both emission trajectories and adaptation, though with different weighting.

Design/methodology/approach This work investigates experimental prototyping of a reversibly self-shaping facade, by integrating the parametric design approach, smart material and 4D-printing techniques. Thermo-responsive building skin modules of two-way shape memory composite (TWSMC) was designed and fabricated, combining the shape memory alloy fibers (SMFs) and 3D-printed shape memory polymer matrices (SMPMs). For geometry design, deformation of the TWSMC was simulated with a dimension-reduced mathematical model, and an optimal arrangement of three different types of TWSMC modules were designed and fabricated into a physical scale model. Findings Model-based experiments show robust workability and formal reversibility of the developed facade. Potential utility of this module for adaptive building design and construction is discussed based on the results. Findings help better understand the shape memory phenomena and presented design-inclusive technology will benefit architectural communities of smart climate-adaptive building. Originality/value Two-way reversibility of 4D-printed composites is a topic of active research in material science but has not been clearly addressed in the practical context of architectural design, due to technical barriers. This research is the first architectural presentation of the whole design procedure, simulation and fabrication of the 4D-printed and parametrically movable facade.","[Yi, Hwang] Ajou Univ, Architecture, Suwon, South Korea",Ajou University,"Yi, H (corresponding author), Ajou Univ, Architecture, Suwon, South Korea.",hwangyi.makes@gmail.com,,"Yi, Hwang/0000-0002-9386-2456",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) [NRF-2021R1C1C1003403]; Ajou University Research Grant [S-2021-G-0001-00016],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Ajou University Research Grant,"The author would like to give special thanks to all the contributors, especially Ms. Yuri Kim and the Makerspace consulting and support team in Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea.

However, simply providing decision makers with higher-resolution climate information will not ensure successful adaptation. In order for there to be appropriate information uptake and use, it is essential to understand the political constraints and conditions under which decision makers operate. A detailed examination of the current regulatory context in relation to climate and weather impacts can provide insight into the barriers and obstacles affecting decision makers in adaptation endeavors. This study examines the experiences of the municipalities of Tompkins County, New York, as they attempt to manage stormwater in compliance with federally mandated regulations. The current policies fail to adequately address the fundamental problems affecting local government in New York: fragmented jurisdiction, interagency communication, inability to cope with unfunded mandates, enforcement, and the promotion of informed decision making. The way forward may be the adaptive governance approach for the management of complex environmental issues.

The paper begins with a review of the science regarding sockeye salmon and climate change. It discusses harvest patterns, and how the timing of runs has changed. A survey was conducted by the first author regarding St'at'imc traditional fishing at a historic site on the Fraser River, in 2005. The results show that the impacts of climate change are apparent to those conducting traditional fishing practices, in terms of changed timing and abundance of salmon runs. These perceptions fit closely with the information available from scientists and management agencies. These changes are highly problematic for the St'at'imc, in that the preservation method (drying) is tied to seasonal weather patterns. The whole cultural setting, and the relevance of salmon for subsistence would be highly altered by climate change that leads to changes in the timing and abundance of sockeye salmon.

However, climate change and urbanisation take place simultaneously with intertwined impacts. To analyse their relative contribution to the heat load of Zagreb, a modelling approach is applied to two land-use/land-cover (LULC) situations and corresponding climate conditions. The results indicate that the change in total heat load is dominantly affected by climate change (-88%) with an average increase in the summer days for 35 days. LULC alterations have a weaker impact (-12%), but they strongly affect heat load spatial variability. The sign of LULC related heat load change de-pends on the type of the change (e.g. an increase is detected in areas that have turned from green into built-up classes). Generally, LULC effect is limited to the area with the modification, however it can spread to adjacent areas due to the processes like advection and evapotranspiration. In areas with considerable LULC alterations, their impact on the heat load is comparable to that of climate change. These results highlight the potential of change in the city infrastructure for climate adaptation, as well as emphasise the importance of considering future climate conditions when assessing efficiency of climate adaptation measures.","[Nimac, Irena] Meteorol & Hydrol Serv Croatia, Zagreb, Croatia; [Nimac, Irena] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Klima & Globalen Wandel, Graz, Austria; [Herceg-Bulic, Ivana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Geophys, Zagreb, Croatia; [Zuvela-Aloise, Maja] Zentralanstalt Meteorol & Geodynam, Vienna, Austria",University of Graz; University of Zagreb,"Herceg-Bulic, I (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Geophys, Zagreb, Croatia.",ivana.herceg.bulic@gfz.hr,,,Croatian Science Foundation;  [UIP-2017-05-6396],Croatian Science Foundation; ,"Funding This research has been fully supported by Croatian Science Foundation under the project UIP-2017-05-6396 (CroClimGoGreen) .

However, the rate of SLWM adoption remains low, suggesting a gap between generalized SLWM advantages for rural development across the literature, and the existence of context-dependent barriers to its effective implementation. Uganda is an example of this paradox: the SLWM adoption rate is low despite favorable ecological conditions for agriculture development and a large rural population. A systemic understanding of the barriers hindering the adoption of SLWM is therefore crucial to developing coherent policy interventions and enabling effective funding strategies. Here, we propose a cross-scale archetype approach to identify and link barriers to SLWM adoption in Uganda. We performed 80 interviews across the country to build cognitive archetypes, harvesting stakeholders' perceptions of different types of barriers. We complemented this bottom-up perspective with a spatial archetype analysis to contextualize these results across different social-ecological regions. We found poverty trap, overpopulation, risk aversion, remoteness, and post-conflict patriarchal systems as cognitive archetypes that synthesize the different dynamics of barriers to SLWM adoption in Uganda. Our results reveal both specific and cross-cutting barriers.

We carried out a systematic review to synthesize evidence regarding the effects of environmental factors associated with climate change and management conditions associated with climate adaptation on the crop quality of a culturally-relevant perennial crop, coffee (Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora). Seventy-three articles were identified that addressed the study's research question including 42 articles on environmental factors, 20 articles on management conditions, and 11 articles on both. While variation was found between studies, findings highlight that coffee quality is vulnerable to changes in light exposure, altitude, water stress, temperature, carbon dioxide, and nutrient management. Both increases as well as decreases were found in secondary metabolites and sensory attributes that determine coffee quality in response to shifts in environmental and management conditions. The most consistent evidence identified through this systematic review includes the following two trends: (1) increased altitude is associated with improved sensory attributes of coffee and; (2) increased light exposure is associated with decreased sensory attributes of coffee. Research gaps were found regarding the effects of shifts in carbon dioxide, water stress, and temperature on the directionality (increase, decrease, or non-linear) of coffee quality and how this varies with location, elevation, and management conditions. This systematic review further identified the following research needs: (1) long-term studies that examine the interactive effects of multiple environmental factors and management conditions on coffee quality; (2) studies that examine the interaction between sensory attributes and secondary metabolites that determine coffee quality and; (3) studies on the feasibility of various climate-adaptation strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change on coffee quality. Evidence-based innovations are needed to mitigate climate impacts on coffee quality toward enhanced sustainability and resilience of the coffee sector from farm to cup.","[Ahmed, Selena; Smith, Erin; Warne, Teresa] Montana State Univ, Dept Hlth & Human Dev, Food & Hlth Lab, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Brinkley, Sarah] Texas A&M Univ, Ctr Coffee Res & Educ, Dept Hort Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Sela, Ariella; Theisen, Mitchell; Thibodeau, Cyrena; Cash, Sean B.] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Boston, MA USA; [Anderson, Evan] Essys Coffee, Bozeman, MT USA; [Van Dusen, Natalie] Treeline Coffee Roasters, Bozeman, MT USA; [Giuliano, Peter; Ionescu, Kim Elena] Specialty Coffee Assoc, Santa Ana, CA USA; [Giuliano, Peter] Coffee Sci Fdn, Santa Ana, CA USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Tufts University,"Ahmed, S (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Hlth & Human Dev, Food & Hlth Lab, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",selena.ahmed@montana.edu,,"Brinkley, Sarah/0000-0002-0995-0278","United States National Science Foundation - Award NSF RII Track-2 [FEC 1632810]; Tufts University [2019-N302201]; United States National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [P20GM103473, 5P20GM104417]",United States National Science Foundation - Award NSF RII Track-2(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Tufts University; United States National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health,"The authors received funding support for the study presented here from the following agencies: (1) United States National Science Foundation - Award NSF RII Track-2 FEC 1632810 (SA), (2) Tufts University, Tufts Collaborates Award 2019-N302201 (SC), (3) United States National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health-Awards P20GM103473 (SA), and Award 5P20GM104417 (SA).",,125,12,12,16,35,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

This necessitates adaptation actions to mitigate potential losses. Based on farm household survey data collected from three Chinese mountain villages, the study examines farmers' adaptation measures in response to drought and factors driving motivations to adapt. The results show that climate risk perceptions and households' assessment of their own abilities to adapt are important determinants of proactive adaptation decisions, with the latter found a better predictor than the former. The influences of village context and farm income are also significant. By drawing attention to the vital roles of human cognition to stimulate adaptation responses, the study emphasizes the need for greater efforts to raise risk awareness and, more importantly, to equip households with a feeling of perceived capacity to adapt. This can be done by providing additional information on risk-reducing measures and how to implement them as well as to make them affordable. Adaptation can also be improved by continuing investment in developing agriculture and rural livelihoods, such as policy interventions that enhance farm income.","[Zheng, Yuan; Dallimer, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Dallimer, Martin] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Copenhagen; University of Leeds,"Zheng, Y (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",yuanzheng@ifro.ku.dk,"Dallimer, Martin/I-1547-2019","Dallimer, Martin/0000-0001-8120-3309",European Commission Framework Programme 7 Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship [273547]; Danish National Research Foundation,European Commission Framework Programme 7 Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"Martin Dallimer was supported by a European Commission Framework Programme 7 Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship [No. 273547] and would like to thank the Danish National Research Foundation for their financial support of the Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate.",,57,27,27,0,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

To prepare for increasing temperatures, climate adaptation actors are prioritizing climate resilience- and transformation-based activities. There is, however, limited understanding of actors' knowledge of and attitudes and practices towards these global temperature targets and concepts. Using the case of Caribbean small island developing states, we qualitatively analyze in-depth interviews with 35 climate change donors and project implementers. We find that most actors are aware of the 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C targets but that all are pessimistic about their achievement. Project implementers do not have a clear way to incorporate these targets into their adaptation projects. We also find that there is no uniform understanding of 'resilience' and 'transformation', though actors commonly define 'resilience' as the ability to 'bounce back' from extreme events and note 'transformation' as requiring the disruption of current socio-economic and political systems. Actors are further pessimistic about achieving resilience goals within short programming and funding cycles. Our study highlights the need for the global temperature targets to be urgently translated into the design and implementation of adaptation projects. We also highlight that the concepts of resilience and transformation are top-down and donor-driven, and that there is a need for donors to facilitate the creation of a shared vision of these concepts across all stakeholders.","[Saxena, Alark; Qui, Kristin] Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Robinson, Stacy-ann] Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, 91 Waterman St, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Saxena, Alark] Aarhus Univ, Sch Culture & Soc, AURA Program, Moesgard Alle 20, DK-8270 Hojbjerg, Denmark",Yale University; Brown University; Aarhus University,"Robinson, SA (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, 91 Waterman St, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",alark.saxena@yale.edu; kristin.qui@yale.edu; stacy-ann_robinson@brown.edu,"Robinson, Stacy-ann/R-2769-2019","Robinson, Stacy-ann/0000-0003-3163-8771",Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies,Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies,We would like to thank: the experts for their time and continued interest in this research area; Dustin Schinn and the anonymous reviewers for comments on earlier versions; and the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies for fieldwork funding.

However, failure to consider future flooding from climate change in municipal planning may have dangerous and costly consequences when the water does come. We suggest that managed retreat practices are challenging in Sweden, not only due to public opinions but also because of a deficit of uptake of territorial knowledge by decision-makers and difficulties in realizing flexible planning options of the shoreline. A territorial governance framework was used as a heuristic to explore the challenges to managed retreat in four urban case studies (three municipalities and one county) representing different territorial, hydrological and oceanographic environments. This was done through a series of participatory stakeholder workshops. The analysis using a territorial governance framework based on dimensions of coordination, integration, mobilization, adaptation and realization presents variations in how managed retreat barriers and opportunities are perceived among case study sites, mainly due to the differing territorial or place-based challenges. The results also indicate common challenges regardless of the case study site, including coordination challenges and unclear responsibility, the need for integrated means of addressing goal conflicts and being able to adapt flexibly to existing regulations and plans. Yet rethinking how managed retreat could boost community resilience and help to implement long-term visions was seen as a way to deal with some of the territorial challenges.","[Goransson, Gunnel; Van Well, Lisa; Bendz, David; Danielsson, Per; Hedfors, Jim] Swedish Geotech Inst, Dept Geotech Risk & Climate Adaptat, SE-58193 Linkoping, Sweden",,"Goransson, G (corresponding author), Swedish Geotech Inst, Dept Geotech Risk & Climate Adaptat, SE-58193 Linkoping, Sweden.",gunnel.goransson@sgi.se,,"Goransson, Gunnel/0000-0001-6016-0856; Van Well, Lisa/0000-0002-2066-5099",FORMAS within the National Climate research programme [2017-01919],FORMAS within the National Climate research programme,"This study was part of the CAMEL project - Climate Adaptation by Managed Realignment, funded by FORMAS within the National Climate research programme (project no. 2017-01919).",,53,4,4,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

We surveyed small-scale farmers to assess climate change-related perceptions and adaptations in the agriculture sector. The majority of the respondents agreed that there were changes in climatological variables affecting their farming activities, especially in terms of precipitation and temperature. However, the results also revealed that only 13% of respondents believed that human activities play a significant role. Three forms of adaptations have been developed by the farmers, namely: (1) agricultural diversification, (2) agricultural intensification, and (3) socioeconomic adaptation. Changing crops to more climate-tolerant varieties was one of the most common agricultural diversification practices (implemented by 88% of farmers). Most of the farmers also tried to maintain agricultural productivity by adjusting a local planting calendar (implemented by 94% of farmers). The use of machinery to intensify farming practice was an uncommon strategy (implemented by only 30% of farmers) because of expensive maintenance and small cultivation areas. The results suggested the importance of increasing farmers' knowledge and technological know-how related to climate change and its implications, developing effective adaptation and mitigation efforts, and constructing climate-resilient infrastructure in the agricultural sector.","[Sekaranom, Andung Bayu; Nurjani, Emilya] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Geog, Dept Environm Geog, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia; [Sekaranom, Andung Bayu] Univ Gadjah Mada, Res Ctr Disaster, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia; [Nucifera, Fitria] Univ Amikom, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Geog, Yogyakarta 55283, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University; Gadjah Mada University,"Sekaranom, AB (corresponding author), Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Geog, Dept Environm Geog, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia.;Sekaranom, AB (corresponding author), Univ Gadjah Mada, Res Ctr Disaster, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia.",andungbayu@geo.ugm.ac.id; emilya.nurjani@ugm.ac.id; fnucifera@amikom.ac.id,"Sekaranom, Andung/GLT-5087-2022","Sekaranom, Andung/0000-0003-3497-0905; Nucifera, Fitria/0000-0001-8024-0845",Grant of Prioritas Riset Nasional-SIMLITABMAS from Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture in 2021 [1736/UN1/DITLIT/DIT-LIT/2021],Grant of Prioritas Riset Nasional-SIMLITABMAS from Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture in 2021,This research was funded by Grant of Prioritas Riset Nasional-SIMLITABMAS from Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture in 2021 with Dr. Emilya Nurjani as the principal investigator (Contract number: 1736/UN1/DITLIT/DIT-LIT/2021).,,45,5,5,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,13,,,,,,,7069,10.3390/su13137069,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13137069,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TG3GG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000671295900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Inclusive, pro-poor growth is central to the development of low-income countries. There is also a broad consensus that growth and development are important to reduce vulnerability to climate change. Growth does not automatically reduce vulnerability, only the right kind of growth does. The paper aims to develop a better understanding of what the right kind of growth may be. We find that many growth policies, such as investment in skills and access to finance, indeed reduce vulnerability to climate change. However, climate change calls for some adjustments in growth policy.

However, few prototypes are easy to use and accessible for decision-makers to evaluate and manage risks locally. DESYCO is a GIS based decision support system specifically designed to better understand the risks that climate change poses at the regional/subnational scale (e.g. the effect of sea level rise and coastal erosion on human assets and ecosystems) and set the context of strategic adaptation planning within Integrated Coastal Zone Management. It implements a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology allowing the spatial assessment of multiple climate change impacts in coastal areas and the ranking of key elements at risk (beaches, wetlands, protected areas, urban and agricultural areas). The core of the system is a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model used to operationalize the steps of the RRA (hazard, exposure, susceptibility, risk and damage assessment) by integrating a blend of information from climate scenarios (global/regional climate projections and hydrodynamic/hydrological simulations) and from non-climate vulnerability factors (physical, environmental and socio-economic features of the analysed system). User-friendly interfaces simplify the interaction with the system, providing guidance for risk mapping, results communication and understanding. DESYCO was applied to low-lying coastal plains and islands (the North Adriatic Sea, the Gulf of Gabes and the Republic of Mauritius), river basins and groundwater systems (Upper Plain of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Marche Region).

The availability and sharing of good knowledge and information is a key prerequisite for a successful planning in cities. Urban planning for adaptation is largely considered as a collective process. This raises the importance of the availability/usability of proper planner/user friendly interfaces to interpret and translate the available information into adaptation decisions, and to facilitate the information sharing and collaborative decision making within the interaction network in which the different actors are embedded. Nevertheless, collaborative planning is far from being the standard in urban adaptation. The activities carried out in EU-MACS aimed at detecting and analysing the main barriers hampering the process. To this aim, Problem Structuring Methods and Social Network Analysis were implemented. The evidences collected in an urban case study - i.e. Helsinki - demonstrated that ambiguity in problem understanding and information needs, and missing connections in the mechanisms of interaction among actors-resources-tasks could hamper the effectiveness of collaborative planning and create inefficient flow between information production and decision process. Starting from these premises, and referring to the results of an extensive literature review about existing tools, our research aimed at facilitating the use of climate services to enable the collective decision-making process.","[Giordano, Raffaele; Pluchinotta, Irene; Matarrese, Raffaella] Natl Res Council CNR, Water Res Inst, Rome, Italy; [Pilli-Sihvola, Karoliina; Perrels, Adriaan] Finnish Meteorol Inst FMI, Helsinki, Finland",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulle Acque (IRSA-CNR); Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Giordano, R (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR, Water Res Inst, Rome, Italy.",raffaele.giordano@cnr.it,"GIORDANO, RAFFAELE/AAX-7089-2020; Matarrese, Raffaella/D-5174-2016","Pluchinotta, Irene/0000-0002-1883-8675; Matarrese, Raffaella/0000-0002-3923-9639; Perrels, Adriaan/0000-0003-4655-1310",EU-MACS Project within the H2020 [730500],EU-MACS Project within the H2020,"The research activities described in this work have been financially supported by the EU-MACS Project (Project ref. 730500) within the H2020.

In terms of emissions mitigation, carbon credits transactions, and adaptation to local and regional impacts, these population concentrations clearly have a key role to play. The documentation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), initiatives such as the Kyoto instruments (e.g. Clean Development Mechanism and the World Bank Carbon Fund), and wider information regarding the risks generated and faced by cities (in the light of the New Orleans experience for example), emphasizes the need to put them in the centre of the climate change debate. This article uses these sources and others for the construction of necessary steps for the incorporation of climate change considerations in strategic planning in particular.

In these sensitive ecosystems, traditional sectoral, disciplinary approaches will not work to attain sustainability: achieving a collective vision of how to attain sustainability requires interactive efforts among disciplines in a more integrated approach. Therefore, we developed an integrated ecological-economic approach that consists of an ecological and an economic module and combines relevant processes on either level. Parameters for both modules are adjusted for an and dwarf shrub savannah in southern Namibia. The economic module is used to analyse decisions of different virtual farmer types on annual stocking rates depending on their knowledge how the ecosystem works and climatic conditions. We used a dynamic linear optimisation model to simulate farm economics and livestock dynamics. The ecological module is used to simulate the impact of the farmers' land-use decision, derived by the economic module, on ecosystem dynamics and resulting carrying capacity of the system for livestock. Vegetation dynamics, based on the concept of State-and-transition models, and forage productivity for both modules is derived by a small-scale and spatially explicit vegetation model. This mechanistic approach guarantees that data collected and processes estimated at smaller scales are included in our application. Simulation results of the ecological module were successfully compared to simulation results of the optimisation model for a time series of 30 years. We revealed that sustainable management of semi-arid and and rangelands relies strongly on rangeland managers' understanding of ecological processes. Furthermore, our simulation results demonstr n results demonstrate that the projected lower annual rainfall due to climate change adds an additional layer of risk to these ecosystems that are already prone to land degradation.

Maintaining this asset involves approximately $134 billion of government funds annually from Federal, State, and local agencies. Climate change may represent a risk or an opportunity to this network, as changes in climate stress will affect the resources necessary for both road maintenance and construction projects. This paper develops an approach for estimating climate-related changes in road maintenance and construction costs such that the current level of service provided by roads is maintained over time. We estimate these costs under a baseline scenario in which annual mean global temperature increases by 1.5 degrees C in 2050 relative to the historical average and a mitigation scenario under which this increase in mean temperature is limited to 1.0 degrees C. Depending on the nature of the changes in climate that occur in a given area, our analysis suggests that climate change may lead to a reduction in road maintenance and/or construction costs or an increase in costs. Overall, however, our analysis shows that climate change, if unchecked, will increase the annual costs of keeping paved and unpaved roads in service by $785 million in present value terms by 2050. When not discounted, this figure increases to $2.8 billion. Policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to reduce these costs by approximately $280 million in present value terms and by $885 million when not discounted. These costs vary substantially by region and time period, information that should be important for transportation planners at the national, state, and local levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Different dimensions of knowledge (declarative and procedural knowledge, assessed in terms of objective and subjective knowledge measures) and value priorities (basic values and forest values), as well as the role of forest owner identity, were examined. The study was conducted by means of a postal questionnaire to a random sample of private forest owners in Sweden (n = 3000, response rate 43%). The distinctions between actual knowledge (objective knowledge), confidence (subjective knowledge), and value priorities, in addition to the hierarchical structure of how these factors are linked to management behaviors, proved to be valuable. Results revealed that different knowledge dimensions and value priorities were jointly important for forest management behaviors. In addition, the role of forest owner identity for management behaviors was confirmed.

Since, 2007 agroforestry has received attention in global climate discussions for its carbon sink potential. Agroforestry plays a defining role in offsetting greenhouse gases, providing sustainable livelihoods, localizing Sustainable Development Goals and achieving biodiversity targets. The review explores evidence of agroforestry systems for human well-being along with its climate adaptation and mitigation potential for South Asia. In particular, we explore key enabling and constraining conditions for mainstreaming agroforestry systems to use them to fulfill global climate mitigation targets. Nationally determined contributions submitted by South Asian countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change acknowledge agroforestry systems. In 2016, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation's Resolution on Agroforestry brought consensus on developing national agroforestry policies by all regional countries and became a strong enabling condition to ensure effectiveness of using agroforestry for climate targets. Lack of uniform methodologies for creation of databases to monitor tree and soil carbon stocks was found to be a key limitation for the purpose. Water scarcity, lack of interactive governance, rights of farmers and ownership issues along with insufficient financial support to rural farmers for agroforestry were other constraining conditions that should be appropriately addressed by the regional countries to develop their preparedness for achieving national climate ambitions. Our review indicates the need to shift from planning to the implementation phase following strong examples shared from India and Nepal, including carbon neutrality scenarios, incentives and sustainable local livelihood to enhance preparedness.","[Dhyani, Shalini] CSIR Natl Environm Engn Res Inst NEERI, Water Technol & Management Div, Nehru Marg, Nagpur 440020, Maharashtra, India; [Murthy, Indu K.; Adesh Gadpayle, Kritika] Ctr Study Sci Technol & Policy, Adaptat & Risk Anal Div, RMV 2nd Stage, Bengaluru 560094, Karnataka, India; [Kadaverugu, Rakesh] CSIR Natl Environm Engn Res Inst NEERI, Cleaner Technol & Modeling Div, Nehru Marg, Nagpur 440020, Maharashtra, India; [Dasgupta, Rajarshi] Inst Global Environm Strategies IGES, Nat Resources & Ecosyst Serv Div, 2108-11 Kamiyamaguchi, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan; [Kumar, Manoj] Forest Res Inst, GIS Ctr, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India",Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI); Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI); Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE); Forest Research Institute (FRI),"Dhyani, S (corresponding author), CSIR Natl Environm Engn Res Inst NEERI, Water Technol & Management Div, Nehru Marg, Nagpur 440020, Maharashtra, India.",s_dhyani@neeri.res.in; indukmurthy@cstep.in; rakesh927@gmail.com; dasgupta@iges.or.jp; manojfri@gmail.com; kritika@cstep.in,"郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022; Gadpayle, Kritika/HCI-0996-2022; kadaverugu, rakesh/HGU-7893-2022; DasGupta, Rajarshi/AAX-2695-2021; Kumar, Manoj/X-8489-2018; K Murthy, Indu/C-8445-2016","DasGupta, Rajarshi/0000-0003-0051-5090; Kumar, Manoj/0000-0003-2360-5451; Dhyani, Shalini/0000-0002-0915-5733; K Murthy, Indu/0000-0001-9520-1662; KADAVERUGU, RAKESH/0000-0002-4110-7176","CGIAR research program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry","CGIAR research program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry(CGIAR)","Authors are thankful to Director CSIR-NEERI, Nagpur and Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, Bangalore.

The results confirmed marketing strategies aligned with the theme of sustainability with little work from small developing island nations. Additionally, findings demonstrated that research exploring business strategies through green marketing directed to green consumers with sustainable supply chain management had been dominantly increasing in the literature over recent years. Similarly, social marketing associated with green consumers was a common concern for the public and academics, rising over the years with strong influence from the published IPCC Assessment Reports.

A water and energy intensive system consisting of non-renewable (NRES) and renewable energy subsystems (HRES), a reverse osmosis module and a fuel cycle, is studied using the approach and the results are validated and calibrated according to the relevant literature. Four scenarios including an NRES fueled by pulverized coal (I) and natural gas (II), a hybrid NRES and HRES application (III), and a power and freshwater cogeneration system (IV) are compared from both economic and environmental viewpoints. Finally, the applicability of the controlled NRES is investigated using economic, environmental, and combined environmental-economic cost of products (CEECP) and the sensitivity of the model responses with respect to the manipulating variable is studied. The results showed that CEECP was obtained to be 164.7, 134.1, 515.2, and 134.1 $/MWh in the scenarios I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Additionally, the operational water withdrawal could be decreased by 1.7-3.2% in favor of additional 0.03-0.05% of CO2-eq emissions by employing a controlled power plant. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Global warming could disturb the production of both rainfed and irrigated agriculture thru the amplify of yield water requests in many areas. In this study, the fast-track projections available through the Inter-Sectors Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP) were presented and analyzed to assess the effects of two global warming (GW) levels (1.5 and 2.0 degrees C) on the maize and wheat yields in Egypt. Outcomes proposed spatial variations in the effects of temperature change on crop yield. Compared with the referenced situation, an observed national average change in wheat yield about 5.0% (0.0% to 9.0%) and 5.0% (-3.0% to 14.0%) under GW1.5 and GW2.0 respectively. While for maize yield, the change in national average about -1.0% (-5.0% to 3.0%) and -4.0% (-8.0% to 2.0%) under GW1.5 and GW2.0 respectively. GW1.5 could be helpful for wheat yield, but the positive effect decayed when the warming level reached 2.0 degrees C overhead the pre-industrial level. Nevertheless, the possible deviations to Egypt's maize production under the GW1.5 and GW2.0 scenarios are unclear where the models do not agree with the sign of change. Adjusting the temperature rise within 1.5 degrees C would diminish the yield reduction, as it is an extraordinary priority to safeguard crop production. To achieve Progress of innovative agronomic managing plans and swapping to additional drought-resistant crops may be valuable for coping with climate change in regions vulnerable to yield decline.","[Gamal, Gamil; Samak, Magdy; Shahba, Mohamed] Cairo Univ, Fac African Postgrad Studies, Nat Resources Dept, Giza 12613, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Shahba, M (corresponding author), Cairo Univ, Fac African Postgrad Studies, Nat Resources Dept, Giza 12613, Egypt.",gamil.gamal@cu.edu.eg; magdysamak@faps.cu.edu.eg; shahbam@cu.edu.eg,"Shahba, Mohamed/ABH-6152-2020","Shahba, Mohamed/0000-0003-2141-2859",,,,,113,2,2,3,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,DEC,2021,12,12,,,,,,,1589,10.3390/atmos12121589,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12121589,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,XW6SL,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000735746300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It introduces natural elements to create a pleasant space for human activities. However, this study measured a typical sunken courtyard and found potential problems of excessive solar radiation and accumulated air pollutants in summer when at an acceptable outdoor temperature for human activities. To improve the comfort and health of a sunken courtyard, this research proposes some green retrofit designs. Firstly, compared with green wall, water and a tree, sunshade is a primary measure to improve thermal comfort. Combining sunshade, a green wall and water reduces the temperature by up to 5.6 degrees C in the activity zone during the hottest hour. Secondly, blocking/guiding wind walls can effectively improve the wind environment in a sunken courtyard, but only when the wind direction is close to the prevailing wind. A blocking wind wall was better at affecting velocity and uniformity, while the guiding wind wall was more efficient at discharging air pollutants. This study initially discusses the climate-adaptive design of underground spaces in terms of green, thermal comfort and natural ventilation. Designers should generally integrate above/underground and indoor/outdoor spaces using natural and artificial resources to improve comfort and health in underground spaces.","[Han, Gang; Wen, Yueming; Leng, Jiawei; Sun, Lijun] Southeast Univ, Sch Architecture, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China; [Han, Gang; Wen, Yueming; Leng, Jiawei; Sun, Lijun] Southeast Univ, Future Underground Space Inst, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China,"Leng, JW (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Architecture, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.;Leng, JW (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Future Underground Space Inst, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.",han_gang007@163.com; wenyueming66@163.com; jw_leng@seu.edu.cn; s-lijun@163.com,,"Wen, Yueming/0000-0003-4603-9405",National Natural Science Foundation of China [52178009]; Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYCX20_0112]; open fund for Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Building Energy Efficiency [BEE201902],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province; open fund for Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Building Energy Efficiency,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 52178009, the Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, grant number KYCX20_0112, and the open fund for Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Building Energy Efficiency, grant number BEE201902.",,63,6,6,13,56,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,SEP,2021,11,9,,,,,,,413,10.3390/buildings11090413,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings11090413,,,19,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,UV3SS,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000699403300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Power supply is insufficient, and the electricity supply for about 60 million Nigerians relies on private generators, causing noise, pollution, and high expenditures for mainly imported fuel. Altogether, current challenges clearly demonstrate the need for effective energy efficiency policies targeting also the building sector. The Nigerian Energy Support Program began in 2013, among others, with the objective being to support the Nigerian Government in developing the Nigerian Building Energy Efficiency Code. This paper presents two preparatory activities carried out in order to come up with suggestions for a legal framework well suited for the situation on the ground: the Case Study Building Analysis carried out in collaboration with a Nigerian developer and the Nigerian Building Energy Efficiency Guideline, elaborated together with stakeholders. The results of preparatory activities pointed out that the code must put emphasis on climate adaptive design and must define requirements and procedures in a clear and simple way to allow for effective enforcement. Only then can energy-efficient mass housing be feasible in Nigeria. The paper concludes with a description of the Nigerian Building Energy Efficiency Code (BEEC), officially approved and launched by the Federal Minister of Power, Works and Housing on 29 August 2017.","[Geissler, Susanne] SERA Energy & Resources eU, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Oesterreicher, Doris] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Struct Engn, Working Grp Sustainable Construct, Dept Civil Engn & Nat Hazards, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Macharm, Ene] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ GmbH, D-53113 Bonn, Germany","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Osterreicher, D (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Struct Engn, Working Grp Sustainable Construct, Dept Civil Engn & Nat Hazards, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",susanne.geissler@sustain.at; doris.oesterreicher@boku.ac.at; ene.macharm@giz.de,,"Geissler, Susanne/0000-0002-2064-8133; Osterreicher, Doris/0000-0003-3988-4889",Federal Ministry of Power Works and Housing (FMPWH); German Government; European Union; Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH,Federal Ministry of Power Works and Housing (FMPWH); German Government; European Union(European Commission); Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH,"The paper is based on projects funded under the framework of the Nigerian Energy Support Program (NESP), a five-year working program (2013-2018), implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Power Works and Housing (FMPWH), and funded by the German Government and the European Union.",,31,6,6,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2018,10,8,,,,,,,2620,10.3390/su10082620,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10082620,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GW3CI,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000446767700036,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of the study is to obtain the future projections of NEM rainfall over this region representing three different greenhouse gas emission scenarios (i.e., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for two future time slices, i.e., near (2020-2049) and far future (2070-2099) estimated from a set of high-resolution regional climate simulations performed under CORDEX-SA experiments. To achieve that, first, an assessment of ten CORDEX-SA regional climate model (RCM) simulations is done for NEM rainfall over SPI for present climate (1976-2005) against India Meteorological Department high resolution (0.25o x 0.25o) gridded rainfall analysis dataset. Then, the change in NEM rainfall over SPI in the near and far future is computed after applying standardized reconstruction technique to adjust the bias present in the models. The results suggest that most of the CORDEX-SA experiments are able to simulate the spatial distribution of NEM seasonal rainfall and its variability over SPI but there is an inability in capturing realistic magnitudes and the errors are more over the east and west coast where most of the rainfall occurs. The experiment with RCA4 driven by EC-EARTH global model and REMO2009 driven by MPI-ESM has a fairly lesser bias than the other models, whereas the bias is more in LMDZ-IITM-RegCM4. The experiments by CCAM models have very similar characteristics in representing the rainfall pattern. The standardized reconstruction bias correction technique was found to significantly improve the performance of the climate models in representing the climatological mean and inter-annual variability of (IAV) of NEM rainfall over SPI, but in case of categorical rainfall years, improvement is seen only in the normal rainfall years. In the future, for RCP 2.6, there is a rise in NEM rainfall in the first half of the twenty-first century, which is projected to decline after that; however, in the other two scenarios, the rainfall is projected to increase. It is also found that there may be lesser excess rainfall years and more deficit rainfall years in the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios in the near future, and no deficit rainfall years are projected in the far future in both these scenarios based on the present climate. It is also noticed that the variability in the NEM rainfall over this region may remarkably increase in all the three future scenarios, which will highly impact various water resources management sectors. Thus, this study is very useful in determining the effects on various sectors due to the variability in NEM rainfall over this region and for adapting to climate change using advanced technologies for a sustainable future.","[Sannan, M.

The 4th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) mentions that drier areas will be affected by more droughts while the rainfall regime, in general, will become 'rougher'. In West Africa, specifically the area below the Sahel, the climate change signal may be more subtle. Anecdotal evidence from farmers suggests that the onset of rainy season has been shifting forward in time over the past two generations. Recently, detailed atmospheric modelling over the region shows that in the near future too, the onset of rainy season will shift to later periods in the year, roughly from April towards May. The end of rainy season as well as the total amount of rainfall will remain more or less fixed. This implies that adaptation strategies should be twofold. The first part of a comprehensive adaptation strategy would be a continuation of the efforts to produce faster growing rain-fed crop cultivars, mainly corn and sorghum. The second part would consist of increased water storage during the wet season for use during dry season.","[van de Giesen, Nick] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands; [Liebe, Jens] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Jung, Gerlinde] UNICAL Polifunzionale, Inst Atmospher Pollut, Consiglio Nazl Ric, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",Delft University of Technology; University of Bonn; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Sull'inquinamento Atmosferico (IIA-CNR),"van de Giesen, N (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Stevinweg 1, Delft, Netherlands.",n.c.vandegiesen@tudelft.nl,"van de Giesen, Nick/O-8137-2019; Liebe, Jens/A-6010-2009","van de Giesen, Nick/0000-0002-7200-3353; ",,,,,20,67,68,0,24,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0011-3891,,,CURR SCI INDIA,Curr.

Governments are looking for effective ways to protect lives, buildings, and infrastructure. At the same time, a large investment gap seems to exist-a big difference between what should necessarily be done to curb the increase in damage and what is actually being done. Decision-makers involved in climate adaptation are facing fundamental (so-called deep) uncertainties. In the course of time, the scientific community has developed a wide range of different approaches for dealing with these uncertainties. One of these approaches, adaptation pathways, is gaining traction as a way of framing and informing climate adaptation. But research shows that very little work has been done to evaluate the current use of adaptation pathways and its utility to practitioners and decision makers (Lin et al. 2017, p. 387). With this paper, the authors, as action researchers and practitioners involved in two of the world's largest real-life applications of this approach in flood risk management, aim to contribute to filling in that gap. Analysis of the experience in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in long-term planning in flood risk management shows that the adaptation pathways approach is effective in keeping decision processes going forward, to the final approval of a long-term plan, and helps increase awareness about uncertainties. It contributes to political support for keeping long-term options open and motivates decision-makers to modify their plans to better accommodate future conditions. When it comes to implementing the plans, there are still some major challenges, yet to be addressed, amongst others: the timely detection of tipping points in situations with large natural variability, the inclusion of measures that prepare for a switch to transformational strategies, and the retention of commitment of regional and local authorities, non government organizations, and the private sector, to climate adaptation as national policies move from blueprint planning to adaptive plans. In delivering this feedback, the authors hope to motivate the scientific community to take on these challenges.","[Bloemen, Pieter; Zevenbergen, Chris; Rijke, Jeroen] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands; [Reeder, Tim] Southampton Univ, Southampton, Hants, England; [Rijke, Jeroen] HAN Univ Appl Sci, Arnhem, Netherlands; [Kingsborough, Ashley] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Southampton; University of Oxford,"Bloemen, P (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands.",Pieter.bloemen@deltacommissaris.nl; Tim.reeder@ntlworld.com; C.zevenbergen@un-ihe.org; J.rijke@han.nl; Ashley.kingsborough@gmail.com,,,,,,,83,56,57,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Specifically, while the spread of climate mitigation initiatives in the 1990s was triggered primarily by transnational municipal networks (horizontal diffusion), the development and revision of climate mitigation strategies and the emergence of climate adaptation strategies during the last decade have been driven mainly by national and subnational funding programmes (vertical upscaling). Notably, forerunner cities are less dependent on external funding than followers and latecomers, because they have more internal capacity to act. By arguing that upscaling of local climate policies from forerunners to followers and latecomers depends on interventions by national and subnational authorities, we stress that the majority of German municipalities require external support in order to develop and implement effective climate strategies.","[Kern, Kristine; Eckersley, Peter; Haupt, Wolfgang] Leibniz Inst Raumbezogene Sozialforsch IRS eV, Res Grp Urban Sustainabil Transformat, Erkner, Germany; [Kern, Kristine] ?bo Akad Univ, Fac Social Sci Business & Econ, Turku, Finland; [Eckersley, Peter] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham, England",Nottingham Trent University; University of Nottingham,"Kern, K (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Raumbezogene Sozialforsch IRS eV, Res Grp Urban Sustainabil Transformat, Erkner, Germany.;Kern, K (corresponding author), ?bo Akad Univ, Fac Social Sci Business & Econ, Turku, Finland.",kristine.kern@leibniz-irs.de,,"Kern, Kristine/0000-0001-9923-4621",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL,,44,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

This study explores the climate-related content, climate sensitivities, and opportunities to incorporate climate change concerns in a set of aquaculture policies by the government of Thailand. The analysis is based on content analysis of policy documents and in-depth interviews with 14 officials that had roles in the design or implementation of 8 Department of Fisheries policies. The Aquaculture Master Plan 2011-2016 and the now abandoned Tilapia Strategy refer directly to climate variability or change. The Master Plan also suggests measures or strategies, such as investment in research, and the transfer of technologies, which would be helpful to sustainability and adaptation. Other policies suggest, or at the very least include, practices which could contribute to strengthening management of climate-related risks, for example: a registration policy included provisions for compensation; extension programme policy recognizes the importance of extreme events; and a standards policy gives guidance on site selection and water management. Most existing aquaculture policies appear to be sensitive to the impacts of climate change; for instance, the zoning policy is sensitive to spatial shifts in climate. Stakeholders had ideas on how policies could be made more robust; in the case of zoning, by periodically reviewing boundaries and adjusting them as necessary. POLICY RELEVANCE This study is one of the first evaluations of the coverage and sensitivity of aquaculture policies to climate change. It shows that while existing policies in Thailand are beginning to refer explicitly to climate change, they do not yet include much in the way of adaptation responses, underlining the need for identifying entry points as has been done in this analysis. Further mainstreaming is one option; another possibility is to adopt a more segregated approach, at least initially, and to collect various policy ideas under a new strategic policy for the aquaculture sector as a whole.","[Uppanunchai, Anuwat] Minist Agr & Cooperat, Dept Fisheries, Lamphun Inland Fisheries Res & Dev Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand; [Chitmanat, Chanagun] Maejo Univ, Fac Fisheries Technol & Aquat Resources, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Lebel, Louis] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Social Sci, USER, Chiang Mai, Thailand",Ministry of Agriculture & Cooperatives - Thailand; Maejo University; Chiang Mai University,"Lebel, L (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Social Sci, USER, Chiang Mai, Thailand.",llebel@loxinfo.co.th,,,"International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada [107087]","International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada","The work was carried out with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada [grant number 107087] as a contribution to the AQUADAPT project.",,47,11,11,2,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Emerging climatic-vulnerabilities and the mismatched farm practices are becoming major challenges for poor or declining rice productivity in potential rice growing regions, especially South Asia. In the biodiversity-rich landscapes of South Asia, many traditional rice varieties (TRVs) are known to exhibit resilience to climate change and climate adaptation besides their therapeutic benefits. Hence, a random sample survey of farmers (n = 320), alongwith secondary data collection from non-governmental organizations/farmers' organizations/farmers, led to documentation of the information on TRVs' biodiversity in South Asia. The current study (2015-2019) explored and documented ~164 TRVs which may enhance the resilience to climatic-risks with improved yields besides their unique therapeutic benefits. A large number of TRVs have still not been registered by scientific organizations due to poor awareness by the farmers and community organizations. Hence, it is urgently needed to document, evaluate and harness the desired traits of these TRVs for ecological, economic, nutritional and health benefits. This study suggests taking greater cognizance of TRVs for their conservation, need-based crop improvement, and cultivation in the niche-areas owing to their importance in climate-resilient agriculture for overall sustainable rice farming in South Asia so as to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.</p>","[Muralikrishnan, L.; Padaria, Rabindra.

However, we still lack an understanding of how society adapts itself outside of policy sectors and as part of what some refer to as autonomous adaptation. The way people respond to risk without deliberate interventions of public actors is not well understood. Given the increasing occurrence of climatic changes that affect our daily lives, the topic is regaining attention with an emphasis on behavioral adaptation. This angle, however, does little to enhance our understanding of how society adapts collectively and which practices and routines groups choose to adopt. This study investigates autonomous heat-stress adaptation efforts in two small towns in Germany. Autonomous heat-stress adaptation is approached through a lens of (social) adaptation practices. Small towns are understudied in adaptation research and have played only a minor role when it comes to public adaptation planning due to their lack of formal resources to develop public adaptation strategies. Based on empirical data, consisting of qualitative problem-centered interviews and a quantitative survey, concrete examples of (social) adaptation practices are identified and classified. The presented classification of practices goes beyond earlier attempts by generating insights on the role politics can play in providing a fruitful ground for enabling autonomous adaptation. The paper emphasizes the need for researchers and decision-makers to take a closer look at the wide variety of social adaptation practices already in place. This discloses insights on public-private adaptation mixes, which could ultimately also lift autonomous adaptation from its ad hoc and reactive nature. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Social adaptation practices are not yet at the center of research and decision-making. We believe that adding practice-based approaches to adaptation governance widens the debate on who is vulnerable and possible coping mechanisms from within society. It shows that vulnerability and adaptation lie in people's everyday actions. We provide a first classification of heat-health adaptation practices according to their heat-health target, the involved individuals and actors, the degree of coordination involved, and the spatial and temporal scales. This classification draws attention to potential governance leverage points to initiate heat-adaptation practices. Focusing more strongly on already-in-use and possible heat-health adaptation practices puts citizens' wants and needs at the center of adaptation governance by including them directly in the adaptation process. This can be of special interest for small towns that want to introduce citizen-based approaches to heat-risk adaptation.","[Teebken, Julia; Mitchell, Nicole; Jacob, Klaus; Heimann, Thorsten] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Teebken, J (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",julia.teebken@princeton.edu,,,German Ministry for Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung) [FKZ: 01LR1703A1],German Ministry for Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),The authors are thankful to three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on<EM><STRONG> </STRONG></EM>an earlier version of the paper.

However, agricultural activities in Vietnam are significantly affected by climate change. In Vietnam, the central coastal area in general and Ninh Thuan province in particular are the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. In that context, climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is a good strategy to help local famers coping with climate change while securing food security. This study has two main objectives: to assess farmers' awareness on disasters and to analyze factors affecting the decision to apply CSA practices of farming households in Ninh Thuan. The study conducted focus group discussion, in-depth interview and survey of 436 households in 3 districts of Ninh Thuan to collect data. Research results showed that local farmers have a high awareness of natural disasters trends and impacts on agricultural livelihoods. Facing with disasters in the context of climate change, farming households have applied some models of CSA such as minimal tillage, intercropping, crop rotation, crop transformation, and the use of plant varieties. Binary logit regression analysis indicated that age, education level, household income, membership of local associations, training attendance, and support policies were variables significantly influencing the farmers' decision to apply CSA. Challenges for CSA adoption include lack of capital, information, technical support and land ownership institutions in Vietnam. The study also made recommendations to promote CSA in Vietnam, including reforming the legal system, strengthening agricultural extension services, and providing technical and capital support to farmers.","[Truong, Dinh Duc; Huan, Le Huy] Natl Econ Univ, Fac Environm Climate Change & Urban Studies, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Dat, Tran Tho] Vietnam French Ctr Management Training CFVG, Hanoi, Vietnam",National Economics University - Vietnam,"Dat, TT (corresponding author), Vietnam French Ctr Management Training CFVG, Hanoi, Vietnam.",tranthodat@neu.edu.vn,,,,,,,48,0,0,6,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

These events disrupt transit operations, impair service quality, increase threats to public safety, and damage infrastructure. Despite the growing risk of extreme weather and climate change, little is known about how public managers recognize, experience and address these risks. Using data from a national study of public transit agencies we investigate the types of extreme weather events transit agencies are experiencing, the associated risks, and how agencies are preparing for them. We find that while extreme events are commonly experienced by transit agencies across states and transit managers perceive increased risks from these events, most agencies rely on the traditional emergency management approach to address extreme weather ex post rather than taking a proactive approach to mitigating the adverse weather impact on transit assets and infrastructure ex ante. Managers report that a lack of access to financial resources is the greatest challenge for undertaking adaptation and preparation. We conclude with a discussion of what these findings mean for understanding organizational adaptation behavior as well as climate adaptation policy making.","[Miao, Qing] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Publ Policy, 3242 Eastman Hall,92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Feeney, Mary K.; Zhang, Fengxiu; Welch, Eric W.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Sci Technol & Environm Policy Studies, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Sriraj, P.

Access and use of climate information is considered vital to households' and communities' adaptive capacity. This research employed a survey to investigate barriers to the access, and use of, formal climate change information among two groups of farmers (ethnic minority and Kinh) in mountainous areas of Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. Adopting a logit model, the results show that the main barriers were: 1) farmers' lack of trust of formal climate-related services; 2) farmers' lack of perceived risk from climate change; and 3) difficulties in balancing climate adaptation and economic benefits of new interventions. Ethnicity was not a barrier, as all farmers looked for climate information from informal channels (friends, neighbors, market actors) rather than from formal channels (agricultural departments, television, radio), although cultural issues such as language did act as a barrier. This research recommends strengthening the networks and interactions between market actors and government staff with local people, through direct communication and adaptation demonstrations. Formal and informal climate information channels should be integrated to effectively combine local resources and indigenous knowledge with advanced technologies, to support farmers' sustainable and robust climate adaptation responses. Further, the research found that while farmers have access to devices, such as smart phones, they prefer to use these for entertainment rather than climate information. The implications of the study therefore are that any future network or communication activities should be in local languages and note the limitations of using devices for information dissemination.","[Le Thi Hoa Sen; Nguyen Tien Dung; Hoang Gia Hung; Nguyen Thi Hong Mai] Hue Univ, Hue Univ Agr & Forestry, 102 Phung Hung Str, Hue City, Vietnam; [Bond, Jennifer] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Bathurst, NSW, Australia; [Huynh Thi Anh Phuong] Hue Univ, Univ Sci, Hue, Vietnam",Hue University; Charles Sturt University; Hue University,"Bond, J (corresponding author), POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.",sen.lethihoa@huaf.edu.vn; jebond@csu.edu.au,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Hoang, Hung/0000-0002-4379-5355; Nguyen, Tien Dung/0000-0003-0303-8226; Le, Thi Hoa Sen/0000-0001-5799-4331",Strong Research Group Program of Hue University,Strong Research Group Program of Hue University,This work was supported by the Strong Research Group Program of Hue University.,,69,2,2,1,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8807,,,CLIM SERV,Clim.

Since the completion of the first set of climate simulations in 2015, the database has been growing continuously. It contains the results of ensemble simulations conducted over a total of thousands years respectively for past and future climates using high-resolution global (60 km horizontal mesh) and regional (20 km mesh) atmospheric models. Several sets of future climate simulations are available, in which global mean surface air temperatures are forced to be higher by 4 K, 2 K, and 1.5 K relative to preindustrial levels. Nonwarming past climate simulations are incorporated in d4PDF along with the past climate simulations. The total data volume is approximately 2 petabytes. The atmospheric models satisfactorily simulate the past climate in terms of climatology, natural variations, and extreme events such as heavy precipitation and tropical cyclones. In addition, data users can obtain statistically significant changes in mean states or weather and climate extremes of interest between the past and future climates via a simple arithmetic computation without any statistical assumptions. The database is helpful in understanding future changes in climate states and in attributing past climate events to global warming. Impact assessment studies for climate changes have concurrently been performed in various research areas such as natural hazard, hydrology, civil engineering, agriculture, health, and insurance. The database has now become essential for promoting climate and risk assessment studies and for devising climate adaptation policies. Moreover, it has helped in establishing an interdisciplinary research community on global warming across Japan.","[Ishii, Masayoshi] Meteorol Res Inst, Dept Atmosphere Ocean & Earth Syst Modeling Res, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Ishii, Masayoshi] Japan Meteorol Business Support Ctr, Climate & Environm Res Promot, Chiyoda Ku, Kanda Nishikicho, Tokyo 1010054, Japan; [Mori, Nobuhito] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Uji, Kyoto 6110011, Japan",Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Kyoto University,"Ishii, M (corresponding author), Meteorol Res Inst, Dept Atmosphere Ocean & Earth Syst Modeling Res, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan.;Ishii, M (corresponding author), Japan Meteorol Business Support Ctr, Climate & Environm Res Promot, Chiyoda Ku, Kanda Nishikicho, Tokyo 1010054, Japan.",maish@mri-jma.go.jp,"Mori, Nobuhito/B-8627-2008","Mori, Nobuhito/0000-0001-9082-3235","Program for Risk Information on Climate Change (SOUSEI) program; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) [JPMXD0717935561, JPMXD0717935498]; Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT); Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS) - Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan","Program for Risk Information on Climate Change (SOUSEI) program; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU); Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT); Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS) - Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan","This work was supported by Program for Risk Information on Climate Change (SOUSEI, from FY2012 to FY2016) program, Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU, from FY2017 to FY2021; Grant Numbers: JPMXD0717935561, JPMXD0717935498), Social Implementation Program on Climate Change Adaptation Technology (SI-CAT, from FY2015 to FY2019), and Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS) funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan.

Yet there is a lack of critical understanding of how asymmetric power dynamics shape the vulnerabilities of such populations under climate change. This article examines the interrelations between smallholders' climate-related vulnerability experiences and power relations across multiple scales of climate adaptation in the Peruvian Andes, a region susceptible to increasing climatic threats. The analysis draws on a case study conducted in the Mantaro River Valley in Central Peru using qualitative methods: open-ended interviews, participant observation, and document analysis. Findings of the study show that in the context of climate change, the production of vulnerabilities has much to do with larger socio-political structures in which protection of the highland farmers is not prioritized. The impact of the uneven scalar power dynamics in climate adaptation and other overlapping fields of policy have created uneven terms of adaptation among smallholders. This has created marginalization, conflicts, and deepened smallholders' vulnerabilities under climate change. I argue that to reach a better understanding of the multidimensionality of vulnerabilities, more detailed attention must be paid to place-based climate experiences within context-specific, socio-political processes, and to the ways these are shaped by unequal power relations across multiple scales.","[Heikkinen, Anna Marjaana] Univ Helsinki, Global Dev Studies, Snellmanninkatu 14 C, Helsinki 00014, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Heikkinen, AM (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Global Dev Studies, Snellmanninkatu 14 C, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",anna.heikkinen@helsinki.fi,,"Heikkinen, Anna/0000-0002-2955-4862",Kone Foundation [4705967],Kone Foundation,This research is funded by the Kone Foundation (grant no. 4705967).,,86,3,3,2,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Information provision is a key strategy adopted by governments to support household adaptation. However, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of the different types of information and their influence on coastal household response. Drawing on case study research in two Australian coastal communities, we explore the types of information shaping household responses to three hazard scenarios: a heatwave, a severe storm, and sea-level rise. We find that passive information informs action in fewer than half of all households. Furthermore, even current attempts at more action-oriented information only informs coping strategies. If coastal adaptation is to achieve the transformational changes vital to manage the impacts of climate change, information provision must transition from passive and generic delivery via traditional modes, to actively communicating adaptation as the 'glue' between hazard management and household resilience through context-relevant and household-driven communication modes. Further research into the types of information that promote more-than-coping responses, such as information to facilitate collective action, is also recommended.","[Elrick-Barr, Carmen E.; Smith, Timothy F.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Law & Soc, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia; [Smith, Timothy F.] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Smith, Timothy F.] Uppsala Univ, SWEDESD, S-75185 Uppsala, Sweden",University of the Sunshine Coast; Brock University; Uppsala University,"Elrick-Barr, CE (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Law & Soc, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia.",smith5@usc.edu.au; smith5@usc.edu.au,"Elrick-Barr, Carmen/Q-9861-2019; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Elrick-Barr, Carmen/0000-0001-6868-1373; Smith, Timothy/0000-0002-3991-5211","Australian Government through the Australian Research Council [FT180100652, DP1093583]; Australian Research Council [DP1093583] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Government through the Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),We acknowledge the support of the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects Funding Scheme (Projects FT180100652 and DP1093583).,,65,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2022,14,5,,,,,,,2904,10.3390/su14052904,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14052904,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW4FB,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000771168800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Little attention has been paid, however, to reviewing adaptation initiatives amongst farmers in Asia. This article fills this knowledge gap by examining the current literature on Asian farmers' perception of climate change, their adaptation strategies, key factors influencing their choices, and the barriers to change. A systematic quantitative literature review is undertaken of 48 papers taken from a range of sources. The review indicates that farmers' perceptions of climate change have been consistent with the scientific data. It further identifies farmers' adaptation strategies with regards to soil conservation, water management and land use changes. The review shows numerous factors influencing, and barriers impacting, farmers' ability to adapt. Influencing factors were analysed and categorised into five groups: cognitive, demographic, social-economic, resources, and institutional. Barriers hampering their adaptive capacity were identified as: a lack of access to information, a lack of access to extension services, limited awareness and knowledge, and limited financial options. The review finishes with some recommendations for future research.","[Nguyen, Thu-Huong; Sahin, Oz] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Gold Coast 4222, Australia; [Nguyen, Thu-Huong; Sahin, Oz; Howes, Michael] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Nguyen, Thu-Huong] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Nat Resources & Environm, Fac Land Adm, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Sahin, Oz; Howes, Michael] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Sahin, O (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.;Sahin, O (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.;Sahin, O (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.",huong.nguyen4@griffithuni.edu.au; o.sahin@griffith.edu.au; m.howes@griffith.edu.au,"Sahin, Oz/HLG-7805-2023","Sahin, Oz/0000-0002-1914-5379; Howes, Michael/0000-0003-1102-1483","Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment; Griffith Sciences Group","Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment; Griffith Sciences Group","This research was funded by Endeavour Leadership Program of the Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment, and Griffith Sciences Group.",,80,5,5,3,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,13,,,,,,,7346,10.3390/su13137346,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13137346,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TH3WL,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000672023800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this article, we introduced an infrastructure of alternative fuel as a synergistic approach to climate-adaptation and -mitigation, and advanced a quantitative method to simulate the dependency of travel behavior on fuel availability when the infrastructure of transportation energy is stressed or under attack. Our approach allows both commuters traveling behavior and properties of transportation energy system to interact. Featuring a multi-stage mathematical program, the proposed model was used to study the resilience of New York City's transportation energy sector in the face of a range of climatic extremes. We found the impact of the changing climate on energy sector is major and worsening over time. The modeling results also reveal spatial distribution of vulnerable elements in both transportation and fueling infrastructures, the system's overall resilience in time of disaster, and the daily-commuters impact of vulnerable energy infrastructure. The modeling results are crucial to successful integrated planning response to climate-adaptation and -mitigation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

There are conflicting narratives as to whether these wildfires are restoring landscape resilience to future climate and wildfires. To evaluate the landscape-level work of wildfires, we assessed four subwatersheds in eastern Washington, USA that experienced large wildfires in 2014, 2015, or 2017 after more than a century of fire exclusion and extensive timber harvest. We compared preand post-fire landscape conditions to an ecoregion-specific historical (HRV) and future range of variation (FRV) based on empirically established reference conditions derived from a large dataset of historical aerial photo imagery. These four wildfires proved to be a blunt restoration tool, moving some attributes towards more climate-adapted conditions and setting others back. Fires reduced canopy cover and decreased overall tree size and canopy complexity, which moved them into, or slightly outside, the FRV ranges. Moderate- and low-severity fire generally shifted closed-canopy forest structure to open-canopy classes. Patches of high-severity fire shifted patterns of forest, woodland, grassland, and shrubland towards or beyond the HRV ranges and within the FRV ranges by increasing the total area and size of non-forest patches. However, large patches of high-severity fire in dry and moist mixed-conifer forests homogenized landscape patterns beyond FRV ranges towards simplified conditions dominated by non-forest vegetation types. Fires realigned and reconnected landscape patterns with the topo-edaphic template in some cases, but pre-existing fragmentation and spatial mismatches were compounded in many others. Patches of large-tree, closed-canopy forest were reduced by high-severity fire, and the potential to restore more climate-adapted large-tree, open-canopy forest was lost. Re-establishing landscape patterns with desired patch sizes of forest, in particular patches with large trees, will take many decades to centuries and may not occur in drier locations or where seed trees are no longer present. While large wildfires burning during extreme fire weather conditions can move some attributes towards HRV and FRV ranges, intentionally planned mechanical and prescribed-fire treatments that are integrated with strategic wildfire response will better prepare and adapt landscapes for future wildfires and climate.","[Churchill, Derek J.] Washington State Dept Nat Resources, Forest Resiliency Div, MS 47037, Olympia, WA 98504 USA; [Jeronimo, Sean M.

The vulnerability of seaports, besides the robustness and design of their infrastructures, is also directly related to their adaptive capacity. A policy framework plays an important role in facing the effects of climate change by virtue of planning and supporting the implementation of adaptive measures. This research aims to identify and evaluate the extent to which the climate change topic is addressed by the port planning, coastal management, and climate adaptation policies of Brazil. A policy review was carried out and the documents were evaluated based on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 13 (climate action) targets. A multiscale analysis was performed to identify how different management levels address the topic in their planning. The results suggest that although Brazil has effectively addressed the climate issue with its Adaptation National Plan, the coastal management framework and primarily port planning both remain uncertain. The existing coastal policies for climate adaptation purposes remain virtually not implemented, and accomplishments related to port adaptations are based only on a recent national sustainability guideline agenda. Although climate change impacts are perceived on a local scale, the Brazilian coastal ports and cities have not institutionalized efforts to taking climate-adaptive actions. This observed gap points out the necessity of policymakers to enhance the planning and application of adaptation measures at the local level, as well as promote the cooperation between multiscale sectoral agencies. This overview illustrates several opportunities to update, redesign, and innovate coastal and port management instruments to address climate-related issues. Nature-based Solutions would appear as a fundamental approach to be incorporated in multi-scale policy frameworks, which would support coastal ports and cities in their becoming climate-resilient, thus containing socio-economic losses and environmental deterioration.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we collected recorded maize yields and simulated three levels of yield potentials (radiation-temperature yield potential Y-p climatic yield potential Y-pw and soil-climatic yield potential Y-pws) with the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM-Maize) from 1981 to 2010 in the three main cropping regions in China [the North China spring maize region (NCS), the Huanghuaihai summer maize region (HS), and the Southwest China mountain maize region (SCM)]. The distributions of four categories of maize yield and yield stability zones, and limitations by precipitation, soil and technology & management on average yield, yield stability and total production were analyzed. The county-level average recorded yields during the period under study were 4624.26 kg ha(-1), 4718.32 kg ha(-1) and 3880.44 kg ha(-1) in NCS, HS and SCM, respectively. Coefficients of variations (CV) for recorded yields were 0.40, 0.30 and 0.27 in NCS, HS and SCM, respectively. Based on comprehensive analysis of both average yields and CV values, we divided the main maize cropping areas into four zone categories: those with high and stable yields (high-stable zone), those with high and unstable yields (high-unstable zone), those with low and stable yields (low-stable zone), and those with low and unstable yields (low-unstable zone). Comparison of Y-p, Y-pw,Y-pws and Y-a at the county level, among the three regions, revealed that precipitation was the most important limiting factor on both averages (56%, 9436.97 kg ha(-1) and 53%, 8114.21 kg ha(-1)) and CVs (0.42 and 0.39) of yield in all four zone types in NCS and HS. On the other hand, technology & management was the most important limiting factor in SCM (39%, 3934.87 kg ha(-1)). Total maize productions were reduced by 47.6% and 52.7% by precipitation in NCS and HS, respectively. Nevertheless, the limiting effect of soil was lower than that of technology & management in NCS, while it was higher in HS. In SCM, technology & management was the most important limiting factor (1295.72 x 10(4) t and 39.3%), followed by precipitation (613.80 x 10(4) t and 18.6%) and soil (219.62 x 10(4) t and 6.7%). In the three main cropping regions, the limiting effect of each factor on total productions in high-stable zone was the highest among all four zone types. Our results could be used to provide a theoretical basis for targeted climate change adaptation policies to improve maize yield and yield stability in China. In addition, our results may serve as a reference for other maize cropping regions in the world.","[Zhao, Jin; Yang, Xiaoguang; Sun, Shuang] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Yang, XG (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",yangxg@cau.edu.cn,"yang, xiao/HJI-7815-2023",,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0300101]; Donation for China Clean Development Mechanism Fund [2014109]; Chinese Central Government Administrative Program Agricultural Adaptation to Climate Change,National Key Research and Development Program of China; Donation for China Clean Development Mechanism Fund; Chinese Central Government Administrative Program Agricultural Adaptation to Climate Change,"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0300101), the Donation for China Clean Development Mechanism Fund (2014109), and the Chinese Central Government Administrative Program Agricultural Adaptation to Climate Change.",,45,29,34,7,92,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1161-0301,1873-7331,,EUR J AGRON,Eur.

While blue-green infrastructure has emerged as a focal adaptation technique for stormwater management, in order to craft adaptation policies cities must consider a multitude of emerging, complex, and competing stakeholder interests around multiple adaptation alternatives. However, accounting for these different interests, analyzing their diverse priorities, and maintaining a transparent decision-making process is not easily achieved within the existing policy frameworks. Here we define and present a combined multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods that easily integrates and quantifies stakeholder priorities while remaining accessible for non-experts engaged in the policy-making process. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness through analyzing opinions about stormwater adaptation in New York City across several stakeholder groups. The method succeeds in integrating quantitative and qualitative judgements, indicating stakeholder preferential differences and allowing for more inclusive policy to be crafted. It can be extended beyond stormwater to many urban climate adaptation decisions facing multi-criteria considerations.","[Axelsson, Charles; Giove, Silvio; Soriani, Stefano] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, I-30121 Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Axelsson, C (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",charles.axelsson@unive.it; sgiove@unive.it; soriani@unive.it,,"Axelsson, Charles/0000-0002-8529-7020",,,,,94,7,7,1,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2021,13,17,,,,,,,2422,10.3390/w13172422,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13172422,,,24,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,UO1JR,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000694458900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The potential possible climate adaptation strategies were investigated through the comparison of climate risk maps with diverse adaptation options. The framework was demonstrated in the Kyoto City in Japan with residents as a target population to reduce the flood risk. The results indicate that the government should pay attention to reducing the population in flood-prone areas and adopt diverse adaptation strategies to reduce the flood risk to the residents. Rainwater storage and green roofs as adaptation strategies as short-term planning options are recommended. The construction of detention ponds has been suggested to prevent flood risks in future as a part of the long-term planning process.

Favourable conditions for winter tourism decreased over the last decades in the Saxon low mountain ranges. A change from predominantly snow-based to a wider variety of winter tourism options appears indispensible as climate models project continuing warming. Diversifying touristic options provides opportunities to develop new business fields and to attract new target groups. This paper reveals obstacles and opportunities to adapt and develop winter tourism in the central European low mountain ranges and to increase the competitiveness of regional tourism. A survey explored the current awareness of representatives of most of the Saxon downhill skiing areas and of selected winter tourism municipalities towards climate change and its implications on their business. Awareness is essential to successfully implement adaptation measures. About half of the interviewees were not aware of the regional changes in natural snow conditions projected for the next 15-20 years. Nevertheless, the majority recognized climate change as a serious issue. Yet, stakeholders repeatedly emphasized their uncertainty about related scientific facts. They attributed their perception to mass media reports that suggest a lack of scientific consensus on climate change issues. Adaptation options for slope-based and general winter tourism are developed and presented, involving ideas of the interviewees. To successfully move towards adaptation, supply and marketing of alternative offers need to be strengthened. A survey of tourist expectations is planned to ensure a successful implementation of new (winter) touristic offers in the Saxon mountains.","[Hoy, Andreas; Haensel, Stephanie; Matschullat, Joerg] TU Bergakad Freiberg, Interdisciplinary Environm Res Ctr, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany",Technical University Freiberg,"Hoy, A (corresponding author), TU Bergakad Freiberg, Interdisciplinary Environm Res Ctr, Brennhausgasse 14, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany.",andreas.hoy@ioez.tu-freiberg.de,"Hänsel, Stephanie/N-6345-2014; Matschullat, Jörg/AAW-1655-2021; Matschullat, Jörg/HKV-6370-2023","Hänsel, Stephanie/0000-0003-3734-0001; Hoy, Andreas/0000-0003-3733-6483",,,,,36,19,19,2,30,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Because agricultural production remains the main source of income for most rural communities in the region, adaptation of the agricultural sector is imperative to protect the livelihoods of the poor and to ensure food security. Abetter understanding of farmers' perceptions of climate change, ongoing adaptation measures, and the decision-making process is important to inform policies aimed at promoting successful adaptation strategies for the agricultural sector. Using data from a survey of 1800 farm households in South Africa and Ethiopia, this study presents the adaptation strategies used by farmers in both countries and analyzes the factors influencing the decision to adapt. We find that the most common adaptation strategies include: use of different crops or crop varieties, planting trees, soil conservation, changing planting dates, and irrigation. However, despite having perceived changes in temperature and rainfall, a large percentage of farmers did not make any adjustments to their farming practices. The main barriers to adaptation cited by farmers were lack of access to credit in South Africa and lack of access to land, information, and credit in Ethiopia. A probit model is used to examine the factors influencing farmers' decision to adapt to perceived climate changes. Factors influencing farmers' decision to adapt include wealth, and access to extension, credit, and climate information in Ethiopia; and wealth, government farm support, and access to fertile land and credit in South Africa. Using a pooled dataset, an analysis of the factors affecting the decision to adapt to perceived climate change across both countries reveals that farmers were more likely to adapt if they had access to extension, credit, and land. Food aid, extension services, and information on climate change were found to facilitate adaptation among the poorest farmers. We conclude that policy-makers must create an enabling environment to support adaptation by increasing access to information, credit and markets, and make a particular effort to reach small-scale subsistence farmers, with limited resources to confront climate change.

Maintenance managers are not imagining things; the amount of rainfall during intense precipitation has increased 20% over the past century. A survey of DOTs shows that maintenance demands in response to flooding and snowfall have increased precipitously in many states. This study began with a discussion at the 2011 AASHTO maintenance meeting and proceeded with an inquiry to all 50 states to scan the growth in extreme weather events and the impacts that DOTs have experienced. The impacts of the increase in wind, dust storms, snow and ice, flooding, and other events are discussed in this paper, with some attention devoted to the impacts of rising sea levels and erosion. The case studies reported here of extreme weather events offer a place to start to assess the potential costs of climate change, at least in the initial years, and to plan for adaptation.

Principles from the field of urban forestry are mainstreamed into urban planning, but little is known about effective tools for the successful implementation of new UFs. This article presents explorative research comparing how three cities (Almere, Madrid, and Boston) are dealing with the planning of a UF project, and their alignment with distinct organisational and typological interpretations of a UF. We employed a mixed-methods approach to gain insights into the main goals of the project, their organisational structure, and the employed planning process through the analysis of project documents and expert interviews. Our results point to an effective mainstreaming of environmental questions among stakeholders, but also indicate a poor development of objective criteria for the success of a UF. We note that municipal planners circumvented current internal rigidities and barriers by relying on intermediaries and local academia as providers of external knowledge, or by facilitating experiments. Finally, our results show that there may not be just one UF type to achieve the desired environmental and social goals and overcome implementation barriers. Conversely, each of the governance and organisational models behind the implementation of each type present collaborative and mainstreaming challenges. Therefore, we see an opportunity in further research examining processes and institutions towards the collaborative building of UFs that could bridge gaps between top-down and bottom-up approaches and activate different types of agencies.","[Sanz, Victor Munoz; Herdt, Tanja] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Urbanism, Delft, Netherlands; [Munoz, Sara Romero; Chaparro, Teresa Sanchez] Univ Politecn Madrid, Innovat & Technol Human Dev Ctr, Madrid, Spain; [Gomez, Lorena Bello] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Design, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Delft University of Technology; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Harvard University,"Sanz, VM (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Urbanism, Delft, Netherlands.",v.munozsanz@tudelft.nl,,"Sanchez-Chaparro, Teresa/0000-0003-3444-1501; Herdt, Tanja/0000-0003-2789-0667",,,,,66,1,1,2,5,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-7635,,,URBAN PLAN,Urban Plan.,,2022,7,2,,,,,202,213,,10.17645/up.v7i2.5039,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v7i2.5039,,,12,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,1W5DT,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000806794600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whereas the mitigation pillar is more developed and peer-reviewed literature can be found, adaptation is still lagging behind,not to mention the absence of information on the effectiveness of the CoM concerning the development of climate adaptation plans. This paper aims at presenting a thorough analysis of climate hazard data declared by CoM signatories as well as the degree of regional agreement of those signatories when reporting climate data. Thus, we assume that the signatories belonging to the same climate region should report similar climate hazard data for both current and future timeframes. Using a new statistical method for measuring the variability of categorical data, we determine that, overall, the signatories show low agreement within climate regions. Hence, we conclude that the CoM, in the corresponding part of climate risk assessment, is not as effective as it could be desired.Furthermore, several recommendations are proposed to improve the current reporting.","[Hernandez, Yeray; Naumann, Gustavo; Barbosa, Paulo] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Barbosa, P (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy.",paulo.barbosa@ec.europa.eu,,"Barbosa, Paulo/0000-0003-3023-3502",,,,,28,2,2,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,OCT,2020,6,10,,,,,,,e05043,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05043,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05043,,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,OK1DQ,33072902,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000584392300023,View Full Record in Web of Science

While these efforts are premised on the belief that citizen participation will lead to more effective climate responses, there remains limited empirical evidence of the relationship between local democracy and climate risk reduction. This paper asks: How, and through which processes, do local institutions emerge as more substantively democratic arenas to coordinate responses to climate risk and change? And how does the character of local democratic practice, in turn, influence the effectiveness of adaptive responses? To answer these questions, the paper analyzes the implementation of India's Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)-a substantial devolution of development resources to rural local governments in India-and its effects on climate risk reduction in the state of Himachal Pradesh. A primary data set of 798 small-scale development projects in 35 villages shows that a majority of water-related interventions are helping to improve water access in the face of water stress, while benefits skew towards poorer and historically marginalized social groups. Drawing on intensive qualitative enquiry, the paper argues that these outcomes were made possible as the result of long-term political transformations in the region, which have paved the way for more inclusive - if often contested - participation in local decision-making processes. The analysis underscores the need to move beyond a narrow focus on institutional building to undertake longer-term investments in supporting more robust subnational democratic systems. The growing flow of resources dedicated to climate assistance has the potential to help drive such processes where the nascent conditions for democratic deepening are in place. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Preventing meteorological disasters and coping with climate change necessitate understanding the characteristics and causes of extreme precipitation and its impact on ecosystems. In this study, the spatiotemporal characteristics of summer extreme precipitation in the WUA are analysed from 1961 to 2020. Then, NCEP reanalysis data and the relevant circulation index are used to explore the causes of extreme pre-cipitation. Finally, how extreme precipitation influences key ecosystem services, such as water yield, water regulation, and soil conservation, is investigated. The results reveal that (1) extreme precipitation in the WUA has shown an obvious upwards trend over the past 60 years. Huanggang, Xianning, Huangshi, Wuhan, and E'zhou city demonstrate the highest values. The extreme precipitation increased significantly after 1980s, especially the R97.5P and PRCPTOT with change rate of 12.1 mm/10a and 18.82 mm/10a respectively. (2) Atmospheric circulation variation is a dominant factor affecting extreme precipitation in the WUA and causes the meridional distribution of the + - + wave train in eastern China. The intensity and location of the Western Pacific subtropical high are closely related to extreme precip-itation. Furthermore, the weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon circulation is also conducive to the occurrence of extreme precipitation. (3) The spatial distribution of water yield and runoff retention in abnormal extreme precip-itation years are similar to the variation patterns of the total amount of extreme precipitation. Water yield and runoff retention in high-value extreme precipitation years are higher than that in low-value extreme precipitation years, while soil conservation shows no difference. In addition, ecosystem services have a synergistic relationship in high-value areas and a trade-off relationship in low-value areas. This study can contribute to the understanding of extreme precipitation in the WUA and its interaction with ecosystem services.","[Dai, Xin; Wang, Lunche; Li, Xin; Cao, Qian] China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Hunan Key Lab Remote Sensing Ecol Environm Dongtin, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Dai, Xin; Wang, Lunche; Li, Xin; Cao, Qian] China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Hubei Key Lab Reg Ecol & Environm Change, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Gong, Jie] China Univ Geosci, Inst Geol Survey, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lunche] China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences,"Wang, LC (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Hunan Key Lab Remote Sensing Ecol Environm Dongtin, Wuhan, Peoples R China.;Wang, LC (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Hubei Key Lab Reg Ecol & Environm Change, Wuhan, Peoples R China.;Wang, LC (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",wang@cug.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for National Universities, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan;  [41975044];  [41925007];  [41771360];  [41801021]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for National Universities, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan; ; ; ; ","Acknowledgements This work is fi nancially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41975044, 41925007, 41771360, and 41801021) and the Fundamental Research Funds for National Universities, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan.

We seek to contribute to the debate on whether environmental adversity tends to be positively or negatively related to adaptation. We propose that both diverging perspectives tend to predict part of firms' adaptation to nature adversity intensity. This is because of the interplay between latent counterbalancing mechanisms. First, at mild levels of nature adversity intensity, organizational inertial forces constrain organizations' willingness to adapt. Second, at medium levels of nature adversity intensity, coalition building and internal organizational politics allow managers to deploy adaptation resilience capabilities. Third, at severe levels, growing natural forces eventually impose limits beyond which protective adaptation becomes unviable. Our findings from a 2001 to 2013 analysis of western U.S. ski resorts' adaptation to temperature conditions indicate that firms facing medium levels of nature adversity intensity appear more likely to engage in higher levels of adaptation whereas those experiencing lower and higher intensity show a tendency for lower levels of adaptation, yielding an inverted U-shaped relationship.","[Rivera, Jorge] George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Dept Strateg Management & Publ Policy, Washington, DC USA; [Clement, Viviane] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",George Washington University; The World Bank,"Rivera, J (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Dept Strateg Management & Publ Policy, Strateg Management & Publ Policy, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",jrivera@gwu.edu,,,,,,,72,17,17,6,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0964-4733,1099-0836,,BUS STRATEG ENVIRON,Bus.

This bottom-up strategy represents an alternative to the prolonged reliance on, and widespread ineffectiveness of, mitigation methods to halt climate change, in addition to the exacerbation of vulnerability resulting from top-down adaptation approaches. Yet despite the promises of this alternative approach, the efficacy of community-based adaptation remains unknown. Its potential to reduce vulnerability within communities remains a significant gap in knowledge, largely due to limited participatory evaluations with those directly affected by these initiatives, to determine the success and failure of project design, implementation, outcomes and long-term impact. This paper seeks to close this gap by undertaking an in-depth evaluation of multiple community-based adaptation projects in Tanna Island, Vanuatu and exploring community attitudes and behavioural changes. This study found that future community-based adaptation should integrate contextual specificities and gender equality frameworks into community-based adaptation design and implementation, as well as recognise and complement characteristics of local resilience and innovation. In doing this, the critical importance of looking beyond assumptions of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) as homogenous, primarily vulnerable to climate change and lacking resilience, was also recognised.","[Clarke, Tahlia; McNamara, Karen E.; Clissold, Rachel] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Nunn, Patrick D.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Social Sci, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland; University of the Sunshine Coast,"McNamara, KE (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",tahlia.clarke@uq.net.au; karen.mcnamara@uq.edu.au; rachel.clissold@uq.net.au; pnunn@usc.edu.au,"Nunn, Patrick D./C-7864-2011","Nunn, Patrick D./0000-0001-9295-5741",ARC [LP160100941]; CARE in Vanuatu; Australian Research Council [LP160100941] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,ARC(Australian Research Council); CARE in Vanuatu; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Many thanks to the communities of Imaio and Waisisi, Vanuatu, for their warm hospitality and invaluable participation.

Given China's largest installed capacity globally, assessing climate impacts on diverse power infrastructures will yield critical risk information and support climate-resilient policymaking. However, lacking detailed plant-level data and ignoring the integrated infrastructural management of adaptation and mitigation priorly impede an in-depth evaluation. By employing high-coverage and-resolution plant-level data and the outputs of six CMIP6 models, we evaluate the pending climate impacts on five power-production sources at the interprovincial and plant levels in China. We find a pervasive negative impact on China's power sector, and the adverse effects expand over time (short-term: 214-342 TWh, long-term: 268-397 TWh, 25-75% quantile). For different future scenarios, the greater the radiative forcing, the greater the loss of power generation. Fossil-related production loss will completely offset the gain in most provinces from renewable power, with an overall negative impact in these regions. Besides, two evident phenomena occur: First, spatial heterogeneity appears across diverse provinces; second, a critical minority of China's plants with a low capacity share contribute to the main body of climate impacts. We consider the need for a targeted coal decommissioning strategy for climate adaptation.","[Huang, Chen; Zhu, Yuyao; Ren, Ming; Dai, Hancheng] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Chen; Zhu, Yuyao; Ren, Ming] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Zhang, Pei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yingchao] Shandong Technol & Business Univ, Econ Sch, Yantai, Peoples R China; [Tan, Xianchun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China","Peking University; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Shandong Technology & Business University; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Tan, XC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",txc@casisd.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72140007, 72004122, 72073003, 71810107001]; Youth Academic Program in Area Studies of Peking University [7101602310]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [G2021202013]; Hong Kong RGC-CRF [C7041-21G]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Academic Program in Area Studies of Peking University; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province); Hong Kong RGC-CRF,"Financial support was obtained from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72140007, 72004122, 72073003, 71810107001), the Youth Academic Program in Area Studies of Peking University (7101602310), the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (G2021202013), and the Hong Kong RGC-CRF (C7041-21G).",,52,0,0,8,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

J,"Alexandra, J",,,,"Alexandra, Jason",,,The science and politics of climate risk assessment in Australia's Murray Darling Basin,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate risk; Adaptive water governance; Water reform; River basin planning; Murray Darling Basin,POLICY; UNCERTAINTY; CRISIS,"Climate change has many disruptive consequences, particularly in large river basins experiencing drying trends and declining water availability. With pressure for more adaptive policies, understanding how institutions governing water are adapting to climate risks has broad international relevance. This paper examines the challenges of climate risk assessments in Australia's Murray Darling Basin, an economically and culturally important basin where national legislation mandates a Basin Plan based on the best available science. However, despite repeated scientific warnings about a drying climate, the current Basin Plan does not reduce estimates of water resources available, and its climate risk management relies on a bricolage of policy mechanisms, which appear insufficient for the magnitude of predicted changes. This paper outlines the findings of original research exploring why this occurred. It draws on interviews with 30 senior public policy professionals and researchers with deep experience in climate and water policy. The interview data indicate that minimising political risks were the principal reasons for abandoning proposed reductions in entitlements and for relying on historical averages for estimating water availability. As the reform process evolved, decisions about water-planning techniques became increasingly politicised, and the adoption of explicit climate adaptation measures became problematic. As a result, the Basin Plan neither reflects the broad scientific consensus about climate change nor makes specific allowances for declining water availability. Climate risks are downplayed while concerns about levels of scientific uncertainties appear overstated. Importantly, lessons emerge from this examination that could contribute to the revisions of the Plan, scheduled for 2026. More generally, the research finds that proactive climate adaptation policies for large river basins require sustained and well-designed institutional reforms, particularly the adoption of legally prescribed procedures for utilising science and accounting for its use in controversial environmental reforms.","[Alexandra, Jason] Alexandra & Associates, 16 Homestead Rd Eltham, Melbourne, Vic 3095, Australia; [Alexandra, Jason] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Alexandra, J (corresponding author), Alexandra & Associates, 16 Homestead Rd Eltham, Melbourne, Vic 3095, Australia.",jason@alexandra-consulting.com,,"Alexandra, Jason/0000-0002-9624-1698",,,,,57,14,14,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

It is an important method of soil carbon sequestration, having positive effects on stabilizing productivity and coping with climate change. This paper, by taking the soil of Pinus massoniana forests of different ages as the object, researched the soil aggregates' distribution characteristics and carbon sequestration mechanism. The results show that for the 20-year-old Pinus massoniana forest, the content of soil aggregates decreases with the decrease of aggregates' particle size in different soil depths; for the 60-year-old Pinus massoniana forest, the overall percentage content of soil aggregates is similar to that of the 40-year-old Pinus massoniana forests in terms of distribution, but has some differences in the value. The percentage of aggregates with a particle size of 2.00 mm changes significantly, from approximately 16.00% to more than 20.00% (except for the 60-80 cm soil layer). The soil aggregates with different particle sizes are mainly dominated by aggregates with a particle size of 10.00 mm, followed by aggregates with a particle size of 2.00 mm. The new organic matter in Pinus massoniana forests promotes the formation of coarse aggregates, and the particulate organic matter in coarse aggregates helps the formation of fine aggregates. The coarse aggregates can physically protect the newly added organic carbon in Pinus massoniana forests, but the protection has a saturation limit. With increasing forest age, the saturated limit of coarse aggregates would be broken under the combined action of internal and external forces, and fine aggregates would then be released. The research results will provide theoretical and methodological support for the study of aggregates' organic carbon and promote the sustainable development of forest soil carbon sequestration and emission reduction technology.","[HE, H.

In this study, heuristic approaches including Co-Active Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS), Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were utilized to predict the hydrological drought based on multi-scalar Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) at Naula and Kedar stations located in upper Ramganga River basin, Uttarakhand State, India. The SDI was calculated on 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 24-month time scales (SDI-1, SDI-3, SDI-6, SDI-9, SDI-12, and SDI-24) using monthly streamflow data of 33 years (1975-2007). The significant input variables (lags) for CANFIS, MLPNN, and MLR models were derived using autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions (ACF &PACF) at 5% significance level on SDI-1, SDI-3, SDI-6, SDI-9, SDI-12 and SDI-24 data series. The predicted values of multi-scalar SDI using CANFIS, MLPNN and MLR models were compared with the calculated values, based on root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of correlation (COC) and Willmott index (WI). The visual interpretation was also made using line diagram, scatter diagram and Taylor diagram (TD). The results of analysis revealed that the performance of CANFIS models was the best for hydrological drought prediction at 3-, 6- and 12-month time scales for Naula station, and at 1-, 3-, 12- and 24-month time scales for Kedar station; while MLPNN was the best at 1- and 9-month time scales for Naula station, and at 6- and 9-month time scales for Kedar station. The MLR model was found to be the best at 24-month time scale for Naula station only. The results of this study could be helpful in prediction of hydrological drought on multiple time scales and decision making for remedial schemes to cope with hydrological drought at Naula and Kedar stations.","[Malik, Anurag; Kumar, Anil] GB Pant Univ Agr & Technol, Coll Technol, Dept Soil & Water Conservat Engn, Pantnagar 263145, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Rajesh P.] GB Pant Univ Agr & Technol, Coll Technol, Dept Irrigat & Drainage Engn, Pantnagar 263145, Uttar Pradesh, India",Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture Technology; Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture Technology,"Malik, A (corresponding author), GB Pant Univ Agr & Technol, Coll Technol, Dept Soil & Water Conservat Engn, Pantnagar 263145, Uttar Pradesh, India.",anuragmalik_swce2014@rediffmail.com,"Malik, Anurag/AAF-5402-2020; Kumar, Anil/HJB-2850-2022; KUMAR, ANIL/ACD-8340-2022; Boothapati, Anil Kumar/HHS-1813-2022","Malik, Anurag/0000-0002-0298-5777; Kumar, Anil/0000-0002-5817-5829; ",,,,,45,49,51,3,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Agriculture is one of the most climate sensitive sectors because of its dependence on rain-fed cultivation. This paper identifies the main adaptation strategies used by farming households in the Sudan savannah and forest-savannah transitional agro-ecological zones of Ghana, in order to reduce the adverse impacts of climate variability on their livelihood activities. It combines questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews and a range of participatory methods. Results show that households employ a range of on- and off-farm adaptation strategies including changing the timing of planting, planting early maturing varieties, diversification of crops, support from family and friends, and changing their diets to manage climate variability. Results reveal that most households use adaptation strategies linked to livelihood diversification to adapt to the increased climate variability seen in recent decades. Most households now engage in multiple non-arable farming livelihood activities in an attempt to avoid destitution because of crop failure linked to climate variability (particularly drought). The findings suggest that policy makers need to formulate more targeted climate adaptation policies and programmes that are linked to enhancing livelihood diversification, as well as establishing communication routes for farming communities to better share their knowledge on successful local climate adaptation strategies.","[Antwi-Agyei, Philip; Stringer, Lindsay C.; Dougill, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Antwi-Agyei, Philip] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana",University of Leeds; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Antwi-Agyei, P (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana.",eepaa@leeds.ac.uk,"Antwi-Agyei, Philip/AAI-7392-2020","Antwi-Agyei, Philip/0000-0002-8599-474X; Dougill, Andrew/0000-0002-3422-8228; Stringer, Lindsay/0000-0003-0017-1654","Commonwealth Scholarships, UK; International Foundation for Science (IFS); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Commonwealth Scholarships, UK; International Foundation for Science (IFS)(International Foundation for Science); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This study was funded by the Commonwealth Scholarships, UK and the International Foundation for Science (IFS).

A form pipiens s. s. (anautogeous pipiens) has been confirmed only in westernmost China. A temperate form pollens and a subtropical and tropical form quinquefasciatus are connected with intermediates in morphology and many aspects of ecology, but their difference is rather clear in climatic adaptation traits. The distribution of a form molestus overlaps with pallens and, in Taiwan, quinquefasciatus, and, in East Asia, this form requires artificial underground habitats for its persistence. The origin and interrelation of 3 forms other than pipiens s. s. are considered from ecological aspects, especially climatic adaptation. A hypothesis is presented that molestus was originally a form having adapted to the Mediterranean climate in the western Palaearctic, secondarily colonized artificial underground habitats, and reached East Asia in the early 20th century by ships from North America. At present, it is difficult to assign pallens with certainty to either the old or new groups of the Manchurian mosquito fauna. Three hypotheses about the interrelation between pallet's and quinquefasciatus are compared, and the strengths and problems of each hypothesis are indicated. Finally, a map to show the distribution of the forms of the Culex pipiens complex before it was extensively changed by humans is presented as an initial trial. The Culex pipiens problems now troubling humans are largely human-made problems.","Saga Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pathol & Biodef, Div Parasitol, Saga 8498501, Japan",Saga University,"Mogi, M (corresponding author), Saga Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pathol & Biodef, Div Parasitol, Nabeshima 5-1-1, Saga 8498501, Japan.",,,,,,,,185,8,8,0,14,AMER MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOC,MOUNT LAUREL,"15000 COMMERCE PARKWAY, SUITE C, MOUNT LAUREL, NJ 08054 USA",8756-971X,1943-6270,,J AM MOSQUITO CONTR,J.

This research interrogates various factors which affect the success of agriculture in the area, specifically the Nasia sub-basin, to suggest prudent water management strategies which will be required to adequately adapt to the impacts of climate change. The research evaluates the irrigation water requirements of the major staple crops in the area in the context of a changing climate, and the implications on available groundwater resources to support small-scale irrigation. The study then proceeds to use a robust geostatistical technique to estimate the spatial variations in the thickness and characteristics of the regolith in the Nasia sub-basin since the latter plays an important role in the hydrogeological characteristics and the groundwater resources potential of the rocks of the Neoproterozoic Voltaian Supergroup. The variography conducted on the regolith thicknesses in the area suggests a high level of spatial variability within short distances, consistent with the nature of the underlying geology. The models suggest that the older, sandstone formations in the north of the terrain are associated with thicker regolith compared to the finer grained, younger formations in the south. Locations of thick regolith are generally regarded as areas of high promise in terms of shallow groundwater-based irrigation. Based on local conditions which dictate the crop types cultivated during the major cropping season, this research has computed crop coefficients for four crops (i.e., millet, maize, groundnut, and rice). The analysis suggests that the crop water requirements for the various staple crops are sensitive to variations in climatic conditions and will respond to increasing temperatures and evapotranspiration rates as predicted by climate models over the sub-region. This research recommends further detailed hydrogeological research which builds on the predicted variations in regolith thickness and characteristics already identified here. This will facilitate a proper delineation of prolific groundwater-bearing units within shallow, easily accessible depths to support smallholder irrigation in the area.","[Fynn, Obed Fiifi] CSIR, Water Res Inst, Accra, Ghana; [Dzikunoo, Elikplim Abla; Chegbeleh, Larry Pax; Yidana, Sandow Mark] Univ Ghana, Dept Earth Sci, Legon, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Dzikunoo, EA (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Dept Earth Sci, Legon, Accra, Ghana.",eadzikunoo@ug.edu.gh,,"Dzikunoo, Elikplim Abla/0000-0001-6307-227X",Danida Fellowship Center [14-P02-GHA],Danida Fellowship Center,AcknowledgementsThis research was funded in its entirety by the Danida Fellowship Center through grant Number 14-P02-GHA (Groundwater Development and Sustainable Agriculture).

In this study, mobile measurement of the air temperature (Ta) was conducted in summer (July 2021) and winter (December 2021 and January 2022) in an urban area near Huangpu River in Shanghai, China. Four factors: river proximity, ventilation, urban morphology and land use were considered as the potential drivers. A GeoDetector Model (GDM) was used to investigate the contributions of these drivers and their interactions for the uneven distri-bution of Ta. This study identified that in both seasons, the Ta distribution at block scale showed spatiotemporal variation and exhibited different degrees of stratified heterogeneity at the levels of four potential drivers. En-hancements were found between pairs among the drivers, with maximum explanatory power reaching 96% and 82% for the summer and winter Ta distributions, respectively, suggesting that the thermal environment of the riverfront is driven by a combination of factors. The dominant factors include river proximity, urban morphology and land use, and the urban morphology factor can strongly influence the regulation effect of the river.

We sought to better understand how adaptation is being incorporated in land management decision-making across diverse land ownership types in the Midwest by evaluating project-level adaptation plans from a suite of forest management projects developed through the Climate Change Response Framework. We used quantitative content analysis to evaluate 44 adaptation-planning documents developed through the Framework's Adaptation Workbook within two ecoregional provinces of the Midwest. This approach was used to assess the components of adaptation planning, including the resources that adaptation actions targeted within planning documents, the climate changes and impacts of concern, and the adaptation strategies managers identified. Analyses of adaptation plans show that the most frequent climate changes and impacts of concern included alterations in the amount and timing of precipitation, increased vegetation moisture stress, and forest pest and pathogen impacts. Individual projects identified a diversity of adaptation options, rather than focusing singly on actions that aimed to resist climate impacts, enhance resilience, or transition systems. Multivariate analyses indicate that ecoregion and land ownership influenced adaptation planning, while the type of resources and the climate change impacts managers were concerned with were significantly correlated with the adaptation strategies selected during planning. This finding reinforces the idea that one-size-fits-all guidance on adaptation will be insufficient for land managers. Perceptions of relevant climate impacts differ based on regional and ownership contexts, which naturally leads to differences in preferred adaptation actions.","[Ontl, Todd A.; Swanston, Chris; Shannon, P.

Objectives We aimed to transcend the existing research logic (from case studies to obtain the patterns of the cooling effect of UGI, then propose implications for UHI mitigation) and established a hypothetical idealized urban thermal security pattern model (TSPurban). Methods Based on two basic concepts deduced from the physical property of UGI-(threshold) size and cooling distance, as well as the simplifying assumptions we defined. Then, three proposed conceptual UGI types (ecological, efficient, and elementary-3E) and subtypes were used to frame the model. Results We deduced that the idealized TSPurban model conforms to a hierarchical hexagonal structure in theory and it can be calculated and applied, although it generally cannot be seen in the real world. Conclusions The idealized TSPurban model can help us better-understanding UGI cooling effects when considering climate adaption planning and decision-making; it also serves as a novel pathway to study the cooling effects of UGI and mitigate the UHI effect.","[Yu, Zhaowu; Fryd, Ole; Jorgensen, Gertrud; Yang, Gaoyuan; Ozdil, Nevruz Cinar; Vejre, Henrik] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Yu, Zhaowu; Sun, Ranhao] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhaowu] Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecorestorat, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Copenhagen; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES),"Yu, ZW (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark.",zhyu@ign.ku.dk,", Zhaowu/E-8032-2016; sun, ranhao/AAM-6837-2021; Gaoyuan, Yang/HKO-4087-2023; Ozdil, Nevruz Cinar/D-9037-2015; Vejre, Henrik/P-7142-2014; Jorgensen, Gertrud/B-1396-2015",", Zhaowu/0000-0003-4576-4541; sun, ranhao/0000-0003-2396-5131; Ozdil, Nevruz Cinar/0000-0001-7128-7625; Vejre, Henrik/0000-0002-6820-0389; Jorgensen, Gertrud/0000-0003-3987-3098; Yang, Gaoyuan/0000-0001-9735-6529",Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology of China [SKLURE2019-2-6]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41922007]; Shanghai Key Lab for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration [SHUES2019A01]; China Scholarship Council [201504910797],Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Key Lab for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),This work was financially supported by Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology of China (Grant No. SKLURE2019-2-6); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41922007); Shanghai Key Lab for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration (Grant No. SHUES2019A01); WEL Visiting Fellowship Program; China Scholarship Council (Grant No. 201504910797).

(2) The complementarity of multi-subjects in resources and capabilities is key force for the formation of LCEFT collaborative innovation alliance and an important source of additional benefits for innovation subjects. (3) Subsidy and punishment mechanisms implemented by government will also actively promote multi-subject cooperation, which is conducive to collaborative innovation of LCEFT, but not an overall optimal strategy.

Perceptions and activities related to past and future dry periods was investigated through interviews with managers at the ten major English and Welsh water supply/sewerage companies, and several smaller, water-only companies. Several of the companies report that they have observed a trend towards drier summers in their regions, and a number of companies say that they have observed a change towards more intensive rainfall of shorter duration. Recent supply measures in a number of regions have been aimed at improving storage and distribution related to the perceived change in rainfall intensity. A new requirement to incorporate regional climate change scenarios in future supply assumptions appears to have had little impact on planning in the region to date. Many water resource planners believe that the scenarios generated are too aggregated and do not encourage a precautionary approach to planning. Some managers believe that records of historical drought conditions, such as experienced in 1933/1934 or 1995/1996, as worst-case scenarios provide a better basis for planning.","Univ E Anglia, CSERGE, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Subak, S (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, CSERGE, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,,,,,,,20,24,24,0,15,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

The purpose of this work is to quantify the water balance and dynamics in the unsaturated zone by means of daily measurements of different meteorological parameters and the moisture profiles of a soil that was treated to conservation practices in the Independence Aquifer (Upper La Laja River Basin tributary of the Lerma-Chapala). The stratigraphy of the site was obtained through continuous records of electrical conductivity and granulometry in unaltered soil samples - to which physical properties and organic matter content were determined - in their first 2.50 m depth. The changes in moisture content at 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, 0.90 and 1.20 m were controlled by Time Domain Refractometry (TDR). The saturated permeability was quantified with the Guelph Permeameter, complemented with infiltration tests. A one-dimensional numerical model was used to develop predictive tools. The results indicate that progressive capture of carbon occurred and that a saturated hydraulic conductivity of up to Kfs=5 m.d(-1) has been reached, in the first 0.60 m of depth, which contrasts up to two orders of magnitude with traditional soil management; allowing the gradual filtering of a total water sheet of 6,753 mm for three days, which would cover any sequence of maximum rainfall events recorded in the region. The RDT sensors showed a rapid increase in moisture content along the profile, indicating that the characteristics obtained in the soil allow the immediate input and storage of rainwater, with a minimum evaporation rate and zero runoff. The present work demonstrates that it is feasible to favor the infiltration of sufficient rainwater for the production of staple and fodder crops and to reduce the impacts of negative incidents because of climate change. This applies to irrigation crops, which would allow the progressive reduction of groundwater extraction, by more than 50%, through adequate conservation practices, a fundamental aspect in the management of the aquifer.","[Aguilar-Garcia, Ramon] Inst Nacl Invest Forestales Agr & Pecuarias, Campo Expt Norte Guanajuato, Km 67 Carretera Queretaro San Luis Potosi N-A, Guanajuato, Mexico; [Adrian Ortega-Guerrero, M.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Geociencias, Campus UNAM Juriquilla,Blvd Juriquilla 3001, Queretaro 76230, Qro, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Ortega-Guerrero, MA (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Geociencias, Campus UNAM Juriquilla,Blvd Juriquilla 3001, Queretaro 76230, Qro, Mexico.",maog@geociencias.unam.mx,,,,,,,54,4,4,2,15,CENTRO GEOCIENCIAS UNAM,QUERETARO,"CENTRO GEOCIENCIAS, UNAM, CAMPUS JURIQUILLA, QUERETARO, QRO 76230, MEXICO",1026-8774,2007-2902,,REV MEX CIENC GEOL,Rev.

When mitigation falters, adaptation to current and anticipated future climate conditions becomes increasingly urgent. This study provides a novel collection of adaptive capacity and adaptation readiness indicators, which it aggregates into a composite adaptation index to assess the relative adaptation performance of nations. Adaptation performance is assessed using two complementary techniques, a distance to frontier analysis and a dominance analysis. Developed countries perform relatively well and developing countries perform relatively poorly in both exercises. Adaptation performance is found to be closely and positively related to both national income per capita and greenhouse gas emissions per capita, highlighting the inequities of global adaptation performance. These adaptation inequities are consistent with the IPCC assessment that nations most affected by climate change are those that are least able to adapt and contribute least to the problem, creating a need for assistance from developed countries.","[Edmonds, Heidi K.; Lovell, C.

This article surveys the multiple components of food security, particularly those relating to access and utilization, which are threatened by the complex responses of food systems to the impacts of climate change. Food security can only be ensured and enhanced with a suite of interventions across activities, ranging from production to distribution and allocation. Although many studies have demonstrated the importance of policy and institutional interventions for ensuring food security after a shock, the climate change impacts and adaptation community have been slow to pick up on these lessons. This article pulls together lessons from the literature on the type of institutional interventions that could be strengthened to enable adaptation in the food system to buffer against climate change at multiple levels, from the local to the global level.

They struggle with defining the urgency of heat stress and finding good arguments for the need to adapt urban environments to rising temperatures. In order to provide urban professionals with reasons to adapt their urban environments to heat, we analyzed the potential impacts of urban heat from international policy reports and scientific literature. We summarized the impacts in a mind map. This map visualizes the large number and variety of heat-related risks. They can be subdivided into risks for health, open space, liveability, water and infrastructure networks.

Anticipatory planning to adapt to the impacts of climate change usually follows a number of steps: assess current and future vulnerability, identify potential adaptations, prioritize options, implement prioritized options, and monitor and evaluate implementation. While most of these steps are well documented, there has been limited examination of the process of adaptation prioritization in Arctic communities. In this paper, we build upon existing tools and propose a framework for prioritizing adaptation options and guiding decision-making for implementation in Arctic regions. Using four adaptation performance criteria (timescale, equity, sustainability and total costs) to evaluate options through a multi-criteria decision analysis coupled with a network centric approach, our Adaptation Prioritization Framework promotes a participatory approach for adaptation prioritization and planning. We illustrate application of the framework using a hypothetical example from the territory of Nunavut in the Canadian Arctic.","[Champalle, Clara; Ford, James D.; Sherman, Mya] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada",McGill University,"Champalle, C (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",clara.champalle@mail.mcgill.ca; james.ford@mcgill.ca; Mya.Sherman@mail.mcgill.ca,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456",Operating Grant; Applied Public Health Chair from the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); International Development Research Centre (IDRC); ArcticNet,Operating Grant; Applied Public Health Chair from the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); International Development Research Centre (IDRC); ArcticNet,"The work was funded by an Operating Grant and Applied Public Health Chair from the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and ArcticNet.",,76,18,19,2,44,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2015,7,7,,,,,9268,9292,,10.3390/su7079268,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su7079268,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CQ1JU,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000360354500060,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the aid of the fuzzy cognitive maps constructed by 427 community groups with 4-5 members in each group, drawn from 96 villages in 12 districts of arid and semi-arid India, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of various adaptation pathways. The ongoing adaptations in arid and semi-arid India face adaptation deficits. The FCM-based simulations revealed that integrated adaptation measures that embrace nature-based solutions, including integrated water resource management, natural farming-assisted soil rejuvenation, and improved agricultural productivity are most likely to enhance the resilience of small and marginalised farming communities to climate variability and change. Facilitation of such adaptation measures requires inclusive and adaptive local institutions, sufficient financial assistance, and climate information services. Besides, gender-nuanced, inclusive, and adaptive governance and processes would be helpful for the implementation of appropriate adaptation interventions in arid and semi-arid drylands worldwide. Hence policy-makers must enable polycentric and adaptive governance, and inclusive institutions and processes. The emphasis on multiple factors in a socio-ecological system often makes it difficult to understand the critical role of a particular factor. However, the FCM-based simulations in this study helped us overcome such limitations.

Transformation of agricultural systems, for example switching crop types or moving out of agriculture, is projected to be necessary in some cases(3-5). However, little attention has been paid to the timing of these transformations. Here, we develop a temporal uncertainty framework using the CMIP5 ensemble to assess when and where cultivation of key crops in sub-Saharan Africa becomes unviable. We report potential transformational changes for all major crops during the twenty-first century, as climates shift and areas become unsuitable. For most crops, however, transformation is limited to small pockets (<15% of area), and only for beans, maize and banana is transformation more widespread (similar to 30% area for maize and banana, 60% for beans). We envisage three overlapping adaptation phases to enable projected transformational changes: an incremental adaptation phase focused on improvements to crops and management, a preparatory phase that establishes appropriate policies and enabling environments, and a transformational adaptation phase in which farmers substitute crops, explore alternative livelihoods strategies, or relocate. To best align policies with production triggers for no-regret actions, monitoring capacities to track farming systems as well as climate are needed.","[Rippke, Ulrike; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian; Jarvis, Andy; Parker, Louis; Mer, Flora] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira, Cali 763537, Colombia; [Rippke, Ulrike; Diekkrueger, Bernd] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian; Challinor, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian; Jarvis, Andy; Vermeulen, Sonja J.; Challinor, Andrew J.] Agr & Food Secur CCAFS, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira, Cali 763537, Colombia; [Vermeulen, Sonja J.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Rolighedsvej 21, DK-1958 Frederiskberg C, Denmark; [Howden, Mark] CSIRO Agr, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Howden, Mark] Australian Natl Univ, Climate Change Inst, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University of Bonn; University of Leeds; CGIAR; University of Copenhagen; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University,"Ramirez-Villegas, J (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira, Cali 763537, Colombia.;Ramirez-Villegas, J (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Ramirez-Villegas, J (corresponding author), Agr & Food Secur CCAFS, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira, Cali 763537, Colombia.",j.r.villegas@cgiar.org,"Diekkrüger, Bernd/D-9410-2013; Howden, Stuart M/C-1138-2008; Challinor, Andrew/AAK-3023-2020; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/AAY-8073-2020; Challinor, Andrew J/C-4992-2008; Jarvis, Andy/K-5516-2013","Diekkrüger, Bernd/0000-0001-9234-7850; Howden, Stuart M/0000-0002-0386-9671; Challinor, Andrew/0000-0002-8551-6617; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/0000-0002-8044-583X; Challinor, Andrew J/0000-0002-8551-6617; Jarvis, Andy/0000-0001-6543-0798","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT); CMIP; US Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT); CMIP; US Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This study was funded by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and by a Young Scientist Innovation Grant from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) awarded to J.R.-V.

Researchers worked closely with the City of Prince George, in Central British Columbia, Canada, to build on existing work and explore how the City could plan, design, and maintain roads and other structures to account for climate change. A local steering committee was formed, and created and evaluated 23 potential research topics. Two focus areas were selected for further investigation and explored during a workshop with practitioners, researchers, consultants and other representatives. The workshop precipitated an investigation of projected impacts of climate change on road maintenance and road safety, and plans to explore alternative paving techniques.

Reducing tariffs and other barriers to international trade would mitigate this, but trade integration requires a careful approach to avoid reducing domestic food security in food-exporting regions. International trade enables us to exploit regional differences in climate change impacts and is increasingly regarded as a potential adaptation mechanism. Here, we focus on hunger reduction through international trade under alternative trade scenarios for a wide range of climate futures. Under the current level of trade integration, climate change would lead to up to 55 million people who are undernourished in 2050. Without adaptation through trade, the impacts of global climate change would increase to 73 million people who are undernourished (+33%). Reduction in tariffs as well as institutional and infrastructural barriers would decrease the negative impact to 20 million (-64%) people. We assess the adaptation effect of trade and climate-induced specialization patterns. The adaptation effect is strongest for hunger-affected import-dependent regions. However, in hunger-affected export-oriented regions, partial trade integration can lead to increased exports at the expense of domestic food availability. Although trade integration is a key component of adaptation, it needs sensitive implementation to benefit all regions.","[Janssens, Charlotte; Van Lipzig, Nicole; Maertens, Miet] Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Heverlee, Belgium; [Janssens, Charlotte; Havlik, Petr; Krisztin, Tamas; Frank, Stefan; Hasegawa, Tomoko; Leclere, David; Valin, Hugo] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, Laxenburg, Austria; [Baker, Justin] RTI Int, Durham, NC USA; [Hasegawa, Tomoko] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Kusatsu, Japan; [Ohrel, Sara; Ragnauth, Shaun] US EPA, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Schmid, Erwin] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria","KU Leuven; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Research Triangle Institute; Ritsumeikan University; United States Environmental Protection Agency; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Janssens, C (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Heverlee, Belgium.;Janssens, C (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, Laxenburg, Austria.",charlotte.janssens@kuleuven.be,"Frank, Stefan/AAE-8070-2019; van Lipzig, Nicole/ABF-2964-2021; Hasegawa, Tomoko/AAB-2616-2019; Schmid, Erwin/Z-1946-2019; Krisztin, Tamás/ABE-1438-2020","Frank, Stefan/0000-0001-5702-8547; van Lipzig, Nicole/0000-0003-2899-4046; Hasegawa, Tomoko/0000-0003-2456-5789; Schmid, Erwin/0000-0003-4783-9666; Krisztin, Tamás/0000-0002-9241-8628; Maertens, Miet/0000-0001-7245-0375; Ragnauth, Shaun/0000-0001-8370-7025; Baker, Justin/0000-0002-9914-8421; Janssens, Charlotte/0000-0002-0252-9843; Ohrel, Sara/0000-0002-2583-5261; Leclere, David/0000-0002-8658-1509","Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) [180956/SW]; US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [BPA-12-H-0023, EP-B15H-0143]; EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [776479]; European Structural and Investments Funds [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16 _019/0000797]",Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO); US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(United States Environmental Protection Agency); EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; European Structural and Investments Funds,"We thank H.

There are multiple barriers to climate adaptation, including among others: the lack of the public understanding of risks, lack of leadership and availability of resources to adapt. In this study, we assess to what extent coastal residents understand their properties' flood risk, and what predicts their risk perception and adaptation behaviour. We surveyed 420 individuals in South East Queensland projected to be within the permanent or temporary flood zone in 2100 based on combined sea-level rise and storm surge scenarios. We assessed the correlations between the projected (i.e. objective) and perceived risk of inundation, adaptation behaviour, and the individual characteristics considered to influence risk perception and adaptation. While we found a correlation between perceived and some objective flood risks, perceived risk only partially reflected objective risk. Other factors that influenced risk perception were previous experience of flooding events, belief in climate change, risk aversion, age and gender. Factors driving risk perception varied with the type (permanent, temporary) and frequency of flooding event (1 in 20 or 1 in 100 years). Previous experience with extreme event impacts and belief in climate change influenced all future perceived risks. However, even after being impacted by an extreme event, adaptation was moderate (58 %). Personal as well as environmental factors influence the likelihood of adaptation. The moderate adaptation response within our case study is likely a result of most respondents considering large flooding events to be rare and of limited impact, and anticipating future government aid to overcome flooding damage costs. Existing attitudes towards risk, which influence the extent of proactive adaptation, should be of concern to governments who will likely be facing these costs at increasing frequencies.","[Mills, Morena; Adams, Vanessa M.; Archibald, Carla] Univ Queensland, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Mills, Morena; Mutafoglu, Konar; Leon, Javier X.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Mutafoglu, Konar] Inst European Environm Policy, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Bell, Justine] Univ Queensland, Sch Law, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Leon, Javier X.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of the Sunshine Coast,"Mills, M (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.;Mills, M (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",morena.mills@uq.edu.au,"Leon, Javier/J-3971-2012; Mills, Morena/AAD-8916-2019; Adams, Vanessa M./A-3834-2012; Mills, Morena/C-6546-2013","Leon, Javier/0000-0002-4201-5804; Adams, Vanessa M./0000-0002-3509-7901; Archibald, Carla/0000-0003-1640-8396; BELL-JAMES, Justine/0000-0001-7189-1259; Mills, Morena/0000-0001-9865-0770","Australian Research Council; ARC [FS100100024, FS110200005]; ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions; Australian Research Council [FS110200005, FS100100024] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); ARC(Australian Research Council); ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"All authors thank all those that participated in this study.

Warming, causing thawing of the permafrost soils of the tundra, contributes to the massive development of eggs and larvae of blood-sucking mosquitoes. From July 12 to July 28, the deer were attacked around the clock without a decrease in the number. With entomological registration, the number of mosquitoes ranged from 3,328 to 6,080 individuals. During this period, the deer suffered from acute entomosis and other diseases. Animals became uncontrollable, with the herd endlessly whirling in one place until a complete loss of strength. Up to a thousand or more animals perished. The use of veterinary technology to protect against mosquitoes rescues animals.

A five month measurement campaign was conducted to observe surface and air temperatures as well as dewfall dynamics and amounts on an urban green and co-located bitumen roof. Measurements were performed in the period from August to December 2012. Surface temperatures indicated differences of up to 17.4 K, which lead to measurable air temperature differences (Delta T-A) at a height of 0.5 m above roof level. During August afternoons (3 pm) the green roof air temperature (T-A) drops below T-A of the bitumen roof by up to 0.7 K on average. By using a linear regression based approach differences in sensible turbulent heat flux densities (Q(H)) between green and bitumen roof of 200 W m(-2) on a hot day with 30 degrees C and wind velocities of 2 m s(-1) were estimated. During the measurement campaign a total of 60 and 52 dew events were observed on the bitumen roof and the green roof, respectively. At both urban sites the number of dewfall events was distinctly smaller compared to the rural site (94 events). Roof dewfall turned out to be a negligible source in the green roof water balance compared to precipitation amounts. Inhibited dewfall on roofs could be one important factor for the phenomenon of urban moisture excess since roofs represent a high fraction of urban surfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular it remains unclear how MSPs can support the transition from agenda setting to implementation in response to multiple current and future pressures threatening the resilience of cities. Through the lens of the London Climate Change Partnership (LCCP) and drawing from other MSP examples, this paper investigates the scope for MSPs to enhance climate adaptation in an urban context. Our paper has two main aims: to expand understanding of the role of MSPs in the adaptation decision process in the context of the wider governance literature, and to shed some light on the complexities of transitioning through that process. To clarify the role of a MSP we propose a distinction between first generation and second generation MSPs, illustrating the progression from agenda-setting to implementation: first generation MSPs are focused on agenda setting and knowledge sharing in order to support decision makers, while second generation MSPs are aimed at implementing solutions. We consider this distinction from the perspective of the individual members and their perceptions, motivations, and expectations. We find that the dynamic nature of urban adaptation with a shifting focus from initial agenda setting toward the implementation of actions presents challenges for existing MSPs, particularly such long-established ones like the LCCP. Our investigation shows that first generation MSPs can play important roles in agenda setting, but finds little evidence of second generation MSPs achieving implementation.","[Surminski, Swenja] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Leck, Hayley] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; King's College London,"Surminski, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.",s.surminski@lse.ac.uk,,,European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme [308438]; LSE; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme; LSE; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper has been produced under the research project ENHANCE (Enhancing risk management partnerships for catastrophic natural disasters in Europe, http://enhanceproject.eu), funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme-Grant agreement no. 308438.

Next, the paper considers the way scientific uncertainty problematizes policies aimed at adaptation to CC & ASLR. It argues that the prevailing approach, which requires anticipation of impacts, is unsuccessful, and the paper proposes a complementary strategy aimed to enhance the resilience of whole island social-ecological systems.

These models are required to represent a large number of processes in different sectors, but face particular challenges in describing the individual and social behaviors that underpin climate change mitigation and adaptation. We assess descriptions of these behaviors in existing models, their commonalities and differences, and the uses to which they have been put. We find that behavioral models have a distinct and important role to play in climate research, but that they currently suffer from being strongly sectoral in nature, with agricultural models being the most common and behaviorally rich. There are also clear convergences, with economic-based decision-making remaining dominant and behaviors such as diffusion, interaction, anticipation, or learning remaining relatively neglected. Active climate change is also rarely modeled, with adaptation and mitigation generally represented as responses to economic drivers under static climatic conditions. Furthermore, dynamic behaviors, objectives, or decision-making processes are almost entirely absent, despite their clear relevance to climate change responses. We conclude that models have been more successful in the identification of important processes than in their implementation and that, while some behavioral processes may remain impossible to model, behavioral models of adaptation and mitigation in land-based sectors have substantial unexplored potential. We suggest that greater attention be paid to the cumulative coverage of models in this field, and that improvements in the representation of certain key behaviors be prioritized.

It intends to question the technological optimism inherent in mainstream climate change policy discourse by highlighting the multiple sources of vulnerabilities of smallholder peasants in Bangladesh. Using findings from a qualitative study, it demonstrates how smallholders in Bangladesh currently experience climate change through their everyday agricultural practices, and how climate change along with the ecosystem destruction from modern farming technologies adversely affects their livelihoods. Drawing on the recent literature on sustainable adaptation, this paper argues that any agricultural adaptation strategy in Bangladesh must analyse the vulnerabilities of farming communities at the intersection of their geographically specific exposure to climatic threats, the extent of their market participation and the socioecological implications of their technology adoption. It concludes that an eventual departure from the current rice monoculture pivoted on chemical dependence and an excessive use of natural resources is the prerequisite for a sustainable agricultural adaptation.","[Misra, Manoj] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Grad Sch Int & Area Studies, Dept UPEACE, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul 130791, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Misra, M (corresponding author), Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Grad Sch Int & Area Studies, Dept UPEACE, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul 130791, South Korea.",manoj.dhk@gmail.com,,,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,This work was supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund.,,47,18,18,3,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

While this might imply that adaptation would be straightforward, extensive public and private investments, as well as many traditional MAori assets and cultural values, are in areas increasingly at risk of flooding and sea level rise. In order to consider the country's adaptive capacity in more detail, we have used an empirical research approach, working with government practitioners at three levels and with MAori communities. Very different perceptions of risk, and structural inertia in planning processes have emerged as key issues for implementing adaptation responses. In particular, the use of static frameworks biases responses towards retrospective, rather than anticipatory analysis. Ongoing socioeconomic changes in New Zealand also raise the risk of structural effects caused by climate change impacts becoming unevenly distributed across society. Our analysis indicates that a national and regional strategic approach, centred on a dynamic view of climate risk, is necessary for effective decisions at the local government and community level. In addition, effective adaptation requires better identification of barriers and opportunities for addressing changing risk, together with more effective and continuous social engagement.","[Manning, Martin; Lawrence, Judy] Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [King, Darren Ngaru] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Maori Environm Res Ctr, Natl Climate Ctr, Auckland 1149, New Zealand; [Chapman, Ralph] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; Victoria University Wellington,"Manning, M (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",Martin.Manning@vuw.ac.nz; Judy.Lawrence@vuw.ac.nz; Darren.King@niwa.co.nz; Ralph.Chapman@vuw.ac.nz,"Lawrence, Judy/W-9823-2019","Lawrence, Judy/0000-0001-6798-3636; Chapman, Ralph/0000-0002-3437-8525","New Zealand Ministry for Science and Innovation (part of the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment) [VICX0805]; New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE) [VICX0805] Funding Source: New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)","New Zealand Ministry for Science and Innovation (part of the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment); New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE))","The authors acknowledge the many research participants from local governments and participating communities without whom this work could not have been undertaken.

The growing exposure to livelihood shocks from climate variability/change and limited resource base of the rural community to adapt has reinforced the need to mainstream climate adaptation planning into developmental landscape. However, a better understanding of micro-level perceptions is imperative for effective and informed planning at the macro-level. In this paper, the grass-root level perspectives on climate change impacts and adaptation decisions were elicited at farm level in the Moga district of Punjab and Mahbubnagar district of Telangana, India. The farmers opined that the climatic variability impacts more than the long-term climate change. They observed change in the quantum, onset and distribution of rainfall, rise in minimum as well as maximum temperature levels, decline in crop yield and ground water depletion. The key socio-economic effects of climate change included decline in farm income, farm unemployment, rural migration and increased indebtedness among farmers. In order to cope with climate variability and change thereon, farmers resorted to adaptation strategies such as use of crop varieties of suitable duration, water conservation techniques, crop insurance and participation in non-farm activities and employment guarantee schemes. Farmers' adaptation to changing climate was constrained by several technological, socio-economic and institutional barriers. These include limited knowledge on the costs-benefits of adaptation, lack of access to and knowledge of adaptation technologies, lack of financial resources and limited information on weather. Besides, lack of access to input markets, inadequate farm labour and smaller farm size were the other constraints. Further, on the basis of the grass-root elicitation a 'Need-Based Adaptation' planning incorporating farmers' perceptions on climate change impacts, constraints in the adoption of adaptation strategies and plausible adaptation options were linked with the most suitable ongoing programmatic interventions of the Government of India. The study concluded that micro-level needs and constraints for various adaptation strategies and interventions should be an integral part of the programme development, implementation and evaluation in the entire developmental paradigm.","[Singh, Naveen P.; Anand, Bhawna; Khan, Mohd Arshad] Natl Inst Agr Econ & Policy Res, ICAR, New Delhi 110012, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Institute of Agricultural Economics & Policy Research,"Singh, NP (corresponding author), Natl Inst Agr Econ & Policy Res, ICAR, New Delhi 110012, India.",naveenpsingh@gmail.com,"NIAP, LIBRARY ICAR/ABB-6258-2020; Khan, Mohd Arshad/AAO-5674-2021","Khan, Mohd Arshad/0000-0002-7952-4565; , Bhawna/0000-0001-9615-1433",,,,,39,24,25,14,50,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Primary data were obtained from randomly selected 405 households producing rice (Oryza sativa L.) in three provinces in the MDR. Simpson's diversity index was used to assess the level of diversification, multivariate probit regression was utilized to examine the factors affecting farmers' adoption of livelihood strategies, and tobit regression was employed to examine the factors influencing the extent of farmers' diversification. The index showed relatively low levels of livelihood diversification in the study area. The results of the multivariate probit regression analysis of four livelihood strategies indicated that farmers who were exposed to drought or flood were more likely to cultivate conventional rice varieties than newer cultivars, likely because the newer varieties accessible in the study areas were of the resource-using type that were high-yielding under favorable conditions but susceptible to environmental stresses. Furthermore, those prone to salinity intrusion tended to engage in off-farm income opportunities. In addition, the results of the tobit regression analysis exhibited significant effects of asset endowment, extension services, public transport availability, agricultural inputs, and cooperative membership on the extent of livelihood diversification. To enhance rural livelihoods in the MDR, intervention programs should ensure to provide the resource-saving type of improved varieties as well as promote off-farm employment in salt-affected areas.","[Ho, Tien D.

Despite a growing number of assessments on the national or global scale, there is still a need for regionalized studies with a high resolution to identify meso-scale vulnerability patterns. In this paper, we present an indicator-based assessment that was carried out in the Trinational Metropolitan Region Upper Rhine within the Interreg-V project Clim'Ability. The analyzed region is characterized by strong cross-border and transnational linkages, similar ecological features and climatic stressors but differing political, administrative, cultural and legal conditions. In this rather complex setting, we operationalized a state-of-the art vulnerability framework using 18 quantified indicators and aggregating them into a vulnerability index. We show that it is possible to downscale the methods used in recent assessments to a regional context with a challenging data situation and discuss strengths and uncertainties. The results are mapped for stakeholder communication purposes. They provide an evidence-base to the identification of the trinational vulnerability pattern and may enable stakeholders and decision-makers to enhance their own climate adaptation planning.","[Scholze, Nicolas; Riach, Nils; Glaser, Rudiger] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Dept Phys Geog, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Scholze, N (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Dept Phys Geog, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",nicolas.scholze@geographie.uni-freiburg.de; nils.riach@geographie.uni-freiburg.de; ruediger.glaser@geographie.uni-freiburg.de,,"Scholze, Nicolas/0000-0002-4576-5360; Riach, Nils/0000-0003-0100-5615",European Union in the program 2014-2020 INTERREG V-A France-Germany-Switzerland (Rhin superieur-Oberrhein) under the project Clim'Ability; German Research Foundation (DFG); University of Freiburg,European Union in the program 2014-2020 INTERREG V-A France-Germany-Switzerland (Rhin superieur-Oberrhein) under the project Clim'Ability; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Freiburg,The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union in the program 2014-2020 INTERREG V-A France-Germany-Switzerland (Rhin superieur-Oberrhein) under the project Clim'Ability.

Then, provided the policies are effective, such insurance can be justified as a precautionary or minimax response. Even if the policies are potentially ineffective however, intervention can be justified as an attempt to minimise the regret experienced by future generations. This reasoning extends to justify 'all weather' policies provided such policies always reduce policy costs. If, however, policy decisions provide 'all weather' benefits in only certain states of the world, this rationale breaks down. Minimising regret can establish a case for 'mixed' policy responses provided adopting a policy mix precludes the chance that intervention will fail altogether.

Infrastructural adaptation refers to the assets, technologies, or hardware that can withstand climate change impacts, such as climate-proofed irrigation systems, roads, or electricity networks. Organizational adaptation refers to the endurance of an effective institution or set of institutions, usually government ministries or departments, in charge of planning and policy, as well as its capacity to develop and revise climate policies. Social adaptation refers to the cohesion of communities and the livelihoods of the people that compose them. We argue that resilient adaptation infrastructures can recover quickly from climate disruptions, resilient organizations can cope with new stresses and changes and still function, resilient communities have assets such as education or wealth that enable them to survive or even thrive in the face of climate-related challenges. Ongoing adaptation efforts in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, and the Maldives are examples of projects that simultaneously attempt to enhance all three dimensions of adaptation.

Climate adaptation actions can be energy-intensive, but how adaptation feeds back into the energy system and the environment is absent in nearly all up-to-date energy scenarios. Here we quantify the impacts of adaptation actions entailing direct changes in final energy use on energy investments and costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution. We find that energy needs for adaptation increase considerably over time and with warming. The resulting addition in capacity for power generation leads to higher greenhouse gas emissions, local air pollutants, and energy system costs. In the short to medium term, much of the added capacity for power generation is fossil-fuel based. We show that mitigation pathways accounting for the adaptation-energy feedback would require a higher global carbon price, between 5% and 30% higher. Because of the benefits in terms of reduced adaptation needs, energy system costs in ambitious mitigation scenarios would be lower than previous estimates, and they would turn negative in well-below-2-degree scenarios, pointing at net gains in terms of power system costs.","[Colelli, Francesco Pietro; Mistry, Malcolm N.; De Cian, Enrica] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Colelli, Francesco Pietro; De Cian, Enrica] Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, I-30175 Venice, Italy; [Emmerling, Johannes; Marangoni, Giacomo; De Cian, Enrica] Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm EIEE, I-20144 Milan, Italy; [Marangoni, Giacomo] Politecn Milan, Dept Econ Management & Ind Engn, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [Mistry, Malcolm N.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth Environm & Soc, London WC1H 9SH, England",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Polytechnic University of Milan; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Colelli, FP (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, I-30121 Venice, Italy.;Colelli, FP (corresponding author), Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, I-30175 Venice, Italy.",francesco.colelli@unive.it,"DE CIAN, Enrica/AAA-1237-2021","DE CIAN, Enrica/0000-0001-7134-2540; EMMERLING, Johannes/0000-0003-0916-9913; Colelli, Francesco Pietro/0000-0003-3507-8118; Marangoni, Giacomo/0000-0003-3994-380X; Mistry, Malcolm/0000-0003-3345-6197","European Research Council (ERC), under the European Union [756194, 821124]; European Union [681228]","European Research Council (ERC), under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Union(European Commission)","This paper has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC), under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 756194 (ENERGYA) and No. 821124 (NAVIGATE), and from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 681228 (GEMCLIME).

The drive towards agricultural transformation must be accompanied by gender inclusive productivity growth. Therefore, this study analyses the effects of climate variables and livelihood diversification on gendered productivity gaps among maize farmers in Northern Ghana. Data were collected from 619 farmers and were analysed using an endogenously corrected Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition model. Results suggest the presence of a significant productivity gap of 58.8% between male and female household heads, and of 44.8% between men household heads and female spouses. About 87% and 98%, respectively, of these productivity gaps were explained by the differences in resource endowment. While livelihood diversification significantly affected gendered productivity through both endowment and coefficient effects, climate variables significantly influenced gendered productivity gaps only through the coefficient component. These results suggest the potential for reducing gendered productivity gaps by providing equal diversification opportunities and by reducing women's vulnerability to climate change. Among livelihood activities, agro-processing could be prioritized and promoted in the region. While farmers should adopt on-farm climate adaptation strategies, extension services should tailor the provision of climate information and promote climate adaptation strategies.","[Adzawla, William] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Climate Change Econ, Dakar, Senegal; [Baumueller, Heike] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res, Bonn, Germany; [Donkoh, Samuel A.] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tamale, Ghana; [Serra, Renata] Univ Florida, Ctr African Studies, Gainesville, FL USA",University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar; University of Bonn; University for Development Studies; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Adzawla, W (corresponding author), Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Climate Change Econ, Dakar, Senegal.",adzawlawilliam@gmail.com,"Baumüller, Heike/AAE-1347-2020","Baumüller, Heike/0000-0003-3340-9235",Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL),Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL),The lead author sincerely appreciates the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) for providing financial support for his PhD programme.,,69,10,10,3,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Realising adaptive urban governance systems requires attention to institutions, and in particular, processes of institutional innovation. Interestingly, understanding of how institutional innovation and change occurs remains a key conceptual weakness in urban climate change governance. This paper explores how institutional innovation in urban climate change governance can be conceptualised and analysed. We develop a heuristic involving three levels: (1) visible changes in institutional arrangements, (2) changes in underlying rules-in-use, and (3) the relationship to broader governance dilemmas. We then explore the utility of this heuristic through an exploratory case study of urban water governance in Santiago, Chile. The approach presented opens up novel possibilities for studying institutional innovation and evaluating changes in governance systems. The paper contributes to debates on innovation and its effects in urban governance, particularly under climate change.","[Patterson, James J.; Huitema, Dave] Open Univ Netherlands, Fac Management Sci & Technol, Heerlen, Netherlands; [Patterson, James J.; Huitema, Dave] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Open University Netherlands; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Patterson, JJ (corresponding author), Open Univ Netherlands, Fac Management Sci & Technol, Heerlen, Netherlands.;Patterson, JJ (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",james.patterson@ou.nl,"Huitema, Dave/L-1343-2013","Huitema, Dave/0000-0001-8565-3200; Huitema, D./0000-0002-0139-3913",European Union [659065]; Research Program on Learning and Innovation in Resilient Systems from the Open University of The Netherlands,European Union(European Commission); Research Program on Learning and Innovation in Resilient Systems from the Open University of The Netherlands,"The authors wish to acknowledge funding for the research reported here from the European Union's Horizon2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement number 659065 (Dr. James Patterson), and from the Research Program on Learning and Innovation in Resilient Systems from the Open University of The Netherlands.",,85,22,22,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

In regions dependent on agriculture, such changes threaten to aggravate existing food insecurity and economic underdevelopment, and to push migration to urban areas. In the Brazilian semi-arid region, the Sertao, farmers' vulnerability to climate-past, present, and future-stems from several factors, including low yielding production practices and reliance on scarce and seasonally variable water resources. Using interpolated local climate data, we show that, since 1962, in the Bacia do Jacuipe-one of the poorest regions in the Sertao of Bahia state-average temperatures have increased similar to 2 degrees C and rainfall has decreased similar to 350 mm. Over the same time period, average milk productivity-the main rural economic activity in the county-has fallen while in Brazil and in Bahia as a whole milk productivity has increased dramatically. This paper teases apart the drivers of climate vulnerability of the Bacia do Jacuipe in relation to the rest of Bahia. We then present the results of a suite of pilot projects by Adapta Sertao, a coalition of organizations working to improve the adaptive capacity of farmers living in the semi-arid region. By testing a number of different technologies and arrangements at the farm level, Adapta Sertao has shown that interventions focused on balanced animal diets and efficient irrigation systems can help reduce (but not eliminate) the dependence of production systems from climate. They are thus viable adaptation strategies that should be tested at a larger scale, with implications for semi-arid regions worldwide.","[Burney, Jennifer; Russell, Jarrod] Univ Calif San Diego IRPS, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Cesano, Daniele; Corral, Thais] REDEH Rede Desenvolvimento Humano, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [La Rovere, Emilio Levre] Cento Clima UFRJ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Coelho, Nereide Segala; Santos, Laise] Cooperat Ser Sertao, Pintadas, BA, Brazil",,"Burney, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego IRPS, San Diego, CA 92093 USA.",jburney@ucsd.edu,"LA ROVERE, EMILIO/Y-9646-2019; Burney, Jennifer/C-6528-2015","LA ROVERE, EMILIO/0000-0002-9186-7069; Burney, Jennifer/0000-0003-3532-2934",Climate Development and Knowledge Network (CDKN),Climate Development and Knowledge Network (CDKN),This project was supported by the Climate Development and Knowledge Network (CDKN).,,28,38,38,2,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Newly available radar-based forest disturbance information now enables an investigation of the intra-annual relationship between precipitation and forest disturbance in a spatially and temporally explicit manner, especially in the tropics, where frequent cloud cover hinders the use of optical-based remote sensing products. In this study, we applied cross-correlation on monthly precipitation and forest disturbance time series for 2019 and 2020 at a 0.5 degrees grid in the African rainforest. We used the magnitude of the correlation and time lag to assess the intra-annual relationship between precipitation and forest disturbance, and introduced accessibility proxies to analyse the spatial variation of the relationship. Results revealed that a significant negative correlation between forest disturbance and precipitation dominates the study region. We found that significant negative correlations appear on average closer to settlements with overall smaller variations in travel time to settlements compared to grid cells with non-significant and significant positive correlation. The magnitude of the negative correlation increases as the travel time to settlements increases, implying that forest disturbances in less accessible areas are more affected by precipitation seasonality and that in particular human-induced disturbance activities are predominantly carried out in the drier months. Few areas showed a significant positive correlation, mainly resulting from natural causes such as flooding. These new insights in the interaction between forest disturbance, precipitation and accessibility provide a step forward in understanding the complex interactions that underlie the complexity of forest loss patterns that we can increasingly capture with Earth Observation approaches. As such, they can support forest conservation and management in coping with climate change induced changes of precipitation patterns in African rainforest countries.","[Gou, Yaqing; Balling, Johannes; De Sy, Veronique; Herold, Martin; De Keersmaecker, Wanda; Slagter, Bart; Mullissa, Adugna; Reiche, Johannes] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Herold, Martin] Helmholtz GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Remote Sensing & Geoinformat 1 4, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Shang, Xiaocheng] Univ Birmingham, Sch Math, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Shang, Xiaocheng] Alan Turing Inst, British Lib, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB, England",Wageningen University & Research; University of Birmingham,"Gou, YQ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Wageningen, Netherlands.",Yaqing.gou@wur.nl,"Herold, Martin/F-8553-2012; Shang, Xiaocheng/AAY-1527-2021; Reiche, Johannes/O-8819-2018; De Sy, Veronique/P-6526-2014","Herold, Martin/0000-0003-0246-6886; Shang, Xiaocheng/0000-0001-8376-6498; Reiche, Johannes/0000-0002-4327-4349; De Sy, Veronique/0000-0003-3647-7866; Balling, Johannes/0000-0001-8773-9657","Norway's Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI), the US Government's SilvaCarbon program; STW Big-EO-Analytics project of the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) [15839]","Norway's Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI), the US Government's SilvaCarbon program; STW Big-EO-Analytics project of the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO)","This project received funding through Norway's Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI), the US Government's SilvaCarbon program.

Available information about best practice in climate adaptation suggests it is inclusive of socio-economic disadvantage and local community factors such as access to health services. Since 1995, at least 19 164 papers have been published on climate change in the health sciences and social sciences. This body of literature has not yet been systematically examined for how well it serves rural communities. Methods: The ultimate aim of the study was to contribute to better understandings about what climate adaptation research has been done and is needed for rural communities. The two research questions were: 'What kinds of content define climate change research in disciplines that could potentially contribute to adaptation for health?' and 'How is content about rural and Aboriginal communities and best practice in adaptation related to this content?' A quantitative content analysis was performed using 'computational linguistics' Leximancer software. The analysis included 19 164 health and social sciences abstracts, batched by years, from 1 January 1995 to 31 July 2012. The relative frequency and co-occurrence of 52 concepts in these abstracts were mapped, as well as associations with positive or negative sentiment for selected concepts. Results: 'Rural' and 'Aboriginal' concepts tend to be relatively infrequent (3% and 5% overall likelihood of occurrence, respectively) and are more associated with socio-economic concepts in the social sciences than the health sciences. Multiple concepts in the health sciences literature are typically connected with 'disease' and ultimately 'science' storylines, with a 38% likelihood of paired co-occurrence of 'health' and 'disease' concepts alone. The social sciences appear more focused on the local and particular issues of community in climate change than the health sciences. 'Rural' and 'Aboriginal' concepts have increased by 1% across both discipline areas, since 2011 for the 'rural' concept and since 2004 for the 'Aboriginal' concept. 'Health' concepts in the health sciences and 'economic' concepts in the social sciences, as well as 'urban' concepts, are referred to more positively than either the 'rural' or 'Aboriginal' concepts. Conclusions: While care needs to be taken in interpreting the results of this study too negatively for rural and Aboriginal communities, they suggest that a disease focus dominates climate and health research typically unconnected to wider socio-economic and human system factors. This finding needs to be considered in light of the accumulating evidence of the importance of such contextual systemic factors in understanding climate and health effects and responses. The study adds some support to the view that a key priority is bringing the learnings of applied community-based researchers, from those in rural health to those in the social sciences, to climate research. There is a need to build confidence, including in the rural health sector which has arguably been slow to participate in programs of climate change research, that community-based research could make a difference to rural health in a climate-changing world.","Univ Tasmania, Univ Dept Rural Hlth, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Bell, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Univ Dept Rural Hlth, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",,,,,,,,68,11,11,2,23,AUSTRALIAN RURAL HEALTH EDUC NETWORK,DEAKIN WEST,"PO BOX 242, DEAKIN WEST, ACT 2600, AUSTRALIA",1445-6354,,,RURAL REMOTE HEALTH,Rural Remote Health,JAN-MAR,2013,13,1,,,,,,,2343,,,,,16,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",190TY,23398298,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000322364800015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70 degrees N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest-steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2.5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65 degrees N are larger than emissions from the anthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60 degrees N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65 degrees N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning - indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.","[McCarty, Jessica L.; Fain, Justin J.] Miami Univ, Dept Geog, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [McCarty, Jessica L.; Fain, Justin J.] Miami Univ, Geospatial Anal Ctr, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Aalto, Juha; Venalainen, Ari] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Weather & Climate Change Impact Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Aalto, Juha] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland; [Paunu, Ville-Veikko] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Ctr Sustainable Consumpt & Prod, Helsinki, Finland; [Arnold, Steve R.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Eckhardt, Sabine; Evangeliou, Nikolaos] Norwegian Inst Air Res, Dept Atmospher & Climate Res ATMOS, Kjeller, Norway; [Klimont, Zbigniew] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Tchebakova, Nadezhda M.; Parfenova, Elena, I] Russian Acad Sci, VN Sukachev Inst Forests, Siberian Branch, Krasnoyarsk, Russia; [Kupiainen, Kaarle] Minist Environm Finland, Aleksanterinkatu 7,POB 35, Helsinki 00023, Finland; [Soja, Amber J.] Natl Inst Aerosp, Hampton, VA USA; [Soja, Amber J.] NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23665 USA; [Huang, Lin] Environm & Climate Change Canada, ASTD STB, Climate Res Div, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wilson, Simon] Arctic Monitoring & Assessment Programme AMAP Sec, Tromso, Norway","University System of Ohio; Miami University; University System of Ohio; Miami University; Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Helsinki; Finnish Environment Institute; University of Leeds; Norwegian Institute for Air Research; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Russian Academy of Sciences; Krasnoyarsk Science Center of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Sukachev Institute of Forest, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences; National Institute for Aerospace; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center; Environment & Climate Change Canada","McCarty, JL (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Geog, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.;McCarty, JL (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Geospatial Anal Ctr, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",jmccarty@miamioh.edu,"Eckhardt, Sabine/I-4001-2012; Evangeliou, Nikolaos/A-7547-2012; Klimont, Zbigniew/P-7641-2015","Eckhardt, Sabine/0000-0001-6958-5375; Evangeliou, Nikolaos/0000-0001-7196-1018; Arnold, Steve/0000-0002-4881-5685; McCarty, Jessica/0000-0002-3333-3931; Klimont, Zbigniew/0000-0003-2630-198X; Paunu, Ville-Veikko/0000-0002-3466-4169","Miami University, Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland (IBA Forest Fires) [1462/31/2019]; Business Finland (BC Footprint) [1462/31/2019]; ACRoBEAR project - Belmont Forum Climate, Environment and Health (CEH) Collaborative Research Action; UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/T013672/1]; Arctic Monitoring and As-sessment Programme (AMAP); Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [19-45-240004]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research [20-05-00540]; NASA's Weather and Data Analysis programme; Climate Adaptation Research Fund from Environment and Climate Change Canada; European Union; Government of Krasnoyarsk Territory [20-05-00540]; NERC [NE/T013672/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Miami University, Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland (IBA Forest Fires); Business Finland (BC Footprint); ACRoBEAR project - Belmont Forum Climate, Environment and Health (CEH) Collaborative Research Action; UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Arctic Monitoring and As-sessment Programme (AMAP); Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); NASA's Weather and Data Analysis programme; Climate Adaptation Research Fund from Environment and Climate Change Canada; European Union(European Commission); Government of Krasnoyarsk Territory; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This research has been supported by Miami University, Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland (IBA Forest Fires, decision PC0TQ4BT-53); Business Finland (BC Footprint; grant no. 1462/31/2019); the ACRoBEAR project, funded by the Belmont Forum Climate, Environment and Health (CEH) Collaborative Research Action and the UK Natural Environment Research Council (grant no.

The energy transition is an especially impactful challenge and presents a compelling opportunity to pursue integration, as it requires changes to space, landscape, infrastructure and organizations at different scales. While the added value of integrative approaches that address the energy transition alongside other societal challenges is widely acknowledged, it is not the status quo. The aim of this study is to uncover the institutional barriers to integration and suggest possibilities for redesign. The paper sheds light on a hitherto relatively understudied phase of integration, namely implementation. Two illustrative cases for energy transition integration are discussed; (i) sustainable residential heating combined with climate adaptation in the urban context, and (ii) biogas production from livestock manure for rural residential heating and nitrogen reduction in the Netherlands. Inspired by the Institutional Analysis and Development framework (IAD) and networks of action situations (NAS) concept, the study shows that in the context of energy transition integration, action situations are pillarized with incidental interactions happening between sectors and across scales. The rules that govern actor interactions stem from sectoral institutional arrangements and produce sectoral action situations. Factors that especially obstruct integration are financial streams, budgeting and designated task responsibilities of actors that favour sectoral, one-dimensional projects. Actors interact in sectoral action situations and struggle to establish links to plan for more integrative outcomes. As a way forward, the study illustrates how rules can be redesigned to create integrative action situations and what mechanisms may help to achieve this in practice.","[Warbroek, Beau; Vinke-de Kruijf, Joanne; Doree, Andre] Univ Twente, Dept Civil Engn & Management, Enschede, Netherlands; [Holmatov, Bunyod; Arentsen, Maarten] Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil CSTM, Enschede, Netherlands; [Shakeri, Moozhan; de Boer, Cheryl; Flacke, Johannes] Univ Twente, Dept Urban & Reg Planning & Geoinformat Managemen, Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente; University of Twente; University of Twente,"Warbroek, B (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Civil Engn & Management, Enschede, Netherlands.",w.d.b.warbroek@utwente.nl,"Flacke, Johannes/C-9941-2013; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Doree, Andre/H-5369-2018","Flacke, Johannes/0000-0001-8906-7719; Doree, Andre/0000-0003-1234-4858; Warbroek, Beau/0000-0003-1884-7966",Dutch Research Council (NWO),Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This publication is part of the project Regional Energy Transition as Systemic Integration (RETSI), which is (partly) financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO).

Here, we show operational implications for flood management of a 'collapse' of space-based rainfall observing infrastructure as well as the high-value opportunities for a globally coordinated portfolio of satellite missions and data services. Results show that the current portfolio of rainfall missions fails to meet operational data needs for flood management, even when assuming a perfectly coordinated data product from all current rainfall-focused missions (i.e., the full portfolio). In the full portfolio, satellite-based rainfall data deficits vary across the globe and may preclude climate adaptation in locations vulnerable to increasing flood risks. Moreover, removing satellites that are currently beyond their design life (i.e., the reduced portfolio) dramatically increases data deficits globally and could cause entire high intensity flood events to be unobserved. Recovery from the reduced portfolio is possible with internationally coordinated replenishment of as few as 2 of the 4 satellite systems beyond their design life, yielding rainfall data coverages that outperform the current full portfolio (i.e., an optimized portfolio of eight satellites can outperform ten satellites). This work demonstrates the potential for internationally coordinated satellite replenishment and data services to substantially enhance the cost-effectiveness, sustainability and operational value of space-based rainfall observations in managing evolving flood risks.","[Reed, Patrick M.; Herman, Jonathan D.] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Chaney, Nathaniel W.; Wood, Eric F.] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ferringer, Matthew P.] Aerosp Corp, Chantilly, VA 20151 USA",Cornell University; Princeton University; Aerospace Corporation - USA,"Reed, PM (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 211 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",patrick.reed@cornell.edu; nchaney@princeton.edu; jdh366@cornell.edu; Matthew.P.Ferringer@aero.org; efwood@princeton.edu,"Herman, Jonathan D/M-9079-2017; Chaney, Nathaniel/L-9110-2015; Chaney, Nathaniel/AAR-2944-2020; Reed, Patrick/E-4435-2014","Herman, Jonathan D/0000-0002-4081-3175; Chaney, Nathaniel/0000-0001-7120-1713; Chaney, Nathaniel/0000-0001-7120-1713; Reed, Patrick/0000-0002-7963-6102; Wood, Eric/0000-0001-7037-9675",US National Science Foundation under the Petascale Resource Allocation entitled 'Collaborative Research: Petascale Design and Management of Satellite Assets to Advance Space-Based Earth Science' [OCI-1144212]; National Science Foundation [ACI 1238993]; state of Illinois; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1346727] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,US National Science Foundation under the Petascale Resource Allocation entitled 'Collaborative Research: Petascale Design and Management of Satellite Assets to Advance Space-Based Earth Science'; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); state of Illinois; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"The authors of this work were partially supported by the US National Science Foundation under the Petascale Resource Allocation entitled 'Collaborative Research: Petascale Design and Management of Satellite Assets to Advance Space-Based Earth Science' under grant OCI-1144212.

Most vulnerable will be the semi-arid tropics and subtropics, home of the majority of poor and undernourished populations. Policies have to distinguish between dry spells, interannual droughts and long-term climate aridification. Four contrasting situations are distinguished with different water-scarcity dilemmas to cope with. Some countries, where the climate is getting drier, will have to adapt their water policy to sharpening water shortage. In many developing countries it will be wise to go for win-win approaches by picking the low-hanging fruit, i.e. taking measures needed in any case. A fundamental component of adaptive management will be social learning to help people recognize their interdependence and differences. Rethinking will be needed regarding how we manage water for agricultural production, integrating solutions with domestic, industrial and environmental uses. Adaptation to global change will benefit from basin management plans, defining medium- and long-term objectives. Conceptual clarity will be increasingly essential.

However, given growing interest in nature-based solutions research and practice towards questions of justice, it is important that the knowledge systems used to inform decisions about urban nature-based solutions are critically scrutinised. We use the lens of epistemic justice - justice in knowl-edge, with regard to how society defines a problem and the range of possible solutions - to assess nature-based solutions actions for climate adaptation and resilience across five cities: Amsterdam, Glasgow, Hanoi, Oslo, and Taipei. Our study finds common issues: the risk of quantifiable evidence about the distribution of NbS and its benefits closing down the aims of NbS strategies to meeting narrowly-defined indicators; the potential for self -defined communities of experts becoming de facto authorities on NbS; and the need for those tasked with implementing NbS 'on the ground' to have access to the fora and knowledge systems in which NbS strategies are developed. A key message is that more participation alone is insufficient to address epistemic justice concerns, unless it comes at a stage where a broad range of stakeholders (and their knowledges) can influence adaptation strategies and the role of NbS within them. Given the inter-and transdisciplinary nature of NbS scholarship, we argue attention must be focused on the potential for exclusion of key knowledge systems from policy and governance processes.","[Mabon, Leslie] open Univ, Sch Engn & Innovat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, England; [Barkved, Line] Norwegian Inst Water Res NIVA, Water & Soc Grp, Oslo, Norway; [de Bruin, Karianne] Climate Adaptat Serv, Bussum, Netherlands; [de Bruin, Karianne] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Shih, Wan -Yu] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Disaster Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan",Open University - UK; Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA); Wageningen University & Research; Ming Chuan University,"Mabon, L (corresponding author), open Univ, Sch Engn & Innovat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, England.",leslie.mabon@open.ac.uk,,"Mabon, Leslie/0000-0003-2646-6119","ESRC-MOST (UK, Taiwan) [ES/W000172/1/110-2923-M-130-001-MY2]; British Academy, UK [270742, (KF6220287)]; British Academy, UK [(KF6220287)]; Research Council of Norway, Norway [270742]","ESRC-MOST (UK, Taiwan); British Academy, UK; British Academy, UK; Research Council of Norway, Norway(Research Council of Norway)","The research on which this paper is based was funded by the ESRC-MOST (UK, Taiwan)  funded project Urban greening for climate-resilient neighbourhoods: linking scholars and cities across the UK and Taiwan (ES/W000172/1/110-2923-M-130-001-MY2) (LM, WYS) ; the British Academy, UK.

The investigation indicates that SWAT can be applied under a changing climate as a decision support tool for framing adaptation strategies such as altering the method of cultivation by changing water and fertilizer management. Climate change scenarios were developed using the RegCM3 model with EH5OM GCM output for an A1B scenario. The RegCM3 model tended to slightly underestimate the maximum and minimum temperatures. The generated daily climate data were used in the SWAT model for assessing the impact on hydrology and rice productivity of the river basin for a continuous time period of 130 years (1971-2100). To validate the SWAT model, predicted rice yields for the Bhavani Basin over a period of 11 years (1999-2009) were compared with the observed rice yields of Erode district in which the Bhavani Basin is located and the results indicated the satisfactory performance of the model. It is shown that the SWAT model can be employed under different climate change and management scenarios for developing adaptation strategies to sustain rice production. The SRI system of rice cultivation is found to be a better adaptive technology for changing climatic conditions than the conventional flooding system of cultivation in regards to water conservation (300 mm) and increasing yield (26%).","[Lakshmanan, A.] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Dept Nano Sci & Technol, Coimbatore 641003, Tamil Nadu, India; [Geethalakshmi, V.; Rajalakshmi, D.; Bhuvaneswari, K.] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Agro Climate Res Ctr, Coimbatore 641003, Tamil Nadu, India; [Srinivasan, R.] Texas A&M Univ, Spatial Sci Lab, College Stn, TX USA; [Sridhar, G.] Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England; [Annamalai, H.] Univ Hawaii, IPRC SOEST, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Reading; University of Hawaii System,"Lakshmanan, A (corresponding author), Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Dept Nano Sci & Technol, Coimbatore 641003, Tamil Nadu, India.",lakshmanantnau@yahoo.com,"arunachalam, lakshmanan/AAV-1073-2020; Vellingiri, Geethalakshmi/AAP-1053-2020; Srinivasan, R/D-3937-2009; Bhuvaneswari, K./AAS-3767-2020","arunachalam, lakshmanan/0000-0003-2912-1626; Vellingiri, Geethalakshmi/0000-0003-1631-121X; Srinivasan, R/0000-0001-8375-6038; Bhuvaneswari, Kulanthaivel/0000-0002-9139-5700","Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway; Royal Norwegian Embassy in New Delhi","Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway; Royal Norwegian Embassy in New Delhi","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway and the Royal Norwegian Embassy in New Delhi for the financial support to undertake the study through the ClimaRice project.

But what are the implications of climate change for equity and justice amongst vulnerable groups at local and sub-national levels? We ask this question for three reasons: (a) there is a considerable literature suggesting that the poorest and most vulnerable groups will disproportionately experience the negative effects of 21st century climate change; (b) such changes are likely to impact significantly on developing world countries, where natural-resource dependency is high; and (c) international conventions increasingly recognise the need to centrally engage resource stakeholders in agendas in order to achieve their desired aims, as part of more holistic approaches to sustainable development. These issues however have implications for distributive and procedural justice, particularly when considered within the efforts of the UNFCCC. The issues are examined through an evaluation of key criteria relating to climate change scenarios and vulnerability in the developing world, and second through two southern African case studies that explore the ways in which livelihoods are differentially impacted by (i) inequitable natural-resource use policies, (ii) community-based natural-resource management programmes. Finally, we consider the placement of climate change amongst the package of factors affecting equity in natural-resource use, and whether this placement creates a case for considering climate change as 'special' amongst livelihood disturbing factors in the developing world.

It is common in the UK for simple RWH tank sizing methods to be utilised, and these do not consider future climate change. This paper describes the development of a tool, which integrates elements of basic and detailed sizing approaches from the British Standard for RWH, with the latest probabilistic UK Climate Projections data. The method was initially applied to the design of a university building in Cornwall, UK. The methodology utilises 3,000 equi-probable rainfall patterns for tank sizing for each time period. Results indicate that, to ensure that it is 'likely' that the same non-potable demand could be met in 2080 as in the present, a tank 112% larger would be required. This increases to a 225% over-sizing for a 'very likely' probability of meeting the same level of non-potable demand. The same RWH system design was then assessed for three further UK locations with different rainfall characteristics. From these assessments, a simplified method was developed to enable practitioners to size RWH system tanks for current and future climates. The method provides a new approach to meet present and future non-potable demands, while preventing excessive over-sizing of tanks.","[Lash, Daniel; Eames, Matthew] Univ Exeter, Ctr Energy & Environm, Exeter EX4 4RN, Devon, England; [Ward, Sarah; Butler, David] Univ Exeter, Ctr Water Syst, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Kershaw, Tristan] Univ Bath, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter; University of Bath,"Lash, D (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Ctr Energy & Environm, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4RN, Devon, England.",d.lash@ex.ac.uk,"Ward, Sarah/AAK-5052-2020; Ward, Sarah/Q-2728-2015","Ward, Sarah/0000-0002-1432-4204; Ward, Sarah/0000-0002-1432-4204; kershaw, tristan/0000-0003-2148-5396","Technology Strategy Board Design for Future Climate: Design for Future Climate 2 competition; UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council, ReVISIONS consortia under the Sustainable Urban Environment programme [EP/F007566/1]; EPSRC [EP/F007566/1, EP/K006924/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K006924/1, EP/F007566/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Technology Strategy Board Design for Future Climate: Design for Future Climate 2 competition; UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council, ReVISIONS consortia under the Sustainable Urban Environment programme; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))",This work was funded through the Technology Strategy Board Design for Future Climate: Design for Future Climate 2 competition and the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council as part of the ReVISIONS consortia (EP/F007566/1) under the Sustainable Urban Environment programme.,,29,22,22,0,10,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",2040-2244,,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

In this paper, we study the acquisition of supplemental irrigation water rights as an adaptation strategy undertaken by irrigation-dependent farmers in response to historical climate change. By exploiting the panel structure of a unique dataset of farm-level supplemental right adoption decisions in the state of Oregon, we establish a relationship between climate conditions, competition for local water resources, and the acquisition of supplemental rights. Our results indicate that a warmer, drier climate increases the likelihood that irrigated farms acquire supplemental rights, suggesting that farmers in Oregon have used supplemental rights to adapt to historical climate change. We also find evidence of heterogeneous effects suggesting that junior irrigators, groundwater-dependent irrigators, and farmers with access to a relatively lower volume of water have been most affected by historical climate change with respect to their supplemental water right acquisition decisions.","[Bigelow, Daniel P.] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Zhang, Hongliang] Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, Neuchatel, Switzerland",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Neuchatel,"Bigelow, DP (corresponding author), USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",Daniel.bigelow@ers.usda.gov,,"Bigelow, Daniel/0000-0002-1154-2302","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","The authors thank seminar and conference participants at the 2015 Southern Economic Association Annual Meetings, Oregon State University, and Economic Research Service for valuable feedback on earlier versions of this paper.

The institution was situated in a region with a Koppen classification of Warm Summer Continental Climate.FindingsHeat hazards aligned primarily with slow-onset, rather than fast-onset, climate impact categories. Adapting to heat hazards aligned with incremental adaptation rather than transformative adaptation. These findings suggest climate adaptation is a new concept for university sport and so is at a pioneering stage of practice.Practical implicationsIdentifies options for sport managers for integrating adaptation into the strategic and operational thinking of sport organizations.Research contributionThis paper extends knowledge by presenting evidence of heat risks to the sport as perceived by sport managers and participants during an era of climate change. The results address gaps in the existing literature by using primary source data to add to the evidence base for sport and climate change, and by identifying options for climate adaptation.","[Mallen, Cheryl] Brock Univ, Sport Management, St Catharines, ON, Canada; [Dingle, Greg] La Trobe Univ, Coll Arts Social Sci & Commerce, Management Sport & Tourism, Bundoora, Australia; [McRoberts, Scott] Univ Guelph, Int Inst Sport Business & Leadership, Gryphons Athlet Ctr, Dept Athlet, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Dingle, Greg] Trobe Univ, Coll Arts Social Sci & Commerce, Management Sport & Tourism, Kingsbury Dr, Bundoora 3086, Australia",Brock University; La Trobe University; University of Guelph; La Trobe University,"Dingle, G (corresponding author), Trobe Univ, Coll Arts Social Sci & Commerce, Management Sport & Tourism, Kingsbury Dr, Bundoora 3086, Australia.",g.dingle@latrobe.edu.au,"Dingle, Greg/L-2186-2013","Dingle, Greg/0000-0003-0931-6303",,,,,81,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2375-0472,2375-0480,,MANAG SPORT LEIS,Manag.

Data are systematically collected from National Communications prepared by Parties to the Convention and submitted periodically to the Secretariat. 4,104 discrete adaptation initiatives are identified and analyzed. Our findings indicate that while progress is being made on conducting impact and vulnerability assessments and adaptation research in nearly every country in the sample, translation of this knowledge into tangible adaptation initiatives is still limited. The largest number of reported adaptations falls under the category of infrastructure, technology, and innovation. Some types of vulnerability were more frequently reported across initiatives, including floods, drought, food and water safety and security, rainfall, infectious disease, and terrestrial ecosystem health. Notably, reporting on the inclusion of vulnerable sub-populations is low across all actions. Diffusion of adaptation across sectors remains underdeveloped, with the environment, water, and agricultural sectors emerging as the most active adaptors. Our analysis indicates that national communications provide a valuable source of information for global-scale adaptation tracking, but important gaps exist in the consistency of reporting that should be addressed, as these documents could greatly enhance efforts to monitor and evaluate adaptation progress.","[Lesnikowski, Alexandra C.; Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3AOB9, Canada; [Barrera, Magda; Heymann, Jody] McGill Univ, Inst Hlth & Social Policy, Montreal, PQ H3A1A3, Canada",McGill University; McGill University,"Lesnikowski, AC (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Community & Reg Planning, 433-6333 Mem Rd, Vancouver, BC V6T1Z2, Canada.",alesnikowski@gmail.com,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Heymann, Jody/0000-0003-0008-4198",Social Sciences and Humanities Research council; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Social Sciences and Humanities Research council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"This project was supported by an Insight Development Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research council, and a Knowledge Synthesis grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.",,40,78,78,0,93,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Nature-based solutions including salt marshes have been proposed to naturally enhance coastal infrastructure. A gently sloping grass-covered dike ( i.e. Wide Green Dike) can be strengthened with clay accumulating locally in the salt marsh. This study explores the feasibility of extracting salt-marsh sediment for dike reinforcement as a climate adaptation strategy in several sea-level rise scenarios, using the Wide Green Dike in the Dutch part of the Ems-Dollard estuary as a case study. A O-D sedimentation model was combined with a wave propagation model, and probabilistic models for wave impact and wave overtopping. This model system was used to determine the area of borrow pits required to supply clay for adequate dikes under different sea-level rise scenarios. For medium to high sea-level rise scenarios (>102 cm by 2100) thickening of the clay layer on the dike is required to compensate for the larger waves resulting from insufficient marsh accretion. The model results indicate that for our case study roughly 9A ha of borrow pit is sufficient to supply clay for 1 km of dike reinforcement until 2100. The simulated borrow pits are refilled within 22 simulation years on average, and infilling is projected to accelerate with sea-level rise and pit depth. This study highlights the potential of salt marshes as an asset for adapting flood defences in the future. (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, social conflict and other political factors add a layer of complexity that casts doubt on their status as practical climate adaptation options. The specific mechanisms responsible for some projects not progressing beyond initial planning stages remains unclear. In this study, we examined the outcome of two USACE storm surge barrier proposals to explore the political reasons why some coastal flood protection megaprojects break ground in the US, while others do not. Using original archive research, we concluded that storm surge barriers are politically challenging climate adaptation options because of modern environmental laws that provide avenues for expression of oppositional views within the decision process and the allure of alternative options that are more aesthetically pleasing and cheaper and faster to implement. To better allocate public resources and utilize the expertise of USACE, future flood protection megaprojects should first achieve broad support from the public, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and elected officials before beginning serious planning. This support could be achieved through new innovative designs that simultaneously address adverse environmental impacts and provide cobenefits (e.g., recreation). New designs should be studied to better understand the level of protection offered and their associated reliability so that USACE has confidence in their use.","[Rasmussen, D.

Smallholder systems heterogeneity requires local specific climate adaptation for reducing the negative impacts of changing climate in regions heavily relying on small farms agriculture. This study examined the trend in climate in Ghana, how smallholder horticultural farmers perceive this changing climate and how they are responding to its perceived effects. A survey of 480 resource-constrained horticultural producers was conducted in two municipalities of Ghana. Descriptive analysis and Weighted Average Index were employed to rank identified adaptation strategies and challenges. The results showed that farmers are already experiencing increasing temperature and declining rainfall patterns consistent with trends of observed climate changing in the last two decades. To reduce vulnerability and improve resilience of smallholders' production activities, a range of farmer driven soil, water and crop conservation measures and farm management practices are being adopted. The most important adaptation practices identified include fertilization, supplementary irrigation, crop rotation, intercropping and mixed farming. Enhancing households' climate adaptive capacity is dependent on factors such as improved access to financial resources, climate and production information, market accessibility, farm equipment, storage facilities and other institutional support. To facilitate effective and successful adaptation at the local level, government and institutional support are recommended to complement households' autonomous strategies for improved decision-making, adaptation plans and actions.","[Williams, Portia Adade; Crespo, Olivier] Univ Cape Town, Environm & Geog Sci Dept, Climate Syst Anal Grp, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Williams, Portia Adade] CSIR Sci & Technol Policy Res Inst, Box CT 519, Accra, Ghana; [Abu, Mumuni] Univ Ghana, Reg Inst Populat Studies, Legon, Ghana",University of Cape Town; University of Ghana,"Williams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Environm & Geog Sci Dept, Climate Syst Anal Grp, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",adadeposh@gmail.com,"crespo, olivier/L-6398-2013; Abu, Mumuni/Y-2583-2019","crespo, olivier/0000-0001-7320-9428; Abu, Mumuni/0000-0002-6455-0162; Williams, Portia/0000-0002-5919-3930",Organisation of Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD) Fellowship Programme; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),Organisation of Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD) Fellowship Programme; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),The Organisation of Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD) Fellowship Programme and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) supported this research study.

To the extent that climate change is translated into Inuktitut as a wholly environmental phenomenon over which humans have no control, both adaptation and resilience come to be seen as appropriate and distinctly Inuit modes of relating to shifting climatic conditions, calling on practices of patience, observation, creativity, forbearance, and discretion. If translated as a matter of unethical harm of sila, however, Inuit frameworks of justice, relationality, and healing would be activated. In the context of a broader global shift away from mitigation and toward enhancing the adaptive capacities and resilience of particular populations, current modes of translating climate change, we argue, are deeply political.","[Cameron, Emilie] Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Mearns, Rebecca] Nunavut Sivuniksavut, Ottawa, ON K1N 5Z4, Canada",Carleton University,"Cameron, E (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",emilie.cameron@carleton.ca; rebecca.mearns@gmail.com; tamalik@sympatico.ca,,,,,,,53,24,24,1,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

Here we discuss prospects for inclusive approaches to adaptation, drawing particularly on studies of long-term coastal management in the UK and elsewhere. We affirm that public participation is an important normative goal in formulating response to climate change risks, but argue that its practice must learn from existing critiques of participatory processes in other contexts. Involving a wide range of stakeholders in decision-making presents fundamental challenges for climate policy, many of which are embedded in relations of power. In the case of anticipatory responses to climate change, these challenges are magnified because of the long-term and uncertain nature of the problem. Without due consideration of these issues, a tension between principles of public participation and anticipatory adaptation is likely to emerge and may result in an overly managed form of inclusion that is unlikely to satisfy either participatory or instrumental goals. Alternative, more narrowly instrumental, approaches to participation are more likely to succeed in this context, as long as the scope and limitations of public involvement are made explicit from the outset.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Dev Studies, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia; University of Oxford,"Few, R (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Dev Studies, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",r.few@uea.ac.uk,"Few, Roger/AAT-3914-2021; Tompkins, Emma/B-6863-2016","Few, Roger/0000-0001-6653-1400; Tompkins, Emma/0000-0002-4825-9797",,,,,55,391,394,2,133,JAMES & JAMES SCIENCE PUBLISHERS LTD/EARTHSCAN,LONDON,"8-12 CAMDEN HIGH STREET, NW1 0JH LONDON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Based on fieldwork and interviews, the study defined four base housing typologies and possible variations in design and construction details. Each house was assessed using performance-based static wind analysis of potentially critical components. The results show that the initial governing failure mode in all base house typologies considered is roof panel loss due to tear-through at the fasteners, with subsequent governing failures being panel loss due to failures at the purlin-to-truss connections and failures of the truss-to-wall connections. In-plane wall failures and masonry uplift failures were both found to occur at much higher wind speeds than roof failures. To improve the hurricane performance, several feasible modifications are suggested, including installing hurricane straps at both the truss-to-wall and the purlin-to-truss connections, as well as improving the panel-fastener interface. In the construction of new roofs, this study found that using reduced spacing between roof members, hip roofs instead of gable roofs, and higher roof slopes leads to improved performance. These recommendations can make houses built through informal construction processes safer and more resilient to hurricanes as a form of climate adaptation.","[Lochhead, Meredith] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Earth Sci, Notre Dame, IN USA; [Goldwyn, Briar; Liel, Abbie B.; Javernick-Will, Amy] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Venable, Casie] Arup, San Francisco, CA USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Liel, AB (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",abbie.liel@colorado.edu,,"LIEL, ABBIE/0000-0002-9241-5144",US National Science Foundation [1901808]; University of Colorado Innovative Seed Grant,US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Colorado Innovative Seed Grant,"This study is supported by the US National Science Foundation Award No. 1901808 and a University of Colorado Innovative Seed Grant.

This is particularly true for pedestrians, that are more exposed to weather conditions. Introducing the effect of this change in transport modelling allows to analyse and plan walking networks taking into-consideration the climatic variable. The aim of this work is to develop a tool that can support planning and design of walking networks, by assessing the effects of actions oriented to increase resilience with respect to extreme weather conditions (CC adaptation). An integrated approach is used, thus combining transport and land-use planning concepts with elements of outdoor thermal comfort and network accessibility. Walking networks are analysed through centrality indexes, including thermal comfort aspects into a general cost function of links and weighted nodes. The method has been applied to the walking network inside the Campus of the University of Catania (Italy), which includes different functions and where pedestrian paths are barely used by people. Results confirm that this tool is sensitive to the variables representing weather conditions and it can measure the influence of CC adaptation measures (e.g. vegetation) on walking attitude and on the performance of the walking network.

Because BGI can have multiple benefits beyond climate adaptation, policy integration is required. Since drainage services have traditionally been within the remit of a single department, this is new territory for water management. This article provides a dynamic perspective on the messy process of policy integration 'on the ground' in two BGI projects in Dordrecht, NL and Bradford, UK. Drawing on interviews with key actors involved in the cases, our research question is:How are ambitions to integrate policies resulting in multi-functional BGI projects?While previous research typically defines organisational structures as barriers for policy integration, our findings demonstrate instances of actors who are successfully navigating these structures as a route towards policy integration. Nevertheless, we found that actors who push for BGI lack resources and authority, so they mainly rely on more voluntary forms of policy integration that involve concerted action over a number of years. Overall, our cases demonstrate that space for policy integration exists and powerful agencies are sympathetic to this, but more support is needed to achieve this mandate.","[Willems, Jannes J.; Molenveld, Astrid] Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Erasmus Sch Social & Behav Sci, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Kenyon, Anna V.] Univ Manchester, Sch Biol Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Sharp, Liz] Univ Sheffield, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Environm Governance, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Manchester; University of Sheffield,"Willems, JJ (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Erasmus Sch Social & Behav Sci, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",willems@essb.eur.nl,"Kenyon, Anna/HKV-9968-2023","Willems, Jannes/0000-0002-3318-9706; Sharp, Liz/0000-0002-1611-9239; , Anna/0000-0001-5423-0651",BEGIN project - Interreg VB North Sea Region Programme,BEGIN project - Interreg VB North Sea Region Programme,This work was supported by BEGIN project - Interreg VB North Sea Region Programme.,,40,8,8,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-908X,1522-7200,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

This paper explores the likely impacts of climate-induced changes on the provisioning of forest ecosystem goods and services and its effect on the economic and social well-being of the society, including the national economy and the livelihoods of forest-dependent people. The analysis focuses on four identified vulnerable sectors - food (NTFPs), energy (fuelwood), health (medicinal plants) and water (freshwater) through a multi-stakeholder dialog at national and regional levels. We use a vulnerability assessment framework by combining the elements of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to conceptualize vulnerability in these sectors. The identified sectors in relation to the forest ecosystem are discussed in view of providing an understanding of the sector's potential adaptive capacities for policy intervention. Our analysis presents the possible implications of the vulnerability of these sectors for planning local and national adaptation strategies. Local and national adaptive capacities to respond to climate impacts in the forest sectors includes: reducing poverty, enhancing food security, water availability, combating land degradation and reducing loss of biological diversity.

This study performs a systems process analysis to quantify the carbon emissions and nonrenewable energy costs induced by a state-of-art demonstration CSP plant located in the Tibetan plateau. Estimated to induce 111.2 g CO2 eq/kWh carbon emissions and 1.42 MJ/kWh nonrenewable energy consumption, the CSP plant is considered to have extremely high carbon neutrality (88.8%) and energy renewability (86.4%). The prominent performance of carbon emissions reduction and energy conservation induced by the CSP plant shed light on its superiority of reliable power supply and environmental benefits. The plant is expected to cumulatively fulfill 3.4 million tons of carbon emissions reduction over its life cycle. In contrast to coal-based power and other renewable energy technologies, CSP technology is shown to be a promising solution to the low-carbon energy transition. Besides, a scenario analysis indicates that the incremental employment of CSP technologies will play a critical role in coping with climate change and energy security in China. Moreover, multiple policies to facilitate the development of the CSP system in China are elaborated, such as the promotion of integrated solar combined-cycle systems. The empirical finding draws a holistic picture of the carbon neutrality and energy sustainability performance of CSP technologies, and the systematic analysis in this study provides comprehensive policy perspectives for energy policy in the Tibetan region as well as in China in the context of global climate change.","[Ye, Huafeng; Li, Chaohui; Li, Yilin; Li, Zhi; Chen, Guoqian] Peking Univ, Coll Engn, Lab Syst Ecol & Sustainabil Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ye, Huafeng] GuangDong Elect Power Dev Corp Ltd, Guangzhou 510000, Peoples R China; [Peng, Huaiwu] PowerChina Northwest Engn Corp Ltd, Xian 710000, Peoples R China; [Yang, Qing] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Coal Combust, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guoqian] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Macao Environm Res Inst, Macao Special Adm Reg, Macau 999078, Peoples R China",Peking University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Macau University of Science & Technology,"Chen, GQ (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Engn, Lab Syst Ecol & Sustainabil Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Yang, Q (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Coal Combust, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",qyang@hust.edu.cn; gqchen@pku.edu.cn,"Chen, Guoqian/B-5407-2012","Chen, Guoqian/0000-0003-1173-6796; Li, Chaohui/0000-0002-3951-7141",National Natural Science Foundation of China;  [51879002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ,This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51879002) .,,45,0,0,18,18,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

The impact of this finance depends on how much finance is mobilized and where it is targeted. However, there has been no comprehensive quantitative mapping of adaptation-related finance flows to African countries to date. Here we track development finance principally targeting adaptation from bilateral and multilateral funders to Africa between 2014 and 2018. We find that the amounts of finance are well below the scale of investment needed for adaptation in Africa, which is a region with high vulnerability to climate change and low adaptation capacity. Finance targeting mitigation (US$30.6 billion) was almost double that for adaptation (US$16.5 billion). The relative share of each varies greatly among African countries. More adaptation-related finance was provided as loans (57%) than grants (42%) and half the adaptation finance has targeted just two sectors: agriculture; and water supply and sanitation. Disbursement ratios for adaptation in this period are 46%, much lower than for total development finance in Africa (at 96%). These are all problematic patterns for Africa, highlighting that more adaptation finance and targeted efforts are needed to ensure that financial commitments translate into meaningful change on the ground for African communities. Key policy insights Between 2014 and 2018, adaptation-related finance committed by bilateral and multilateral funders to African countries remained well below US$5.5 billion per year, or roughly US$5 per person per year; these amounts are well below the estimates of adaptation costs in Africa. Funders have not strategically targeted support for adaptation activities towards the most vulnerable to climate change African countries. Lessons from countries that have been more successful in accessing finance point to the value of more sophisticated domestic adaptation policies and plans; of alignment with priorities of the NDC; of meeting funding requirements of specific funders; and of the strategic use of climate funds by national planners. A low adaptation finance disbursement ratio in this period in Africa (at 46%) relates to barriers impeding the full implementation of adaptation projects: low grant to loan ratio; requirements for co-financing; rigid rules of climate funds; and inadequate programming capacity within many countries.","[Savvidou, Georgia; Atteridge, Aaron] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Omari-Motsumi, Kulthoum; Trisos, Christopher H.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa",Stockholm Environment Institute; University of Cape Town,"Savvidou, G (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden.",georgia.savvidou@gmail.com,"Savvidou, Georgia/HDO-5470-2022","Savvidou, Georgia/0000-0002-4334-6306; Trisos, Christopher/0000-0002-5854-1489",,,,,64,9,9,2,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Although there are many challenges to modelling agricultural CC adaptation, it is unclear whether these are novel or, whether adaptation merely adds new motivations to old challenges. Here, qualitative analysis of modellers' views revealed three categories of challenge: Content, Use, and Capacity. Triangulation of findings with reviews of agricultural modelling and Climate Change Risk Assessment was then used to highlight challenges specific to modelling adaptation. These were refined through literature review, focussing attention on how the progressive nature of CC affects the role and impact of modelling. Specific challenges identified were: Scope of adaptations modelled, Information on future adaptation, Collaboration to tackle novel challenges, Optimisation under progressive change with thresholds, and Responsibility given the sensitivity of future outcomes to initial choices under progressive change.","[Kipling, R.

The extent of social disruption and risk to human health are, however, potentially much broader than these general consequences, taken individually, would suggest. To address this gap, we assess the distribution of contaminated sites in the United States (US) and then estimate the impact that flood hazards in urban areas will have on these contaminated sites. Using these measures, we draw inferences about the risk of contamination from climate impacted extreme weather events, climate adaptation at the local level, social risk and how it is distributed, and a broader understanding of the potential global consequences of climate change. In this paper we address three critical points: 1) the role classification of contaminated sites on our understanding of risk due to climate change; 2) the relationship between contaminated sites and flood risk; and 3) the potential for climate adaption strategies to mediate this risk. We estimate that of the roughly one-third of the US population living in urban areas, up to 3,338,518 people, are living in high-risk flood zones near contaminated sites. Our results suggest severe potential implications for estimates of the negative consequences from climate change and contamination and provide critical insights into the relationship between climate change and the built environment for urban planners and environmental policy makers and managers alike.","[Marcantonio, Richard; Regan, Patrick M.] Univ Notre Dame, Kroc Inst Int Peace Studies, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Marcantonio, Richard; Field, Sean] Univ Notre Dame, Anthropol Dept, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Regan, Patrick M.] Univ Notre Dame, Polit Sci Dept, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame,"Marcantonio, R (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Kroc Inst Int Peace Studies, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.;Marcantonio, R (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Anthropol Dept, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",rmarcant@nd.edu,,"Marcantonio, Richard/0000-0003-3470-341X",,,,,85,2,2,1,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

The case for such robust policy is compelling. However, advocates of robust approaches to policymaking often understate the challenge, as the variability of climate is just one of at least three interactive arenas of uncertainty that require attention. Emerging technologies will have a significant but indeterminate impact on climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. Uncertainty is also heightened because politics is an arena of disruptive change. The development of robust climate policy given the convergence of unknowns in the climatic, technological, and political realms entails three components: (1) diverse, distributed, and transparent participation; (2) safe-to-fail experimentation; and (3) exploratory foresight.","[Thiele, Leslie Paul] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Thiele, LP (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",thiele@ufl.edu,,"Thiele, Leslie Paul/0000-0002-2314-2058",,,,,102,0,0,3,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The geography and historic, linear development of its capital on the South Tawara atoll mean that many key public assets are at risk from impacts of coastal erosion and thus vulnerable to climate-change effects. An adaptation project started in 2003, which included developing a means of assessing coastal vulnerability and a process for proactive management of the coast. Guidelines offering alternatives to traditional coastal engineering methods were provided, and practical application of these guidelines was demonstrated at selected high-risk pilot sites in 2006-2010. Appropriate technology for increasing resilience was shown through application of simple but effective tools to identify and select adaptation options; recognition that customary responses ingrained over lifetimes will not be changed by a short-term project; and use of tried-and-tested quality improvements to traditional construction techniques. Rather than introducing completely new and unfamiliar measures, the pilot works enhanced and built on existing knowledge.","[Frankland, Richard; Hardwick, Lisa] Beca Infrastruct Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand; [Watkin, Samuel] Sinclair Knight Merz Pty Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand",,"Frankland, R (corresponding author), Beca Infrastruct Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,2,6,6,2,39,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",0965-089X,,,P I CIVIL ENG-CIV EN,Proc.

Therefore, the appropriate management of land-sea interaction (LSI)contexts should base on those planning approaches which can holistically support coastal development, such as Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) and Climate Adaptation Planning (CAP). One of the main limiting factors for this integration is the fragmentation of existing databases and information sources, which compose the territorial knowledge framework. Investigations have sought to address the representation and assessment of wicked and interconnected coastal problems. The present research focuses on the production of the necessary information to fill sectorial knowledge gaps and to merge the available data into a single framework. The research methodology is based on remote sensing assessment techniques and is designed to be replicated in other coastal areas to integrate CAP and MSP. The output maps are a result of the empirical application of the integration of the assessment techniques and are meant to support local decision-making processes. The result aims at illustrating and highlighting the relationships between climate change impact vulnerabilities their spatial relation to marine resources and maritime activities. This can support effective actions aimed at environmental and urban protection, the organization of the uses of the sea and adaptation to climate impacts. The application of the assessment techniques is developed on a case study in the north Adriatic Basin. The Gulf of Trieste constitutes a representative case study for the Mediterranean Basin due to its transboundary nature. The relationship and the ongoing projects between Slovenia and Italy make the case study an interesting context in which to test and train the proposed integrated planning approach. Therefore, the study investigates local vulnerability to climate impacts, i.e., Urban Heat Island (UHI) and urban runoff, and the existing relationship between the urban fabrics and the marine environment.","[Maragno, Denis; dall'Omo, Carlo Federico; Pozzer, Gianfranco; Bassan, Niccolo; Musco, Francesco] Univ Iuav Venice, Dept Architecture & Arts, I-30315 Venice, Italy; [Maragno, Denis; dall'Omo, Carlo Federico; Musco, Francesco] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Dept EPiC, Earth & Polis Res Ctr, I-30315 Venice, Italy",IUAV University Venice; Fondazione Mattei,"Dall'Omo, CF (corresponding author), Univ Iuav Venice, Dept Architecture & Arts, I-30315 Venice, Italy.;Dall'Omo, CF (corresponding author), Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Dept EPiC, Earth & Polis Res Ctr, I-30315 Venice, Italy.",denis.maragno@iuav.it; carlo.dallomo@iuav.it; gianfranco.pozzer@iuav.it; niccolo.bassan@iuav.it; francesco.musco@iuav.it,"dall'Omo, Carlo Federico/AAT-6265-2021; Maragno, Denis/AHE-1762-2022","dall'Omo, Carlo Federico/0000-0002-7299-1566; Maragno, Denis/0000-0002-9489-7538; Musco, Francesco/0000-0002-8377-0128",European Commission-EASME-European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF): MSP-MED Towards the operational implementation of MSP in our common Mediterranean Sea,European Commission-EASME-European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF): MSP-MED Towards the operational implementation of MSP in our common Mediterranean Sea,"European Commission-EASME-European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF): MSP-MED Towards the operational implementation of MSP in our common Mediterranean Sea, scientific coordinator prof.

This paper suggests a methodological framework for backcasting to support spatial adaptation to predicted climate changes. Starting from a vision of the future, backcasting infers information about the constituents of a system using knowledge about the behavior of the system and its structure. In popular terms, backcasting plans from a single future vision of a desirable outcome, followed by the question what shall we do today I get to the desired future situation?, thus freeing constraints caused by the current situation and Opening the mind for future options. It provides a broad and flexible enough platform for a set of strategies to address future uncertainties and insure the realization of the vision. Strategic backcasting involves various stakeholders in the discussion of alternative visions and in the development and implementation of flexible measures; and is thus useful for coordinating spatial planning instruments. For addressing quantitative spatial problems, inverse modeling has shown to be a valuable expansion of strategic backcasting. Yet, for a successful implementation of such approaches, current planning systems have to evolve: (I) participation, bottom-up processes and informal instruments need to be further developed, (2) a regional perspective and responsibility has to be taken by planners, and (3) sectoral measures should be combined strongly and implemented integratively in system-oriented strategies to secure the multifunctionality of landscapes and reduce the vulnerability of our environment to climate changes.","[Gret-Regamey, Adrienne; Brunner, Sibyl H.] Inst Raum & Landschaftsentwicklung, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Gret-Regamey, A (corresponding author), Inst Raum & Landschaftsentwicklung, Wolfgang Pauli Str 15, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",gret@nsl.ethz.ch; brunner@nsl.ethz.ch,"Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne/AAZ-7546-2021; Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne/HPE-6858-2023","Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne/0000-0001-8156-9503; Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne/0000-0001-8156-9503",,,,,40,5,5,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0251-3625,2166-8604,,DISP,disP,,2011,47,1,,,,,43,51,,10.1080/02513625.2011.10557123,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02513625.2011.10557123,,,9,Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Public Administration,949JC,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000304571500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on survey from 200 rice growers of Pakistan, the adaptations identified include elevated rates of irrigation, on-farm storage, alteration in fertilizer rates, weather forecasting and soil conservation techniques. Further, influence of different socioeconomic factors on adoption of adaptations is unraveled by using multiple linear regression approach. Results reveal the impact of farming experience, education of farmer, family size, access to credit, involvement in non-farm activities, belief on climate change and relevant adaptations is significant on adoption of adaptations.

Our econometric analysis with linear regression and count data models finds a positive influence of the awareness of possible climate change effects on the scope of corporate adaptation. Surprisingly, no significant influence of the vulnerability to climate change effects on the scope of adaptation could be found.

Study design: This is a systematic literature review and narrative synthesis. Methods: A review of the published literature using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and GreenFILE databases was conducted. The search criteria were kept broad to capture evidence from all countries and contexts; no date or study design limits were applied, except English language limits. We included studies that specifically measured indoor temperature and examined its effect on physical or mental health outcomes. Evidence was graded using the National Institutes of Health framework. Results: Twenty-two articles were included in the review, including 11 observational, seven cross-sectional and three longitudinal cohort studies and one prospective case-control study. Eight main health effects were described: respiratory, blood pressure, core temperature, blood glucose, mental health and cognition, heat-health symptoms, physical functioning and influenza transmission. Five studies found respiratory symptoms worsened in warm indoor environments, with one reporting indoor temperatures higher than 26 degrees C, which was associated with increased respiratory distress calls being made to paramedics (odds ratio = 1.63, P = 0.056). Core symptoms of schizophrenia and dementia were found to be significantly exacerbated by indoor heat (the latter above a 26 degrees C cumulative exposure threshold). The absorption of insulin doses in people with type one diabetes was also significantly accelerated in hot indoor environments. Only five studies reported the temperatures at which health outcomes worsened, with thresholds ranging between 26 degrees C and 32 degrees C. However, owing to insufficient data and the heterogeneity of the included studies (design, population, setting, exposure measures, outcomes and location), meta-analysis and an upper threshold determination was not feasible. Conclusions: High indoor temperatures affect aspects of human health, with the strongest evidence for respiratory health, diabetes management and core schizophrenia and dementia symptoms. Exacerbation of symptoms in warm indoor environments has clinical relevance to at-risk groups and those caring for them. Care staff and facility managers need to be vigilant of high temperatures in care environments and should incorporate indoor overheating into their risk management and sustainability and/or climate change adaptation plans. The indoor temperature threshold at which adverse effects begin to occur remains unclear as studies seldom report the exposure-response relationship over a temperature continuum. Until there is extensive scientific data to support a maximum indoor temperature threshold, 26 degrees C may be the most suitable indoor temperature for at-risk groups in keeping with the existing guidance documents.

A systematic investigation of the climatology and spatiotemporal changes in sub-daily precipitation extremes is of paramount importance to inform future precipitation projection as well as to guide climate adaptation. Here, leveraging a newly proposed set of sub-daily extreme precipitation indices, we examine the climatology and changes in hourly precipitation extremes in mainland China across the major river basins during the warm period of 1970-2018. Our results show that the southern and eastern parts of China tend to experience more frequent hourly precipitation extremes with larger intensity, and the Pearl river basin has the most frequent and intense extreme precipitation at hourly timescale. The Southeast and Yangtze river basins and the mainland China as a whole have field significantly increasing trends in average and extreme precipitation intensities as well as in extreme precipitation frequencies. The intensification signals in hourly precipitation extremes of mainland China seem to emerge from internal climate variability around 2010, whereas average precipitation intensity since 1970 could become field significant earlier than 1999. Besides, we note a marked shift in the probability distributions of the extreme indices, with a wetting tendency toward more frequent and more intense precipitation extremes from the 1970-1999 period to the recent two decades in the 21st century. Our findings provide an alternative line of evidence for changes in precipitation extremes at hourly timescale over China and could contribute to societal decision-making for climate adaptation.","[Li, Xin; Zhang, Ke] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ke] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul Eng, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ke] Yangtze Inst Conservat & Dev, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin; Zhang, Ke] Hohai Univ, CMA HHU Joint Lab HydroMeteorol Studies, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ke] Hohai Univ, Key Lab Water Big Data Technol, Minist Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Bao, Hongjun; Zhang, Hengde] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Hohai University; Hohai University; Hohai University; Hohai University; China Meteorological Administration,"Zhang, K (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zhang, K (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul Eng, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",kzhang@hhu.edu.cn,"Li, Xin/E-2966-2018; Zhang, Ke/B-3227-2012","Li, Xin/0000-0001-7205-7506; Zhang, Ke/0000-0001-5288-9372","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41875131, 41775111]; Fundamental Re-search Funds for the Central Universities [B210202005, B200204038]; Jiangsu Shuangchuang Program; Nanjing Science and Technology Innovation Project for the Re-turned Overseas Chinese Scholars",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Re-search Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Jiangsu Shuangchuang Program; Nanjing Science and Technology Innovation Project for the Re-turned Overseas Chinese Scholars,"We thank Dr. David Pritchard and Prof. Hayley Fowler from Newcastle University for clarifying the sub-daily extreme precipitation indices in this study.

It encompasses meteorological science and technological support for national ecological civilization construction, especially national environmental protection and sustainable development. Accelerating ecological meteorology monitoring and research and establishing an operational brand is critical. The origin, concept, and primary research areas of ecological meteorology are hereby reviewed. Ecological meteorology studies the relationship between ecosystem and meteorological conditions (the core of multiple earth system sphere interactions) and serves the harmonious development of humans and nature. It includes six main aspects: (1) The patterns and laws of meteorologically induced ecosystem types and their geographical distribution; (2) the measurement of ecosystem temporal and spatial changes due to variable meteorological conditions; (3) the meteorological contribution and attribution analyses to ecological changes; (4) the feedback of ecosystem changes to the earth system; (5) the numerical modeling of ecological meteorology; (6) the interaction between meteorological conditions and ecosystems, and the principles that promote the harmonious development of humans and Nature. Compared with ecology and meteorology, ecological meteorology research has the following characteristics: (1) The time scale ranges from seconds to millennia; (2) the spatial scale ranges from the stomatal scale to the global scale; (3) the driving forces include weather, climate, atmospheric composition, climate change, and ecological and environmental changes; (4) the content emphasizes multiple earth system sphere interactions and disaster risk management; (5) the methods and technologies focus on satellite-ground integration monitoring systems and data-model fusion analyses; (6) the goal is to understand the relationship between humans and nature based on the sustainable development of the earth system. Ecological meteorology observations come from typical ecosystem research stations and regional-scale field investigations, and the operational services include assessing the ecological carrying capacity of climate resources and monitoring, evaluating, and warning for ecological meteorology disasters. This paper explains the relationship between ecological meteorology and ecological civilization construction, disaster prevention and mitigation, and how to address climate change. The primary and urgent ecological meteorology research tasks are extracting relevant information for analysis using big data and artificial intelligence, investigating ecosystem adaptations to climate change and their change attributions, exploring an ecosystem's main meteorological disaster processes and critical meteorological conditions, analyzing the eco-physiological mechanisms of key terrestrial ecosystem phenological periods and developing simulation models of them based on multiple environmental factors, developing an eco-meteorological numerical model coupling the biological, physical, and chemical, management processes, and understanding how terrestrial ecosystem changes and sustainable development countermeasures affect the climate system. Ecological meteorology is a new and promising field that is expected to provide valuable information for the future.","[Zhou, Guangsheng; Zhou, Li] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Guangsheng; Zhou, Li] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Joint Ecometeorol Lab, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Guangsheng; Zhou, Li] Zhengzhou Univ, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Zhengzhou University,"Zhou, GS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Zhou, GS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Joint Ecometeorol Lab, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.;Zhou, GS (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.",zhougs@cma.gov.cn,,,,,,,43,1,2,6,24,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",0023-074X,2095-9419,,CHIN SCI B-CHIN,Chin.

As indoor efficiency and reuse improves, outdoor use amounts to an increasingly large portion of consumptive urban water demand. Infill development, or the redevelopment of single-family properties to more dense multi-family and mixed-use developments, is a growing trend in urban planning; however, the influences of infill on outdoor water demand are poorly understood. The current work utilizes a remote sensing-based methodology to calculate parcel-scale irrigation rates in Denver, Colorado and applies a novel resampling methodology to model the impacts of redevelopment on outdoor water use. Results for 2018 showed irrigation rates varied by almost 250 mm between park and commercial land uses, and mean single-family irrigation rates of 224 mm exceeded multi-family rates by 70 mm. In the Berkeley neighborhood, modeled redevelopment of 1,347 single-family parcels (39.5%) resulted in a 102,000 m3 (83 acrefeet, or 30.2%) reduction in outdoor use. Citywide analyses indicate reductions of 141,000 m3 (114 acre-feet, or 0.76%) of residential outdoor use per one percent increase in redeveloped single-family parcels. These savings are equivalent to new annual supply for 181 four-person households and may provide significant contributions towards climate adaptation. Results highlight the importance of the continued integration of land use and water supply for demand management within the urban planning process.","[Blount, Kyle] Colorado Sch Mines, Hydrol Sci & Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Abdi, Reza; Panos, Chelsea L.; Hogue, Terri S.] Colorado Sch Mines, Civil & Environm Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Ajami, Newsha K.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Colorado School of Mines; Colorado School of Mines; Stanford University,"Blount, K (corresponding author), Colorado Sch Mines, Hydrol Sci & Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA.;Hogue, TS (corresponding author), Colorado Sch Mines, Civil & Environm Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",wkblount@mymail.mines.edu; rabdi@mines.edu; cpanos@mines.edu; newsha@stanford.edu; thogue@mines.edu,"Ajami, Newsha/GLU-2387-2022","Ajami, Newsha/0000-0003-4421-3764",National Science Foundation-funded Engineering Research Center for Reinventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt) [NSF EEC-1028968]; Colorado Higher Education Competitive Research Authority (CHECRA); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [R836174]; University of California-Berkeley,National Science Foundation-funded Engineering Research Center for Reinventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt); Colorado Higher Education Competitive Research Authority (CHECRA); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); University of California-Berkeley(University of California System),"The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments that helped improve the context and clarity of this manuscript.

They overlook not only ecological complexities but also the multitude of ways in which various population groups across the continent approach climatological variability, thereby challenging positivist modeling and external adaptation agendas. The current state of affairs for many often-silenced citizens is already one of hunger, uncertainty, and marginalization; the self-appointed lead actors on climate adaptation-states, markets, NGOs-have, from their vantage point, deeply troubling track records of dealing with people and their environments. For plenty of communities around Africa, it might therefore not so much be only the worsening climate that is increasingly exposing people to disease, displacement, and water insecurity, but the very policies adopted in the name of preparing for, and living with, worsening weather. This essay explores how understanding climate adaptation as a fundamentally social and political process points to possibilities for imagining and working toward futures with greater emancipatory potential. There is no scenario in which African societies adapt successfully to climatic change and do not simultaneously radically reimagine both their relationship with the outside world and with each other, including institutions of control and mechanisms of exclusion at home.","[Verhoeven, Harry] Columbia Univ, Ctr Global Energy Policy, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Verhoeven, Harry] Sch Internat & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Verhoeven, H (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Ctr Global Energy Policy, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Verhoeven, H (corresponding author), Sch Internat & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,82,0,0,0,0,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0011-5266,1548-6192,,DAEDALUS-US,Daedalus,FAL,2021,150,4,,,,,260,277,,10.1162/DAED_a_01883,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/DAED_a_01883,,,18,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,YW5QH,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000753467200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we further test the respiratory-energetics hypothesis and investigate potential interactions between metabolic and climatic pressures on human nasal morphology.Materials and Methods This study employed computed tomography (CT) scans of 79 mixed-sex crania derived from an extreme cold-dry locale (Point Hope, Alaska). In conjunction with basal metabolic rate (BMR, kcal/day) estimates derived from associated femoral head diameter measurements, 41 cranial three-dimensional (3D) coordinate landmarks and 17 linear measurements were employed in multivariate analyses to test for associations between metabolic demands and nasal/facial morphology across and within the sexes.Results Overall nasal size was found to be significantly correlated with BMR both across and within the sexes, with higher metabolic demands predictably associated with larger noses. However, associations between BMR and overall nasal size were found to be predominantly driven by nasal passage height and length dimensions, with the Arctic sample exhibiting minimal (non-dimorphic) variation in nasal passage breadths. Accordingly, significant correlations between BMR and 3D nasal shape were also identified.Discussion Our study provides additional support for the respiratory-energetics hypothesis, while providing insights into potential metabolic and climatic constraints on specific nasal dimensions. In particular, our results suggest that climatic pressures on nasal passage breadths for heat/moisture transfers may necessitate compensatory changes in passage heights (and developmentally-linked lengths) to maintain sufficient air intake to meet metabolic requirements.","[Kelly, Alexa Pennavaria; Maddux, Scott David] Univ North Texas, Ctr Anat Sci, Hlth Sci Ctr, 3500 Camp Bowie Blvd, Ft Worth, TX 76107 USA; [Ocobock, Cara] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Anthropol, Notre Dame, IN USA; [Ocobock, Cara] Univ Notre Dame, Eck Inst Global Hlth, Inst Educ Initiat, Notre Dame, IN USA; [Butaric, Lauren Nicole] Des Moines Univ, Dept Anat, Des Moines, IA USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; University of North Texas Health Science Center; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame,"Kelly, AP (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Ctr Anat Sci, Hlth Sci Ctr, 3500 Camp Bowie Blvd, Ft Worth, TX 76107 USA.",alexakelly@my.unthsc.edu,,"Ocobock, Cara/0000-0002-6949-2029",National Science Foundation [2050253]; Wenner-Gren Foundation [10009],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Wenner-Gren Foundation,"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 2050253; Wenner-Gren Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 10009",,168,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2692-7691,,,AM J BIOL ANTHROPOL,Am.

Adjusting the crop management practices based on the assessment of adaptability mechanisms to take full advantage of climate resources during the growing season is an important technique for japonica rice adaptation to climate changed conditions. Research based on the adaptability mechanisms of japonica rice to temperature and other environmental variables has theoretical and practical significance to constitute a theoretical foundation for sustainable japonica rice production system. A contrived study was arranged with method of replacing time with space having four different japonica cultivars namely Longdao-18, Longdao-21, Longjing-21, and Suijing-18, and carried out in Harbin and Qiqihar during the years 2017-2019 to confer with the adaptability mechanisms in terms of growth, yield and quality. The formation of the grain-filling material for superior and inferior grains was mainly in the middle phase which shared nearly 60% of whole grain-filling process. Maximum yield was noticed in Longdao-18 at Harbin and Qiqihar which was 9500 and 13,250 kg/ha, respectively. The yield contributing components fertile tillers, number of grains per panicle, and 1000-grain weight were higher at Qiqihar; therefore, there was more potential to get higher yield. The data for grain-filling components demonstrated that the filling intensity and duration at Qiqihar was contributive to increase the grain yield, whereas the limiting agents to limit yield at Harbin were the dry weights of inferior grains. The varietal differences in duration and time of day of anthesis were small. Across all cultivars and both study sites, nearly 85% of the variation of the maximum time of anthesis could be justified with mean atmospheric temperature especially mean minimum temperature. Mean onset of anthesis was earliest in Longdao-21 at Harbin, whereas it was latest in Longdao-18 at Qiqihar. The maximum time to end anthesis and the longest duration of anthesis were taken by Longdao-18, i.e., 9.0 hasr and 4.2 h, respectively. Chalkiness and brown rice percentages were elevated at Qiqihar showing Harbin produced good quality rice. This study investigated the adaptability mechanisms of japonica rice under varying temperature conditions to distinguish the stress tolerance features for future sustainability and profitability in NEC. It was concluded that there is an adaptive value for anthesis especially regarding T-min and, moreover, earlier transplantation may produce tall plants. The results demonstrated that high temperature at the onset of anthesis at the start of the day enhanced the escape from high temperature later during the day. Early transplantation is recommended in NEC because earlier anthesis during humid days rendered for potential escape from high ambient temperature later during that day. Temperature influenced japonica rice significantly and coherently, whereas the influence of growing season precipitation was not significant. Daily mean sunshine influenced the japonica rice significantly, but the impact was less spatially coherent. The results foregrounded the response of the japonica rice to external driving factors focusing climate, but ignored socioeconomic suggesting emphasis on both driving factors to target future research and render important insights into how japonica rice can adapt in mid-high-latitude regions.","[Shahbaz Farooq, Muhammad; Gyilbag, Amatus; Xu, Yinlong] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Virk, Ahmad Latif] China Agr Univ, Coll Agron & Biotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development in Agriculture, CAAS; China Agricultural University","Xu, YL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",virk3813b64@yahoo.com,"Virk, Ahmad Latif/B-6223-2019; Shahbaz Farooq, Muhammad/HNB-7639-2023; Virk, Ahmad Latif/GLR-2415-2022","Virk, Ahmad Latif/0000-0002-1558-9642; AMATUS, GYILBAG/0000-0003-1722-3959","Climate Change Adaptation Lab of Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture (IEDA), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS)","Climate Change Adaptation Lab of Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture (IEDA), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS)","This study was financially supported by the Climate Change Adaptation Lab of Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture (IEDA), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS).",,103,4,4,2,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,NOV,2021,11,11,,,,,,,2367,10.3390/agronomy11112367,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11112367,,,35,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,XF0GH,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000723757400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Firstly, the evolution of ISM precipitation, mean temperature and soil moisture during June to September 2001-2010 is verified using Emanuel over land and Grell over ocean with Arakawa and Schubert (1974) closure, in combination with the two planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes, Holtslag and University of Washington - UW Turbulence closure model for PBL. Then the feedback due to extended desertification between land surface and PBL, during ISM regime is studied. The RCM simulations with Emanuel over land and Grell over ocean with Arakawa and Schubert (1974) closure in combination with UW PBL scheme, is able to properly simulate the rainfall, mean temperature JJAS climatology with bias in rainfall similar to 2 mm/day and bias in mean temperature is similar to 0.5-1 degrees C over the monsoon core region. Numerical experiments (control and design experiment) with the above mentioned combination of PBL schemes is performed for investigating the impact of extended desertification on the changes in the ISM precipitation, surface fluxes, circulation pattern, moisture fluxes and net radiation etc. In the extended desert design experiment, the land-use pattern in the model over Thar Desert (i.e. northwestern part of Indian sub-continent between Pakistan and northwestern India) is changed from crop/mixed farming and semi-desert to desert/semi-desert type of vegetation, mimicking extended desertification in the RegCMv4.4.5.10 model. Results show that due to increase in desertification over Thar deserts there is increase in albedo resulting from a decrease in plant cover, along with formation of anomalous anti-cyclonic circulation causes a decrease in JJAS rainfall (p < 0.01) over north, north-west India by -1 to -2 mm/day (similar to 25% reduction). Anomalous anti-cyclonic circulation over the Indian land mass in the extended desertification experiment causes less convective heating and is responsible for the decrease in precipitation (with respect to control experiment). The anomalous anti-cyclonic circulation developed covers northern part of Bay of Bengal resulting in decrease in moisture advection of the order of -12 to -18 kgm(-1)sec(-1) (similar to 10% reduction). This drives away all moisture from the nearby regions. The effect of extended desertification induced feedbacks on variability and dominant modes of variability of Indian monsoon precipitation and soil wetness is also studied and reported. Finally, it is concluded that the relative magnitudes of the changes in albedo and vegetation (or vegetation roughness length) are important determinants of the size of climate change due to prescribed extended desert landscape over Thar desert region of Indian subcontinent. The results of this numerical study provides a basis and reference study for LULCC and mitigation measure human beings need to undertake for climate change adaptation.","[Lodh, Abhishek] Minist Earth Sci, Earth Syst Sci Org, Natl Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasting NCMRWF, A-50,Sect 62, Noida 201309, India; [Lodh, Abhishek] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Ctr Atmospher Sci, New Delhi 110016, India",Earth System Science Organization (ESSO); Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Lodh, A (corresponding author), Minist Earth Sci, Earth Syst Sci Org, Natl Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasting NCMRWF, A-50,Sect 62, Noida 201309, India.",abhishek.iitd.lodh@gmail.com,"lodh, abhishek/AGR-2143-2022","Lodh, Abhishek/0000-0002-4951-0226",MHRD (Govt. of India),"MHRD (Govt. of India)(Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India)","The author is thankful to Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy for making the RegCMv4.4.5.10 model codes available for this study and regular updates via RegCNET.

Here, a three-dimensional conceptual framework of 'power as domination' is applied to the UNFCCC adaptation regime. We argue that this 'power-over' framing is an important lens through which to view adaptation, a field dominated by 'power-to', capacity-based constructs. The framework distinguishes between power-over manifesting through decision-making, agenda setting and preference shaping. Through a literature review we demonstrate that first and second dimension behavioral views of power-over fail to account for the subtle ways in which the interests and preferences of smallholder farmers are unknowingly shaped and restricted within the regime. Potential sources of third dimension preference shaping power are explored in a survey with high-level decision makers involved in National Adaptation Plans (NAP) development in seven countries. The results suggest that several inter-related features of the international agriculture adaptation regime collectively contribute to the shaping of interests and preferences of smallholders: prevailing discourses of uncertainty and the perceived limited capacity of smallholders; the resulting privileged status of 'expert' decision makers; the predominance of neoliberal development rationalities; and systemic biases resulting from the nation state as the principle unit of UNFCCC negotiation. These forces lie beyond the explanatory scope of first and second dimensions of power-over and help to explain why stakeholder engagement in adaptation decision making remains superficial in nature and why adaptation responses in agriculture can be considered 'common and non-differentiated'. We argue for increased awareness of third dimension manifestations and impacts of power in adaptation literature to facilitate the improved participation of marginalized stakeholders in UNFCCC and domestic adaptation decision making forums, to increase the diversity of adaptation options available to smallholders, and ultimately, to improve the attribution of responsibility for adaptation outcomes.

The same period has brought economic growth, aggressive government-funded social support programmes, and technological advancements. These latter factors have led to widespread, successful, and largely unintended adaptation to increasing climatic stress. With specific focus on the experience of irrigated farmers in Pernambuco during the 2011-2013 drought, the worst in a half century, in this article, we examine how Brazil's societal changes have led to the emergence of unique climate adaptation strategies. To put this into context, income diversification, particularly in the form of employment in clothing production, provides a stable back-up income for farmers amidst environmental uncertainty. Aggressive poverty alleviation programmes, foundational to the presidential administrations of Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, have had the spillover benefit of decreasing climate vulnerability. Efficient irrigation technology, which farmers have adopted primarily in an effort to decrease erosion and labour needs, saves water and decreases drought vulnerability. In summary, we find that the study area serves as a global example that economic, political, and social developments not aimed at climate adaptation can inadvertently facilitate it and decrease drought vulnerability.","[Herwehe, Lauren; Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Herwehe, Lauren; Scott, Christopher A.] Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA",University of Arizona,"Herwehe, L (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.;Herwehe, L (corresponding author), Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.",laurenherwehe@gmail.com,,"Kim Herwehe, Lauren/0000-0002-8841-8879",ICER; Directorate For Geosciences [1128040] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; ICER; Directorate For Geosciences [1459322] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,ICER; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); ICER; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),,,36,7,7,1,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

In the Bolivian Andes, the Chacaltaya glacier (5400 masl) had been a tourist destination known as the highest ski slope in the world since 1939. As a result of climate change, skiing has not been possible after 1987 and the glacier definitely disappeared in 2009. However, since 2005, the place has become a new attraction for tourists. Travel agencies in La Paz now offer day trips to the Chacaltaya site. In order to understand the present attraction of the site and its potential for reproduction elsewhere, 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted with various categories of stakeholders involved in the tourism industry in La Paz, and archives and images were analysed. Our results show that the multifunctional character of this tourist site, including easy access to a summit, beautiful views, acclimatisation to altitude and opportunity to experience snow, are key factors in its renewed attraction for visitors, together with, to a lesser extent, the incentive of being able to watch a famous and evident full disappearance of a glacier and former ski slope. The stakeholders' groups share general views and perceptions about environmental changes and about the qualities of the site, but they also differ in terms of projects and evaluation of potential attractiveness. In particular, the development of the visibility of climate change impacts on mountain environment is valued by experts or by members of the Andean Club, but not by travel agencies. The example of Chacaltaya shows that multifunctional tourist sites may still be attractive in the future.","[Kaenzig, Raoul] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Geog, Espace Louis Agassiz 1, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Rebetez, Martine; Serquet, Gaelle] Univ Neuchatel, Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Inst Geog & Swiss Fed Inst Forest, Espace Louis Agassiz 1, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland","University of Neuchatel; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Neuchatel","Kaenzig, R (corresponding author), Univ Neuchatel, Inst Geog, Espace Louis Agassiz 1, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",raoul.kaenzig@unine.ch,,"Rebetez, Martine/0000-0002-3337-2025",,,,,40,32,34,4,69,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-6688,1470-1340,,TOURISM GEOGR,Tour.

Using data from a national survey (N = 4031), individuals with robust collective efficacy beliefs were found to be more likely to participate in community activities intended to ensure the adequacy of water supplies, and this relationship was found to be stronger in communities with high levels of community collective efficacy compared to communities with low levels of community collective efficacy. In addition, community collective efficacy was positively associated with self-reported community adaptation responses.

This study carries out material property tests on typical bamboo variants and hygrothermal performance simulation on bamboo exterior wall constructions in the Asia-Pacific bamboo areas, and makes comparison with reference timber units in parallel. Results show that, except for bamboo particleboard, the rest bamboo variants have overall lower hygric properties and higher thermal properties, and some indicators of bamboo scrimber and bamboo mat board exceed the property range of the reference timber. The construction groups with bamboo particleboard as interior or (thickened) interlayer boards show overall better hygrothermal performance than those with timber units given the same construction and space size. For example, the annual total cooling demand and cooling peak are reduced by up to 14%, respectively. The combination of bamboo mat board and bamboo particleboard in bamboo groups shows better performance in most indicators than the combination of OSB and Spruce in timber groups. Thanks to the advantages of lower cost and technical requirement, bamboo particleboard and bamboo mat board have the potential to be local climate adaptive building materials and are competitive compared with the corresponding timber products. The multi-level comparison between bamboo and timber units in this study demonstrates the feasibility to 'substitute timber with bamboo' in terms of hygrothermal performance, identifies the dominant bamboo variants and offers suggestions on its market competition with timber.

Observed annual maximum series (AMS) of extreme precipitation intensities of 17 durations (1-min to 1440-min) and runoff records of 27 years from a 21.255 ha (23% impervious, 35% built-up and 41% open areas) Risvollan catchment in Trondheim City were used. Using a balanced bootstrap resampling (BBRS) with frequency analysis, we quantified considerable uncertainty in precipitation and runoff quantiles due to the sampling variability of systematic observations (e.g., -43% to +49% relative differences from the quantile estimates for the original sample). These differences are higher than suggested increase in design rainfall and floods by many countries for climate change adjustment. The uncertainties in IDF curves and derived design storm hyetographs are found to have large effects on the reliability of sizing of stormwater pipes. The study also indicated low validity of the assumptions on extreme precipitation and runoff relationships in the return period-based method for the partially paved urban catchment: (i) maximum of only 46% of the AMS of extreme precipitation and runoff events occurred concurrently and (ii) T-year return period extreme precipitation events do not necessarily result in T-year flood events. These indicate that there are effects of snowmelt seasonality, and probably catchment moisture states and interactions between the flows in subsurface media and pipes. The results substantiate the need for better understanding of relationships between precipitation and runoff extremes and urban runoff generation process, and importance of uncertainty assessment and application of reliability-based methods for design and management of water infrastructure.

J,"Cotton, M; Stevens, E",,,,"Cotton, Matthew; Stevens, Emma",,,Mapping Discourses of Climate Change Adaptation in the United Kingdom,WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social Science,EXTREME WEATHER; PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT; Q-METHODOLOGY; RISK; POLICY; VULNERABILITY; SCIENCE; LEVEL; PERCEPTIONS; MANAGEMENT,"The concept of adaptation is becoming part of mainstream public discourse on climate change. Yet the diversity, complexity, and novelty of the adaptation concept itself leads to interpretive flexibility, differing public understanding of (and engagement with) adaptation strategies, and hence differentiated policy responses. The boundary work of communicative practices and public understanding of the adaptation concept therefore requires empirical analysis in different cases and contexts. This study employs Q-methodology (a combined quantitative-qualitative social research method) to reveal the typologies of perspectives that emerge around the adaptation concept among a diverse group of citizen-stakeholders in the United Kingdom. Four such typologies are identified under the labels 1) top-down climate action, 2) collective action on climate change, 3) optimistic, values-focused adaptation, and 4) adaptation skepticism. The division between these perspectives reveals a perceived responsibility gap between the governmental-institutional and/or individual-community levels. Across the emergent discourses we find a consensual call for a multisector, multiscalar, and multistakeholder-led approach that posits adaptation as a contemporary, intragenerational problem, with a strong emphasis upon managing extreme weather events, and not as an abstract future problem. By attending to these public discourses in climate policy, this presents a potential means to lessen such a responsibility gap.","[Cotton, Matthew] Univ York, Dept Environm, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Stevens, Emma] Univ Sheffield, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of Sheffield,"Cotton, M (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Environm, York, N Yorkshire, England.",matthew.cotton@york.ac.uk,,"Cotton, Matthew/0000-0002-8877-4822",,,,,111,10,11,0,51,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1948-8327,1948-8335,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

With this in mind we seek to identify entry points to integrate short- to medium-term climate risk reduction within development activities in Africa, drawing from experiences in Ethiopia. To achieve this we employ a range of data and methods. We examine the changing nature of climate risks using analysis of recent climate variability, future climate scenarios and their secondary impacts. We assess the effects of climate variability on agricultural production and national GDP. Entry points and knowledge gaps in relation to mainstreaming climate risks in Ethiopia are identified using the Government's plan for poverty reduction. We end with a case study incorporating climate risks through drought insurance within the current social protection programme in Ethiopia, which provides support to 8.3 million people. Rainfall behaviour in Ethiopia shows no marked emergent changes and future climate projections show continued warming but very mixed patterns of rainfall change. Economic analysis highlights sensitivities within the economy to large-scale drought, however, while the effects are clear in major drought years in other years the relationship is weak. For social protection fairly small positive and negative effects on the number of recipients and frequency of cash payments during drought occur under the extreme range of climate model rainfall projections (2020s). Our analysis highlights several important challenges and opportunities for addressing climate risks. Challenges primarily relate to the large uncertainties in climate projections for parts of Africa, a weak evidence base of complex, often non-deterministic, climate-society interactions and institutional issues. Opportunities relate to the potential for low-regrets measures to reduce vulnerability to current climate variability which can be integrated with relatively modest effort within a shift in Africa from a disaster-focused view of climate to a long-term perspective that emphasises livelihood security and vulnerability reduction.

Potential economic ramifications for ski operators are assessed separately for the main revenue-generating period and shoulder seasons. The paper concludes that climate change does not pose a threat to the Quebec ski industry under 2020s scenarios and that, while adequate snow base can be maintained with additional snowmaking under even the warmest scenario for the 2050s, the combined economic impact of lost revenue opportunities from a shortened ski season and increased snowmaking costs will likely prove prohibitive for some ski operators.

This paper reflects on how co-production shaped the development of the portal and evaluates its use and the usability of the most frequently accessed tool, the Climate Adaptation Atlas'. Analysis of evaluation reports and web-statistics revealed a substantial, diverse and regularly returning group of visitors to the portal. For example, municipalities use the atlas to understand how their municipality can be impacted by climate change to support spatial planning. Using the usability criteria of fit, interplay and interaction, the analysis showed that the atlas fits the needs of creating awareness and integrating climate information with other spatial information. However, the interplay of new climate information with other currently used information varies amongst municipalities. Interactions between scientists and users were found at different stages involving different actors. Based on the development and use of the portal, seven lessons have been derived emphasising the importance of a continuous co-production process with users; a modular setup to acknowledge the diversity in approaches; encouraging users by providing showcases of adaptation initiatives and enabling exchange of information amongst users; the need for political support; the ability and will to act even in case of uncertainty; flexibility in project design to incorporate changes in user needs and the beneficial role of boundary organisations in improving mutual understanding. Through this paper, contributions to the understanding of how adaptation web portals can be developed and improved are made.","[Laudien, Rahel; Goosen, Hasse; van Nieuwaal, Kim] Climate Adaptat Serv, Bussummergrindweg 1-J, NL-1406 NZ Bussum, Netherlands; [Boon, Eva] Univ Utrecht, POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Laudien, R (corresponding author), Climate Adaptat Serv, Bussummergrindweg 1-J, NL-1406 NZ Bussum, Netherlands.",rahel@climateadaptationservices.com,,"Goosen, Hasse/0000-0002-8749-2874; Boon, Eva/0000-0002-8071-1595",,,,,37,18,18,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The Hotterdam study accordingly measured urban heat and modelled the surface energy balance in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. It identified in detail the city's social, morphological, and land-use dimensions using a geographic information system (GIS), 3D models, and satellite images. It used hierarchical and multivariate regression analyses to determine the links between temperatures and the surface energy balance on the one hand, and social, morphological, and land-use aspects on the other. The Hotterdam study did establish a link between the urban heat island effect in Rotterdam and the health of its population. It also statistically explained the high rate of mortality among seniors seventy-five and over during the summer of 2006. The spatial concentration of senior citizens, the average age of the buildings they live in, and the sum of the sensible heat flux and storage heat flux play a large role. Imperviousness, the leaf area index, the building envelope, surface water, and shade are the dimensions that best explained the Rotterdam urban heat island.

We find that generalist ENGOs have a higher likelihood of tackling climate change issues and even of indicating them as a priority area of their work. However, we also find that the issue areas of the specialist ENGOs and whether these align with climate action explain variation across ENGOs based in different countries. Compared with wildlife-focused ENGOs, especially those working on nature protection and sustainability are more likely to tackle climate change issues.

It reviews the relevant literature on migration, disasters and climate change, and constructs a model through which international policies may be used to encourage resettlement options that support the capabilities and entitlements of poor and vulnerable populations. By distinguishing between rapid-onset disasters and long-term environmental change, it explores the ways in which cash transfers, asset transfers and conditional cash transfers may be used to break the cycle of vulnerability, destitution and distress migration that can occur during times of severe environmental stress. An important distinction is made between economic migration, which implies that households have at their disposal an opportunity to engage in forward-looking analysis about the ways in which they will invest household resources and distress migration, which implies that household decisions about investment and migration are largely ad hoc responses to external environmental processes and events. The article reviews recent discussions about the prospects of revising the international refugee regime, and identifies the opportunities and challenges of using social protection to support household decisions that can facilitate economic migration over the long-term.

Strategic investments in training and support, especially in broad-based efforts that span traditional disciplinary boundaries, can help ECRs meet this potential and become emerging leaders equipped to address pressing climate-related challenges throughout their careers. In 2018, the inaugural USDA Northeast Climate Hub's Graduate Climate Adaptation Partners (GradCAP) Program was launched to provide professional development opportunities and a platform for collaboration to graduate students studying climate resilience in agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture. This essay represents the unified voice of this consortium of emerging leaders. Here we offer perspectives, experiences, and recommendations for building capacity among ECRs, specifically with regard to interdisciplinary research, long-term research, and community engagement. We discuss these three tenants, which we term Convergence, Continuity, and Community, as essential elements in the development of successful leaders prepared for the complex challenges ahead. We encourage institutions, particularly universities and government agencies, to commit resources and pursue structural changes to provide support for mentorship and training that span these focal areas. As a result, more ECRs will have the capacity to engage in meaningful solution-oriented research and make lasting societal contributions toward the sustainable production of food and other natural resources in a changing climate.","[Birthisel, S.

This research aims to design and evaluate robust adaptable plans under deep climate uncertainties in the agricultural sector. For this purpose, a combination of the Adaptation Pathways (AP) approach in conjunction with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is used to evaluate the robustness of adaptation actions and to design robust adaptation pathways under future climate uncertainties in the Hablehroud River Basin, Iran. Deep climate uncertainties are specified as plausible climate scenario combinations according to the average precipitation and temperature changes in Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, 2020-2080. According to the results, changes in cropping patterns represent the most robust adaptation action across various combinations of climate scenarios. Other adaptation actions, including deficit irrigation, changes in crop planting dates, and improving irrigation efficiency, are fairly robust in the specific time period from 2020 to 2080. Sequencing of these adaptation actions based on their robustness and expiry date results in designing adaptation pathway maps under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. Finally, different preferred pathways are identified based on the expiry date of each robust adaptation action. Changes in cropping patterns can be selected as the most robust adaptation pathway (robustness greater than 80) under deep climate uncertainty among these different pathways. Suggesting other preferred pathways can be helpful to select reasonable pathways for implementation.","[Babaeian, Fariba; Delavar, Majid; Morid, Saeed] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Engn & Management, Tehran, Iran; [Srinivasan, Raghavan] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Srinivasan, Raghavan] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Tarbiat Modares University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Delavar, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Engn & Management, Tehran, Iran.",m.delavar@modares.ac.ir,"Delavar, Majid/AFP-1708-2022",,,,,,64,7,7,7,26,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-3774,1873-2283,,AGR WATER MANAGE,Agric.

J,"Wu, J; Zhou, BT; Xu, Y",,,,Wu Jia; Zhou Bo-Tao; Xu Ying,,,Response of precipitation and its extremes over China to warming: CMIP5 simulation and projection,CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION,,,Chinese,Article,,,,,,Warming; CMIP5; Precipitation; Precipitation extremes; Regional response,CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; SCENARIOS; DATASET; TRENDS,"The relationship between regional precipitation change and warming is an important open issue in climate change physical science. Because precipitation in China has strong sensitivity to warming, quantitative assessment and projection on the responses of precipitation and its extremes in a warming world are crucial for better understanding of regional climate change and helpful for regional adaption to climate change. For this reason, based on simulations of 24 models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), this study assesses the ability of the models in simulating the responses of annual mean precipitation and its extremes to warming over China and its subregions, and then projects their change under the RCP4. 5 and RCP8. 5 scenarios that represent respectively a medium-low and high radiative forcing. The annual mean precipitation is defined as the total amount of precipitation from January to December. The precipitation extremes are measured by the R95p (very wet days) and R99p (extremely wet days) indices, which are defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). According to the definition of ETCCDI, the R95p and R99p refer to annual total precipitation when the daily precipitation exceeds the 95th and the 99th percentile of the wet day precipitation, respectively. Eight subregions determined by administrative boundaries and societal and geographical conditions, i. e., NEC(Northeast China), NC(North China), EC (East China), CC (Central China), SC (South China), SWC1 (Tibetan Plateau), SWC2(Southwest China), and NWC(Northwest China), are used in this study. The model performance is validated through the comparison for the time period from 1961 to 2005 between the historical simulation and the gridding observation dataset with a horizontal resolution of 0. 25 degrees X 0. 25 degrees in latitude and longitude. Quantitative analysis shows that the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble (MME) can generally capture the spatial features of the temperature, mean precipitation and precipitation extremes as well as the relationship of precipitation and its extremes with temperature over China. However, it underestimates the response of mean precipitation while overestimates the response of precipitation extremes over China region in historical period. The CMIP5 MME also has some abilities in reproducing the responses of the mean precipitation and its extremes to the warming over the subregions of China, and better performance can be found for the precipitation extremes. Under the RCP4. 5 and RCP8. 5 scenarios, concurrent with the temperature rising, the mean precipitation and precipitation extremes are projected to increase consistently over China. As the regional mean temperature rises by 1 degrees C, the mean precipitation will increase by 3. 5% and 2. 4%, and the R95p will increase by 8. 0% and 11., respectively. The response of R99p is much more sensitive, respectively with an increase of 15. 3% and 21. 6%. For the subregions of China, they all show positive response and the regional difference will decrease in the future. Moreover, the sensitivity of the precipitation extremes to the warming is higher than that of the mean precipitation. The stronger the precipitation extreme is, the higher sensitivity it will have. Besides, the response of the mean precipitation to the warming is larger in Northern China than in Southern China. The largest increases in R95p and R99p are projected in the Tibetan Plateau and Southwest China, indicating an increasing risk of heavy rainfall and floods.","[Wu Jia; Zhou Bo-Tao; Xu Ying] Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhou Bo-Tao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Wu, J (corresponding author), Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",wujia@cma.gov.cn; zhoubt@cma.gov.cn,"Wu, Jia/C-8393-2013",,,,,,39,50,78,5,80,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0001-5733,,,CHINESE J GEOPHYS-CH,Chinese J.

The problem is likely to be further aggravated by the growing population pressure. A viable pathway is climate smart agriculture, aiming at the triple win of improving food security and climate change adaptation, while contributing to mitigation if possible. The Government of Rwanda has initiated ambitious policies and programs aiming at low emission agricultural development. Crop focused policies include the Crop Intensification Program (CIP) which facilitates access to inorganic fertilizer and improved seeds. In the livestock subsector, zero-grazing and improved livestock feeding are encouraged, and the Girinka program provides poor farm households with a crossbred dairy cow. In this study, we aimed at assessing the potential impact of these policy programs on food availability and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 884 households across different agro-ecologies and farming systems in Rwanda. Household level calculations were used to assess the contribution of current crops, livestock and off-farm activities to food availability and GHG emissions. Across all sites, 46% of households were below the 2500 kcal MAE(-1) yr(-1) line, with lower food availability in the Southern and Eastern Rwanda. Consumed and sold food crops were the mainstay of food availability, contributing between 81.2% (low FA class) to 53.1% (high FA class). Livestock and off-farm income were the most important pathways to higher FA. Baseline GHG emissions were low, ranging between 395 and 1506 kg CO(2)e hh(-1) yr(-1) per site, and livestock related emissions from enteric fermentation (47.6-48.9%) and manure (26.7-31.8%) were the largest contributors to total GHG emissions across sites and FA classes. GHG emissions increased with FA, with 50% of the total GHG being emitted by 22% of the households with the highest FA scores. Scenario assessment of the three policy options showed strong differences in potential impacts: Girinka only reached one third of the household population, but acted highly pro-poor by decreasing the households below the 2500 kcal MAE(-1) yr(-1) line from 46% to 35%. However, Girinka also increased GHG by 1174 kg CO(2)e hh(-1) yr(-1), and can therefore not be considered climate-smart. Improved livestock feeding was the least equitable strategy, decreasing food insufficient households by only 3%. However, it increased median FA by 755 kcal MAE(-1) yr(-1) at a small GHG increase (50 kg CO(2)e hh(-1) yr(-1)). Therefore, it is a promising option to reach the CSA triple win. Crop and soil improvement resulted in the smallest increase in median FA (FA by 322 kcal MAE(-1) yr(-1)), and decreasing the proportion of households below 2500 kcal MAE(-1) yr(-1) by 6%. This came only at minimal increase in GHG emissions (23 kg CO(2)e hh(-1) yr(-1)). All policy programs had different potential impacts and trade-offs on different sections of the farm household population. Quick calculations like the ones presented in this study can assist in policy dialogue and stakeholder engagement to better select and prioritize policies and development programs, despite the complexity of its impacts and trade-offs.

There is increasing evidence that anthropogenic climate change has a direct and indirect impact on the availability of natural n-3 LC-PUFA. However, this information is fragmented and not well organized. Therefore, this article reviewed published data from laboratory experiments, field experiments and model simulations to reveal the impact of climate change on the global supply of natural n3 LC-PUFA and how this will limit the availability of n-3 LC-PUFA in the future food web. In general, climate change can significantly reduce the availability of natural n-3 LC-PUFA in grazing food webs in the following ways: 1) decrease the total biomass of phytoplankton and shift the plankton community structure to a smaller size, which also reduce the biomass of animals in higher trophics; 2) reduce the n-3 LC-PUFA content and/or quality (n-3: n-6 ratio) of all marine organisms; 3) reduce the transfer efficiency of n-3 LC-PUFA in grazing food web. In addition, as an anthropogenic climate adaptation measure, this review also proposed some alternative sources of n-3 LC-PUFA and determined the direction of future research. The information in this article is very useful for providing a critical analysis of the impact of climate change on the supply of natural n-3 LC-PUFA. Such information will aid to establish climate adaptation or management measures, and determine the direction of future research.","[Tan, Karsoon; Zhang, Hongkuan; Zheng, Huaiping] Shantou Univ, Marine Sci Inst, Key Lab Marine Biotechnol Guangdong Prov, Shantou 515063, Peoples R China; [Tan, Karsoon; Zhang, Hongkuan; Zheng, Huaiping] Mariculture Res Ctr Subtrop Shellfish & Algae Gua, Shantou 515063, Peoples R China; [Tan, Karsoon; Zhang, Hongkuan; Zheng, Huaiping] Shantou Univ, STU UMT Joint Shellfish Res Lab, Shantou 515063, Peoples R China",Shantou University; Shantou University,"Tan, K; Zheng, HP (corresponding author), Shantou Univ, Marine Sci Inst, Key Lab Marine Biotechnol Guangdong Prov, Shantou 515063, Peoples R China.",1124tan@stu.edu.cn; hpzheng@stu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [42106126, 31872563]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFD0901400]; China Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System [CARS-49]; STU Scientific Research Foundation for Talents [NTF21018]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; China Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System; STU Scientific Research Foundation for Talents,"Acknowledgement Present study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42106126 and 31872563) , National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFD0901400) , China Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System (CARS-49) , STU Scientific Research Foundation for Talents (NTF21018) .",,131,5,5,6,11,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0163-7827,1873-2194,,PROG LIPID RES,Prog.

They survive in a relatively warm environment (mean annual temperature 0 degrees C to +1 degrees C) due to local topographic controls and high levels of accumulation as a result of avalanche and wind-blown snow. In the Pirin Mountains, Bulgaria, Snezhnika glacieret has been cored, providing an archive of recent climate change. Small glaciers such as this respond quickly to climatic extremes. Since the LIA maximum during the 19th century, all southern European glaciers have retreated, losing 30-100% of their volume. However, despite the trend towards warmer years since the late 1970s, some glaciers still survive, even after some of the hottest summers on record.

In addition, it identifies three trends in coastal adaptation and associated technology use: (i) a growing recognition of the benefits of soft protection and of the adaptation strategies retreat and accommodate, (ii) an increasing reliance on technologies to develop and manage information, and (iii) an enhanced awareness of the need for coastal adaptation to be appropriate for local natural and socio-economic conditions.","Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; Middlesex Univ, Flood Hazard Res Ctr, Enfield EN3 4SF, Middx, England; Meteorol Serv, Vacoas, Mauritius; Tecnomare SpA, R&D Div, I-30124 Venice, Italy; NOAA, Coastal Serv Ctr, Charleston, SC 29405 USA",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Middlesex University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Klein, RJT (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",,"Capobianco, Michele/ABD-6770-2020; Nicholls, Robert James/ABD-1481-2020; Nicholls, Robert James/G-3898-2010; Klein, Richard J.T./B-1148-2009","Capobianco, Michele/0000-0002-1573-7879; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Klein, Richard J.T./0000-0002-9458-0944",,,,,176,149,153,2,68,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0749-0208,,,J COASTAL RES,J.

A high agreement between current growing regions and optimal climatic zones is thus anticipated for a given variety. A changing climate is, however, expected to impose new challenges to this long-term varietal selection. The present research examines the spatial distribution of the main grapevine varieties in Portugal, establishing current and future optimal climatic zones for each variety. The spatial locations of 44 varieties are assessed, and their growing degree-day (GDD) requirements are computed using a high resolution climatic dataset (<1 km). A clustering methodology is applied to the spatial patterns of the optimal GDD of each variety, leading to three varietal groupings (early, intermediate and late). Future changes (2041-2060) in those patterns are then analysed using a 17 model-ensemble and two scenarios (RCP4.5 and 8.5). Results indicate that Portuguese varieties have high adaptability, because they are grown over a large range of thermal conditions. Although the three clusters provide a good agreement with the current growth conditions, a strong warming trend is projected in the future, resulting in projections of a northward shift and move to higher elevations for the cluster patterns. Hence, other European regions may experience improved growing conditions for the settlement of these Portuguese varieties. Nonetheless, future varietal selection will heavily depend on the interest of winemakers and global market policies for the production of specific wines. Adaptation measures may indeed be required for maintaining the current varietal distribution.","[Fraga, H.; Santos, J. A.; Malheiro, A. C.; Oliveira, A.

This redistribution constitutes a significant challenge for climate adaptation planning and may affect how countries engage in cooperative action. This paper investigates the long-term (2070-2099) potential impacts of climate change on global food trade networks of three key crops: wheat, rice and maize. We propose a simple network model to project how climate change impacts on crop yields may be translated into changes in trade. Combining trade and climate impact data, our analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we use network community detection to analyse how the concentration of global production in present-day trade communities may become disrupted with climate change impacts. Second, we study how countries may change their network position following climate change impacts. Third, we study the total climate-induced change in production plus import within trade communities. Results indicate that the stability of food trade network structures compared to today differs between crops, and that countries' maize trade is least stable under climate change impacts. Results also project that threats to global food security may depend on production change in a few major global producers, and whether trade communities can balance production and import loss in some vulnerable countries. Overall, our model contributes a baseline analysis of cross-border climate impacts on food trade networks.","[Hedlund, Johanna; Bodin, Orjan] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2b, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Carlsen, Henrik] Stockholm Environm Inst, Box 242 18, SE-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Croft, Simon; West, Chris; Stokeld, Emilie] Univ York, Stockholm Environm Inst York, Dept Environm & Geog, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England; [Jagermeyr, Jonas] Columbia Univ, Climate Sch, 2910 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Jagermeyr, Jonas] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Jagermeyr, Jonas; Mueller, Christoph] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany",Stockholm University; Stockholm Environment Institute; University of York - UK; Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Hedlund, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2b, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.;Carlsen, H (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Box 242 18, SE-10451 Stockholm, Sweden.",johanna.hedlund@su.se; henrik.carlsen@sei.org,"Muller, Christoph/E-4812-2016; Bodin, Orjan/A-5098-2010","Muller, Christoph/0000-0002-9491-3550; Carlsen, Henrik/0000-0003-1054-6747; Bodin, Orjan/0000-0002-8218-1153; West, Christopher David/0000-0002-5091-6514; Hedlund, Johanna/0000-0002-8137-050X",,,,,34,1,1,9,9,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Mixed farming systems are typical agricultural enterprises in the Western Australian wheatbelt where climate drives the productivity and profitability of these farms and therefore the effects of likely climate change on their performance need to be understood. Here the effects of climate change projected at 2030 were evaluated compared to a baseline period (1980-1999) on mixed farming systems at paddock, enterprise and whole farm scales using the coupled APSIM and GRAZPLAN biophysical simulation models. The yield of different crops, livestock production and gross margins were assessed under current and projected climates using current farming technology and management practices. Representative mixed-farm systems were selected along a climate transect. Modelling analysis suggests that current production levels and gross margins of mixed farm systems in Western Australia will not be sustained in 2030 climate conditions except in areas of moderately high-rainfall. Whole farm gross margin declined at all site x potential climate scenarios between 1% and 22% except in moderately high rainfall where gross margin increased by up to 4% under a 'hot and moderate change in rainfall' climate. Projected crop yields declined for most of the crop x site x potential climate combinations, with greatest declines under a hot and dry climate (at driest margin of transect) in which wheat, barley, canola, and lupin yield declined up to 16%, 15%, 21%, and 27%, respectively. Increase in yield was predicted for wheat and barley at some of the site x potential climate s. Wheat yield increased only under moderately high rainfall region by 6% while barley increased by 1%. Simulated cropping gross margin was also shown to decline by between >1% and 23%, except for the moderately high rainfall site where cropping gross margins were projected to increase by up to 3%. Changes in simulated livestock production were smaller and less variable than for crop production. The change in weight of livestock sold across sites x potential climate combinations ranged between -3% and +3%. Livestock gross margin varied between -11% and +6%. Modelling results indicated a greater fertilisation effect of the elevated CO2 on pasture production than on crop yield and biomass particularly in drier sites. But however, this could not offset negative impact of climate change under hot potential climates. The main negative environmental impacts from the projected climate change were declines in annual net primary production (ANPP), ground cover and water use efficiency mostly at drier sites. Whole farm N2O emission declined significantly for the majority of site x potential climate combinations, while smaller decreases in ruminant CH4 emission were predicted. In 2030, returns from livestock enterprises are predicted to be smaller, but less variable than from cropping and with increasing probability of success in drier regions. Reduced variability in financial return is important from the perspective of whole farm risk management. Shifts in enterprise mix in dryland mixed-farming systems towards increased livestock may be a helpful strategy in adapting to climate change and managing the associated financial risks.

Given this fragility and the large numbers of urban inhabitants, it is important for researchers and government regulators to assess the adaptation capacity of urban areas with respect to climate change. Currently, there are few studies that have evaluated such adaptation capacity across different regions and periods. In this study, a framework and method are established to assess the adaptation capacity of Chinese cities and urban agglomerations (UAs) with respect to climate change by integrating an SPRR (Source, Pathway, Receptor, Response) model with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment framework. We develop an indicator system for exposure, sensitivity, and resilience and use the set pair analysis (SPA) method to evaluate the adaptation capacity of 12 typical UAs in China. Results show that (1) adaptation capacity levels show wide variation across China, with the majority of cities and UAs having either high or low levels of capacity and a minority having a moderate level of capacity; (2) inland UAs have low adaptation capacity because of low resilience and sensitivity, whereas eastern coastal UAs have high adaptation capacity, for their high resilience and sensitivity; and (3) higher climate change exposures are distributed predominantly in central China. A pronounced economic disparity exists between western inland regions and eastern regions, with the latter having higher levels of economic development and superior infrastructure. The regional economic inequalities and spatial variation in climate variability observed in China are also characteristics shared by many other countries and regions, suggesting that our results may be generalised to other countries and regions. We propose that underdeveloped regions should seek to improve infrastructure and funding directed towards improving adaptation capacity, whereas developed regions should improve their ability to monitor climate change and its impacts.","[Zhao, Chunli; Chen, Jianguo; Su, Guofeng; Yuan, Hongyong] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Engn Phys, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chunli; Chen, Jianguo; Su, Guofeng; Yuan, Hongyong] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Publ Safety Res, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chunli; Chen, Jianguo] Beijing Key Lab City Integrated Emergency Respons, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Chen, JG (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Engn Phys, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Chen, JG (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Inst Publ Safety Res, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Chen, JG (corresponding author), Beijing Key Lab City Integrated Emergency Respons, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",zhaochunli@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn; chenjianguo@tsinghua.edu.cn; sugf@tsinghua.edu.cn; hy-yuan@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC0806900]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71790613]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M650631],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFC0806900), the Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.71790613), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2019M650631).",,53,3,4,5,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Therefore, climate adaptation is a regional priority. At least 6% of SA population live at low-elevation coastal zones (LECZ) exposed to sea-level rise, ENSO variability and storminess. This paper reviews some recent and current adaptation experiences in SA coasts focusing on (i) socioeconomic and vulnerability status, (ii) links between adaptation and sustainable development, and (iii) constraints to adaptation. Despite the regional economic growth and poverty reduction over the last decade, an adaptation deficit to current climate variability persists. Overall, SA countries show a poor link between public policies, adaptation, and theoretical-academic scope. Public adaptation efforts in coastal areas are mostly oriented towards risk assessment, vulnerability and reduction of impacts at urban and touristic settlements. Many experiences developed from the academy follow the community-based adaptation (CBA) approach mainstreamed into local plans. Adaptation constraints are linked with poverty, social priorities, allocation of resources and the multifaceted impacts of climate change. Two coastal CBA case studies in Venezuela and Uruguay based on scientific and local knowledge show that non-structural adaptation measures can improve the populations' perception of risks, provided that stakeholders, mainly the community, are informed and integrated to define adaptation actions. There are lots of plans and less specific actions. We propose that the assessment of adaptation success has to rely on implementation and effectiveness criteria rather than solely on plans.","[Villamizar, Alicia] Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Estudios Ambientales, Caracas, Venezuela; [Gutierrez, Maria E.] Univ Simon Bolivar, Direcc Relac Interinst, Caracas, Venezuela; [Nagy, Gustavo J.; Caffera, Ruben M.] UdelaR, Grp Cambio Global Costero, IECA, Fac Ciencias, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Caffera, Ruben M.] UdelaR, Fac Agron, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Caffera, Ruben M.] Soc Amigos Viento SAV NGO, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England","Simon Bolivar University; Simon Bolivar University; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Manchester Metropolitan University","Leal, W (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England.",w.leal@mmu.ac.uk,"Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022; nagy, gustavo/G-8097-2017","Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Villanueva Cuevas, Antonio/0000-0003-4923-3705; nagy, gustavo/0000-0002-8296-4465",,,,,118,22,22,4,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Through this discussion, it specifically considers the implications of the regional governance of South Tyrol and Lombardy as case studies. Despite rising concern at the European level, there are still no specific guidelines in place for climate change governance at the macro-regional level. Macro-regions encompass multiple regions that have certain shared morphological characteristics. To address climate changes that occur here, they adopt optional larger-scale strategies without adequately considering territorial and governmental specificities at the regional level. Each individual region adopts specific climate adaptation strategies to deal with the challenges of the territories they govern, without considering the effects on their neighbours, decentralises climate policies to the lowest tiers of government, and encourages participation from individuals and non-governmental organisations. The Alpine macro-region is governed by three separate international/transnational institutions at the macro-regional level and is subject to different regulations from each of the 48 regions/autonomous provinces. One of these regions is Lombardy, which is particularly exposed to the effects of climate change due to having the highest values for land consumption and pollution in Italy. From the administrative point of view, it is an ordinary region, which means that it has the same legislative competences of the other Italian regions. South Tyrol is entirely mountainous. Being an autonomous province, it benefits from greater legislative autonomy than ordinary regions. Based on documental analysis of climate adaptation strategies, findings demonstrate that the preferred governance structure involves the presence of a coordinating institution (such as the province in South Tyrol or the region in Lombardy) that decides climate action, along with several other local institutions and stakeholders that have less decision-making power. Its preferred mechanism for addressing specific climate challenges is the definition of specific regulations and the draft of regional and mono-sectoral plans. These regulations do not relate strongly to wider-scale strategies at the macro-regional level, but are inspired by their principles and priorities.

Adaptation is a dynamic social process: the ability of societies to adapt is determined, in part, by the ability to act collectively. This article reviews emerging perspectives on collective action and social capital and argues that insights from these areas inform the nature of adaptive capacity and normative prescriptions of policies of adaptation. Specifically, social capital is increasingly understood within economics to have public and private elements, both of which are based on trust, reputation, and reciprocal action. The public-good aspects of particular forms of social capital are pertinent elements of adaptive capacity in interacting with natural capital and in relation to the performance of institutions that cope with the risks of changes in climate. Case studies are presented of present-day collective action for coping with extremes in weather in coastal areas in Southeast Asia and of community-based coastal management in the Caribbean. These cases demonstrate the importance of social capital framing both the public and private institutions of resource management that build resilience in the face of the risks of changes in climate. These cases illustrate, by analogy, the nature of adaptation processes and collective action in adapting to future changes in climate.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, CSERGE, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Adger, WN (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",n.adger@uea.ac.uk,"Adger, Neil/F-7676-2010","Adger, Neil/0000-0003-4244-2854",,,,,80,1357,1392,25,643,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

We aimed to review available information on the projection of dengue in the future under climate change scenarios. Methods Using five databases (PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Web of Science), a systematic review was conducted to retrieve all articles from database inception to 30(th) June 2019 which projected the future of dengue under climate change scenarios. In this review, the future of dengue refers to disease burden of dengue, epidemic potential of dengue cases, geographical distribution of dengue cases, and population exposed to climatically suitable areas of dengue. Results Sixteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and five of them projected a global dengue future. Most studies reported an increase in disease burden, a wider spatial distribution of dengue cases or more people exposed to climatically suitable areas of dengue as climate change proceeds. The years 1961-1990 and 2050 were the most commonly used baseline and projection periods, respectively. Multiple climate change scenarios introduced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including B1, A1B, and A2, as well as Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6), RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, were most widely employed. Instead of projecting the future number of dengue cases, there is a growing consensus on using population exposed to climatically suitable areas for dengue or epidemic potential of dengue cases as the outcome variable. Future studies exploring non-climatic drivers which determine the presence/absence of dengue vectors, and identifying the pivotal factors triggering the transmission of dengue in those climatically suitable areas would help yield a more accurate projection for dengue in the future. Conclusions Projecting the future of dengue requires a systematic consideration of assumptions and uncertainties, which will facilitate the development of tailored climate change adaptation strategies to manage dengue. Author summary Dengue is the most important arboviral disease globally, and the transmission of dengue is closely linked to climate. This review assembled all existing studies which have quantified the impact of climate change on dengue under climate change scenarios.

Within this discussion, grasslands have surfaced as being particularly important, due to their geographic range, their capacity to store substantial quantities of carbon relative to cultivated croplands and their potential role in mitigating droughts and floods. However, leveraging grasslands for climate change mitigation and adaptation will require a better understanding of how farmers and ranchers who rely on them for their livelihoods can improve management and related outcomes. To investigate opportunities for such improvements, we conducted a meta-analysis of field experiments that investigated how soil water infiltration rates are affected by a range of management options: adding complexity to grazing patterns, reducing stocking rates or extended rest from grazing. Further, to explore the relationships between observed changes in soil water infiltration and soil carbon, we identified papers that reported data on both metrics. We found that in 81.9% of all cases, responses of infiltration rates to identified management treatments (response ratios) were above zero, with infiltration rates increasing by 59.3 +/- 7.3%. Mean response ratios from unique management categories were not significantly different, although the effect of extended rest (67.9 +/- 8.5%, n = 140 from 31 experiments) was slightly higher than from reducing stocking rates (42.0 +/- 10.8%; n = 63 from 17 experiments) or adding complexity (34.0 +/- 14.1%, n = 17 from 11 experiments). We did not find a significant effect of several other variables, including treatment duration, mean annual precipitation or soil texture; however, analysis of aridity indices suggested that grazing management may have a slightly larger effect in more humid environments. Within our database, we found that 42% of complexity studies, 41% of stocking rate studies and 29% of extended rest studies also reported at least some measure of soil carbon. Within the subset of cases where both infiltration rates and carbon were reported, response ratios were largely positive for both variables (at least 64% of cases had positive mean response ratios in all management categories). Overall, our findings reveal that a variety of management strategies have the potential to improve soil water infiltration rates, with possible benefits for soil carbon as well. However, we identified a shortage of well-replicated and detailed experiments in all grazing management categories, and call for additional research of both soil water and soil carbon properties for these critical agroecosystems.","[DeLonge, Marcia; Basche, Andrea] Union Concerned Scientists, Food & Environm Program, 1825K,St NW Suite 800, Washington, DC 20006 USA",,"DeLonge, M (corresponding author), Union Concerned Scientists, Food & Environm Program, 1825K,St NW Suite 800, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",MDelonge@ucsusa.org,,"Basche, Andrea/0000-0001-6805-8522",Union of Concerned Scientists Kendall Fellowship Program; TomKat Foundation; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; Duke University Stanback Internship Program; Dartmouth College's Porter Family Fund for Sustainability in the Curriculum; Richard and Jane Pearl Family Fund for Environmental Studies,Union of Concerned Scientists Kendall Fellowship Program; TomKat Foundation; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; Duke University Stanback Internship Program; Dartmouth College's Porter Family Fund for Sustainability in the Curriculum; Richard and Jane Pearl Family Fund for Environmental Studies,"The authors would like to thank the Union of Concerned Scientists Kendall Fellowship Program, as well as TomKat Foundation and The Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, for funding that supported the authors while writing this article.

We present a methodology for more efficiently sampling extremes in future climate projections. As a proof-of-concept, we examine the UK's most recent set of national Climate Projections (UKCP18). UKCP18 includes a 15-member perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of coupled global simulations, providing a range of climate projections incorporating uncertainty in both internal variability and forced response. However, this ensemble is too small to adequately sample extremes with very high return periods, which are of interest to policy-makers and adaptation planners. To better understand the statistics of these events, we use distributed computing to run three 1000-member initial-condition ensembles with the atmosphere-only HadAM4 model at 60km resolution on volunteers' computers, taking boundary conditions from three distinct future extreme winters within the UKCP18 ensemble. We find that the magnitude of each winter extreme is captured within our ensembles, and that two of the three ensembles are conditioned towards producing extremes by the boundary conditions. Our ensembles contain several extremes that would only be expected to be sampled by a UKCP18 PPE of over 500 members, which would be prohibitively expensive with current supercomputing resource. The most extreme winters we simulate exceed those within UKCP18 by 0.85 K and 37% of the present-day average for UK winter means of daily maximum temperature and precipitation respectively. As such, our ensembles contain a rich set of multivariate, spatio-temporally and physically coherent samples of extreme winters with wide-ranging potential applications.","[Leach, Nicholas J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England; [Watson, Peter A.

The approaches used are mostly originated from western concepts, developed in totally different socio-economic, cultural and political environments without recognizing local resources, individual opinions and knowledge. The present study tries to fill this gap and emphasizes the realization of the importance of need and transmission of modern scientific knowledge to local communities. So, the broader objective was to examine farmers' perceptions about climate change and other environmental issues through their indigenous knowledge. For this purpose, data was collected by interviewing 386 farmers from three different agro-ecological zones of Punjab Province, Pakistan. The methods used were problem cataloging index, weighted averages index and constraint index. Results indicated climate change as the biggest environmental problem, whereas scientists and the media were credited as the two most effective and reliable sources for climate information dissemination. In order to handle the issue of climate change, government, local councils and business and industry were assumed to be highly responsible, but farmers did not trust them. Although farmers' perceive climate change, due to many constraints very few of them were adapting accordingly. The major constraints were lack of money, high cost of farm inputs and lack of knowledge about appropriate adaptations. Findings suggest that inclusion of indigenous people in the decision-making process about local and national adaptation initiatives will help policy makers collaborate with local residents more effectively in order to better deal with the crisis of climate change.","[Ali, Muhammad Faisal; Ashfaq, Muhammad; Hassan, Sarfraz; Ullah, Raza] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan",University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Ali, MF (corresponding author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",faisalaliuaf@gmail.com,"Ullah, Raza/AAF-1319-2020","Ullah, Raza/0000-0003-3036-1926",,,,,32,7,7,2,16,HARD,OLSZTYN 5,"POST-OFFICE BOX, 10-718 OLSZTYN 5, POLAND",1230-1485,2083-5906,,POL J ENVIRON STUD,Pol.

A Southern European case study assesses farmers' long and short-run adaptation responses under climate change and policy interventions with a discrete stochastic programming model. Results indicate that climate change will likely have negative impacts on irrigation activities and water-dependent ecosystems in Southern Europe. However, the severity of impacts depends on government policy settings and farmers' adaptation responses. The comparison between water market and irrigation subsidy policies shows the advantages of water markets over irrigation subsidies in terms of both private and social benefits.

This is shown by increased temperatures, loss of summer sea ice, earlier snow melt, impacts on ecosystems, and increased economic access. Arctic sea ice volume has decreased by 75% since the 1980s. Long-lasting global anthropogenic forcing from carbon dioxide has increased over the previous decades and is anticipated to increase over the next decades. Temperature increases in response to greenhouse gases are amplified in the Arctic through feedback processes associated with shifts in albedo, ocean and land heat storage, and near-surface longwave radiation fluxes. Thus, for the next few decades out to 2040, continuing environmental changes in the Arctic are very likely, and the appropriate response is to plan for adaptation to these changes. For example, it is very likely that the Arctic Ocean will become seasonally nearly sea ice free before 2050 and possibly within a decade or two, which in turn will further increase Arctic temperatures, economic access, and ecological shifts. Mitigation becomes an important option to reduce potential Arctic impacts in the second half of the 21st century. Using the most recent set of climate model projections (CMIP5), multimodel mean temperature projections show an Arctic-wide end of century increase of +13 degrees C in late fall and +5 degrees C in late spring for a business-as-usual emission scenario (RCP8.5) in contrast to +7 degrees C in late fall and +3 degrees C in late spring if civilization follows a mitigation scenario (RCP4.5). Such temperature increases demonstrate the heightened sensitivity of the Arctic to greenhouse gas forcing.","[Overland, James E.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Wang, Muyin] Univ Washington, JISAO, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Walsh, John E.] Univ Alaska, Int Arct Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA; [Stroeve, Julienne C.] Univ Colorado, Natl Snow & Ice Data Ctr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Overland, JE (corresponding author), NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",james.e.overland@noaa.gov,"Stroeve, Julienne/ABE-7227-2020; Walsh, John/GQI-2785-2022; Wang, Muyin/K-4006-2014","Wang, Muyin/0000-0001-5233-4588; Walsh, John/0000-0001-9541-5927","NOAA Arctic Research Project of the Climate Program Office; Office of Naval Research [322]; Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under NOAA Cooperative Agreement [NA10OAR4320148, 2156, 4052]; NSF [ARC-1023131]; Office of Polar Programs (OPP); Directorate For Geosciences [1023131] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NOAA Arctic Research Project of the Climate Program Office; Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under NOAA Cooperative Agreement; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Polar Programs (OPP); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"The work is supported by NOAA Arctic Research Project of the Climate Program Office and by the Office of Naval Research, Code 322.

Prices remain high and volatile. In this paper we take a closer look at rice, a crop that feeds billions of people in the world, and focus in particular on Asia and Africa. On both continents, rice is grown in a wide range of climatic conditions, from river deltas to mountainous regions. Irrigated systems dominate in Asia and rainfed systems in Africa. Predicted demands for rice remain strong. An additional 116 million tons of rice will be needed by 2035 to feed growing populations. In Africa, where rice is the most rapidly growing food source, about 30 million tons more rice will be needed by 2035, representing an increase of 130% in rice consumption from 2010. About one-third of this extra rice will be needed in Nigeria alone. In Asia, per capita consumption of rice may go down in some mid-and high-income countries. Rice farming will need to produce about 8-10 million tons more paddy per year over the next decade. Without area expansion this will require an annual yield increase of about 1.2-1.5%, equivalent to an average yield increase of 0.6 tha(-1) world-wide. Improving global food security will, therefore, necessitate concerted efforts to increase the productivity of rice per unit of land, water and/or labor in Asia and Africa, and the development of new land and water resources in a responsible and equitable manner to counteract losses due to urbanization and industrialization. During 2007-2011, productivity increases in Africa have been leading the way, with paddy rice production levels increasing by 9.5% per year, compared to 1.6% in Asia. Priorities for rice sector development include (i) continued and increased research efforts to close yield gaps and raise yield ceilings across rice growing environments through varietal development and improved rice production methods, and coping with climate change in both continents and (ii) strengthened and equitable public-private sector partnerships and conducive policy environments in Africa, with special emphasis on mechanization of rice farming from land preparation to harvest and rice processing practices.","[Seck, Papa Abdoulaye; Diagne, Aliou; Wopereis, Marco C.

This study utilises a mixed model ordinal logistic regression on farm household data collected in the Mekong and Red River deltas with the goal of quantifying their impacts on 'planned', in anticipation of gradual climate change, and 'response', to deal with the impacts of sudden onset change, adaptations. The study highlights increased planned adaptation in response to both direct and indirect climate stress. Farm households with higher proportions of income from agricultural sources were more likely to implement planned adaptation measures, but also response level adaptation due to the vulnerability of income sources to sudden onset shock. Planned adaptation is positively influenced by access to training and on farm support, while both planned, and response adaptation were more likely when households had access to financial assistance. Diversity, in terms of revenue sources, increased planned adaptation implementation, but lowered the likelihood of farm households implementing response level adaptation. Institutional support plays a key role in both planned and response adaptation. To increase resilience, it is essential that this support be responsive to localised contextual challenges.","[Duffy, Colm; Kilcline, Kevin; O'Donoghue, Cathal; Spillane, Charles] Natl Univ Ireland, Plant & AgriBiosci Res Ctr PABC, Ryan Inst, Galway, Ireland; [Pede, Valerien] Int Rice Res Inst, Agrifood Policy Platform, DAPO Box 7777, Manila, Philippines; [Toth, Gregory] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Kilcline, Kevin; Ryan, Mary] TEAGASC, Rural Econ & Dev Programme, Galway, Ireland; [O'Donoghue, Cathal] NUI, Coll Arts Social Sci & Celt Studies, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Teagasc; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Pede, V (corresponding author), Int Rice Res Inst, Agrifood Policy Platform, DAPO Box 7777, Manila, Philippines.;Duffy, C; Spillane, C (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Ryan Inst, Plant & AgriBiosci Res Ctr PABC, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland.",colm.duffy@nuigalway.ie; charles.spillane@nuigalway.ie,"ODonoghue, Cathal/AAW-4109-2021; Spillane, Charles/H-3786-2013","ODonoghue, Cathal/0000-0003-3713-5366; Toth, Gregory/0000-0002-2649-8324; Duffy, Colm/0000-0002-0076-6749; Spillane, Charles/0000-0003-3318-323X",Irish Research Council [GOIPG/2015/3416],"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)",This work was supported by Irish Research Council [grant number GOIPG/2015/3416].,,71,11,11,2,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Heat waves are particularly devastating in cities, where air pollution is high and air temperatures are already inflated by the heat island effect. Determining how cities can ameliorate extreme summer temperature is thus critical to climate adaptation. Tree planting has been proposed to ameliorate urban temperatures, but its effectiveness, particularly of coniferous trees in temperate climates, has not been established. Here, we use remote sensing data (Landsat 8), high-resolution land cover data, and Bayesian models to understand how different tree and land cover classes affect summer surface temperature in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Although areas dominated by coniferous trees exhibited the lowest albedo (95% CrI 0.08-0.08), they were significantly (12.2 degrees C) cooler than areas dominated by buildings. Indeed, we found that for conifers, lower albedo was associated with lower surface temperatures. Planting and maintaining coniferous trees in cities may not only sequester CO2 to mitigate global climate change, but may also ameliorate higher temperatures and deadly heat waves locally.","[Eyster, Harold N.] Univ Vermont, Dept Plant Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Eyster, HN (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Plant Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",haroldeyster@gmail.com; brian.beckage@uvm.edu,,"Eyster, Harold N/0000-0002-5571-3126; Beckage, Brian/0000-0002-5908-6924",Gund Postdoctoral Fellowship; Environment and Climate Change Canada [GCXE22S079],Gund Postdoctoral Fellowship; Environment and Climate Change Canada,This research was funded by a Gund Postdoctoral Fellowship to HNE and by Environment and Climate Change Canada (GCXE22S079).,,54,3,3,10,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,MAY,2022,13,5,,,,,,,830,10.3390/atmos13050830,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13050830,,,13,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,1O7CG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000801484800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of the interventions in natural or semi-natural ecosystems were reported to have ameliorated adverse climate impacts. Conversely, interventions involving created ecosystems (e.g., afforestation) were associated with trade-offs; such studies primarily reported reduced soil erosion or increased vegetation cover but lower water availability, although this evidence was geographically restricted. Overall, studies reported more synergies than trade-offs between reduced climate impacts and broader ecological, social, and climate change mitigation outcomes. In addition, nature-based interventions were most often shown to be as effective or more so than alternative interventions for addressing climate impacts. However, there were substantial gaps in the evidence base. Notably, there were few studies of the cost-effectiveness of interventions compared to alternatives and few integrated assessments considering broader social and ecological outcomes. There was also a bias in evidence toward the Global North, despite communities in the Global South being generally more vulnerable to climate impacts. To build resilience to climate change worldwide, it is imperative that we protect and harness the benefits that nature can provide, which can only be done effectively if informed by a strengthened evidence base.","[Chausson, Alexandre; Turner, Beth; Seddon, Dan; Chabaneix, Nicole; Key, Isabel; Woroniecki, Stephen; Seddon, Nathalie] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Nat Based Solut Initiat, Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Girardin, Cecile A.

Estimates for a global fund,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Disaster risk; Public finance; Fiscal vulnerability; Global climate fund,,"Managing disaster risk is increasingly being considered a key line of response in climate adaptation. While funding support for adaptation has been pledged, rationales for support and cost implications are essentially unclear, which may explain why financing is currently only forthcoming at low levels. Various estimates for the costs of adaptation have been suggested, yet the rationale and robustness of the estimates have been difficult to verify. Focusing on weather-related extreme events, we conduct a global assessment of the public finance costs for financially managing extreme event risks. In doing so, we assess countries' fiscal disaster vulnerability, which we operationalize as the public sector's ability to pay for relief to the affected population and support the reconstruction of lost assets and infrastructure. Methods employed include minimum-distance techniques to estimate the tail behaviour of country disaster risks as well as the inclusion of non-linear loss and financing resources relationships. We find that many countries appear fiscal vulnerable and would require assistance from the donor community in order to bolster their fiscal resilience. Our estimates may inform decisions pertaining to a global fund for absorbing different levels of country risks. We find the costs of funds covering different risk layers to be in the lower billions of dollars annually, compared to estimates of global climate adaptation which reach to more than USD 100 billion annually. Our estimates relate to today's climate, and while disaster losses have currently not been robustly linked to climate change, physical science has made a strong case in attributing changes in climate extremes to anthropogenic Climate Change. We suggest that estimates of current weather variability and related risks, although also associated with substantial uncertainty, can be interpreted as a baseline for discussion and any future projections of risks.

We present a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based hydrodynamic model coupled to a hydraulic network that integrates adaptation analysis in the context of current and future flooding. The hydrodynamic model is based on a finite volume implementation of the shallow water equations formulated for overland flow. The hydraulic network is based on a pressure relaxation method, and uses a GPU-based sparse matrix solver for computational speed. The integrated model is used for modelling potential combined coastal and catchment inundation and climate adaptation analysis for the City of Port Phillip, Victoria, Australia. The key outcome from the adaptation study was that resources spent towards adaptation infrastructure should be investigated in the context of sea level rise (SLR) at least for the next 50 years. The adaptation analysis identified a tipping point beyond a SLR of around 0.4 m (expected in the next 30 years) where conventional adaptation approaches will fail. This outcome has resulted in the City realising that significant changes in infrastructure for the region will be necessary rather than just incremental adaptation approaches to deal with future flooding.","[Prakash, Mahesh; Cohen, Raymond] CSIRO, Data 61, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hilton, James] CSIRO, CMIS, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Khan, Shariar H.] Monash Univ, Comp Sci, Sci Blvd, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Monash University,"Prakash, M (corresponding author), CSIRO, Data 61, 34 Village St, Docklands, Vic 3008, Australia.",mahesh.prakash@data61.csiro.au,"Prakash, Mahesh/A-5506-2009; Hilton, James E/D-1047-2009","Prakash, Mahesh/0000-0001-7344-7944; Hilton, James E/0000-0003-3676-0880",City of Port Phillip Victoria,City of Port Phillip Victoria,City of Port Phillip Victoria,,20,3,3,3,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1753-318X,,,J FLOOD RISK MANAG,J.

A transdisciplinary perspective is therefore required to identify and implement effective solutions. To address this, the International Conference on Managing Protected Areas under Climate Change brought together international scientists, conservation managers, and decision-makers to discuss current experiences with local adaptation of conservation management. This paper summarizes the main issues for implementing adaptation that emerged from the conference. These include a series of conclusions and recommendations on monitoring, sensitivity assessment, current and future management practices, and legal and policy aspects. A range of spatial and temporal scales must be considered in the implementation of climate-adapted management. The adaptation process must be area-specific and consider the ecosystem and the social and economic conditions within and beyond protected area boundaries. However, a strategic overview is also needed: management at each site should be informed by conservation priorities and likely impacts of climate change at regional or even wider scales. Acting across these levels will be a long and continuous process, requiring coordination with actors outside the traditional conservation sector. To achieve this, a range of research, communication, and policy/legal actions is required. We identify a series of important actions that need to be taken at different scales to enable managers of protected sites to adapt successfully to a changing climate.","[Rannow, Sven] Biosphere Reserve River Landscape Elbe Brandenbur, D-19322 Ruhstadt, Germany; [Macgregor, Nicholas A.] Nat England, London SW1P 3JR, England; [Albrecht, Juliane; Neubert, Marco] Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, D-01217 Dresden, Germany; [Crick, Humphrey Q.

The model is developed using WEAP software and was calibrated and validated by historical matching utilizing data for the period 2000-2012. The model is used in the evaluation of the municipal water sector performance in terms of municipal water demands and their associated cost without and with climate change impacts scenarios for the period 2012-2030. The impact of climate change on the municipal water system is quantified as the difference between the two scenarios in three selected cost indicators: financial (production, conveyance and distribution costs), economic (natural gas asset consumption by desalination plants), and environmental (CO2 emissions by desalination plants). The vulnerability assessment indicated that the current municipal water management system in Bahrain is generally inefficient and associated with relatively high costs, which are expected to increase with time under the current policies and management approach focusing on supply-side management. The increase in temperature will increase these already high costs, and would exacerbate the water management challenges in Bahrain. However, these mounting challenges also present an opportune moment for Bahrain to review its current water resources management approaches and practices and to integrate climate change adaptation measures into its water planning and policies. In order to build an adaptive management capacity of the municipal water management system in Bahrain, a number of management interventions are proposed and evaluated, individually and combined, for their effectiveness in enhancing the efficiency of the management system using the developed dynamic model. These are: reduction of the leakage percentage in the municipal water distributions network and reducing per capita water consumption by raising water awareness among consumers and installing water saving devices in residential units. The evaluation results indicate that there is a large potential for reducing the municipal water demand and its associated cost, especially when all the three are combined; by the year 2030 it is estimated that the cumulative financial saving would be about US$ 2.9 Billion, the cumulative reduction in CO2 emission would be about 19.7 Million tons, and the preservation of the kingdom's limited natural gas reserves would be about 4 Billion m(3). In addition, a major reduction in desalination brine discharge to the marine environment and reduction of generated wastewater and their associated collection and treatment cost could be achieved from the implementation of these interventions. Adopting such management interventions will not only enhance the efficiency of the municipal water management system, but it will also help the Kingdom in its efforts in reducing its greenhouse gasses emissions. It is recommended that similar climate change vulnerability and adaptation analysis is extended to the whole water sector in Bahrain to include other major water consuming sectors (i.e., agricultural, industrial, and tourism sectors) and their sources of water (i.e., groundwater and wastewater) in Bahrain.","[Al-Zubari, Waleed K.; El-Sadek, Alaa A.; Al-Aradi, Mohamed J.; Al-Mahal, Hameed A.] Arabian Gulf Univ, Coll Grad Studies, Water Resources Management Program, Manama, Bahrain",Arabian Gulf University,"Al-Zubari, WK (corresponding author), Arabian Gulf Univ, Coll Grad Studies, Water Resources Management Program, Manama, Bahrain.",waleed@agu.edu.bh,"Zubari, Waleed/AFR-6026-2022",,United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); Every Drop Matters Program - Coca Cola Company,United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); Every Drop Matters Program - Coca Cola Company,The authors would like to express their thanks to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Every Drop Matters Program financed by Coca Cola Company for supporting this study.

For mitigation, we analyze whether public participation in local climate plans is significantly related to local greenhouse gas reduction targets. We find that public participation has a positive impact on both, the transformative potential of adaptation and the ambition for mitigation. The influence of participation on adaptation is stronger than the influence on mitigation.

The article analyzes how adaptation mainstreaming was approached during the development of the Swiss National Adaptation Strategy and to what extent adaptation objectives were mainstreamed into sectoral policies. The analysis reveals that in Switzerland, adaptation objectives are integrated more substantially into sectoral policies when they overlap with primary sectoral objectives but generally backing by organizational and procedural measures is lacking. The results suggest a similar pattern for adaptation mainstreaming as for EPI: While policy frameworks such as strategies are adopted rather easily, a move towards more binding measures that interfere with sectoral policy-making and the existing institutional structure is much more challenging. In contrast to environmental concerns, climate change impacts are expected to be considered more substantially resulting in a more substantive mainstreaming of adaptation objectives and measures on a sectoral level. As these measures might negatively affect other sectors, the main challenge of adaptation mainstreaming is to consistently address the cross-cutting nature of adaption and to establish procedures to coordinate sectoral measures in order to avoid such negative externalities.","[Widmer, Alexander] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Social Sci Policy Anal & Environm G, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG),"Widmer, A (corresponding author), Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Social Sci Policy Anal & Environm G, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",alexander.widmer@eawag.ch,,,"Competence Center Environment and Sustainability (CCES) of the ETH Domain, Switzerland, research project MOUNTLAND","Competence Center Environment and Sustainability (CCES) of the ETH Domain, Switzerland, research project MOUNTLAND","The study was supported by the Competence Center Environment and Sustainability (CCES) of the ETH Domain, Switzerland, as part of the research project MOUNTLAND.

This paper presents a literature review on multi-skin adaptive ventilated facades. Additionally, this article presents a literature review on building envelopes that contain inner-air layers. The operation modes of the air layer used in building enclosure structures are classified and summarized and the thermal performance and benefits of climate-adaptive facades are discussed and reviewed. The existing operation modes of the air layer used in building envelopes are summarized, outlined and roughly classified into the following types: the enclosed type, the naturally ventilated type and the mechanically ventilated type. One of the sustainable development trends is the investigation and application of energy-efficient climate-adaptive facades. In this study, the energy modeling of a high-rise office building was calculated using the Green Building Studio. The annual energy, the annual CO2 emissions, and life cycle energy for the following three types of facade were estimated: a single-layer facade made of three-layer glass with argon, a double ventilated facade, and a triple ventilated facade with a double chamber. The calculation results show that the annual energy of the building with an adaptive triple-skin facade could be reduced by 15% compared with buildings with a single skin facade.","[Andreeva, Darya; Nemova, Darya; Kotov, Evgeny] Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Inst Civil Engn, St Petersburg 195251, Russia",Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University,"Nemova, D (corresponding author), Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Inst Civil Engn, St Petersburg 195251, Russia.",andreeva_ds@spbstu.ru; nemova_dv@spbstu.ru; ekotov.cfd@gmail.com,"Kotov, Evgeny/Q-1989-2017",,Russian Science Foundation [21-79-10283]; Russian Science Foundation [21-79-10283] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"This research was funded by the Russian Science Foundation under grant 21-79-10283, date 29 July 2021. https://rscf.ru/project/21-79-10283/(accessed on 12 April 2022).",,78,1,1,18,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAY,2022,15,9,,,,,,,3447,10.3390/en15093447,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15093447,,,26,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,1F6AR,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000795250100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

What are the triggers and barriers, for which sectors and for which risks and how is adaptation funded? This paper examines 147 Local Adaptation Strategies in Europe. Key triggers were incentives via research projects, implementation of EU policies and the increasing frequency of extreme climate events. Insufficient resources, capacity, political commitment and uncertainty were the main barriers. Prioritized sectors reflected the main local vulnerabilities - flood protection and water management, built environment and urban planning. Differing patterns of adaptation planning and adaptive capacity were identified among different regions in Europe. Large municipalities generally fund adaptation locally, whereas international and national funding appears to be more important for adaptation in less urban or densely populated territories. The database of LAS described in the present study can be expanded and used to increase the understanding of and promotion of local adaptation action in Europe and beyond.","[Aguiar, Francisca C.; Bentz, Julia; Silva, Joao M.

Despite the known limitations of the current mapping units (conventional soil map units) used for LSA, alternative methods to objectively delineate mapping units, such as geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) or geomorphons have never been tested for LSA. The objective of this work is to quantitatively assess the effects of different polygon-based mapping units on LSA for agriculture: 1) conventional soil map units; 2) units delineated semi-automatically using GEOBIA; 3) geomorphons. In addition, the three delineation procedures will be compared with the pixel-based LSA conducted as a benchmark. LSA is conducted within the framework of the existing Romanian rating methodology for land suitability, which was developed based on FAO guidelines for land evaluation. We use georeferenced soil profiles with field-measured soil properties and digital terrain models to digitally map 17 eco-pedological indicators (e.g. soil pH, soil texture, soil porosity, gleization, carbonate content, humus content). Based on several lookup tables, these maps are transformed into digital maps with suitability ratings for 14 crops, 7 fruit trees, and 2 land-use types, ranging from 0 (not suitable) to 1 (maximum suitability). The product (multiplication) of the 17 maps with LSA ratings is the final suitability map for each crop and land use. Overall, the best maps were obtained when the LSA was conducted using the GEOBIA units (similar accuracy to the pixel -based approach), whereas geomorphons and conventional soil map units resulted in much poorer maps. GEOBIA is much more suitable for LSA than the conventional soil map units and geomorphons, showing a much higher accuracy and internal homogeneity. Another conclusion is that the LSA based on conventional soil map units recorded the poorest accuracies by far. Our results show that the GEOBIA-based units or pixel-based approach are the right choices when conducting LSA, however, if the map user (eg. farmer, land manager) needs delineated units as semi-permanent and stable regions to manage them as stable spatial entities then GEOBIA technique should be used for LSA.","[Dornik, Andrei; Chetan, Marinela Adriana; Dragut, Lucian] West Univ Timisoara, Bd V Parvan 4, Timisoara 300223, Romania; [Iliuta, Andrei] Pedol & Soil Agrochem Off OSPA, Arad, Romania; [Dicu, Daniel Dorin] Banats Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med King Mihai I Romania, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,"Dornik, A (corresponding author), West Univ Timisoara, Bd V Parvan 4, Timisoara 300223, Romania.",andrei.dornik@e-uvt.ro,"Dornik, Andrei/V-4786-2019; DRAGUT, Lucian/A-4126-2008","Dornik, Andrei/0000-0002-4951-434X; DRAGUT, Lucian/0000-0002-2138-3288","Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CNCS/CCCDI - UEFISCDI [PN-III-P1-1.1-PD-2019-0402]","Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CNCS/CCCDI - UEFISCDI","This work was supported by a grant from the Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CNCS/CCCDI - UEFISCDI, proj- ect number PN-III-P1-1.1-PD-2019-0402, within PNCDI III.

We identify actions that support Indigenous adaptation based on organizational and community perspectives. Our data come from two Indigenous organizations that share cultural heritage stewardship missions-the Sto :lo Research and Resource Management Centre (Sto :lo Nation, British Columbia) and the Fort Apache Heritage Foundation (White Mountain Apache Tribe, Arizona). These organizations collaborated with us in exploring community perceptions of climate effects, investigating community adaptation opportunities and constraints, and identifying actions that support Indigenous adaptation. Research methods included engagement with organizational collaborators and semi-structured interviews with organizational representatives and community members and staff. Results confirm that Sto :lo and Apache territories and communities have experienced climate change impacts, such as changes in temperature, hydrology, and increase in extreme weather events. Climate effects are cumulative to colonial depletion of traditional environments and further reduce access to traditional resources, practices, and food security. Results indicated that certain actions are identified by community members as adaptation enablers across case studies-most prominently, perpetuation of Indigenous culture and knowledge, climate education that is tailored to local contexts, collaborative decision-making among community institutions, and integration of climate adaptation into ongoing organizational programs. We conclude that Indigenous-owned organizations are engaged in the expansion of adaptive capacity and hold potential to further support their communities.","[Gauer, Viviane H.; Schaepe, David M.; Welch, John R.] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Schaepe, David M.] Sto Io Res & Resource Management Ctr, Chilliwack, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Gauer, VH (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",vhippman@sfu.ca,,"Gauer, Viviane/0000-0003-1840-0208; Welch, John R./0000-0001-8820-7150",Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS) Graduate Student Fellowship; Simon Fraser University (SFU) Graduate Fellowship,Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS) Graduate Student Fellowship; Simon Fraser University (SFU) Graduate Fellowship,This work was funded by a Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS) Graduate Student Fellowship and a Simon Fraser University (SFU) Graduate Fellowship to VHG.,,90,0,0,2,9,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",2325-1026,,,ELEMENTA-SCI ANTHROP,Elementa-Sci.

These plans are increasingly subsumed within urban development projects, and embedded in global flows of capital and networks of environmental governance and planning. And yet, scholarship on urban adaptation has tended to approach the city as an analytically bounded territory, neglecting interconnections across space and processes of globalisation, urbanisation, and geopolitics. This paper extends theories of relational geographies to explore the emerging conditions of urban adaptation in the context of climate change and globalised urban development. Focusing on the global links of Dutch water expertise, and tracing relationships within and between Rotterdam, New York, and Jakarta, it illustrates the formation of global-urban networks - the multiscalar, multilevel connections through which capital, knowledge, and influence flow. It probes the ways in which these networks emerge to mobilise ideas and influence across geographical scales and political boundaries, driven and defined by interrelated factors including economic relationships, historically defined situational relationships, and interface conditions including narratives of culture and environmental urgency. The paper introduces the concept of 'network formation' to see and understand such interconnected, relational processes. It explains the spatial and temporal interconnections within and across sites, and the relationships between urban spatial projects and broader political economies and ecologies. The paper asserts the importance of conceptualising the relationships and interfaces of increasingly mobile and interconnected urban environmental futures.","[Goh, Kian] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Goh, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Urban Planning, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, 3250 Publ Affairs Bldg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",kiangoh@ucla.edu,,/0000-0003-1830-2392,,,,,85,33,33,6,107,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,AUG,2020,57,11,,,SI,,2222,2240,,10.1177/0042098018807306,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0042098018807306,,,19,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,MR2RL,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000553437500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

One vulnerable sector to climate change is winter tourism, with some resorts likely to experience a significant reduction in the length of the skiing seasons and snow recreation areas throughout this century. This study assessed the vulnerability of 31 Spanish alpine ski resorts to climate change and evaluated the potential socio-economic and environmental implications of several adaptation measures. Results show that lower-altitude areas such as the Cantabrian Mountains and the Iberian System could be more vulnerable to climate change than higher-altitude areas of the Catalan Pyrenees or the Penibaetic System. Adaptation initiatives may include, inter alia, the production of artificial snow, the protection and conservation of the snow coverage area, and the diversification of recreation activities offered during the whole year. The study concludes that the design and implementation of adaptation strategies have to be adequate to the level of vulnerability associated with each resort as well as minimize their potential socio-economic and environmental costs.","[Campos Rodrigues, Luis; Freire-Gonzalez, Jaume; Gonzalez Puig, Aina; Puig-Ventosa, Ignasi] ENT Environm & Management, St Joan 39,1, Barcelona 08800, Spain; [Campos Rodrigues, Luis; Freire-Gonzalez, Jaume; Gonzalez Puig, Aina; Puig-Ventosa, Ignasi] Fundacio ENT, St Joan 39,1, Barcelona 08800, Spain",,"Campos Rodrigues, L (corresponding author), ENT Environm & Management, St Joan 39,1, Barcelona 08800, Spain.;Campos Rodrigues, L (corresponding author), Fundacio ENT, St Joan 39,1, Barcelona 08800, Spain.",lcampos@ent.cat; jaumefreire@hotmail.com; agonzalez@ent.cat; ipuig@ent.cat,"Freire-González, Jaume/A-8429-2018; Freire-Gonzalez, Jaume/AAA-1923-2019","Freire-González, Jaume/0000-0002-5922-3255; Campos Rodrigues, Luis/0000-0003-1049-4107; Puig-Ventosa, Ignasi/0000-0002-8097-5283","Fundacion Biodiversidad, del Ministerio de Agricultura, Alimentacion y Medio Ambiente","Fundacion Biodiversidad, del Ministerio de Agricultura, Alimentacion y Medio Ambiente","This paper presents the results from the research developed in the project Costes y beneficios de la adaptacion al cambio climatico en el sector del turismo de invierno en Espana (Costs and benefits of adaptation to climate change in the winter tourism sector of Spain), which counted with the support of the Fundacion Biodiversidad, del Ministerio de Agricultura, Alimentacion y Medio Ambiente.

As one of the important indicators of forest quality and carbon potential, vegetation carbon density (VCD) is affected by different factors at different scales, but little is known about the effect of topographic factors on the VCD of subtropical forests in the southeast of China, especially at a large regional scale. Based on the national forest continuous inventory protocols, more than 2000 permanent samples (2061 samples in 2009, 2115 samples in 2014, and 2132 samples in 2016) of major forest types (Bamboo forests (BB), broad-leaved forests (BF), mixed forests (MF), coniferous forests (CF)) were grouped by topographic factors to compare the distribution of VCD in Zhejiang Province of China. The four topographic factors (altitude, slope gradient, aspect, and slope position) explained 16.2%similar to 28.4% of the variance in different forest types in the random forest model and the importance order of the four terrain variables is basically corresponding to the significance in the radar charts. The VCD of each forest type varies significantly at different altitudes (p < .05, except for the BB samples in 2009). In general, VCD tends to be higher at high altitudes. The VCD in BB and BF varies significantly with slope gradient (p < .05, the largest on the steep slope and the smallest on the gentle slope); however, the VCD of CF and MF showed almost no difference in different slope gradients. We found significant differences in VCD between the eight aspects in the mixed forest (p < .05, the largest in the S and SW aspects), but not in the other three forest types. As for different slope positions, the VCD of ridges is relatively large, and the VCD of the upslope is generally larger than that of the downslope (more pronounced in BB and BF, all p < .05). This study made a detailed analysis of the greening distribution in different topographic factors, and the research conclusion could provide a scientific basis for the selection of afforestation location and forest scientific management, and contribute to the improvement of the capability of coping with climate change in subtropical forests.","[Ji, Biyong; Tao, Jixing] Forest Resources Monitoring Ctr Zhejiang Prov, Forest Resources Monitoring Serv, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yin, Jiayang; Shi, Yongjun; Xu, Lin; Zhou, Yufeng] Zhejiang Agr & Forestry Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Silviculture, Linan 311300, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yin, Jiayang; Shi, Yongjun; Xu, Lin; Zhou, Yufeng] Zhejiang Agr & Forestry Univ, Zhejiang Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Bamboo Resou, Linan, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yin, Jiayang; Shi, Yongjun; Xu, Lin; Zhou, Yufeng] Zhejiang Agr & Forestry Univ, Key Lab Carbon Cycling Forest Ecosyst & Carbon Se, Linan, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yin, Jiayang; Shi, Yongjun; Xu, Lin; Zhou, Yufeng] Zhejiang Agr & Forestry Univ, Sch Environm & Resources Sci, Linan, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang A&F University; Zhejiang A&F University; Zhejiang A&F University; Zhejiang A&F University,"Shi, YJ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Agr & Forestry Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Silviculture, Linan 311300, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",syjwwh@163.com,"Zhou, Yu/HHN-3071-2022","Yin, Jiayang/0000-0002-1376-6748",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870618]; Central Fiscal Forestry Science and Technology Extension Demonstration Project [2017TS07]; China Green Carbon Sink Foundation Project [H20170049]; Zhejiang Province Key Science and Technology Projects [2015C03008]; Zhejiang Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center for Bamboo Resources and High-efficiency Utilization Project [2060290005],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Central Fiscal Forestry Science and Technology Extension Demonstration Project; China Green Carbon Sink Foundation Project; Zhejiang Province Key Science and Technology Projects; Zhejiang Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center for Bamboo Resources and High-efficiency Utilization Project,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 31870618), the Central Fiscal Forestry Science and Technology Extension Demonstration Project (grant number: 2017TS07), the China Green Carbon Sink Foundation Project (grant number: H20170049), Zhejiang Province Key Science and Technology Projects (grant number: 2015C03008), and Zhejiang Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center for Bamboo Resources and High-efficiency Utilization Project (grant number: 2060290005).",,79,2,3,5,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1054-9811,1540-756X,,J SUSTAIN FOREST,J.

Herein, we analyse changes in the climatically suitable distribution of summer maize cultivation in China at 1.5 degrees C (GW1.5) and 2.0 degrees C (GW2.0) global warming in the future according to the temperature control targets set by the Paris Agreement. Compared with the reference period (1971-2000), the summer maize cultivation climatically suitable region (CSR) in China mainly shifts eastwards, and its acreage significantly decreases at both GW1.5 and GW2.0. Despite no dramatic changes in the CSR spatial pattern, there are considerable decreases in the acreages of optimum and suitable regions (the core of the main producing region), indicating that half-a-degree more global warming is unfavourable for summer maize production in China's main producing region. When the global warming threshold increases from GW1.5 to GW2.0, the centres-of-gravity of optimum areas shift northeastward under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the centres-of-gravity of both suitable and less suitable areas shift northwestward, though the northward trend is more prominent for the less suitable areas, and the centre-of-gravity of unsuitable areas shifts southeastward. Generally, half-a-degree more global warming drives the cultivable areas of summer maize to shift northward in China, while the west region shows a certain potential for expansion of summer maize cultivation.

An effective response to climate change should include both mitigation and adaptation. Water is essential to human survival and social development. But the shortage of water resources is a worldwide problem, which in China has been exacerbated by climate change. In order to find out how to cope with climate change successfully, this study, on the basis of China statistical data 2007-2009, quantitatively analyzes the role of water saving irrigation (WSI) in addressing climate change. The study shows that water saving irrigation (WSI) can serve as a useful enabler in dealing with climate change. From the perspective of mitigation, the 3-year total CO2 emission reduction stands at 34.67 (21.83 similar to 47.48) Mt, about per year 11.56(7.28 similar to 15.83) Mt. From the perspective of adaptation, the total water saved from 2007 to 2009 stands at 96.85 (61.81 similar to 129.6) Gm(3). If per unit farmland irrigation takes a 3-year average of agricultural water consumption, the water saved in 2009 is enough to irrigate additional 5.70 (3.80 similar to 7.80) Mhm(2), or to increase the grain yield by 22.04 (14.68 similar to 30.15) Gt. In addition, WSI can reduce soil salinization and conserve soil to sustain land productivity and environmental benefits. So WSI can be a positive measure in coping with climate change when it is rightly deployed. However, the costs and local context of such practices call for further studies.","[Zou, Xiaoxia; Li, Yu-e; Gao, Qingzhu; Wan, Yunfan] Minist Agr PRC, Key Lab Agroenvironm & Climate Change, CAAS, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr IEDA, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development in Agriculture, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs","Li, YE (corresponding author), Minist Agr PRC, Key Lab Agroenvironm & Climate Change, CAAS, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr IEDA, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",zouxx@ami.ac.cn; yueli@ami.ac.cn,"Gao, Qingzhu/B-6068-2013",,National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program of China [2008BAD95B13]; National Key Basic Research Program of China [2010CB833504],National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program of China; National Key Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China),"Research for this article was supported by the the National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program of China (2008BAD95B13) and National Key Basic Research Program of China (2010CB833504).

This publication presents a method to display relevant measures of any three adaptation relevant parameters (or optionally their projected future changes) at once on a map by allocating them to multiple transparency levels of the three primary colors of additive color mixing (red, green, and blue). The overlay of information allows the combined assessment of the regional exposures. The method is demonstrated by two examples based on an ensemble of regional climate projections analyzed for 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 3 degrees C global warming periods. The first example shows the increasing number of people at risk for summer climate extremes under 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 3 degrees C global warming by combining projected increases in tropical nights and summer intense precipitation days with today's population density. Under 3 degrees C global warming, many heavily populated areas across Europe are affected by both heat stress and summer precipitation extremes, whereas under 1.5 degrees C global warming, heat stress regions are restricted to southern Europe and the large settlements along the Eastern Mediterranean coast. A second example combines daily mean and minimum and maximum summer temperatures and highlights the regional expansion and the increasing robustness of projected mean summer warming with rising global warming levels, as well as the regional day to night differences of the warming signal.","[Pfeifer, Susanne; Rechid, Diana; Viktor, Elisabeth; Jacob, Daniela] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany; [Reuter, Maximilian] Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, Bremen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; University of Bremen,"Pfeifer, S (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany.",susanne.pfeifer@hzg.de; diana.rechid@hzg.de; mreuter@iup.physik.uni-bremcn.de; elisabeth.viktor@hzg.de; daniela.jacob@hzg.de,"Reuter, Maximilian/AGE-3156-2022","Reuter, Maximilian/0000-0001-9141-3895",,,,,16,7,7,2,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

In particular, it is unclear what the optimal balance is between investments in traditional productive capital (which increases output but is vulnerable to climate change), and investments in adaptive capital (which is unproductive in the absence of climate change but 'climate-proofs' vulnerable capital). We develop a model of investment in adaptive and productive capital stocks, and show that while it is unlikely that the optimal strategy involves no adaptation, the scale and composition of optimal investments depends on empirical context. Application of our model to sub-Saharan Africa suggests, however, that in most contingencies it will be optimal to grow the adaptive sector more rapidly than the vulnerable sector over the coming decades, although it never exceeds 1 per cent of the economy. Our sensitivity analysis goes well beyond the existing literature in evaluating the robustness of this finding.","[Millner, Antony; Dietz, Simon] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Dietz, Simon] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Millner, A (corresponding author), Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.millner@lse.ac.uk; s.dietz@lse.ac.uk,"Dietz, Simon/AAX-9362-2020","Dietz, Simon/0000-0001-5002-018X",Ciriacy-Wantrup Postdoctoral Fellowship at UC Berkeley; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy - UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Munich Re; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Ciriacy-Wantrup Postdoctoral Fellowship at UC Berkeley; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy - UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Munich Re; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors are grateful for helpful discussions with David Anthoff, and comments from Alex Bowen, Sam Fankhauser and seminar participants at Berkeley, EAERE, UNU WIDER, and the LSE/IGC conference on macroeconomics and climate change.

However, the compounding and overlapping vulnerabilities of historically marginalized residents are commonly tackled in a fragmented manner by conventional adaptation approaches, even when justice is presented as an overarching goal of these plans. In response, we propose an intersectional pivot in climate adaptation research and practice to analyze the interconnected forms of social-environmental injustices that drive vulnerabilities in cities, paving the way for more concrete and integrated strategies of just urban adaptation and transformation. This paper brings together narrative and analytical review methodologies to inform a new conceptual framework that highlights the need to (1) tackle underlying reinforcers of racial and gender inequalities; (2) redress drivers of differential vulnerabilities; (3) take politics and ethics of care seriously; (4) adopt place-based and place-making approaches; and (5) promote cross-identity forms of activism and community resilience building. We illustrate the framework with examples of ongoing projects in Barcelona, Spain, which is an early adopter of intersectional thinking and justice-driven principles in climate action. Although many initiatives are in a pilot phase and do not all exclusively focus on climate adaptation, experiences from Barcelona do provide illustrative directionality for innovative and integrated approaches that can address multiple and intersecting social-environmental inequities.","[Amorim-Maia, Ana T.; Anguelovski, Isabelle] Univ Autonoma Barcelona UAB, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Edifici Z ICTA ICP,Carrer Columns S-N,Campus UAB, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Amorim-Maia, Ana T.; Anguelovski, Isabelle; Connolly, James] Barcelona Lab Urban Environm Justice & Sustainabi, Carrer Doctor Aiguader 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Anguelovski, Isabelle] Hosp del Mar Med Res Inst IMIM, Carrer Doctor Aiguader 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Anguelovski, Isabelle] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Passeig Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Chu, Eric] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Human Ecol, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Connolly, James] Univ British Columbia, Sch Community & Reg Planning SCARP, 433-6333 Mem Rd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques (IMIM); Hospital del Mar; ICREA; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of British Columbia,"Amorim-Maia, AT (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona UAB, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Edifici Z ICTA ICP,Carrer Columns S-N,Campus UAB, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain.",anaterra.maia@uab.cat; isabelle.anguelovski@uab.cat; ekch@ucdavis.edu; jconnoll@mail.ubc.ca,"Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615",EU H2020 ERC project GreenLULUs [GA678034]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CEX2019-000940-M]; AGAUR Catalan governmental agency [2019 FI-B 76RNV29TT],"EU H2020 ERC project GreenLULUs; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); AGAUR Catalan governmental agency",This research was supported by the EU H2020 ERC project GreenLULUs (GA678034) and contributes to the Maria de Maeztu Program for Units of Excellence of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (CEX2019-000940-M).

The methodology is a sequential approach built around needs assessments by local stakeholders; the incorporation of climate science results; the sharing of these results and climate adaption response options with stakeholders at a series of workshops; stakeholder priority-setting exercises using multi-criteria scoring; and validation with policymakers. The application is to three diverse agroecosystems in Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. Among the many findings is that, notwithstanding the wide diversity of agro-ecosystems, them are numerous similarities in the agricultural adaptation responses prioritized by local stakeholders.

These challenges have prompted research on natural processes for wastewater treatment, such as constructed wetlands (CWs), providing low-energy treatment potential and storage capacity. As the performance of natural treatment processes may be limited by several factors (e. g. climatic conditions, space restrictions), considerable research concentrates on investigating their combination with engineered pre-or post-treatment processes to improve their performance and increase their treatment resilience. The aim of this paper is to assess and demonstrate the advantages of combined natural and engineered systems (cNES) over purely engineered treatment systems with regard to energy savings and reduced environmental impacts. The case of a cNES located in the island of Antiparos in Greece for the treatment and reuse of municipal effluents is investigated, focusing on the energy savings and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the natural treatment process. The performance of the system, which involves CWs for the secondary treatment of effluents, was assessed using an integrated modelling and simulation environment (baseline scenario). An alternative scenario was also built, substituting the CWs with a conventional activated sludge (CAS) process for the secondary treatment of effluents to achieve the same effluent quality as in the baseline scenario. Energy consumption and generation of GHG emissions was assessed for both scenarios, and a comparison between the two systems was conducted, highlighting the significant energy savings and the reduced GHG emissions produced by the cNES: the CAS system consumed about 3,000 times more energy, producing about 50 times more total GHG emissions compared with CWs. The results of the current analysis demonstrated that cNES involving CWs can provide a competitive alternative to purely engineered systems for wastewater treatment and reuse in isolated insular communities and small municipalities, also contributing to water scarcity reduction.","[Stathatou, P. -M.; Dedousis, P.; Grigoropoulou, H.; Assimacopoulos, D.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Chem Engn, Athens 15780, Greece; [Arampatzis, G.] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Prod Engn & Management, Khania 73100, Greece",National Technical University of Athens; Technical University of Crete,"Stathatou, PM (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Chem Engn, Athens 15780, Greece.",pstathatou@chemeng.ntua.gr; dedousis_p@hotmail.com; garampatzis@pem.tuc.gr; lenag@chemeng.ntua.gr; assim@chemeng.ntua.gr,,"Grigoropoulou, Helen/0000-0003-2361-6556; ARAMPATZIS, George/0000-0001-8307-2891",European Union's (EU) Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [689450],European Union's (EU) Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's (EU) Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Grant Agreement No. 689450: Project AquaNES Demonstrating synergies in combined natural and engineered processes for water treatment systems.

However, system performances are dependent on PCMs ' integrated forms, heat transfer enhancement solutions, system operating modes, together with optimal geometrical and operating parameters. In this study, passive, active, and combined passive/active solutions in PCMs systems have been comprehensively reviewed, when being applied in heating, cooling and electrical systems, together with a dialectical analysis on advantages and disadvantages. In addition to novel system designs, interdisciplinary applications of machine learning have been reviewed and formulated, from perspectives of reliable structures, smart operational controls, and stochastic uncertainty-based performance prediction. Furthermore, a generic methodology with a systematic and hierarchical procedure has been proposed, with the implementation of machine-learning based technique for optimisations during both design and operation periods. The mechanisms of machine learning techniques were characterised as the simplifications of modelling and optimization processes, through the errors-driven update, the support vector regression and the backpropagation neural network. Several technical challenges were identified, such as the heat transfer enhancement, the novel structural configurations and the flexible switch on operating modes. Finally, identified challenges on machine learning include the development of advanced learning algorithms for efficient performance predictions, optimal structural configurations on neural networks, the trade-off between computational complexity and reliable optimal solutions, and so on. The formulated climate-adaptive designs, intelligent operations, uncertainty-based analysis and optimisations with interdisciplinary machine learning techniques can promote PCMs applications in sustainable buildings.","[Zhou, Yuekuan; Wen, Tao; Yan, Jun] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Siqian] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhengxuan; Zhang, Guoqiang] Hunan Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Natl Ctr Int Res Collaborat Bldg Safety & Environ, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoqiang] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Bldg Energy Conservat & En, Changsha 412007, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Ding, Zhixiong] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jun] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Engn Thermophys, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; City University of Hong Kong; Hunan University; City University of Hong Kong; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zheng, SQ (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yuekuan.zhou@outlook.com; candyz129@sina.com,"Zhou, Yuekuan/ABE-4194-2020; Zhengxuan, Liu/AAW-3873-2021; DING, Zhixiong/AAX-7793-2020; Liu, Zhengxuan/ABC-6467-2021","Zhengxuan, Liu/0000-0002-2761-5078; DING, Zhixiong/0000-0002-7518-2828; Zhou, Yuekuan/0000-0003-2038-0314; ZHENG, Siqian/0000-0002-8436-4367",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; City University of Hong Kong; Hunan University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University); City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong); Hunan University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"This research is supported by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, City University of Hong Kong, Hunan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Based on the adaptation deficit framework of Fankhauser and McDermott (2014) and an expert interview with 39 producer organizations from Latin America, Asia and Africa, we first determine the perception and the impacts of climate change on fair trade producers' organizations. We then analyze how fair trade is helping producers to increase their adaptive capacity. Our results suggest that fair trade affects the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers in developing countries in two ways. First, it can work as a growth policy and affects the disposable income, which is then partly spent on adaptation measures. Second, by increased knowledge exchange, a higher degree of social capital and a better access to the international community, it makes the supply of adaptation more efficient.

While the Proto-Aurignacian shows some internal variability that could reflect an adaptation to changing environmental conditions, overall it remains very stable in terms of its techno-typology and social geography across these events. Additionally, the radiocarbon chronology for the site clearly shows that the Proto-Aurignacian outlasts both the super-eruption and Heinrich Event 4 as a whole, by as much as 2000 years. Comparisons with the regional Mousterian record indicate that the Proto-Aurignacian marks the advent of a new way for humans to respond to climatic change, which opens up new avenues to reflect on the disappearance of the Mousterian.","[Riel-Salvatore, Julien] Univ Montreal, Dept Anthropol, Pavillon Lionel Groulx,CP 6128, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Negrino, Fabio] Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Antichita Filosofia & Storia, Genoa, Italy",Universite de Montreal; University of Genoa,"Riel-Salvatore, J (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Anthropol, Pavillon Lionel Groulx,CP 6128, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",julien.riel-salvatore@umontreal.ca,,"Riel-Salvatore, Julien/0000-0001-8418-0958; Negrino, Fabio/0000-0001-7539-2959",Fonds Quebecois de Recherche - Culture et Societe; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Universite de Montreal,Fonds Quebecois de Recherche - Culture et Societe; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Universite de Montreal,"We thank Joao Cascalheira and Nuno Bicho for inviting us to contribute to the session on which this special issue is based at the 2016 SAA meetings and for their help and patience while we delivered this paper.

Several regional studies demonstrate the climate sensitivity of coffee (Coffea arabica) and the likely impact of climate change on coffee suitability, yield, increased pest and disease pressure and farmers' livelihoods. The objectives of this paper are (i) to quantify the impact of progressive climate change to grow coffee and to produce high quality coffee in Nicaragua and (ii) to develop an adaptation framework across time and space to guide adaptation planning. We used coffee location and cup quality data from Nicaragua in combination with the Maxent and CaNaSTA crop suitability models, the WorldClim historical data and the CMIP3 global circulation models to predict the likely impact of climate change on coffee suitability and quality. We distinguished four different impact scenarios: Very high (coffee disappears), high (large negative changes), medium (little negative changes) and increase (positive changes) in climate suitability. During the Nicaraguan coffee roundtable, most promising adaptation strategies were identified, which we then used to develop a two-dimensional adaptation framework for coffee in time and space. Our analysis indicates that incremental adaptation may occur over short-term horizons at lower altitudes, whereas the same areas may undergo transformative adaptation in the longer term. At higher elevations incremental adaptation may be needed in the long term. The same principle and framework is applicable across coffee growing regions around the world.","[Laderach, Peter; Zelaya, Carlos; Martinez-Valle, Armando] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Managua, Nicaragua; [Laderach, Peter; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian; Navarro-Racines, Carlos; Jarvis, Andy] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Cali, Colombia; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian; Navarro-Racines, Carlos; Jarvis, Andy] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University of Leeds,"Laderach, P (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Managua, Nicaragua.;Laderach, P (corresponding author), CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Cali, Colombia.",p.laderach@cgiar.org,"Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/AAY-8073-2020; Jarvis, Andy/K-5516-2013","Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/0000-0002-8044-583X; Jarvis, Andy/0000-0001-6543-0798; Laderach, Peter/0000-0001-8708-6318; Navarro-Racines, Carlos Eduardo/0000-0002-8692-6431",,,,,50,106,109,8,124,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Participants from French natural parks and forest organizations responded positively to its multiple applications.

Therefore, robust frameworks are required that integrate impacts to better understand EbA effectiveness. Monitoring frameworks that are universally applicable to EbA are desirable, however their universal application is problematic as they should reflect a community-driven design that accommodates both donor reporting functions and the generation of local-level data and information to support management actions and community initiatives. Initial products from this research include a generic, five-step process for developing and testing adaptation indicators, a robust framework consisting of (i) the indicators, data and information used to design the framework, (ii) the operational EbA platform that houses and computes the adaptation indicators, and (iii) the participating institutions, and initial, community-level applications to guide water management, replenishment of the vegetation cover, and business development. Immediate benefits to rural communities include the re-orientation of performance indicators mapped to their needs as opposed to donor reporting alone. The framework contributes to the set of tools currently in use for EbA monitoring by offering an umbrella within which existing tools can be applied.

Three literatures, in particular, have made important contributions: neo-institutional approaches to the re-scaling of professional organizational fields; Bourdieusian approaches to inter-and transnational fields of expert power; and approaches deploying Andrew Abbott's notion of linked ecologies in analyzing transnational expert politics. In reviewing these debates, this article makes the case that Abbott's core topological notion of 'ecology'-understood as differentiated and competitive arenas for professional claims-and alliance- making-has certain advantages when it comes to re-scaling and specifying the trans-local character of many contemporary professional projects. In particular, the article argues, this notion allows the analyst to view issues of spatialization and scale-making, and hence the making, linking, and boundary-drawing of specific expert jurisdictions, as themselves major issues of negotiation and struggle for contemporary professional groups. This conceptual and methodological argument is fleshed out in the article in relation to an on-going comparative research project on how professional groups in Denmark compete and cooperate for local organizational change in relation to border-transcending challenges of climate adaptation, lifestyle-related diseases, and economic innovation. By mapping the three case histories in terms of their patterns of local-transnational relations, the article ends by specifying some of the methodological challenges for a qualitative and comparative study aiming to capture emerging and variable modalities of trans-local professional projects.","[Blok, Anders; Lindstrom, Maria Duclos; Meilvang, Marie Leth; Pedersen, Inge Kryger] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Blok, A (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",abl@soc.ku.dk,,"Blok, Anders/0000-0002-3403-698X; Pedersen, Inge Kryger/0000-0003-3542-3532; Lindstrom, Maria Duclos/0000-0001-5513-0652; Meilvang, Marie/0000-0002-4972-2472",Danish Council for Independent Research-Social Sciences [DFF-6109-00063],Danish Council for Independent Research-Social Sciences(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),"This work was supported by the Danish Council for Independent Research-Social Sciences, grant number DFF-6109-00063.",,52,12,12,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2051-8803,2051-8811,,J PROF ORGAN,J.

Past research has focused on the use and added value of PSS. While earlier studies have widely acknowledged the importance of context in determining the effectiveness of PSS, there has so far been no dedicated study of the influence of context on the use and added value of these tools in real planning workshops. To address this gap, we made an in-depth exploratory case study of a PSS, called the Adaptation Support Tool (AST), used in an adaptation planning workshop in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The workshop used the AST to support collaborative spatial planning for urban water management, at the neighbourhood scale. Interviews, questionnaires, observations and document review were used to investigate the influence of three contextual factors on the use and added value of the AST. The studied contextual factors are: 1) the style of tool use, 2) the phase of planning, and 3) the local project setting. Our findings indicate that the style of tool use and the local project setting were the most important contextual factors in determining the use and added value of the AST during the workshop. Meanwhile, the phase of planning appears to be critical for achieving impacts at the project level. This exploratory case study is a modest first contribution to understanding the influence of context on the use and added value of PSS in practice. Nevertheless, the findings indicate that further exploration of this topic could offer important insights to PSS use in practice.

This type of building reflects the climatic architecture and is not based on energy consumption as in modern conceptions, especially in hot and dry regions. To study the thermal comfort in old buildings naturally ventilated, built in adobe with a compacted urban tissue known as the Ksar, we carried out a field study to evaluate the thermal comfort and climatic adaptation on the population of a hot and arid region in southern Algeria. This study was based on the adaptive model of ASHRAE-55. The results showed that the old building constructed in adobe is characterized by a bioclimatic architecture built with local materials, allowing high thermal insulation from the severe outdoor environment. As a result, the building offers thermal and humidity comfort to the inhabitants during a period of extreme heat, compared to modern concrete buildings. We registered a neutral temperature of 31.52 degrees C with a neutral humidity of around 20%.

A rapid assessment and response methodology (RAR) was implemented, which includes the examination of previous studies conducted in the sub-district, the mapping of healthcare facilities in the area, and the implementation of a facility infrastructure and workforce capacity investigation by means of key informant (KI) interviews at eight healthcare facilities. Findings indicate that the greatest need across the facilities relate to access to medical doctors and pharmacists. None of the facilities factored climate associations with health into their clinical care strategies. The necessity to train healthcare facility staff on aspects related to climate change, health, and sustainability is highlighted. Environmental health practitioners should also be incorporated in grassroots community climate adaptation strategies. Outcomes further indicate the need for the advancement of integrated healthcare and climate adaptation strategies that focus on strengthening healthcare systems, which may include novel technological approaches such as telemedicine.

Further, as resources are limited, it is essential to prioritize adaptation actions. At the municipal scale, we suggest that priorities be placed where there is a gap between adaption need and existing adaptation effort. Taking Seattle, USA, as an example, we present this gap in terms of four categories of adaptation options (no-regret, primary, secondary, and tertiary) for the three primary urban hazards flooding, heat wave, and drought. To do so, we first establish current adaptation need by identifying and categorizing adaptation options. Next, we consider for each option the number of hazards addressed and benefit to and beyond climate adaptation, the projected magnitude of the hazards addressed, the projection's uncertainty, and the required scale and irreversibility of investment. Third, we assessed Seattle's current adaptation efforts by reviewing adaptation plans and related materials. Finally, we identify the distance or gap as the proportion of adaptation options not identified by existing adaptation plans. For Seattle, we categorized seven options as no-regret adaptation, five as primary, two as secondary, and three as tertiary. Each level's adaptation gap highlights significant opportunities to take steps to reduce climate risks in key areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Sea level rise due to climate change increases the occurrence of coastal flood events, creating more challenges to coastal societies. Here we intend to draw the understanding of coastal inundation from our early studies, and provide a silhouette of our approaches in assessing climate change impacts as well as developing risk-based climate adaptation. As a result, we impart a distinctive view of the adaption towards the integration of asset design, coastal planning and policy development, which reflect multiscale approaches crossing individual systems to regions and then nation. Having the approaches, we also discussed the constraints that would be faced in adaptation implementation. In this regard, we initially follow the risk approach by illustrating hazards, exposure and vulnerability in relation to coastal inundation, and manifest the impact and risk assessment by considering an urban environment pertinent to built, natural, and socioeconomic systems. We then extend the scope and recommend the general approaches in developing adaptation to coastal inundation under climate change towards ameliorating overall risks, practically, by the reduction in exposure and vulnerability in virtue of the integration of design, planning and polices. In more details, a resilience design is introduced, to effectively enhance the capacity of built assets to resist coastal inundation impact. We then emphasize on the cost-effective adaptation for coastal planning, which delineates the problem of under-adaptation that leaves some potential benefits unrealized or over-adaptation that potentially consumes an excessive amount of resources. Finally, we specifically explore the issues in planning and policies in mitigating climate change risks, and put forward some emerging constraints in adaptation implementation.

A participatory approach blended with scientific field observations and secondary data collection was adopted. Criterion variables were used to identify the Vulnerability Hotspots while component indices helped in depiction of key characteristic features of study units. Findings - Data generated through participatory resource appraisal and scientific field observations were used to determine vulnerable hotspot's, identifying the driving factors (both anthropogenic and natural processes), and determining focus areas for interventions. Practical implications - A pilot project on Water Access and Wasteland Development has been initiated in the Western Himalayas that integrates community based natural resource management with infusion of appropriate technology to address water stress and ecosystem vulnerability. Originality/value - The research results identify target areas and methodologies for intervention, while the pilot initiative strives to ensure that disadvantaged cold desert mountain communities have access to resources and skills for effective management of these resources.","[Banerji, Gargi; Basu, Sejuti] PRAGYA, Res & Advocacy, Gurgaon, India",,"Banerji, G (corresponding author), PRAGYA, Res & Advocacy, Gurgaon, India.",gargi@pragya.org,,"Basu, Sejuti/0000-0002-9813-4159",,,,,35,7,8,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Design/methodology/approach Exploratory research design, using snowball, purposive and simple random sampling methods, was employed to assess respondents' level of knowledge in climate change and participatory adaptation awareness activities. Focus group discussion was finally used to appraise returned responses that compared indigenous knowledge with scientific data to examine variables influencing key determinants. Findings Age, gender, the level of education and work experience were all significant in determining outcome of responses by respondents on perceived level of knowledge in climate change and awareness in adaptation engagement efforts by the public. The study also confirmed existence of perceived knowledge and awareness gap with a marginal difference of 28% between management and stakeholder respondents. Practical implications Anthropogenic activities leading to climate change impacts are rarely linked to individual actions, lifestyles and community's sociocultural practices and choices. Originality/value There is a disconnect between what climate change managers know and are doing in terms of adaptation and mitigation efforts and what stakeholders should know and are expected to do toward achieving functional participatory engagements in Ghana. It calls for needs assessment on a governance system that will chart a new order to transform individual and household attitudes through curriculum development, awareness training, coping strategies to capacity building for members of the communities and households.","[Nunoo, Edward Kweku] Univ Cape Coast, Inst Oil & Gas Studies, Fac Social Sci, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Nunoo, Edward Kweku] Cent Univ, Environm & Dev Studies, Miotso Tema, Ghana; [Twum, Eric K.] Inst Green Growth Solut, Environm Policy, Accra, Ghana; [Panin, Anthony] Cent Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Econ, Miotso Tema, Ghana; [Essien, Bernice Agyeiwa] Cent Univ, Dept Social Work Psychol, Miotso Tema, Ghana",University of Cape Coast,"Nunoo, EK (corresponding author), Univ Cape Coast, Inst Oil & Gas Studies, Fac Social Sci, Cape Coast, Ghana.;Nunoo, EK (corresponding author), Cent Univ, Environm & Dev Studies, Miotso Tema, Ghana.",nunooedward@gmail.com; eric.k.twum@gmail.com; anthonypanin@ymail.com; benny.essien@gmail.com,"Nunoo, Edward Kweku/U-1565-2019","Nunoo, Edward Kweku/0000-0001-6470-9770",,,,,39,2,2,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1477-7835,1758-6119,,MANAG ENVIRON QUAL,Manag.

Here using ocean and atmosphere observations, we demonstrate links between increased upper ocean heat content due to global warming with the extreme rainfalls from recent hurricanes. Hurricane Harvey provides an excellent case study as it was isolated in space and time. We show that prior to the beginning of northern summer of 2017, ocean heat content was the highest on record both globally and in the Gulf of Mexico, but the latter sharply decreased with hurricane Harvey via ocean evaporative cooling. The lost ocean heat was realized in the atmosphere as moisture, and then as latent heat in record-breaking heavy rainfalls. Accordingly, record high ocean heat values not only increased the fuel available to sustain and intensify Harvey but also increased its flooding rains on land. Harvey could not have produced so much rain without human-induced climate change. Results have implications for the role of hurricanes in climate. Proactive planning for the consequences of human-caused climate change is not happening in many vulnerable areas, making the disasters much worse. Plain Language Summary Human-induced climate change continues to warm the oceans which provide the memory of past accumulated effects. The resulting environment, including higher ocean heat content and sea surface temperatures, invigorates tropical cyclones to make them more intense, bigger, and longer lasting and greatly increases their flooding rains. The main example here is Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, which can be reasonably isolated in terms of influences on and by the environment. Hurricanes keep tropical oceans cooler as a consequence of their strong winds that increase evaporation. Here we show for the first time that the rainfall likely matches the evaporation and the corresponding ocean heat loss. Planning for such supercharged hurricanes (adaptation) by increasing resilience (e.g., better building codes and flood protection) and preparing for contingencies (such as evacuation routes, power cuts, and so forth) is essential but not adequate in many areas, including Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico where Harvey, Irma, and Maria took their toll.","[Trenberth, Kevin E.; Zhang, Yongxin; Fasullo, John] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Cheng, Lijing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jacobs, Peter] George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; George Mason University","Trenberth, KE (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",trenbert@ucar.edu,"Trenberth, Kevin Edward/A-5683-2012; cheng, lijing/W-2261-2017; Fasullo, John/H-4552-2019; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Trenberth, Kevin Edward/0000-0002-1445-1000; cheng, lijing/0000-0002-9854-0392; Fasullo, John/0000-0003-1216-892X; Jacobs, Peter/0000-0002-6951-7126",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0603202]; DOE grant [DE-SC0012711]; National Science Foundation,National Key R&D Program of China; DOE grant(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"L.

While existing literature links future aerosol declines to a northward shift of Sahel rainfall, existing climate projections rely on RCP scenarios that do not explore the range of air quality drivers. Here we present projections from two emission scenarios that better envelop the range of potential aerosol emissions. More aggressive emission cuts result in northward shifts of the tropical rainbands whose signal can emerge from expected internal variability on short, 10-20-yr time horizons. We also show for the first time that this northward shift also impacts East Africa, with evidence of delays to both onset and withdrawal of the short rains. However, comparisons of rainfall impacts across models suggest that only certain aspects of both the West and East African model responses may be robust, given model uncertainties. This work motivates the need for wider exploration of air quality scenarios in the climate science community to assess the robustness of these projected changes and to provide evidence to underpin climate adaptation in Africa. In particular, revised estimates of emission impacts of legislated measures every 5-10 years would have a value in providing near-term climate adaptation information for African stakeholders.","[Scannell, Claire; Booth, Ben B.

This paper uses panel data from India spanning from 1956 to 1999 to investigate the ability of farmers to adapt. To identify adaptation, the author exploits persistent, multidecadal monsoon regimes during which droughts or floods are more common. These regimes generate medium-run variation in average rainfall, and there is spatial variation in the timing of the regimes. Using a fixed-effects strategy, she tests whether farmers have adapted to the medium-run rainfall variation induced by the monsoon regimes. The author finds evidence that farmers adjust their irrigation investments and their crop portfolios in response to the medium-run rainfall variation.

Latter describes a meteorological condition or threshold relevant to regional adaptation measures. To reach this goal, several steps were performed, starting with a survey and expert interviews on experiences of the climate influence on regional decision-making focusing on the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg in south-west Germany. After quantifying these experiences in terms of tailored climate parameters, they were analyzed using the observation datasets HYRAS and E-OBS as well as an ensemble of regional climate simulations for south-west Germany for a reference period (1971-2000) and the near future (2021-2050). Then, the relevance of the tailored climate parameters was described by a so-called sensitivity assessment. According to this assessment, the necessity for adaptation measures in a changing climate was identified for different fields of action. In the end, we show that a co-produced coupling of the expertise of climate scientists and decision-makers leads to a better understanding of the regional challenges of climate change and impacts.

To bring robustness in climate adaptation planning, evaluation of resilience across homogenous regions is essential for developing and scaling suitable location-need-context specific interventions and policies that build the resilience of the agricultural system. In this paper, we present an analysis and discussion of multi-scalar and multi-indicator assessment, by profiling resilience across agro-climatic zones of India, based on the development of a Climate-Resilient Agriculture Index embracing environmental, technological, socio-economic, and institutional and infrastructural dimension. A total of 26 indicators, spread across these four dimensions, were employed to purport inter- and intra-agro-climatic zone differentials in the level of resilience. Among the zones, it was found that West Coast Plains & Ghats and Tans-Gangetic Plains had the highest degree of resilience to manage climate risks. Most of the districts lying within Eastern Himalayan Region, Middle Gangetic Plains, Eastern Plateau & Hills, and Western Dry Region had a lower degree of resilience. The study places greater emphasis on deciphering region-specific drivers and barriers to resilience at a further disaggregated scale for improving rural well-beings. It is construed that devising action plans emphasizing awareness, preservation of natural resources, diversification, building physical infrastructure, strengthening of grass-root institutions, and mainstreaming climate adaptation in the developmental policy is crucial for climate-resilient pathways.","[Singh, Naveen P.; Anand, Bhawna; Singh, Surendra; Srivastava, S.

Their reliance on agricultural productivity is marred by inadequate adaptive and response capabilities, making them vulnerable to accompanying challenges. This paper examines the farmers' perceptions about the looming threats emanating from climate change. The study scrutinizes response options and strategies for action. It mainly focuses on the determinants, which characteristically influence the farmers' decision-making to cope with the looming challenges. The current study was carried out in the rain-fed contextual settings ofChakwalDistrict in Pakistan. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 475 households. The multivariate probit model was deployed for assessments and inferences. The findings formulate that a sizeable majority (96%) of farmers is conscious about the consequential impacts of weather and climatic anomalies. The irregular rainfall pattern was identified as the leading cause of concern (86%) among the respondents. Besides this, the households also tackle the abnormalities such as hail storms (73%), irregularities in the durations of summer (72%), and winter (71%) seasons. The respondents rely on several strategies ranging from changes in planting dates (76%) to compromises over the education of children (33%) to ameliorate ensuing stresses. The findings substantiate that the level of education, size of the land held, household income, exposure to information, and access to extension services determine the farmers' adaptation choices. However, financial constraints and lack of institutional support were adjudged as the cardinal hurdles. Therefore, integrated efforts in terms of technical, financial, and institutional support are obligatory for the social-economic resilience of such rain-fed agrarian communities.","[Amir, Sarah; Khan, Muhammad Irfan] Int Islamic Univ, Fac Basic Appl Sci, Dept Environm Sci, H-10, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Saqib, Zafeer; Zaman-ul-Haq] Int Islamic Univ, Fac Basic & Appl Sci, Dept Environm Sci, GIS & Ecoinformat Lab, H-10, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ali, Akhter] Natl Agr Res Ctr NARC, CIMMYT Pakistan Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Azeem] Pakistan Agr Res Council PARC, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Bokhari, Syed Atif] Govt Postgrad Coll, Dept Geog, Asghar Mall, Rawalpindi, Pakistan","International Islamic University, Pakistan; International Islamic University, Pakistan","Amir, S (corresponding author), Int Islamic Univ, Fac Basic Appl Sci, Dept Environm Sci, H-10, Islamabad, Pakistan.",sarah.amir@iiu.edu.pk,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; saqib, zafeer/J-4364-2017","saqib, zafeer/0000-0002-8008-750X",,,,,56,8,9,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1866-7511,1866-7538,,ARAB J GEOSCI,Arab.

Worldwide from 1880 to 2012, the average surface temperature has increased by about 0.85 degrees C and by 0.12 degrees C per decade since 1951. The world's cattle population is a contributor to atmospheric methane, a potent greenhouse gas, in addition to suffering from high temperatures combined with humidity. This makes research into reducing the global footprint of dairy cows of importance on a long-term horizon, while improving tolerance to heat could alleviate the effects of rising temperatures. In December 2017, genomic estimated breeding values for heat tolerance in dairy cattle were released for the first time in Australia. Currently, heat tolerance is not included in the Balanced Performance Index (Australia's national selection index), and the correlation between heat tolerance breeding values and Balanced Performance Index is -0.20, so over time, heat tolerance has worsened due to lack of selection pressure. However, in contrast, sizable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions have been achieved as a favorable response to selecting for increased productivity, longevity, and efficiency, with opportunities for even greater gains through selecting for cow emissions directly. Internationally considerable research effort has been made to develop breeding values focused on reducing methane emissions using individual cow phenotypes. This requires (1) definition of breeding objectives and selection criteria and (2) assembling a sufficiently large data set for genomic prediction. Selecting for heat tolerance and reduced emissions directly may improve resilience to changing environments while reducing environmental impact.","[Pryce, Jennie E.; Haile-Mariam, Mekonnen] Agr Victoria Res, AgriBio, Ctr AgriBiosci, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia; [Pryce, Jennie E.] La Trobe Univ, Sch Appl Syst Biol, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia",La Trobe University; La Trobe University,"Pryce, JE (corresponding author), Agr Victoria Res, AgriBio, Ctr AgriBiosci, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia.;Pryce, JE (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Sch Appl Syst Biol, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia.",jennie.pryce@agriculture.vic.gov.au,,"Haile-Mariam, Mekonnen/0000-0001-5476-7475; Pryce, Jennie/0000-0002-1397-1282","Dairy Australia (Melbourne, Australia); Gardiner Dairy Foundation (Melbourne, Australia); Agriculture Victoria (Melbourne, Australia)","Dairy Australia (Melbourne, Australia)(Dairy Australia); Gardiner Dairy Foundation (Melbourne, Australia); Agriculture Victoria (Melbourne, Australia)","The authors thank DairyBio, jointly funded by Dairy Australia (Melbourne, Australia), the Gardiner Dairy Foundation (Melbourne, Australia), and Agriculture Victoria (Melbourne, Australia), for funding.

In this way, determining the degree of agricultural vulnerability represents a guide for sustainability and adaptability focused on changing future conditions. In many cases, vulnerability analysis data is restricted to use by authorized personnel only, leaving open data policies aside. Furthermore, data in its native format (raw data) by nature tend to be diverse in structure, storage formats, and access protocols. In addition, having a large amount of open data is important (though not sufficient) to obtain accurate results in data-driven analysis. These data require a strict preparation process and having guides that facilitate this process is becoming increasingly necessary. In this study, we present the step by step processing of several open data sources in order to obtain quality information for feedback on different agricultural vulnerability analysis. The data preparation process is applied to a case study corresponding to the upper Cauca river basin in Colombia. All data sources in this study are public, official and are available from different web platforms where they were collected. In the same way, a ranking with the importance of variables for each dataset was obtained through automatic methods and validated through expert knowledge. Experimental validation showed an acceptable agreement between the ranking of automatic methods and the ranking of raters.

Mires (i.e. bogs, transition bogs and fens) are assumed to be especially vulnerable to climate change because they depend on specific, namely cool and humid, climatic conditions. In this paper, we use distribution data of the nine mire types to be found in Austria and habitat distribution models for four IPCC scenarios to evaluate climate change induced risks for mire ecosystems within the 21st century. We found that climatic factors substantially contribute to explain the current distribution of all nine Austrian mire ecosystem types. Summer temperature proved to be the most important predictor for the majority of mire ecosystems. Precipitation-mostly spring and summer precipitation sums-was influential for some mire ecosystem types which depend partly or entirely on ground water supply (e.g. fens). We found severe climate change induced risks for all mire ecosystems, with rain-fed bog ecosystems being most threatened. Differences between scenarios are moderate for the mid-21st century, but become more pronounced towards the end of the 21st century, with near total loss of climate space projected for some ecosystem types (bogs, quagmires) under severe climate change. Our results imply that even under minimum expected, i.e. inevitable climate change, climatic risks for mires in Austria will be considerable. Nevertheless, the pronounced differences in projected habitat loss between moderate and severe climate change scenarios indicate that limiting future warming will likely contribute to enhance long-term survival of mire ecosystems, and to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing peat. Effectively stopping and reversing the deterioration of mire ecosystems caused by conventional threats can be regarded as a contribution to climate change mitigation. Because hydrologically intact mires are more resilient to climatic changes, this would also maintain the nature conservation value of mires, and help to reduce the severe climatic risks to which most Austrian mire ecosystems may be exposed in the 2nd half of the 21st century according to IPCC scenarios.","[Essl, Franz; Moser, Dietmar; Rabitsch, Wolfgang] Environm Agcy Austria, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Dullinger, Stefan] Univ Vienna, Dept Conservat Biol Vegetat & Landscape Ecol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Dullinger, Stefan; Moser, Dietmar; Kleinbauer, Ingrid] Vienna Inst Nat Conservat & Anal, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Essl, F (corresponding author), Environm Agcy Austria, Spittelauer Lande 5, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",franz.essl@umweltbundesamt.at,"Essl, Franz/ABE-7064-2020","Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112; Rabitsch, Wolfgang/0000-0002-3811-6071; Dullinger, Stefan/0000-0003-3919-0887",Austrian Forests (OBf); Upper Austrian Federal Government,Austrian Forests (OBf); Upper Austrian Federal Government,"This analysis has been jointly financed by the Austrian Forests (OBf) and the Upper Austrian Federal Government.

A Probit model and K-means algorithm were used to analyze the factors affecting farmers' agroforestry technology adoption decisions based on the sampled households' socio-economic, demographic, and farm characteristics. The study found that the total yield for maize crop, farm size, extension frequency, off-farm income, access to training, access to credit, access to transport facilities, group membership, access to market, gender, distance to nearest trading center, and household education level had significant effects on the adoption of agroforestry technologies. The findings of this study are important in informing policy formulation and implementation that promotes agroforestry technologies adoption.","[Pello, Kevin; Liu, Aijun] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China; [Okinda, Cedric] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Lab Modern Facil Agr Technol & Equipment Engn Jia, Nanjing 210031, Peoples R China; [Liu, Aijun] Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China; [Njagi, Tim] Egerton Univ, Tegemeo Inst Agr Policy & Dev, POB 20498-00200, Nairobi, Kenya",Nanjing Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University; Egerton University,"Liu, AJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China.;Liu, AJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China.",2018106115@njau.edu.cn; 2017212015@njau.edu.cn; liuaj@njau.edu.cn; tnjagi@tegemeo.org,"Okinda, Cedric/L-2087-2019","Okinda, Cedric/0000-0001-7887-4216; liu, ai jun/0000-0003-4709-6495","Jiangsu Social Science Association Project [20SCB-05]; International Cooperation Project of Nanjing Agricultural University [2018EU-18]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [KYYJ202010, SKYC202002]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions Project (PAPD); Cyrus Tang Foundation",Jiangsu Social Science Association Project; International Cooperation Project of Nanjing Agricultural University; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions Project (PAPD); Cyrus Tang Foundation,"This research was funded by Jiangsu Social Science Association Project, grant number 20SCB-05, International Cooperation Project of Nanjing Agricultural University, grant number 2018EU-18, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, grant number KYYJ202010 and SKYC202002, Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions Project (PAPD) and Cyrus Tang Foundation.",,62,3,3,5,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,APR,2021,10,4,,,,,,,371,10.3390/land10040371,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10040371,,,16,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RR6TD,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000643227000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

But the inevitable climate change effects due to constant feeding of emissions into atmosphere leads to severe and extreme precipitation causing flooding. The combined impact of flooding, rapid urbanization and vehicular growth has become a looming threat to the transportation system which is affecting the developing economies disproportionately. There is an urgent need for the transport infrastructure to adapt to these climate change effects to reduce human as well as economic losses and adaptation is seen as the necessary tool to address this. In this paper, a methodological approach to formulate the adaptation strategies from urban transport to urban flooding in developing economies is presented. Further three adaptation policy bundles are formulated specifically to enhance the resilience of transportation system against urban flooding thereby strengthening the adaptive capacity of the system. These strategies are evaluated for the years 2030 and 2050 along with base year for various travel parameters to estimate the impact of flooding. This study finds that the implementation of bundle 1 is an effective adaptation measure when compared to bundle 2 and 3. The comparative analysis with BAU flooding scenario shows that VKT of bundle 1 is reduced by 4% and 3%, speeds increased by 21% and 45%, vehicle hours travelled by 9% and 8% for the years 2030 and 2050 respectively.

There is an urgent need to understand the diversity within the farming households, identify the main drivers and understand its relationship with household adaptation strategies. Typology construction provides an efficient method to understand farmer diversity by delineating groups with common characteristics. In the present study, based in the Uttarakhand state of Indian Western Himalayas, five farmer types were identified on the basis of resource endowment and agriculture orientation characteristics. Factor analysis followed by sequential agglomerative hierarchial and K-means clustering was use to delineate farmer types. Examination of adaptation strategies across the identified farmer types revealed that mostly contrasting and type-specific bundle of strategies are adopted by farmers to ensure livelihood security. Our findings show that strategies that incurred high investment, such as infrastructural development, are limited to high resource-endowed farmers. In contrast, the low resourced farmers reported being progressively disengaging with farming as a livelihood option. Our results suggest that the proponents of effective adaptation policies in the Himalayan region need to be cognizant of the nuances within the farming communities to capture the diverse and multiple adaptation needs and constraints of the farming households.","[Shukla, Roopam; Sachdeva, Kamna] TERI Univ, Dept Nat Resources, New Delhi 110070, India; [Shukla, Roopam; Agarwal, Ankit; Gornott, Christoph] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Shukla, Roopam; Agarwal, Ankit; Gornott, Christoph] Leibniz Assoc, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Agarwal, Ankit] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Hydrol, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Agarwal, Ankit] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect 4 4 Hydrol, Potsdam, Germany; [Joshi, P.

A key opportunity to replace fossil fuels across sectors is the use of renewable hydrogen. In this context, the main political and social push is currently on climate neutral hydrogen (H-2) production through electrolysis using renewable electricity. Another climate neutral possibility that has recently gained importance is biohydrogen production from biogenic residual and waste materials. This paper introduces for the first time a novel concept for the production of hydrogen with net negative emissions. The derived concept combines biohydrogen production using biotechnological or thermochemical processes with carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage. Various process combinations referred to this basic approach are defined as HyBECCS (Hydrogen Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) and described in this paper. The technical principles and resulting advantages of the novel concept are systematically derived and compared with other Negative Emission Technologies (NET). These include the high concentration and purity of the CO2 to be captured compared to Direct Air Carbon Capture (DAC) and Post-combustion Carbon Capture (PCC) as well as the emission-free use of hydrogen resulting in a higher possible CO2 capture rate compared to hydrocarbon-based biofuels generated with Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technologies. Further, the role of carbon-negative hydrogen in future energy systems is analyzed, taking into account key societal and technological drivers against the background of climate adaptation and mitigation. For this purpose, taking the example of the Federal Republic of Germany, the ecological impacts are estimated, and an economic assessment is made. For the production and use of carbon-negative hydrogen, a saving potential of 8.49-17.06 MtCO(2,)eq/a is estimated for the year 2030 in Germany. The production costs for carbon-negative hydrogen would have to be below 4.30 euro per kg in a worst-case scenario and below 10.44 euro in a best-case scenario in order to be competitive in Germany, taking into account hydrogen market forecasts.","[Full, Johannes; Merseburg, Steffen; Miehe, Robert; Sauer, Alexander] Fraunhofer Inst Mfg Engn & Automat IPA, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Full, Johannes; Sauer, Alexander] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Energy Efficiency Prod EEP, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; University of Stuttgart,"Full, J (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Mfg Engn & Automat IPA, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.;Full, J (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Energy Efficiency Prod EEP, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",johannes.full@ipa.fraunhofer.de; steffen.merseburg@ipa.fraunhofer.de; robert.miehe@ipa.fraunhofer.de; alexander.sauer@ipa.fraunhofer.de,,"Full, Johannes/0000-0002-0748-7689; Miehe, Robert/0000-0002-1129-8880","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, Germany; Ministry of Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, Germany; Ministry of Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany","This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy and the Ministry of Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.",,129,10,10,11,39,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2021,13,7,,,,,,,4026,10.3390/su13074026,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13074026,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RL3SI,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000638897100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

By manufacturing bi-layered structures with adapted grain orientation in the two bonded layers, humidity-driven actuators are generated, which have the potential to be used for autonomous climate adaptive building with tile. The present study deals with design principles for upscaling the size of the bilayers and for increasing the rate of MC change and, thus, rate of shape change. Wood bilayers with widths of up to half a meter were subjected to changes of relative humidity (RH). Moisture and curvature changes were recorded. Bilayers with different widths showed curvature exclusively along their length. Next to this, the performance was compared between bilayers with and without milled-in grooves. These grooves lead to shorter diffusion paths along fibre direction for increasing the rate of MC change. The highest rates of MC change were visible for the samples with the smallest width within the first hours after change of RH. Later on, all samples showed similar rates. The milling of grooves increased the moisture change rate substantially compared to the non-milled samples resulting in a higher rate of curvature change. The increase is especially pronounced for cyclic changes of RH. This study shows that, by applying material specific design principles, the shape change of wood bilayers can be adapted and the rate of the MC change can be increased by keeping diffusion paths short along fibre direction. These principles may facilitate the use of large-scale wood bilayers as lamellae in shading systems.","[Vailati, C.; Hass, P.; Burgert, I.; Ruggeberg, M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Bldg Mat IfB, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Vailati, C.; Hass, P.; Burgert, I.; Ruggeberg, M.] EMPA, Lab Appl Wood Mat, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA),"Ruggeberg, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Bldg Mat IfB, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",mrueggeberg@ethz.ch,,,DFG [SPP 1420]; SNF Project [163191],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); SNF Project,This study was funded by the DFG priority program SPP 1420: Biomimetic Materials Research: Functionality by Hierarchical Structuring of Materials'' and by the SNF Project 163191 Smart shape-changing wood elements for improved energy efficiency of buildings''.,,25,11,11,4,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1359-5997,1871-6873,,MATER STRUCT,Mater.

There has been extensive research on improving forecasts and management practices to minimise climate related yield losses, but less on how to handle yield losses caused by climate variability. We investigated whether index insurance could be used to manage climate related losses, specifically from winter rainfall drought for wheat crops in Australia. We utilised 31 years of yield data from 15 of Australia's key wheat producing regions. The winter rainfall index was developed and tested using generalised additive regression models, allowing for non-linear effects. Models with the winter rainfall index explained significant variation in wheat yields in each of the regions assessed. Wheat yield models had cross-validated R-2 values > 0.5 for two-thirds of the 15 regions modelled and best explained wheat yields in the Mallee, Western Australia (cross-validated R-2 of 0.70). Calculated fair premiums ranged from $8.62 to $77.1 AUD/ha, while maximum liability was $59.25 to $212.12 AUD/ha. Throughout the eastern most wheat growing regions the winter rainfall index was consistently inefficient (i.e. not beneficial). In contrast, the winter rainfall index was financially efficient (i.e. beneficial) in the western wheat regions of eastern Australia and parts of Western Australia, with benefits of up to $97 AUD/ha and loss reductions of $9 AUD/ha. The spatial variability in insurance efficiency was explained by rainfall variance. As rainfall variance increased the efficiency of the winter rainfall index insurance for wheat decreased. Our findings have two important policy implications; (1) in areas where climate change is anticipated to increase rainfall variability risk-transfer options, such as index insurance, may become less viable and as such policies that support the development of index insurance without acknowledging or adjusting for variability in its benefit could lead to inefficient outcomes for both government and agricultural producers; and (2) where index rainfall insurance is not efficient then greater emphasise may need to be placed on developing alternate types of index insurance (e.g. using satellites) and/or on risk-management and climate adaptation strategies that minimise losses.","[Kath, Jarrod; Mushtaq, Shahbaz; Adeyinka, Adewuyi Ayodele; Stone, Roger; Marcussen, Torben; Kouadio, Louis] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Henry, Ross] Queensland Farmers Federat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Southern Queensland,"Kath, J (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Inst Agr & Environm, West St, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",jarrod.kath@usq.edu.au,"Kouadio, Louis A./A-3099-2014","Kouadio, Louis A./0000-0001-9669-7807; Adeyinka, Adewuyi Ayodele/0000-0001-9668-220X; Stone, Roger/0000-0003-3931-2661","Queensland State Government, through the Drought and Climate Adaptation (DCAP) program","Queensland State Government, through the Drought and Climate Adaptation (DCAP) program","The Queensland State Government, through the Drought and Climate Adaptation (DCAP) program, funded this project.",,42,8,8,1,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Because dam building and pond formation by beaver can increase water storage, stream cooling, and riparian ecosystem resilience, beaver have been proposed as a potential climate adaption tool. Despite the large number of studies that have evaluated how beaver activity may affect hydrology and water temperature, few experimental studies have quantified these outcomes following beaver relocation. We evaluated changes in temperature and water storage following the relocation of 69 beaver into 13 headwater stream reaches of the Skykomish River watershed within the Snohomish River basin, Washington, USA. We evaluated how beaver dams affected surface and groundwater storage and stream temperature. Successful relocations created 243 m(3) of surface water storage per 100 m of stream in the first year following relocation. Dams raised water table elevations by up to 0.33 m and stored approximately 2.4 times as much groundwater as surface water per relocation reach. Stream reaches downstream of dams exhibited an average decrease of 2.3 degrees C during summer base-flow conditions. We also assessed how dam age, condition, maintenance frequency, and pond morphology influenced stream temperature at naturally colonized wetland complexes. Our findings demonstrate that dam building can increase water storage and reduce stream temperatures in the first year following successful beaver relocation. Fluvial and floodplain morphology of candidate reaches for relocation is an important consideration because it determines the type and magnitude of response. Relocation to reaches with existing small, abandoned ponds may address thermal criteria by conversion from warming to cooling reaches, whereas relocation within large, abandoned complexes or vacant habitat may result in greater water storage. Although beaver relocation can be an effective climate adaptation strategy to retain more stable hydrologic regimes and water quality in our study area, there appear to be regionally specific environmental and geomorphic factors that influence how beaver affect water storage and temperature. More research is needed to investigate how and why these regional differences affect water storage and stream temperature response in beaver-influenced systems.","[Dittbrenner, Benjamin J.; Lawler, Joshua J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Schilling, Jason W.] Tulalip Tribes Nat Resources, Tulalip, WA USA; [Torgersen, Christian E.] Univ Washington, US Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Cascadia Field Stn,Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Dittbrenner, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",dittbrenner@gmail.com,,,Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center; Tulalip Tribes,Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center; Tulalip Tribes,Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center; The Tulalip Tribes,,97,1,1,17,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,JUL,2022,13,7,,,,,,,e4168,10.1002/ecs2.4168,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4168,,,17,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,3A4FC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000827216500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Over 650 million people depend on climate-sensitive sectors, such as rain-fed agriculture and forestry, for livelihood and over 973 million people are exposed to vector borne malarial parasites. Projection of climatic factors indicates a wider exposure to malaria for the Indian population in the future. If precautionary measures are not taken and development processes are not managed properly some developmental activities, such as hydro-electric dams and irrigation canal systems, may also exacerbate breeding grounds for malaria. This article integrates climate change and developmental variables in articulating a framework for integrated impact assessment and adaptation responses, with malaria incidence in India as a case study. The climate change variables include temperature, rainfall, humidity, extreme events, and other secondary variables. Development variables are income levels, institutional mechanisms to implement preventive measures, infrastructure development that could promote malarial breeding grounds, and other policies. The case study indicates that sustainable development variables may sometimes reduce the adverse impacts on the system due to climate change alone, while it may sometimes also exacerbate these impacts if the development variables are not managed well and therefore they produce a negative impact on the system. The study concludes that well crafted and well managed developmental policies could result in enhanced resilience of communities and systems, and lower health impacts due to climate change.","[Garg, Amit; Shukla, P.

In response, over-summer snow storage, attempted primarily using woodchips as a cover material, has been successfully employed as a climate change adaptation strategy by high-elevation and/or high-latitude ski centers in Europe and Canada. Such storage has never been attempted at a site that is both low elevation and midlatitude, and few studies have quantified storage losses repeatedly through the summer. Such data, along with tests of different cover strategies, are prerequisites to optimizing snow storage strategies. Here, we assess the rate at which the volume of two woodchip-covered snow piles (each similar to 200 m(3)), emplaced during spring 2018 in Craftsbury, Vermont (45 degrees N and 360 m a.s.l.), changed. We used these data to develop an optimized snow storage strategy. In 2019, we tested that strategy on a much larger, 9300 m(3) pile. In 2018, we continually logged air-to-snow temperature gradients under different cover layers including rigid foam, open-cell foam, and woodchips both with and without an underlying insulating blanket and an overlying reflective cover. We also measured ground temperatures to a meter depth adjacent to the snow piles and used a snow tube to measure snow density. During both years, we monitored volume change over the melt season using terrestrial laser scanning every 10-14 d from spring to fall. In 2018, snow volume loss ranged from 0.29 to 2.81 m(3) d(-1), with the highest rates in midsummer and lowest rates in the fall; mean rates of volumetric change were 1.24 and 1.50 m(3) d(-1), 0.55% to 0.72% of initial pile volume per day. Snow density did increase over time, but most volume loss was the result of melting. Wet woodchips underlain by an insulating blanket and covered with a reflective sheet were the most effective cover combination for minimizing melt, likely because the aluminized surface reflected incoming short-wave radiation while the wet woodchips provided significant thermal mass, allowing much of the energy absorbed during the day to be lost by long-wave emission at night. The importance of the pile surface-area-to-volume ratio is demonstrated by 4-fold lower rates of volumetric change for the 9300 m(3) pile emplaced in 2019; it lost < 0.16% of its initial volume per day between April and October, retaining similar to 60% of the initial snow volume over summer. Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of over-summer snow storage at midlatitudes and low elevations and suggest efficient cover strategies.","[Weiss, Hannah S.; Bierman, Paul R.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Bierman, Paul R.] Univ Vermont, Geol Dept, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Dubief, Yves] Univ Vermont, Dept Mech Engn, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Hamshaw, Scott D.] Univ Vermont, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Weiss, HS (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",hsweiss@uvm.edu,"Bierman, Paul/AAA-9466-2020; Dubief, Yves/B-5714-2011","Bierman, Paul/0000-0001-9627-4601; Weiss, Hannah/0000-0001-5204-8565; Dubief, Yves/0000-0001-8181-7597; Hamshaw, Scott/0000-0002-0583-4237","University of Vermont's Department of Geology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, the Office of Undergraduate Research; National Science Foundation [CMMI-1229045]","University of Vermont's Department of Geology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, the Office of Undergraduate Research; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research has been financially supported by the University of Vermont's Department of Geology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, the Office of Undergraduate Research, and the Graduate College.

The research is aimed at eight colleagues in Taiwan and is an undergraduate student taking courses in general environmental education. As diverse courses integrate climate change issues, distributed 1,000 questionnaires were proportionally allocated to each university according to the number of students who had taken the course; a total of 866 questionnaires were recovered. The pro-environmental behavior model be validated, and assess the correlations among risk perception, economic incentives, intrinsic motivation, sacrifice for the environment, place attachment, cheerful emotion, and social norm with partial least squares regression. For college students with high or medium knowledge on climate change, this research demonstrated that if pro-environmental behaviors bring cheerful feeling, they will induce their intrinsic motivation; meanwhile, because of environmental sacrifice and social norms, pro-environmental behaviors will trigger cheerful feeling.","[Fang, Shyang-Chyuan] Natl Penghu Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Tourism & Leisure, 300 Liu Ho Rd, Makung 880, Penghu, Taiwan",National Penghu University of Science & Technology,"Fang, SC (corresponding author), Natl Penghu Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Tourism & Leisure, 300 Liu Ho Rd, Makung 880, Penghu, Taiwan.",chyuansf2012@gmail.com,"Fang, shyang-chyuan/HLQ-6604-2023",,,,,,79,2,2,7,23,SCI METHODICAL CTR-SCI EDUCOLOGICA,SIAULIAI,"DONELAICIO ST 29, SIAULIAI, LT-78115, LITHUANIA",1648-3898,,,J BALT SCI EDUC,J.

Policy-makers and resource managers must now prepare for the impacts from climate change and support implementing such plans on the ground. In this paper we argue that climate change challenges the region to maintain its economic viability, but also holds some opportunities that may enhance economic development, human well-being, and social justice. To face these challenges and seize these opportunities effectively we must better understand adaptation capacities, opportunities and constraints, the social processes of adaptation, approaches for engaging critical players and the broader public in informed debate, decision-making, and conscious interventions in the adaptation process. This paper offers a preliminary qualitative assessment, in which we emphasize the need for (1) assessing the feasibility and side effects of technological adaptation options, (2) increasing available resources and improving equitable access to them, (3) increasing institutional flexibility, fit, cooperation and decision-making authority, (4) using and enhancing human and social capital, (5) improving access to insurance and other risk-spreading mechanisms, and (6) linking scientific information more effectively to decision-makers while engaging the public. Throughout, we explore these issues through illustrative sectoral examples. We conclude with a number of principles that may guide the preparation of future adaptation plans for the Northeast.","[Moser, Susanne C.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Inst Study Soc & Environm, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Kasperson, Roger E.] Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Kasperson, Roger E.] Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Yohe, Gary] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Middletown, CT USA; [Agyeman, Julian] Tufts Univ, Dept Urban & Environm Policy & Planning, Medford, MA 02155 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Clark University; Clark University; Wesleyan University; Tufts University,"Moser, SC (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Inst Study Soc & Environm, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",smoser@ucar.edu; rkasperson@clarku.edu; gyohe@wesleyan.edu; julian.agyeman@tufts.edu,,,,,,,69,41,41,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

However, steady-state conditions are rarely achieved and a significant portion of the embankment remains unsaturated upon a flood event. If transient water flow and partial saturation are considered, the flood embankment can be designed with steeper slopes on the landside, which may lead to significant savings in terms of earthfill material (i.e., embodied carbon) and footprint (i.e., habitat suppression and expropriation costs). This paper examines the case of flood embankments in the tidal area of the Elbe River in Germany. These embankments must be retrofitted by raising their crest from 5 to 7 m because of the new projection of extreme river levels due to climate change. In this paper, the conventional prescriptive design consisting of raising the embankment by maintaining the 1:3 inclination of the landside slope is compared with the performance-based design where the inclination of the slope on the landside could be potentially increased up to 1:1, which is shown to be sustainable if partial saturation and transient water flow are considered. Raising the flood embankment with 1:1 landside slope (rather than 1:3) could lead to expropriation cost savings on the order of euro3.9 M/km. For the case of a newly built embankment of 7 m height, the saving would become euro4.5 M/km. An approximate estimation of embodied carbon suggests that the carbon saving would be on the order of 3,100-4,200 tCO(2)e/km.","[Beber, Raniero] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, James Weir Bldg Level 5, 75 Montrose St, Glasgow G11XJ, Scotland; [Tarantino, Alessandro] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 75 Montrose St, Glasgow G11XJ, Scotland; [Becker, Patrick] Kempfert Geotech GmbH, Hasenhohe 128, D-22587 Hamburg, Germany",University of Strathclyde; University of Strathclyde,"Beber, R (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, James Weir Bldg Level 5, 75 Montrose St, Glasgow G11XJ, Scotland.",raniero.beber@gmail.com; alessandro.tarantino@strath.ac.uk; p.becker@kup-geotechnik.de,,"Tarantino, Alessandro/0000-0001-6690-748X; Beber, Raniero/0000-0003-1818-922X",European Commission via the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN-ETN) project TERRE Training Engineers and Researchers to Rethink Geotechnical Engineering for a Low-Carbon Future [H2020-MSCA-ITN-2015-675762],European Commission via the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN-ETN) project TERRE Training Engineers and Researchers to Rethink Geotechnical Engineering for a Low-Carbon Future,The authors wish to acknowledge the support of the European Commission via the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN-ETN) project TERRE Training Engineers and Researchers to Rethink Geotechnical Engineering for a Low-Carbon Future (H2020-MSCA-ITN-2015-675762).,,39,0,0,1,1,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1532-3641,1943-5622,,INT J GEOMECH,Int.

These agricultural systems are predicted to be vulnerable to climate change and therefore require transformative adaptations. In collaboration with farmers in the wheatbelt of Western Australia (WA), a range of systemic and transformative adaptation options, e.g. land use change, were designed for the modelled climate change projected to occur in 2030 (0.4-1.4 degrees increase in mean temperature). The effectiveness of the adaptation options was evaluated using coupled crop and livestock biophysical models within an economic and environmental framework at both the enterprise and farm scales. The relative changes in economic return and environmental variables in 2030 are presented in comparison with a baseline period (1970-2010). The analysis was performed on representative farm systems across a rainfall transect. Under the impact of projected climate change, the economic returns of the current farms without adaptation declined by between 2 and 47%, with a few exceptions where profit increased by up to 4%. When the adaptations were applied for 2030, profit increased at the high rainfall site in the range between 78 and 81% through a 25% increase in the size of livestock enterprise and adjustment in sowing dates, but such profit increases were associated with 6-10% increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. At the medium rainfall site, a 100% increase in stocking rate resulted in 5% growth in profit but with a 61-71% increase in GHG emissions and the increased likelihood of soil degradation. At the relatively low rainfall site, a 75% increase in livestock when associated with changes in crop management resulted in greater profitability and a smaller risk of soil erosion. This research identified that a shift toward a greater livestock enterprises (stocking rate and pasture area) could be a profitable and low-risk approach and may have most relevance in years with extremely low rainfall. If transformative adaptations are adopted then there will be an increased requirement for an emissions control policy due to livestock GHG emissions, while there would be also need for soil conservation strategies to be implemented during dry periods. The adoption rate analysis with producers suggests there would be a greater adoption rate for less intensified adaptations even if they are transformative. Overall the current systems would be more resilient with the adaptations, but there may be challenges in terms of environmental sustainability and in particular with soil conservation.","[Ghahramani, Afshin] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm Australia, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Bowran, David] Yarunaresearch, York, WA 6302, Australia; [Bowran, David] Dept Agr & Food Western Australia, Northam, WA 6401, Australia",University of Southern Queensland,"Ghahramani, A (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm Australia, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",Afshin.Ghahramani@usq.edu.au,"Ghahramani, Afshin/C-4169-2012","Ghahramani, Afshin/0000-0002-9648-4606","Australian Government's Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Meat & Livestock Australia; Australian Wool Innovation","Australian Government's Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Meat & Livestock Australia; Australian Wool Innovation(Australian Wool Innovation)","The Australian Government's Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Meat & Livestock Australia, and Australian Wool Innovation funded this research through the Filling the Research Gap program.

More specifically, climate change effects were investigated on sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) development and yield under the A2 and B2 scenarios of the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). The direct impact of extreme climate events (i.e. heat stress at anthesis stage) was also included. The increase in both mean temperatures and temperature extremes under A2 and B2 scenarios (2071-2100) resulted in: a general advancement of the main phenological stages, shortening of the growing season and an increase in the frequency of heat stress during anthesis with respect to the baseline (1961-1990). The potential impact of these changes on crop yields was evaluated. It was found that winter and summer crops may possess a different fitting capacity to climate change. Sunflower, cultivated in the southern regions of the Mediterranean countries, was more prone to the direct effect of heat stress at anthesis and drought during its growing cycle. These factors resulted in severe yield reduction. In contrast, the lower frequency of heat stress and drought allowed the winter wheat crop to attain increased yields with respect to the baseline period. It can be concluded that the impact of extreme events should be included in crop-modelling approaches, otherwise there is the risk of underestimating crop yield losses, which in turn would result in the application of incorrect policies for coping with climate change.","[Moriondo, M.] CNR IBIMET, I-50145 Florence, Italy; [Giannakopoulos, C.] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Athens 11810, Greece; [Bindi, M.] Univ Florence, Dept Plant Soil & Environm Sci, I-50144 Florence, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Biometeorologia (IBIMET-CNR); National Observatory of Athens; University of Florence,"Moriondo, M (corresponding author), CNR IBIMET, Via G Caproni 8, I-50145 Florence, Italy.",marco.moriondo@cnr.it; cgiannak@meteo.noa.gr; marco.bindi@unifi.it,"Moriondo, Marco/H-5279-2019; bindi, marco/M-6415-2014; Giannakopoulos, Christos/H-6827-2014","Moriondo, Marco/0000-0002-8356-7517; bindi, marco/0000-0002-8968-954X; Giannakopoulos, Christos/0000-0003-1822-7716",Commission of EU [EVK2-CT-2001-00118],Commission of EU,"This research was supported by the Commission of EU (Project MICE n.

The sensitivity of impacts to each is unknown because they have never been systematically compared. In addition, little is known about the relative sensitivity of impacts to-adaptation uncertainty (i.e., the inclusion/exclusion of adaptation modeling) relative to using multiple climate models and emissions scenarios. OBJECTIVES: This study had three aims: a) Compare the range in projected impacts that arises from using different adaptation modeling methods; b) compare the range in impacts that arises from adaptation uncertainty with ranges from using multiple climate models and emissions scenarios; c) recommend modeling method(s) to use in future impact assessments. METHODS: We estimated impacts for 2070-2099 for 14 European cities, applying six different methods for modeling adaptation; we also estimated impacts with five climate models run under two emissions scenarios to explore the relative effects of climate modeling and emissions uncertainty. RESULTS: The range of the difference (percent) in impacts between including and excluding adaptation, irrespective of climate modeling and emissions uncertainty, can he as low as 28% with one method and up to 103% with another (mean across 14 cities). In 13 of 14 cities, the ranges in projected impacts due to adaptation uncertainty are larger than those associated with climate modeling and emissions uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers should carefully consider how to model adaptation because it is a source of uncertainty that can be greater than the uncertainty in emissions and climate modeling. We recommend absolute threshold shifts and reductions in slope.","[Gosling, Simon N.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Hondula, David M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ USA; [Bunker, Aditi] Heidelberg Univ, Network Aging Res, Heidelberg, Germany; [Bunker, Aditi; Sauerborn, Rainer] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany; [Ibarreta, Dolores] European Commiss, JRC, Seville, Spain; [Liu, Junguo] South Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xinxin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Nottingham; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Southern University of Science & Technology; Beijing Forestry University,"Gosling, SN (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",simon.gosling@nottingham.ac.uk,"Gosling, Simon N/A-3013-2012; Liu, Junguo/B-3021-2012","Gosling, Simon N/0000-0001-5973-6862; Liu, Junguo/0000-0002-5745-6311",European Commission Joint Research Centre [154858-2015 A08-GB]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41625001],European Commission Joint Research Centre(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank E.

We develop a multinomial logit model of farmer's choice of crops. Estimating the model across 949 farmers in seven countries, we find that both temperature and precipitation affect the crops that South American farmers choose. Farmers choose fruits and vegetables in warmer locations and wheat and potatoes in cooler locations. Farms in wetter locations are more likely to grow rice, fruits, potatoes, and squash and in dryer locations maize and wheat. Global warming will cause South American farmers to switch away from maize, wheat, and potatoes towards squash, fruits and vegetables. Predictions of the impact of climate change on net revenue must reflect not only changes in yields per crop but also crop switching. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Seo, S.

With 18,422 comments by 5715 commenters from 2010 through 2021, we parse discourse through content analysis in a well-being framework and capture trends in principal component analysis. Climate change becomes more prominent in discourse with the impacts of extreme marine heatwaves. However, attribution and cognitive dissonance processes result in entrenchment of polarizing viewpoints between user groups on fisheries allocations and enhancements. Yet some adaptation pathways emerge that bridge fishing identities with empowered conservation.

Use of metrics as assessment tools in water security and climate adaptation is an important field, with the potential to inform sustainable management policy. Reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability are used as indicators to define the system's performance against supply. The results indicate from the pre-Accord period to the post-Accord period, the reliability of Guddu Barrage (the upstream-most barrage in the study) is not changed. However, at Sukkur and Kotri, the most downstream barrage in the study, reliability has significantly decreased.

Through a review of climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction literature, this article takes the position that the advancement of procedurally just adaptive planning should engage a dynamic framing of vulnerability that brings together aspects of both contextual and outcome vulnerability in order to support ongoing adaptation planning efforts that include the acknowledgement and representation of a full range of stakeholders. To illustrate this position, a case study of the City of Boston's resilience plans is presented to explore the strengths and weaknesses of current planning practices that vary in their static and dynamic conceptualization of vulnerability and participatory planning processes.

Unfortunately, the Brazilian coffee production is threatened by high temperatures projected by climate change models. We evaluated three schemes of low levels of shade, which avoid the loss of production, as a strategy to adapt coffee to possible climate change. Additionally, as field measurements are expensive and often difficult to implement, we used numerical simulation to complement the evaluation. The microclimate simulator software Envi-met is a computer program often used to simulate urban environments, and we tested it on agriculture design. We verified that the shaded schemes assessed in the field decreased the air temperature in 0.6 degrees C in the studied period and reduced other possible climate stressors such as wind speed, radiation and raised air humidity in the dry period. Envi-met described the studied meteorological variable cycle very well, showing that combining numerical modelling and field research may be an important tool for planning the adaptation of the coffee sector to possible climate change, allowing growers choose a proper technique for their regions and environmental conditions. Finally, we highlighted the importance of planning the shade scheme on coffee areas in an interdisciplinary approach, including local climate evaluation to achieve a balance between temperature attenuation and production.","[Coltri, Priscila Pereira; Pinto, Hilton Silveira; do Valle Goncalves, Renata Ribeiro; Zullo Junior, Jurandir] Univ Estadual Campinas, UNICAMP, Ctr Meteorol & Climate Res Appl Agr CEPAGRI, Cidade Univ Zeferino Vaz, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Dubreuil, Vincent] Rennes 2 Univ, Rennes, France; [Pinto, Hilton Silveira; Zullo Junior, Jurandir] Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev CNPq, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universite de Rennes,"Coltri, PP (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, UNICAMP, Ctr Meteorol & Climate Res Appl Agr CEPAGRI, Cidade Univ Zeferino Vaz, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",pcoltri@unicamp.br,"Coltri, Priscila Pereira/AAS-3382-2020; Junior, Jurandir Zullo/J-8292-2012","Coltri, Priscila Pereira/0000-0002-0807-3410; dubreuil, vincent/0000-0001-8383-805X",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); EMBRAPA CAFE; Consorcio de Pesquisa do Cafe; FAPESP - Sao Paulo Research Foundation,National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); EMBRAPA CAFE(Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA)); Consorcio de Pesquisa do Cafe; FAPESP - Sao Paulo Research Foundation(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"This work was supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), the EMBRAPA CAFE and Consorcio de Pesquisa do Cafe and the FAPESP - Sao Paulo Research Foundation.",,61,10,11,0,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,FEB,2019,5,2,,,,,,,e01263,10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01263,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01263,,,27,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,HN3KM,30891512,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000460082200077,View Full Record in Web of Science

While alarming, this news has mobilized nations, cities, and communities across the world to engage in an array of mitigation and adaptation activities. Our research focuses on San Diego County, CA, USA, to answer two major questions regarding mitigation and adaptation measures being taken in the region: (1) What climate change mitigation and adaptation activities have taken place, are underway, and are planned for the future in San Diego County? (2) How successful and effective have these activities been at meeting their objectives to mitigate climate change or adapt to the impacts of climate change? Through a mixed-methods online survey, we gathered responses from 28 climate change experts throughout San Diego County to ensure a cross-sectoral perspective of the actions being taken. Results document 39 different mitigation and/or adaptation activities taking place in San Diego County.

However, the effectiveness of projects was not uniform across sectors, and respondents also highlighted challenges and areas for improvement.

In areas where impacts are likely to be severe, migration is considered to be an adaptation option. In Bangladesh coastal areas migration due to climate change is contingent on people's freedom of choice at individual and household level. Following Amartya Sen's capability approach, we argue that there should be a line drawn between migrations by free choice versus forced migration. Sen's capability approach focuses on the importance of people's freedom of choice to act, and the ability to achieve what they consider valuable in their life. In this paper, we use an extensive empirical work engaging 22 focus groups discussions (8-12 individuals in each group) and 14 Key Informants Interviews in South-West Bangladesh to elicit how freedom of choice changes with the economic class and social status of an individual. Using these data we apply Sen's capability approach to understand the role of the freedom of choice when considering migration as an adaptation option. We argue that the capability approach is essential in revealing a thin border between migration as a (planned) adaptation option and forced migration.","[Assaduzzaman, Mohammad; Filatova, Tatiana; Coenen, Frans] Univ Twente, Fac Behav Management & Social Sci, Enschede, Netherlands; [Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Technol, Fac Engn & IT, Sch Informat Syst & Modelling, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lovett, Jon] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Twente; University of Technology Sydney; University of Leeds,"Assaduzzaman, M (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Behav Management & Social Sci, Enschede, Netherlands.",m.assaduzzaman@utwente.nl,"Coenen, Frans/AFV-5780-2022","Coenen, Frans/0000-0003-1709-0228; Lovett, Jonathan/0000-0002-5839-3770",,,,,53,5,5,3,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,1745-2627,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

The focus is in particular on individuals' adaptation to temperature changes. The authors analyze the relationship between climatic change (measured by temperature rate) and mortality in 23 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries during 1970-2010. Design/methodology/approach This study performs the adaptation regression model in the level form as a dynamic panel fixed effects model. The authors use a non-linear threshold estimation approach to examine the extreme temperature changes effect on the temperature-mortality relation. More specifically, the study explores whether the large increases/decreases in temperature rates affect mortality rates more than the modest changes. Findings This study indicates that the temperature-mortality relation is significant in early part of the sample period (before 1990) but insignificant during the second part (after 1990). After including controlling factors, as well as nation and year fixed effects, the authors provide evidence that people do adapt to the most of the temperature-related mortalities. Also, this study provides evidence of the non-linear relationship between national temperatures and mortality rates. It is observed that only after 5 per cent increase in the annual temperature, the relation between temperature and overall mortality is significant. Originality/value Most studies cover only one specific country, hence making it difficult to generalize across countries. Therefore, the authors argue that the best estimation of the health effects of temperature change can be found by modeling the past relationships between temperature and mortality across countries for a relatively long period. To the authors' knowledge, previous studies have not systemically tested the adaptation effect across countries.","[Korhonen, Marko; Kangasraasio, Suvi; Svento, Rauli] Univ Oulu, Sch Econ, Oulu, Finland",University of Oulu,"Korhonen, M (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Sch Econ, Oulu, Finland.",marko.korhonen@oulu.fi,,"Kangasraasio, Suvi/0000-0001-6812-5254; Korhonen, Marko/0000-0002-7632-3020",,,,,24,5,5,1,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

These climate organizations work across many boundaries in science, politics, and culture. This article asks how large-scale U.S. climate boundary organizations that convene Indigenous and non-Indigenous climate practitioners contend with ongoing colonialism. Analysis indicates that Indigenous-settler networks offer avenues for Indigenous values to be practiced in collaborative climate science. Such organizations also provide limited opportunities to utilize climate science in tribal climate adaptation. While these boundary organizations aim to build meaningful cross-cultural and mentoring relationships, uneven power dynamics and resources also permeate the partnerships. These structural inequalities cause tensions to arise. Tensions further arise from uses of new terminology to navigate longstanding struggles over places, political sovereignties, and human relationships to natural worlds. I argue that a decolonial environmental framework discerns roles for Indigenous governance in attending to anthropogenic climate change.

This pattern is anticipated to affect a range of services derived from river ecosystems and consecutively deteriorate the sectoral outputs and household welfare. This paper aims to evaluate local residents' adaptation preferences for the Piave River basin in Italy. A Discrete Choice Experiment accounting for adaptation scenarios of the Piave River services was conducted and the collected data were econometrically analyzed using Random Parameters Logit, Latent Class and Covariance Heterogeneity models. In terms of policy-relevant outcomes, the analysis indicates that respondents are willing to pay for adaptation plans. This attitude is reflected on the compensating surplus to sustain the current state of the Piave, which corresponds to a monthly contribution of 80(sic) per household. From an econometric point of view, the results show that it is not sufficient to take solely into account general heterogeneity, provided that distinct treatment of the heterogeneity produces rather different welfare estimates. This implies that analysts should examine a set of criteria when deciding on how to better approach heterogeneity for each empirical data set. Overall, non-market values of environmental services should be considered when formulating cost-effective adaptation measures for river systems undergoing climate change effects and appropriate heterogeneity approximation could render these values unbiased and accurate.

J.; Izac, A. -M.",,,The role of agronomic research in climate change and food security policy,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; adaptation; environmental feedbacks; food security,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; ELEVATED CO2; SYSTEMS,"Societal concern is growing about the consequences of climate change for food systems and, in a number of regions. for food security. There is also concern that meeting the rising demand for food is leading to environmental degradation thereby exacerbating factors in part responsible for climate change. and further undermining the food systems upon which food security is based, A major emphasis of climate change/food security research over recent years has addressed the agronomic aspects of climate change, and particularly crop yield. This has provided an excellent foundation for assessments of how climate change may affect crop productivity, but the connectivity between these results and the broader issues of food security at large are relatively poorly explored; too often discussions of food security policy appear to be based on a relatively narrow agronomic perspective. To overcome the limitation of current agronomic research outputs there are several scientific challenges where further agronomic effort is necessary, and where agronomic research results can effectively contribute to the broader issues underlying food security. First is the need to better understand how climate change will affect cropping systems including both direct effects on the crops themselves and indirect effects as a result of changed pest and weed dynamics and altered soil and water conditions. Second is the need to assess technical and policy options for either reducing the deleterious impacts or enhancing the benefits of climate change on cropping systems while minimising further environmental degradation. Third is the need to understand how best to address the information needs of policy makers and report and communicate agronomic research results in a manner that will assist the development of food systems adapted to climate change. There are, however, two important considerations regarding these agronomic research contributions to the food security/climate change debate. The first concerns scale. Agronomic research has traditionally been conducted at plot scale over a growing season or perhaps a few years, but many of the issues related to food security operate at larger spatial and temporal scales. Over the last decade, agronomists have begun to establish trials at landscape scale, but there are a number of methodological challenges to be overcome at such scales. The second concerns the position of crop production (which is a primary focus of agronomic research) in the broader context of food security. Production is clearly important, but food distribution and exchange also determine food availability while access to food and food utilisation are other important components of food security. Therefore, while agronomic research alone cannot address all food security/climate change issues (and hence the balance of investment in research and development for crop production vis vis other aspects of food security needs to be assessed), it will nevertheless continue to have an important role to play: it both improves understanding of the impacts of climate change on crop production and helps to develop adaptation options; and also - and crucially - it improves understanding of the consequences of different adaptation options on further climate forcing. This role can further be strengthened if agronomists work alongside other scientists to develop adaptation options that are not only effective in terms of crop production, but are also environmentally and economically robust, at landscape and regional scales. Furthermore, such integrated approaches to adaptation research are much more likely to address the information need of policy makers.

Land-use optimization can effectively cope with these hazards. However, the trade-offs between multi-hazard mitigation and economic development impose many limitations in practice. Furthermore, current region-based optimization methods no longer meet the precise management demand, and both subdivision and spatial heterogeneity identification have the potential for wider applicability. Hence, a systematic integration of climate adaptation and urban construction through land-use planning is urgently required. This paper proposes a new land-use decision approach for improving climate adaptability of urbanization. This approach involves multi-objective optimization, spatial subdivision, and urbanization stage identification, which enable the simultaneous achievement of environmental and economic benefits. Taking Xiamen as case study, the results showed that excessive pursuit of land economic output (LEO) limits the chance of mitigating UHI and USF. Improving the LEO per unit area of construction land could disrupt the link between land exploitation and the increasing side effects of climate hazards. Future urbanization hotspots in Xiamen will likely emerge at the urban fringe in Tong'an District and Xiang'an District. Within each developing unit, the upper limit of construction land was 81.06 hm(2) and the green space was recommended to be 7.29-21.94 hm(2). Construction land and bare land contributed most to UHI and USF, while forest and grassland were highly efficient in heat and runoff mitigation. The developed approach proved to be effective and practica-ble, especially for reducing the impacts of extreme UHI and USF. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

It argues that cash transfers are likely to contribute to adaptive capacity by (1) meeting basic needs; (2) helping the poor respond to climate-related shocks; (3) helping vulnerable households to manage risk and consider investment innovations that increase their adaptive capacity; (4) transferring money for investment in long-term adaptive capacity development; and (5) facilitating mobility and livelihood transitions. While the article acknowledges that cash transfers cannot address all areas of adaptation, these transfers may be a prerequisite for further adaptation to be equitable and effective. When compared with other adaptation options, cash transfers fare well as they are supported by a substantial evidence base, do not require much climate-related information, have a demonstrated potential for scaling up and are likely to gain local acceptance.","[Wood, Rachel Godfrey] IIED, London, England; [Wood, Rachel Godfrey] IDS, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Wood, RG (corresponding author), IIED, London, England.",,,,,,,,26,14,14,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0265-5012,,,IDS BULL-I DEV STUD,IDS Bull.-Inst.

Health authorities require information about current associations between health outcomes and weather or climate, vulnerable populations, projections of future risks and adaptation opportunities in order to reduce exposures, empower individuals to take needed protective actions and build climate-resilient health systems. An increasing number of health authorities from local to national levels seek this information by conducting climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments. While assessments can provide valuable information to plan for climate change impacts, the results of many studies are not helping to build the global evidence-base of knowledge in this area. They are also often not integrated into adaptation decision making, sometimes because the health sector is not involved in climate change policy making processes at the national level. Significant barriers related to data accessibility, a limited number of climate and health models, uncertainty in climate projections, and a lack of funding and expertise, particularly in developing countries, challenge health authority efforts to conduct rigorous assessments and apply the findings. This paper examines the evolution of climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments, including guidance developed for such projects, the number of assessments that have been conducted globally and implementation of the findings to support health adaptation action. Greater capacity building that facilitates assessments from local to national scales will support collaborative efforts to protect health from current climate hazards and future climate change. Health sector officials will benefit from additional resources and partnership opportunities to ensure that evidence about climate change impacts on health is effectively translated into needed actions to build health resilience.","[Berry, Peter; Enright, Paddy M.] Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Shumake-Guillemot, Joy] WMO WHO Climate & Hlth Off, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Prats, Elena Villalobos; Campbell-Lendrum, Diarmid] WHO, Climate Change & Hlth Unit, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",University of Waterloo; World Health Organization,"Enright, PM (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",pberry@uwaterloo.ca; pmenright@uwaterloo.ca; jshumake-guillemot@wmo.int; villalobose@who.int; campbelllendrumd@who.int,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Villalobos Prats, Elena/0000-0001-7638-8433",,,,,88,30,30,9,40,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

However, few studies have assessed the course of adaptation along with the progress of climate change in each of the current major food producing countries. Adaptation pathways, which describe the temporal sequences of adaptations, are helpful for illustrating the timing and intensity of the adaptation required. Here we present adaptation pathways in the current major wheat-producing countries, based on sequential introduction of the minimum adaptation measures necessary to maintain current wheat yields through the 21st century. We considered two adaptation options: (i) expanding irrigation infrastructure; and (ii) switching crop varieties and developing new heat-tolerant varieties. We find that the adaptation pathways differ markedly among the countries. The adaptation pathways are sensitive to both the climate model uncertainty and natural variability of the climate system, and the degree of sensitivity differs among countries. Finally, the negative impacts of climate change could be moderated by implementing adaptations steadily according to forecasts of the necessary future adaptations, as compared to missing the appropriate timing to implement adaptations.","[Tanaka, Akemi; Takahashi, Kiyoshi; Hijioka, Yasuaki] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Masutomi, Yuji] Ibaraki Univ, Coll Agr, Inashiki, Ibaraki 3000393, Japan; [Hanasaki, Naota; Shiogama, Hideo] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Yamanaka, Yasuhiro] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Ibaraki University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Hokkaido University,"Tanaka, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",tanaka.akemi@nies.go.jp,"Shiogama, Hideo/B-9598-2012; Hanasaki, Naota/C-2932-2009; TAKAHASHI, KIYOSHI/AAD-5992-2019; Hijioka, Yasuaki/AAQ-7586-2020; Yamanaka, Yasuhiro/H-7393-2012","Shiogama, Hideo/0000-0001-5476-2148; Hanasaki, Naota/0000-0002-5092-7563; TAKAHASHI, KIYOSHI/0000-0002-0163-545X; Yamanaka, Yasuhiro/0000-0003-3369-3248","Environmental Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [S-10-1]","Environmental Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan","This study was supported by the Environmental Research and Technology Development Fund (S-10-1) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.",,26,27,27,0,46,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,SEP 16,2015,5,,,,,,,,14312,10.1038/srep14312,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep14312,,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,CR4HY,26373877,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000361294000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, resilience is used to explore the layers of responses to past and present climate stress. It examines the factors and circumstances that may hinder or enhance resilience, providing insights into past and present adaptation processes that may be relevant for adaptation to future climate change. Specifically, this paper tests the value of social capital in influencing resilience to climate stress. While there are many examples where social capital influences resilience to climate stress, this paper aims to determine the relative importance of different types of social capital for enhancing resilience, by exploring how relationships of exchange and reciprocity influence responses to climate stress. This study involved case studies of specific communities in the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh. This case study highlights a complex rather than a uniformly positive relationship between social capital and enhancing resilience to climate stress. Specifically, it identifies four types of social capital-based support (with monetary support as a subset) and the interlinkages among the types (and processes) of social capital with diverse effects on resilience. It emphasizes the moral and ethical importance of reconceptualizing resilience with an emphasis on the most vulnerable, as resilience approaches that fail to recognize the differentiated nature of resilience, risk reinforcing vulnerability. Westernized concepts have important benefits, but crucial limitations when applied to the particular conditions, value sets and modes of community working in the south. The uncritical importation of social capital needs to be treated with caution, especially in the context of climate adaptation.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Planning Architecture & Civil Engn, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast,"Jordan, JC (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Planning Architecture & Civil Engn, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",joanne.jordan@manchester.ac.uk,,"Jordan, Joanne/0000-0002-2085-827X",,,,,47,41,42,4,46,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

We used risk-based deliberation, through workshops, with climate scenario-based fire and flood impact modeling to evaluate risk and adaptation opportunities at bases in the southwestern United States. We found that success in working with Defense installations hinges on linking risks of increasing climate-related impacts to DoD's ability to achieve its mission objectives at installations.

With climate change, saltwater is shifting landward into regions that previously have not experienced or adapted to salinity, leading to novel transitions in biogeochemistry, ecology, and human land uses. We explore these changes and their implications for climate adaptation in coastal ecosystems. Biogeochemical changes, including increases in ionic strength, sulfidation, and alkalinization, have cascading ecological consequences such as upland forest retreat, conversion of freshwater wetlands, nutrient mobilization, and declines in agricultural productivity. We explore the trade-offs among land management decisions in response to these changes and how public policy should shape socioecological transitions in the coastal zone. Understanding transitions resulting from saltwater intrusion-and how to manage them-is vital for promoting coastal resilience.","[Tully, Kate] Univ Maryland, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, Agroecol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Gedan, Keryn] George Washington Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Epanchin-Niell, Rebecca] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Strong, Aaron] Hamilton Coll, Clinton, NY 13323 USA; [Bernhardt, Emily S.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC USA; [Mitchell, Molly] Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Williamsburg, VA USA; [Kominoski, John] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Jordan, Thomas E.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Neubauer, Scott C.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Weston, Nathaniel B.] Villanova Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Bendor, Todd] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; George Washington University; Resources for the Future; Hamilton College; Duke University; William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center; Virginia Commonwealth University; Villanova University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Tully, K (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, Agroecol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",kltully@umd.edu,"Bernhardt, Emily S/D-9940-2011; Bernhardt, Emily/B-4541-2010; Kominoski, John Stephen/A-5907-2008; Gedan, Keryn/A-3575-2010","Bernhardt, Emily S/0000-0003-3031-621X; Kominoski, John Stephen/0000-0002-0978-3326; Gedan, Keryn/0000-0003-4020-5441","National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) - National Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1639145]; NSF Coastal SEES grant [1426802]; United States Department of Agriculture National Institute for Food and Agriculture Resilient Agroecosystems in a Changing Climate Challenge Area [12451226, 1015143]; Harry R.

Sustainable Land Management (SLM) practices are increasingly promoted to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, but there is lack of evidence at scales most relevant for policymaking. We evaluated the effectiveness of SLM in a large Mediterranean catchment where climate change is projected to significantly reduce water security. We show that the on-site and off-site impacts of climate change are almost entirely reversed by the large-scale implementation of SLM under moderate climate change conditions, characterized by limited reductions in annual precipitation but significant increased precipitation intensity. Under more extreme reductions of annual precipitation, SLM implementation reduces the impacts on water security, but cannot prevent significant increased plant water stress and reduced water availability. Under these conditions, additional adaptation measures are required considering their interactions and trade-offs regarding water security. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Eekhout, J.

Insufficient attention has been paid to relational dynamics between multiple levels of governance, and related learning networks outside formal government structures, particularly in the context of development imperatives in poor countries. This paper illustrates these issues via an exploration of relations between two contiguous, yet contrasting local authorities in South Africa and between these local authorities and higher government levels and other networks. To date, most progressive local climate change initiatives have been undertaken autonomously and often there are mismatched priorities between different government spheres regarding climate change efforts. The likely implications for the execution of environmental change adaptation actions and the benefits of effective networking are considered in this light and through deploying conceptual insights from multilevel governance, systems approaches to urban governance and other literatures.","[Leck, Hayley; Simon, David] Univ London, Dept Geog, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Leck, H (corresponding author), Univ London, Dept Geog, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",Hayley.Leck.2008@live.rhul.ac.uk; d.simon@rhul.ac.uk,,"Simon, David/0000-0002-3164-4138","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1229429] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,51,88,88,1,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,MAY,2013,50,6,,,,,1221,1238,,10.1177/0042098012461675,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0042098012461675,,,18,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,142LA,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000318797600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

When coupled with sea level rise (SLR), poor urban development design, and loss of habitats, severe flooding often impacts the coastal zone. In order to protect citizens and adapt to a changing climate, national and local governments need to investigate their coastal vulnerability and climate change risks. To assess flood and inundation risk, some of the critical data are topography, bathymetry, and socio-economic. We review the datasets available for these parameters in Jamaica (and specifically Old Harbour Bay) and assess their pros and cons in terms of resolution and costs. We then examine how their use can affect the evaluation of the number of people and the value of infrastructure flooded in a typical sea level rise/flooding assessment. We find that there can be more than a three-fold difference in the estimate of people and property flooded under 3m SLR. We present an inventory of available environmental and economic datasets for modeling storm surge/SLR impacts and ecosystem-based coastal protection benefits at varying scales. We emphasize the importance of the careful selection of the appropriately scaled data for use in models that will inform climate adaptation planning, especially when considering sea level rise, in the coastal zone. Without a proper understanding of data needs and limitations, project developers and decision-makers overvalue investments in adaptation science which do not necessarily translate into effective adaptation implementation. Applying these datasets to estimate sea level rise and storm surge in an adaptation project in Jamaica, we found that less costly and lower resolution data and models provide up to three times lower coastal risk estimates than more expensive data and models, indicating that investments in better resolution digital elevation mapping (DEM) data are needed for targeted local-level decisions. However, we also identify that, with this general rule of thumb in mind, cost-effective, national data can be used by planners in the absence of high-resolution data to support adaptation action planning, possibly saving critical climate adaptation budgets for project implementation.","[Acosta-Morel, Montserrat; McNulty, Valerie Pietsch; Lummen, Natainia; Schill, Steven R.] Nature Conservancy, Caribbean Div, Coral Gables, FL 33134 USA; [Beck, Michael W.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95062 USA",Nature Conservancy; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Acosta-Morel, M (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, Caribbean Div, Coral Gables, FL 33134 USA.",m.acosta-morel@tnc.org; valerie.mcnulty@tnc.org; natainia.lummen@tnc.org; sschill@tnc.org; mwbeck@ucsc.edu,,"Beck, Michael/0000-0002-5107-9973; Schill, Steven R/0000-0002-9066-434X; Pietsch McNulty, Valerie/0000-0002-4906-7586; Acosta Morel, Montserrat/0000-0002-4902-3743","International Climate Initiative (IKI); Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU)","International Climate Initiative (IKI); Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU)","This research was funded by the International Climate Initiative (IKI).

These strategies include infrastructural changes to agricultural businesses, changes to practices, and the adoption of new skills and knowledge. The transition towards greater drought adaptiveness will also demand broader cultural shifts in the way that drought is defined and approached as an issue facing primary producers. This paper presents the results of a discourse analysis conducted as part of social research exploring the cultural barriers to drought preparedness within the Queensland Government's Drought and Climate Adaptation Program (DCAP). Focusing on media and government accounts, the analysis found two different ways of framing drought and its management in Queensland agriculture. The first, which is dominant in media accounts, emphasises the disruptive power of drought, presenting it as a profound difficulty for producers that is managed using endurance, hope and ingenuity. This frame adopts highly evocative discursive strategies oriented towards mobilising community sentiment and support for producers. The second, which is less prominent overall, downplays drought's disruptive power and counters the emotionality of the adversity discourse by presenting drought as a neutral business risk that can be managed using rational planning skills and scientific knowledge. In discussing these two frames, this paper suggests strategies whereby drought adaptation frames might be made more powerful using more meaningful and emotive narratives that showcase it as a vital practice for ensuring agricultural livelihoods and rural futures in a changing climate.","[Paxton, Gillian] Queensland Dept Environm & Sci, 41 Boggo Rd, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia; [Paxton, Gillian] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Paxton, G (corresponding author), Queensland Dept Environm & Sci, 41 Boggo Rd, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia.;Paxton, G (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",Gillian.L.Paxton@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Paxton, Gillian/0000-0002-4688-0838",Queensland Drought and Climate Adaptation Program,Queensland Drought and Climate Adaptation Program,"This research was conducted by the author as a Senior Social Scientist with the Queensland Department of Environment and Science.

In order to address this matter, different values of thermal transmittance (opaque and transparent), window to floor ratio, window distribution, shape factor, diurnal heat storage capacity, external opaque surface solar absorptivity and natural ventilation cooling rates were combined in 496,800 building energy models, which were simulated at eight locations. Because buildings are in use for many decades, the energy use simulations were made considering the projected climate change up to the end of the 21st century. The results delivered a set of the most effective passive design measures for achieving low energy use in buildings regarding climate type and period. A lower window to floor ratio was identified as the most universally applicable design measure to counterbalance the projected effect of a warming climate. In contrast, other measures vary according to climate type and studied period. Furthermore, it was concluded that it is difficult to neutralise the projected climate change effects on buildings' energy use, even when applying the best performing combination of passive design measures. However, reasonably low energy use can still be assured solely by passive building design, especially in oceanic, warm, and some temperate climate locations. Therefore, the identified trends in energy use and passive design measures represent the foundation for strategies and guidelines aimed at future-proof energy-efficient buildings.","[Pajek, Luka; Kosir, Mitja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Jamova 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Kosir, M (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Jamova 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",luka.pajek@fgg.uni-lj.si; mitja.kosir@fgg.uni-lj.si,"Košir, Mitja/ABB-1491-2021; Pajek, Luka/AAT-6487-2020","Pajek, Luka/0000-0002-7758-2104",Slovenian Research Agency [P2 - 0158],Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),"The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Slovenian Research Agency (research core funding No. P2 - 0158).

Since the country is one of the most inefficient energy users in Europe, improving the energy efficiency of buildings is essential. Therefore, the study implemented a novel multi-aspect approach to energy retrofitting, linking building thermal performance, occupant interaction and climate change. A representative existing multi-apartment building in Podgorica was selected, and a survey among occupants was conducted to identify their satisfaction with indoor thermal comfort and to evaluate the acceptability of the proposed energy retrofit measures. Next, the thermal performance of the building was simulated under current and future climate conditions. Finally, a comprehensive parametric analysis was performed by applying different retrofit sce-narios. The selected retrofit measures were evaluated based on their impact on energy efficiency and occupant acceptability. The results showed that the most impactful retrofit measure would be thermally insulating the building envelope, followed by a lower shading set-point and natural ventilation cooling. Applying the best retrofit combinations would reduce the total energy de-mand by 75% under the current climate and by 66% and 59% at the end of the 21st century under the RCP4.5 or RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. However, the occupant survey results disclosed that beyond thermally insulating the building, occupants have limited awareness about the potential of energy retrofit actions, while summer thermal discomfort is the dominant issue. Therefore, building energy retrofit and climate adaptability actions should also address occupant views.","[Pajek, Luka; Kosir, Mitja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Jamova 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Jevric, Marija; Cipranic, Ivana] Univ Montenegro, Fac Civil Engn, Dzordz Vasingtona bb, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro",University of Ljubljana; University of Montenegro,"Kosir, M (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Jamova 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",luka.pajek@fgg.uni-lj.si; marijaj@ucg.ac.me; ivanac@ucg.ac.me; mitja.kosir@fgg.uni-lj.si,,"Cipranic, Ivana/0000-0002-6081-3965; Jevric, Marija/0000-0003-3058-8469",Slovenian Research Agency; Ministry of Science and Technological Development of Montenegro;  [P2-0158];  [BI-ME/21-22-012],Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); Ministry of Science and Technological Development of Montenegro; ; ,"Acknowledgements Research presented in this paper is the result of bilateral cooperation funded by the Slovenian Research Agency and the Ministry of Science and Technological Development of Montenegro (project No. BI-ME/21-22-012) .

The revolution in internet access, technology and costs has led to a shift from using traditional paper-based data collection to the use of Mobile Data Collection using Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) such as smartphones and tablets. In this paper, we report our experiences using both approaches for a household and business survey during a climate adaptation study in two Nigerian cities-Makurdi and Calabar. The focus of this paper is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of using traditional paper-based data collection and PDAs as data collection tools for climate change study in African societies. In Calabar, data were collected using paper questionnaires, while in Makurdi the questionnaires were developed on Open Data Kit (ODK) and administered using PDAs. Results show that data collection using PDA was faster, cheaper, more accurate and resulted in fewer omissions than paper-based data collection. There was a time saving of four (4) minutes per questionnaire and a 24% cost saving when using PDA. PDA provides additional benefits where platforms can collect images, videos and coordinates. This significantly improved the credibility of the data collection process and provided further data that allowed for the mapping of environmental phenomena by linking survey research with geo-referenced data in a geographic information systems platform to provide spatial representations of social and environmental system convergence. PDA offers a tool for collecting data that will make necessary socio-environmental data available in a faster, reliable and cheaper manner; future research can build on this study by discovering other possible but less highlighted benefits of PDA. Although, with great benefits, there are lessons to be learnt and issues to consider when deploying PDA in large-scale household surveys.","[Adekola, Olalekan; Lamond, Jessica; Bhattacharya-Mis, Namrata] Univ West England, Ctr Floods Communities & Resilience, Bristol, Avon, England; [Adekola, Olalekan] York St John Univ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Adelekan, Ibidun] Univ Ibadan, Dept Geog, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Bhattacharya-Mis, Namrata] Univ Chester, Chester, Cheshire, England; [Ekinya, Mboto; Eze, Eze Bassey] Univ Calabar, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, Calabar, Nigeria; [Ujoh, Fanan] Urban Base Consulting, Abuja, Nigeria",University of West England; York Saint John University; University of Ibadan; University of Chester; University of Calabar,"Adekola, O (corresponding author), York St John Univ, Dept Geog, York YO31 7EX, N Yorkshire, England.",o.adekola@yorksj.ac.uk,"Adelekan, Ibidun O./H-3735-2019","Adelekan, Ibidun O./0000-0002-3407-8549; Mis, Namrata Bhattacharya/0000-0003-4967-8325; Ujoh, Fanan/0000-0003-2554-0815; Adekola, Olalekan/0000-0001-9747-0583",Department for International Development,Department for International Development,Department for International Development,,40,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2049-6060,,,GEOSCI DATA J,Geosci.

This research uses the Acadian dykelands of Nova Scotia, Canada, as an opportunity to explore the social and governance limits to coastal climate adaptation in 'new world' cultural agricultural landscapes, as well as inform local decision-making. Approximately half of Nova Scotia's coastal wetlands were converted to dykeland in the 1600s, lowering local resilience to the increased frequency and storm severity anticipated with climate change. Today, dykelands protect a diversity of public and private interests, meanings and values, yet are controlled by the agricultural sector, which can no longer afford to maintain them all to 2050 climate projections. We report here on a representative online Q-methodology survey of 183 adult Nova Scotians in the spring of 2015. Respondents sorted 34 statements along a normal distribution about whether they prefer dykeland maintenance or wetland restoration, and under what governance arrangements. Four factors were derived: the dominant discourse was local, female and strongly pro-dykeland, indicating the likelihood for local resistance to dykeland removal on for cultural, recreational and farming reasons. The second factor was supportive of wetland restoration for reasons of efficiency, not wetland affinity, but characterized by those in positions of management power. The two minority viewpoints were less informed about dykelands, characteristic of outsiders, and concerned more with governance. More education is needed about the challenges facing dykelands, the benefits of coastal wetlands, and the management options, but this research shows proposals to change landscape should emphasize flood mitigation over cost-saving. Cultural values and status quo bias are clearly barriers to adaptation planning, even when discussing the removal of man-made structures. The factors were surprisingly polarized, suggesting the forced-normal distribution affects the space available to convey nuanced perspectives. Large p-set Q-method of this kind is likely most useful for characterizing the emergent discourses demographically, and understanding their prevalence; the same discourses had emerged within a much smaller pilot study.

Significant weather aberrations in form of the uneven precipitation pattern, more frequent and intense occurrence of temperature fluctuations accompanied by changes in wind intensity and frequency, amount of clouds, intensity and quality of sunlight can be expected. Maybe the most vulnerable sector affected by CC is agriculture. So, it is important to mitigate and adapt to a new situation through different and most adaptable agricultural strategies. Accordingly, scientists, experts, politicians, decision-makers, and others increasingly emphasize the need for further development of sustainable agricultural production, whose management will be compatible with different ecosystems (agroecosystem compliance with global ecosystems), while simultaneously restoring degraded agricultural land. One of the best solutions for sustainable agricultural production, under CC conditions, can be Conservation agriculture. Climate change is not only an abstraction, which is why one of the most important roles of conservation agriculture today is its ability to adapt and mitigate these changes. The basis of conservation agriculture production is in management set on three fundamental postulates, which contextually unify climate-soil-plant, while respecting agroecological and socio-economic differences.","[Jug, D.; Jug, I; Brozovic, B.; Vukadinovic, V.; Stipesevic, B.; Durdevic, B.] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Agr Osijek, Vladimira Preloga 1, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Jug, D (corresponding author), Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Agr Osijek, Vladimira Preloga 1, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",djug@pfos.hr,"Jug, Danijel/AAH-5154-2020; Durdevic, Boris/W-3347-2019; Jug, Irena/AAC-4575-2019","Durdevic, Boris/0000-0003-0623-9437; Jug, Irena/0000-0001-6957-4801",,,,,68,24,25,3,27,FAC AGRICULTURE OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"TRG SV TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1330-7142,1848-8080,,POLJOPRIVREDA,Poljoprivreda,,2018,24,1,,,,,35,44,,10.18047/poljo.24.1.5,http://dx.doi.org/10.18047/poljo.24.1.5,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture,GM5PN,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000438192400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Rice is the main staple food for the population in the lower Mekong Basin and the demand for food is expected to grow due to increase in population. This paper examines the impact of climate change on rice production in the lower Mekong Basin, evaluates some widely used adaptation options, and analyses their implications for overall food security by 2050. Climate change data used in the study are the future climate projection for two IPCC SRES scenarios, A2 and B2, based on ECHAM4 General Circulation Model downscaled to the Mekong region using the PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies) system. In general, the results suggest that yield of rainfed rice may increase significantly in the upper part of the basin in Laos and Thailand and may decrease in the lower part of the basin in Cambodia and Vietnam. Irrigated rice may not be affected by climate change if increased irrigation requirements are met. Negative impact on the yield of rainfed rice can be offset and net increase in yield can be achieved by applying widely used adaptation options such as changing planting date, supplementary irrigation and increased fertilizer input. Analysis of the projected production, considering population growth by 2050, suggests that food security of the basin is unlikely to be threatened by the increased population and climate change, excluding extreme events such as sea level rise and cyclones.","[Mainuddin, Mohammed; Kirby, Mac] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Hoanh, Chu Thai] SE Asia Reg Off, Int Water Management Inst, Viangchan, Laos",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Mainuddin, M (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, GPO Box 1666, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Mohammed.Mainuddin@csiro.au; Mac.Kirby@csiro.au; c.t.hoanh@cgiar.org,"Mainuddin, Mohammed/I-8667-2012; Kirby, John M/D-2249-2013","Mainuddin, Mohammed/0000-0002-6057-5688; ",AusAID,AusAID(Australian Aid (AusAID)),The authors express their sincere thanks to AusAID for funding this study and to SEA START RC for the provision of using PRECIS climate data.

It found that 1) thermal performances between and within parks range widely, and 2) critical thermal points in the respective parks highlight the value of shade, especially in terms of volume and continuity over a length of path.

They have been investing in adaptation measures to mitigate potential disaster damages. This paper proposes an economic model to examine the inter-port competition in adaptation investments when ports face asymmetric disaster losses. Specifically, we model the trading mechanism of the adaptation resources among different ports, and benchmark the outcomes with the widely used adaptation subsidy policies. Our analytical results suggest that with adaptation trading under the minimum requirement policy, the port facing the low disaster loss sells adaptation resources to the port facing the high disaster loss, allowing the latter to cover all its disaster loss. Subsidy policy is pro-competitive and intensifies inter-port competition in adaptation investment and output. In comparison, adaptation trading facilitates inter-port coordination, possibly leading to port collusion. When the magnitudes of disaster damages are low, adaptation trading brings higher social welfare than the subsidy policy despite possible port collusion, leading to a Pareto improvement. When the magnitudes of disaster damages are high, the subsidy policy is preferred in terms of social welfare and port adaptation. Our model results reveal the strengths of alternative adaptation policies, and call for evaluation beyond competition effects when examining port coordination in adaptation.","[Zheng, Shiyuan] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Sch Transportat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Fu, Xiaowen] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kun] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongchang] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Shanghai Maritime University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of International Business & Economics; Beijing Jiaotong University,"Wang, K (corresponding author), Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",kunwang@uibe.edu.cn,"Zheng, sy/GRS-3136-2022","Wang, Kun/0000-0002-2137-9457","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFE0201200]; National Science Foundation of China [71774109, 72031005, 72072113]; National Social Science Foundation research project the Realization Path of Supporting the Comprehensive Construction of a Modern Country with Strong Transportation Network [21AZD019]; Soft Science Key Program of Action Plan of Technological Innovation from Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [21692108400]; DGRF from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University [P0035755]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation research project the Realization Path of Supporting the Comprehensive Construction of a Modern Country with Strong Transportation Network; Soft Science Key Program of Action Plan of Technological Innovation from Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality; DGRF from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University),"Financial supports from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFE0201200), the National Science Foundation of China (71774109, 72031005, 72072113), the National Social Science Foundation research project the Realization Path of Supporting the Comprehensive Construction of a Modern Country with Strong Transportation Network (21AZD019), the Soft Science Key Program of Action Plan of Technological Innovation from Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (21692108400), DGRF grant P0035755 (UAKR-G) from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University are gratefully acknowledged.",,67,6,6,10,27,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,1878-5794,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

It is also clear that many local governments are politically and economically constrained in their capacity to implement needed adaptations. These constraints can restrict adaptation options to incremental, or even maladaptive, practices. At the same time, necessary transformational actions may remain out of reach for local actors. Building on five years of collaborative research with the city of Flagler Beach (FL, USA), we draw on political process theories to describe how incremental adaptation activities that are possible within current constraints can serve to build local capacity for instigating reforms at higher scales of social organization. We use the concept of a collective action strategy to conceptualize how context-specific barriers to adaptation can be overcome. From our analysis, an idealized multi-step process for designing collective action strategies is presented.

Considering extreme vulnerability to the effects of climate change on prawn production, one of the adaptation strategies is to translocate prawn culture from coastal to inland (i.e., Bagerhat-Gopalganj) that appear less vulnerable to climate change. Although the prospects for prawn-carp polyculture and integrated prawn-fish-rice farming are positive in Gopalganj, a number of challenges were identified for the expansion of prawn culture.

The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into their perspective and the potential for participatory adaptation to enhance their resilience. This paper presents the results of a collaborative adaptation planning process conducted with older adults in Bridgeport, Connecticut. During two meetings, older adult participants developed recommendations following adaptation best practices. Recommendations focused on encouraging preparedness through workshops and informational materials tailored for older adults. Additional recommendations focused on enhancing community services to provide effective warning mechanisms, shelter access, ride sharing and transportation assistance, and establishing a telephone based clearinghouse for extreme weather and emergency resources for older adults. A prioritization exercise showed that the participants and city staff believed all recommendations were potentially effective and feasible. A summative evaluation showed that the participatory planning enhanced resilience by raising awareness among the older adult participants and city agencies, enhancing communication, and increasing the older adult participants' ability to self-advocate.","[Rhoades, Jason; Gruber, James] Antioch Univ New England, Dept Environm Studies, Keene, NH 03431 USA; [Horton, Bill] Dublin Sch, Dublin, NH USA",Antioch University New England,"Rhoades, J (corresponding author), Antioch Univ New England, Dept Environm Studies, Keene, NH 03431 USA.",jrhoades@antioch.edu,,"Rhoades, Jason/0000-0003-3524-1042",,,,,26,1,1,3,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6361,1547-7355,,J HOMEL SECUR EMERG,J.

The Climate Road is located at Hedensted, Denmark and is 50 m long and 8 m wide, and the depth of the roadbed is 1 m. Half of the Climate Road, i.e., 25 m, is paved with permeable asphalt and the remaining 25 m with traditional asphalt. All surface water drains into the roadbed, which stores up to 120 m(3) of water, either directly through the permeable asphalt or by drain grates. In addition, 800 m of geothermal pipes are embedded in the roadbed, distributed over four 200 m w-loops, two buried 1 m below the asphalt and two similar loops at 0.5 m depth. The Climate Road was tested from May 2019 to May 2021. In the project period, a total precipitation value of 1654 mm was recorded, the mean temperature was 9.3 degrees C and the most intense rainfall was 40.3 mm/30 min. The long-term infiltration performance of the permeable asphalt shows that the overall infiltration capacity slowly reduces. The reduction can be hindered, but not completely prevented, with annual restorative cleaning. After two years of operation, the Climate Road still, by a large margin, fulfils the recommendations of the infiltration capacity of 97.2 mm/h for the vast majority of the road section. The total volume reduction capacity is estimated to be between 15 and 30%. Based on an analysis of 61 single rain events, the event detention time is found to range between 10 and 130 min, with an average of 35 min. During the project period, the Climate Road produced a total of 98 MWh for a nearby kindergarten, with an average coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.1.","[Andersen, Theis Raaschou; Poulsen, Soren Erbs; Tordrup, Karl Woldum] VIA Univ Coll, Res Ctr Built Environm Energy Water & Climate, DK-8700 Horsens, Denmark",,"Andersen, TR (corresponding author), VIA Univ Coll, Res Ctr Built Environm Energy Water & Climate, DK-8700 Horsens, Denmark.",thra@via.dk; soeb@via.dk; kart@via.dk,,"Andersen, Theis Raaschou/0000-0003-1077-4520; Tordrup, Karl Woldum/0000-0001-5222-9833",,,,,34,2,2,3,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2022,14,4,,,,,,,666,10.3390/w14040666,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14040666,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,ZK0MZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000762692900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, many local communities are preparing adaptation plans. Even so, much of what was done has not been published in the peer-reviewed literature. This means that consideration of adaptation options for local communities is limited. With the objective of assisting in the development of adaptation plans, we present 80 adaptation options suitable for coastal communities that can be applied by local governments. They are a catena of options from defend to co-exist and finally, retreat that progresses as impacts become less manageable. Options are organized according to their capacity to protect local properties and infrastructure, natural systems, food production, availability of fresh and drinking water and well-being of the local population, as these are likely to be affected by climate change. To respond to multiple threats, 'soft' options, such as awareness raising, planning, political articulation and financial incentives, insurance and professional skills enhancement, can be encouraged immediately at relatively low cost and are reversible. For specific threats, options emphasize change in management practices as pre-emptive measures.

Detailed assessment of multiple measures is resource-consuming and requires specific expertise, which is not always available. To tackle these issues, in the context of the H2020 project RESCCUE (RESilience to cope with Climate Change in Urban arEas), a methodology to effectively prioritize adaptation measures against extreme rainfall-related hazards in urban areas has been developed. It follows a multi-phase structure to progressively narrow down the list of potential measures. It begins using less resource-intensive techniques, to finally focus on the in-depth analysis on a narrower selection of measures. It involves evaluation of risks, costs, and welfare impacts, with strong focus on stakeholders' participation through the entire process. The methodology is adaptable to different contexts and objectives and has been tested in two case studies across Europe, namely Barcelona and Bristol.","[Guerrero-Hidalga, Maria; Martinez-Gomariz, Eduardo; Termes-Rife, Montserrat] Cetaqua, Water Technol Ctr, Barcelona 08940, Spain; [Martinez-Gomariz, Eduardo] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Flumen Res Inst, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Evans, Barry; Webber, James] Univ Exeter, Ctr Water Syst, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Evans, Barry] Massey Univ, Coll Sci, Sch Built Environm, Wellington 4442, New Zealand; [Termes-Rife, Montserrat] Univ Barcelona, Econ Dept, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Russo, Beniamino; Locatelli, Luca] AQUATEC Suez Adv Solut, Barcelona 08038, Spain; [Russo, Beniamino] Univ Zaragoza, Escuela Politecn La Almunia EUPLA, Grp Ingn Hidraul & Ambiental GIHA, Zaragoza 50100, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; University of Exeter; Massey University; University of Barcelona; University of Zaragoza,"Guerrero-Hidalga, M (corresponding author), Cetaqua, Water Technol Ctr, Barcelona 08940, Spain.",maria.guerrero@cetaqua.com; eduardo.martinez@cetaqua.com; b.evans@exeter.ac.uk; J.Webber2@exeter.ac.uk; mtermes@ub.edu; brusso@aquatec.es; luca.locatelli@aquatec.es,"Webber, James/HQY-4347-2023; Russo, Beniamino/Z-6372-2019; Termes-Rife, Montserrat/ABG-9131-2020; Termes-Rife, Montserrat/Q-3956-2018; Gomariz, Eduardo Martínez/I-1269-2019","Russo, Beniamino/0000-0001-9437-0085; Termes-Rife, Montserrat/0000-0002-2878-8077; Termes-Rife, Montserrat/0000-0002-2878-8077; Gomariz, Eduardo Martínez/0000-0002-0189-0725; Locatelli, Luca/0000-0003-3859-3553; Webber, James/0000-0002-1158-4895; Guerrero Hidalga, Maria/0000-0003-4550-5013",European Commission [700174],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This research, under the RESCCUE Project, was funded by the European Commission Horizon2020 funding program.

Stronger collaborative approaches are urgently needed. At the same time, there is little research and hardly any empirical evidence on what inspires adaptation engagement in different citizen groups. Against this background, this paper examines the external/material (e.g., resources, hazards, public support) and internal aspects (e.g., values and worldviews) that shape people's engagement in and for adaptation. Based on a survey of Swedish citizens at risk from severe climate events, we show that engagement is a gendered process, which is mediated by personal values, worldviews and place aspects rarely considered in public adaptation. While a high level of diverse citizen action is often related to past experiences of hazards, motivation to adapt goes beyond the idea of acting out of rational self-interest. Economic considerations (e.g., low cost) are not the only motivation to adapt; the potential of an adaptation action to contribute to green, thriving surroundings and mitigate global climate change was found nearly as (and among female respondents, more) motivating. Women were also found to be more motivated to engage in adaptation if this supports other community members at risk. At the same time, past adaptation action could not be linked to motivation to adapt, and was found to be negatively correlated with communitarian and ecological values or worldviews. This confirms that motivation to adapt does not automatically translate into action, and indicates a 'mitigation-adaptation gap' in people's climate awareness, which can lead to ineffective climate responses. Given these findings, we discuss alternative approaches to support increased citizen engagement and more effective and transformative climate action. We end with a call for public adaptation and risk communication that takes greater account of inner/subjective dimensions. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We assess whether residents in a sub-tropical Australian city perceive green infrastructure as an effective climate adaptation response for reducing vulnerability to heat stress. Gold Coast City has pursued urban densification policies, such as reducing block sizes and increasing building heights, to accommodate rapid population growth. Little attention has been given to the combined impact of local heat island effects and global climate change upon lower-income residents in the city's suburban fringe, including rising energy costs associated with cooling homes. The study has three aims: to assess whether social disadvantage is associated with (1) concern about climate change impacts; (2) perceptions about the potential of green infrastructure to offer potential climate adaptive benefits; and (3) the desire for more urban greening in a working class suburb. We used a mail-back survey to elicit information related to cooling dwellings, awareness of, and concern about, climate change impacts, perceptions of the benefits of green infrastructure, and desire for more urban greening. Results indicate that despite their vulnerability to heat stress, comparatively disadvantaged residents are no more concerned about climate change; nor are they any more inclined to encourage local government to enhance neighbourhood greenery. These residents are, if anything, less likely to perceive benefits of urban greening. Our findings indicate that cultivating support for green infrastructure in disadvantaged neighbourhoods will require parallel efforts to redress inequality.","[Ambrey, Christopher] Univ Queensland, Inst Social Sci Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Byrne, Jason; Matthews, Tony] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Davison, Aidan] Univ Tasmania, Geog & Spatial Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Lo, Alex] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Queensland; Griffith University; University of Tasmania; University of Hong Kong,"Ambrey, C (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Inst Social Sci Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",c.ambrey@uq.edu.au; jason.byrne@griffith.edu.au; t.matthews@griffith.edu.au; aidan.davison@utas.edu.au; chloeportanger@gmail.com; alexloyh@hku.hk,"Lo, Alex/B-7948-2008; Byrne, Jason/AAC-6344-2019; Davison, Aidan GM/N-3863-2013; Byrne, Jason/L-7140-2013","Lo, Alex/0000-0002-5953-4176; Davison, Aidan GM/0000-0002-5618-7068; Byrne, Jason/0000-0001-8733-0333; Matthews, Tony/0000-0003-0838-5462",Griffith University,Griffith University(Griffith University),"An earlier version of this manuscript was presented at the Institute of Australian Geographers Annual Conference 2016.

Together with historical daily weather and water production data, socioeconomic data such as population and unemployment rate were used to estimate daily per capita water demand in the two service areas. The structural time series regression model results show that the sensitivity of per capita water demand to both weather and unemployment rate variables is higher in suburban areas than in urban areas. This is associated with relatively higher proportional demand by the residential sector in the suburban area. The estimated coefficients of the historical demand model were used to project the mid-21st century (2035-2064) per capita water demand under three climate change scenarios that represent high (HadGEM2-ES), medium (MIROC5), and low (GFDL) climate changes. Without climate adaptation, compared to the historical period between 1983 and 2012, per capita water demand is projected to increase by 10.6% in the 2035-2064 period under the HadGEM2-ES in suburban areas, while per capita demand is projected to increase by 4.8% under the same scenario in urban areas. Our findings have implications for future urban water resource management and land use planning in the context of climate variability and change. A tight integration between water resource management and urban planning is needed for preparing for climate adaptation in municipal water planning and management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This is followed by a brief assessment of how sustainability is addressed as part of national policies and programs. We then present a case study of the US Federal Highway Administration's INVEST (Infrastructure Voluntary Evaluation Sustainability Tool), and its application by four agencies. In general, the findings indicate that there is acknowledgement of triple bottom line sustainability considerations in transportation planning - though a cohesive and unified approach is lacking. We also note the presence of planning initiatives and discourse that implicitly address sustainability issues, by targeting related considerations such as liveability, health, climate adaptation, quality of life, and economic opportunity.","[Ramani, Tara; Zietsman, Josias] Texas A&M Univ Syst, Texas A&M Transportat Inst, A 3135 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Pryn, Marie Ridley] Ctr Reg Dev, Kongens Vaenge 2, DK-3400 Hillerod T, Denmark",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Ramani, T (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Syst, Texas A&M Transportat Inst, A 3135 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",t-ramani@tti.tamu.edu; zietsman@tamu.edu; marie.ridley.pryn@regionh.dk,"Babariya, Dheeraj/G-8663-2019",,Strategic Research Council of Denmark,Strategic Research Council of Denmark,"This work was conducted as part of the SUSTAIN research project funded by the Strategic Research Council of Denmark.

Nikte and Zamorana showed the highest phenolic potential mainly due to their higher content of anthocyanins, while Pakal was richer in phenolic acids. Regarding color, Nikte and Zamorana were the more similar cultivars having the lowest values of lightness and hue. On the contrary, the color of Pakal was quite different from all the rest, due to the specific distribution between pelargonidin and cyanidin.

To select a region for grassroots enquiry, spatial differential in risk to climate change was assessed in Rajasthan, using IPCC AR5 framework. Among the highly vulnerable and risky districts, Bikaner district was selected for elicitation of micro-level imperatives. Rising atmospheric temperature, inter-seasonal displacements of rainfall and recurrence of extreme events were perceived by the farmers resulting in resource degradation, production risks and erosion of households' socio-economic dynamics. As risk preventive measures, suitable adjustment in agricultural practices, natural resource management, shift to off-farm activities and other relief measures were adopted by the farmers. Farmer's choice of adaptation was influenced by several climatic, socio-economic and infrastructural & institutional factors in varying degree. Moreover, several financial, economic, infrastructural and informational bottlenecks to adaptations were reported during household survey and FGDs. The results suggest that capturing grassroots evidence is crucial for directing locally tailored adaptation strategies, along with the improving deficiencies in the developmental pathways for climate-resilient agriculture.","[Singh, Naveen P.; Anand, Bhawna; Srivastava, S.

Innovation itself is a mechanism by which society adapt to changing resource endowments, and which is in turn driven by social and cultural values. In the future, as resource conditions changes, the role of institutions in the process of technological innovations would be crucial to avoid deleterious consequences of climate change in agriculture. Using Nepal as a case, this paper illustrates how farmers and their supporting institutions are evolving and co-producing climate sensitive technologies on demand. Drawing upon the hypothesis of induced innovation, we examine the extent to which resource endowments have influenced the evolution of technological and institutional innovations in Nepal's agricultural research and development. This study reveals that Nepal has developed a novel multilevel institutional partnership, including collaboration with farmers and other non-governmental organizations in recent years. More importantly, by combining conventional technological innovation process with the tacit knowledge of farmers, this new alliance has been instrumental in the innovation of location-specific technologies thereby facilitating the adoption of technologies in a more efficient manner. This alliance has improved knowledge network among institutions, scientists and farmers and enabled them to seek technologies that are responsive to likely changes in climate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The MONICA model was employed in four different modelling exercises for demonstration and testing different management options for farmers in Germany to adjust their production system. 30-Year simulations were run for the periods 1996-2025 and 2056-2085 using future climate data generated by a statistical method on the basis of measured data from 1961 to 2000 and the A1B scenario of the IPCC (2007a). Crop rotation designs that are expected to become possible in the future due to a prolonged vegetation period and at the same time shortened cereal growth period were tested for their likely success. The model suggested that a spring barley succeeding a winter barley may be successfully grown in the second half of the century, allowing for a larger yields by intensification of the cropping cycle. Growing a winter wheat after a sugar beet may lead to future problems as late sowing makes the winter wheat grow into periods prone to drought. Irrigation is projected to considerably improve and stabilise the yields of late cereals and of shallow rooting crops (maize and pea) on sandy soils in the continental climate part of Germany, but not in the humid West. Nitrogen fertiliser management needs to be adjusted to increasing or decreasing yield expectations and for decreasing soil moisture. On soils containing sufficient amounts of Moisture and soil organic matter, enhanced mineralisation is expected to compensate for a greater N demand. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Population growth presents one of the biggest challenges for the South East Queensland region (SEQ) of Australia. Indigenous people, the aged, lone person households and single parent families show marked increases relative to other population segments. The literature suggests that these groups are more vulnerable to the risks associated with climate change. Population growth will not only increase the number of vulnerable groups, but also the demand for land, goods and services, including energy, infrastructure and ecosystem services.

However, the specific mechanisms underlining the evolution of earlier migration timing in salmonid fishes are unknown. In this paper, I present a hypothesis by which fishery-induced selection works to advance the timing of salmonid migration, given that the timings of migration and breeding are genetically controlled heritable traits. Although late-spawning salmon brood lines enter rivers after early-spawning brood lines, there is evidence that all brood lines arrive in coastal fishing grounds at similar times. As such, late-spawning brood lines would be fished for longer periods of time, with their increased harvest rate imposing directional selection on earlier-spawning brood lines. Thus, fisheries-induced evolution could favor the earlier timing of river entry to escape coastal fisheries. Should earlier migration timing not be an adaptation to global warming-should it be a maladaptation to fisheries-induced selection instead-then it will have a negative impact on the sustainability of salmonid resources.","[Morita, Kentaro] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Toyohira Ku, 2-2 Nakanoshima, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan",Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA),"Morita, K (corresponding author), Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Toyohira Ku, 2-2 Nakanoshima, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan.",moritak@affrc.go.jp,"Morita, Kentaro/G-2578-2015","Morita, Kentaro/0000-0002-7803-2438",,,,,38,13,13,3,37,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Due to climate change, summer heat events will increase. Therefore, mitigation and adaptation are needed. In this study, meteorological measurements in various local climate zones were performed to demonstrate the influence of evaporation surfaces and other factors on thermal comfort, as determined by the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET). Furthermore, a quantification of the thermal effects of several adaptation measures and varying meteorological parameters was made using model simulations (ENVI-met) in an inner-city neighborhood (Oberhausen, Germany). The results show that the most effective adaptation measure was increased wind speed (maximal 15 K PET reduction). Moreover, vegetation areas show greater PET reductions by the combination of shading and evapotranspiration than water surfaces. The creation of park areas with sufficient water supply and tall, isolated, shade-providing trees that allow for adequate ventilation can be recommended for planning.","[Mueller, Nicole; Kuttler, Wilhelm; Barlag, Andreas-Bent] Univ Duisburg Essen, D-45127 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Muller, N (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Schutzenbahn 70, D-45127 Essen, Germany.",nicole.mueller@uni-due.de,,,Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LR0804G],Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The dynaklim project, Dynamic adaptation to the effects of climate change in the Emscher-Lippe region (Ruhr area; www.dynaklim.de), on which part of this report is based, was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under grant number 01LR0804G.

However, laws written to specifically protect mountain glaciers have only recently been considered within national political agendas. Glacier Protection Laws (GPLs) originate in countries where mining has damaged glaciers and have been adopted with the aim of protecting the cryosphere from harmful activities. Here, we analyze GPLs in Argentina (approved) and Chile (under discussion) to identify potential environmental conflicts arising from law restrictions and omissions. We conclude that GPLs overlook the dynamics of glaciers and could prevent or delay actions needed to mitigate glacial hazards (e.g. artificial drainage of glacial lakes) thus placing populations at risk. Furthermore, GPL restrictions could hinder strategies (e.g. use of glacial lakes as reservoirs) to mitigate adverse impacts of climate change. Arguably, more flexible GPLs are needed to protect us from the changing cryosphere.","[Anacona, Pablo Iribarren] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Geog, Valparaiso, Chile; [Anacona, Pablo Iribarren; Mazzorana, Bruno] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Tierra, Edificio Pugin,Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile; [Kinney, Josie] Univ Oregon, Robert D Clark Honors Coll, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Kinney, Josie] 2618 NW Marken StreetBend, Bend, OR 97703 USA; [Schaefer, Marius] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Fis & Matemat, Edificio Pugin 4 Piso,Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile; [Harrison, Stephan] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Cornwall Campus, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England; [Harrison, Stephan] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Wilson, Ryan; Glasser, Neil F.] Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Geog Hist Polit & Psychol, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Ceredigion, Wales; [Segovia, Alexis] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Forestales & Conservac Nat, Fray Camilo Henriquez 364, Santiago 8330207, Chile; [Guerra, Felipe] Observ Ciudadano, Antonio Varas 428, Temuco, Chile; [Farias, David] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Geog & Geosci, Wetterkreuz 15, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Reynolds, John M.] Reynolds Int Ltd, Suite 2,Broncoed House,Broncoed Business Pk, Mold CH7 1HP, Flint, Wales",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; Universidad Austral de Chile; University of Oregon; Universidad Austral de Chile; University of Exeter; University of Exeter; Aberystwyth University; Universidad de Chile; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Anacona, PI (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Geog, Valparaiso, Chile.;Anacona, PI (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Tierra, Edificio Pugin,Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile.",pablo.iribarren@uach.cl; Josie11k@gmail.com; mschaefer@uach.cl; stephan.harrison@exeter.ac.uk; ryw3@aber.ac.uk; alexisegov@ug.uchile.cl; bruno.mazzorana@uach.cl; felipe.guerra.schleef@gmail.com; david.farias@fau.de; jmr@reynolds-initernational.co.uk; nfg@aber.ac.uk,"Schaefer, Marius/HNR-3586-2023; Farias, David/AAA-2955-2021","Schaefer, Marius/0000-0002-7508-8786; Wilson, Ryan/0000-0001-9063-8021","RCUK-CONICYT project [MR-N026462-1]; VRIEA-PUCV project; Becas Chile, CONICYT; TanDEM-X [DLR AO XTI_GLAC0264]; NERC [NE/N020693/1] Funding Source: UKRI","RCUK-CONICYT project; VRIEA-PUCV project; Becas Chile, CONICYT; TanDEM-X; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This research was supported by the RCUK-CONICYT project MR-N026462-1 Glacial Hazards in Chile: Processes, Assessment, Mitigation, and Risk Management Strategies'' and a VRIEA-PUCV project.

Effective adaptation measures to mitigate the negative effects of climate change would affect both the ecological environment and the social economy. In this paper, we built a positive mathematical programming model to assess adaptation measures, which were divided into four aspects, to tackle climate change based on the survey data obtained from seven counties and 32 villages in the region of Hulun Buir. The results showed that, livestock breeding improvement had a positive impact on grass yield, livestock number and especially herder's household income (the most in Ewenki (11.7%) and the least in Xinzuo (2.3%)); artificial grassland project could lead to an average growth rate of 8.4% in household income among the four counties; current policies and going out for work could also increase household income, however, not a sustainable choice. To realize sustainable development in the context of global climate change, the vitality of sustainable development of animal husbandry under the premise of protecting ecological environment should be enhanced. For example, improving the safety and quality of livestock products through influencing livestock breeding, processing technology and high quality forage, and ensuring adequate forage supplement through artificial grassland project.

Nevertheless, cross-sectoral effects of adaptation measures are rarely taken into consideration in adaptation costing and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). We explicitly address joint adaptation processes by focusing on inter- or intra-sectoral adaptation synergies within a cost-effectiveness framework. A software tool - CrossAdapt - has been developed in order to quantify cross-sectoral adaptation impacts based on expert judgement. Our research shows that the calculation of cross-sectoral impacts and their integration into cost-effectiveness analysis can significantly affect the cost-effectiveness ranking of adaptation measures.

Agricultural land in the Gamo Highlands is highly fragmented. The extent to which land fragmentation (LF) moderates the food security effects of sustainable land management (SLM) practices is unknown. This study used probit and Poisson models to explain this relationship. The study found that food insecurity was severe during the food shortfall season. LF provides more potential opportunities for improving food security than challenges. Furthermore, SLM practices had both positive and negative effects on food security and their effects were conditioned by the magnitude of LF. Reducing severe LF through the assembly of small parcels into larger heterogeneous plot clusters could enhance food security by exploiting synergies between adaptation practices and LF.","[Cholo, Tesfaye C.; Fleskens, Luuk; Sietz, Diana] Wageningen Univ & Res, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Cholo, Tesfaye C.] Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Dept Dev Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Sietz, Diana] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Earth Syst Anal Res Domain 1, Potsdam, Germany; [Sietz, Diana] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam, Germany; [Peerlings, Jack] Wageningen Univ & Res, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Wageningen University & Research,"Cholo, TC (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Cholo, TC (corresponding author), Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Dept Dev Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",tesfaye.cholo@wur.nl,"Cholo, Tesfaye Chofana/Q-1339-2019; S, D/HJB-2910-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Fleskens, Luuk/B-4004-2009","Cholo, Tesfaye Chofana/0000-0001-5094-4710; S, D/0000-0002-2309-2134; Fleskens, Luuk/0000-0001-6843-0910",,,,,58,19,19,9,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The effect of overall climate change on agricultural productivity (modelled as reduced land productivity) is projected to be relatively limited until about 2030, thereafter becoming worse. The simulation results indicate that despite the projected reduction in agricultural productivity, the negative impacts can potentially be quite limited. This is because the timescales involved, as well as the low starting point of the economy, leave ample room for factor substitutability and increased overall productivity. This indicates that policies that give farmers the opportunity to invest in autonomous climate adaptation, as well as those that improve the overall performance of the economy, can be as important in reducing the impacts of climate change in the economy as direct government policies for adaptation.","[Stage, Jesper] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Social Sci, S-85170 Sundsvall, Sweden; [Bezabih, Mintewab] Univ Portsmouth, Dept Econ, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England; [Chambwera, Muyeye] Int Inst Environm & Dev, Sustainable Markets Grp, Econ Climate Change Team, London WC1H 0DD, England",Mid-Sweden University; University of Portsmouth,"Stage, J (corresponding author), Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Social Sci, S-85170 Sundsvall, Sweden.",jesper.stage@miun.se,"Stage, Jesper/B-6718-2009","Stage, Jesper/0000-0001-7206-6568",,,,,49,20,20,1,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

In spite of such efforts, forest fragmentation and degradation continues, with forests being subject to increased pressure due to anthropogenic factors. Such fragmentation and degradation is leading to the forest cover to change from very dense to moderately dense and open forest and 253 km(2) of very dense forest has been converted to moderately dense forest, open forest, scrub and non-forest (during 2005-2007). Similarly, there has been a degradation of 4,120 km(2) of moderately dense forest to open forest, scrub and non-forest resulting in a net loss of 936 km(2) of moderately dense forest. Additionally, 4,335 km(2) of open forest have degraded to scrub and non-forest. Coupled with pressure due to anthropogenic factors, climate change is likely to be an added stress on forests. Forest sector programs and policies are major factors that determine the status of forests and potentially resilience to projected impacts of climate change. An attempt is made to review the forest policies and programs and their implications for the status of forests and for vulnerability of forests to projected climate change.

It causes an imbalance between people by creating a more desirable living environment for some societies while erasing settlements and shelters of some others. Due to floods, sea level rise, destructive storms, drought, and slow-onset factors such as salinization of water and soil, people lose their lands, homes, and natural resources. Catastrophic events force people to move voluntarily or involuntarily. The relocation of communities is a debatable climate adaptation measure which requires utmost care with human rights, ethics, and psychological well-being of individuals upon the issues of discrimination, conflict, and security. As the number of climate-displaced populations grows, the generations-deep connection to their rituals, customs, and ancestral ties with the land, cultural practices, and intangible cultural heritage become endangered. However, intangible heritage is often overlooked in the context of climate displacement. This paper presents reflections based on observations regarding the intangible heritage of voluntarily displaced communities. It begins by examining intangible heritage under the threat of climate displacement, with place-based examples. It then reveals intangible heritage as a catalyst to building resilient communities by advocating for the cultural values of indigenous and all people in climate action planning. It concludes the discussion by presenting the implications of climate displacement in existing intangible heritage initiatives. This article seeks to contribute to the emerging policies of preserving intangible heritage in the context of climate displacement.","[Akturk, Gul] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Architecture, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Lerski, Martha] Lehman Coll, Leonard Lief Lib, New York, NY USA",Delft University of Technology; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY),"Akturk, G (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Architecture, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",g.akturk@tudelft.nl; martha.lerski@lehman.cuny.edu,"akturk, gul/GRR-6475-2022; Aktürk, Gül/AAV-8037-2020; Lerski, Martha B/Y-7566-2018","Aktürk, Gül/0000-0003-1555-8202; Lerski, Martha B/0000-0002-7436-3969",,,,,75,8,8,4,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

Here, we investigate the physical characteristics of plausible worst case scenario extreme storm sequences capable of giving rise to megaflood conditions using a combination of climate model data and high- resolution weather modeling. Using the data from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble, we find that climate change has already doubled the likelihood of an event capable of producing catastrophic flooding, but larger future increases are likely due to continued warming. We further find that runoff in the future extreme storm scenario is 200 to 400% greater than historical values in the Sierra Nevada because of increased precipitation rates and decreased snow fraction. These findings have direct implications for flood and emergency management, as well as broader implications for hazard mitigation and climate adaptation activities.","[Huang, Xingying] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Swain, Daniel L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Swain, Daniel L.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Capac Ctr Climate & Weather Extremes, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Swain, Daniel L.] Nat Conservancy Calif, Sacramento, CA 95811 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Nature Conservancy,"Huang, XY (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.;Swain, DL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Swain, DL (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Capac Ctr Climate & Weather Extremes, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.;Swain, DL (corresponding author), Nat Conservancy Calif, Sacramento, CA 95811 USA.",xyhuang@ucar.edu; dlswain@ucla.edu,"Swain, Daniel/I-9394-2019","Swain, Daniel/0000-0003-4276-3092; Huang, Xingying/0000-0003-2494-9897","Yuba Water Agency; California Department of Water Resources grant; National Science Foundation [1854761]; Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles; Center for Climate and Weather Extremes at the National Center for Atmospheric Research; Nature Conservancy of California","Yuba Water Agency; California Department of Water Resources grant; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles; Center for Climate and Weather Extremes at the National Center for Atmospheric Research; Nature Conservancy of California","This work was supported by the Yuba Water Agency grant (to X.H. and D.L.S.), the California Department of Water Resources grant (to X.H. and D.L.S.), and the National Science Foundation award #1854761 (to D.L.S.) and a joint collaboration between the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles; the Center for Climate and Weather Extremes at the National Center for Atmospheric Research; and the Nature Conservancy of California (to D.L.S.).",,66,9,8,6,9,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",2375-2548,,,SCI ADV,Sci.

Continuing expectations to the contrary stem from a reliance on the supposed ability of science to prime political understandings of climate change. This paper shows how scientists undermine this 'deficit model' ideal by conflating types and uses of evidence and expertise in policymaking. These tactics are unconvincing for conservative opponents, for whom climate science is far from the last word on what climate change means. This paper examines experts' rhetorical tactics through the eyes of conservative policymakers and, thereby, proposes a strategy more likely to effect resilient climate adaptation and mitigation policies in Australia.","[Tangney, Peter] Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Ctr Sci Educ 21st Century, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Tangney, P (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Ctr Sci Educ 21st Century, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",peter.tangney@flinders.edu.au,"Tangney, Peter/O-2153-2015","Tangney, Peter/0000-0003-3878-4034",,,,,82,9,9,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1036-1146,1363-030X,,AUST J POLIT SCI,Aust.

Greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere may cause considerable climate change in northern latitudes. In the Nordic region, increases in temperature and precipitation, over the next several decades, could change the availability of renewable energy. Climate change scenarios suggest that both hydropower and biomass potentials would increase considerably in Sweden. Bioenergy from forestry could be adversely affected by rapid climate change, while short rotation biomass production would adapt more readily to changing environmental conditions. Impacts of climate change on wind and direct solar energy are difficult to assess, due to uncertainties in future changes of wind variability and cloudiness.

Irrespective of future climatic changes increasing the need for systematic evaluation and management of extremes, weather-related disasters already today pose substantial burdens for households, businesses and governments. Research in the ADAM project identified substantial direct risks in terms of potential crop and asset losses due to combined drought and heatwave, as well as flood hazards in Southern and Eastern Europe, respectively. This paper focuses on the indirect, medium to longer term economic risks triggered by the direct risks and mediated by policy responses. We present a selection of three economic impact and adaptation assessments and modelling studies undertaken on extreme event adaptation in Europe. Responding to a need for more economically based adaptation assessments, we address some relatively unresearched issues such as the understanding of past adaptation, the role of market response to impacts as well as government's ability to plan for and share out extreme event risks. The first analysis undertakes an empirical exploration of observed impacts and adaptation in the agricultural sector in the UK comparing the impact of consecutive extreme events over time in order to determine whether adaptation has occurred in the past and whether this can be used to inform future estimates of adaptation rates. We find that farmers and the agricultural sector clearly have adapted to extreme events over time, but whether this rate can be maintained into the future is unclear, as some autonomous adaptation enacted seemed rather easy to be taken. Markets may mediate or amplify impacts and in the second analysis, we use an economic general equilibrium model to assess the economic effects of a reduction in agricultural production due to drought and heatwave risk in exposed regions in Spain. The analysis suggests that modelled losses to the local economy are more serious in a large-scale scenario when neighbouring provinces are also affected by drought and heatwave events. This is due to the supply-side induced price increase leading to some passing on of disaster costs to consumers. The simulation highlights the importance of paying particular attention to the spatial and distributional effects weather extremes and possibly changes therein induced by climate change may incur. Finally, we discuss how national governments may better plan their disaster liabilities resulting from a need to manage relief and reconstruction activities post event. We do so using a risk based economic planning model assessing the fiscal consequences associated with the coping with natural extremes. We identify large weather-related disaster contingent liabilities, particularly in the key flood hot spot countries Austria, Romania, and Hungary. Such substantial disaster liabilities (hidden disaster deficits) when interacting with weak fiscal conditions may lead to substantial additional stress on government budgets and reduced fiscal space for funding other relevant public investment projects. Overall, our paper suggests the importance of respecting the specific spatial and temporal characteristics of extreme event risk when generating information on adaptation decisions. As our adaptation decisions considered, such as using sovereign risk financing instruments are associated with a rather short time horizon, the analysis largely focuses on the management of today's extreme events and does not discuss in detail projctions of risks into a future with climate change. Such projections raise important issues of uncertainty, which in some instances may actually render future projections non-robust, a constraint to be kept in mind when addressing longer term decisions, which at the same time should account for both climate and also socioeconomic change.","[Mechler, Reinhard] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Mechler, Reinhard; Hochrainer, Stefan] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Aaheim, Asbjorn; Salen, Hakon] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res CICERO, Oslo, Norway; [Wreford, Anita] Scottish Agr Coll, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wreford, Anita] Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Vienna University of Economics & Business; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Scottish Agricultural College; University of East Anglia,"Mechler, R (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",mechler@iiasa.ac.at,"Wreford, Anita/Y-1996-2018; mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020","Wreford, Anita/0000-0002-9546-4080; /0000-0003-2239-1578; Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan/0000-0002-9929-8171",European Commission [018476],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This paper has been produced as a result of research carried out for the EC-funded ADAM project, which was funded by the European Commission's DG-RTD under the EU's Sixth Framework Programme, Contract Number 018476 (GOCE).",,66,31,31,9,154,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Known as the Climate Agenda it outlines a programme, that in a cost-effective way, responds to national obligations to respond to international agreements as well as their national needs for social and economic development. The paper briefly describes the Climate Agenda and the incorporation within it of studies of climate impact assessments and response strategies to reduce vulnerability The need for increased emphasis on climate impact assessment and for the development of effective adaptation measures is emphasised following the elaboration of a Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). UNEP's efforts to identify national programmes contributing to the Climate Agenda are described. The response from developing countries has, however, been very disappointing, even from countries where we know work is ongoing through funding by GEF or US Country Studies Program and other bilateral programmes. Initial compilation of information available so far shows that many developed countries are putting a lot into the area of impact assessment of not just climate change, but also climate variability. There remain some research gaps, especially in the area of assessment of climate impacts on ecosystems, hydrological systems, etc. Considerable efforts are presently being directed at reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases and in the case of developing countries, most efforts are being directed towards completing national communications and providing baseline data for future studies. The paper refers to early activities by UNEP in cooperation with other international organizations to undertake integrated assessments of the impacts of climate change on important socio-economic sectors and the later incorporation of lessons teamed into the IPCC Guidelines for Assessing Impacts of Climate Change. Later sections outline the development of a handbook on methods for climate change impact assessment and adaptation strategies as a practical approach to national assessments and the development of appropriate and cost-effective response to climate change. The initiation of a GEF-funded project to apply the methods contained in the handbook and improve the results based on national studies is also described for both developed and developing countries. Working in collaboration with a team of international experts under the coordination of the Institute of Environmental Studies at Vrije University (Amsterdam), the goal of this ongoing project is to develop a valuable methodological tool that Parties to the UNFCCC may apply to develop national climate change impact and adaptation assessments. Development of these guidelines was linked to a series of country studies in Antigua and Barbuda, Estonia, Cameroon and Pakistan funded under a UNEP/GEF project. The application of the first version of the UNEP Handbook by national study teams in these four countries is making valuable technical and practical contributions and will ensure that the next version of the Handbook will be a more useful tool for experts in developing countries undertaking similar studies in the future. The methods contained in the Handbook are also the basis for similar assessments funded under bilateral development programmes in other countries. These and similar studies elsewhere are coordinated with the UNEP programme and will eventually aim to create reliable and comparable assessments, a compatible set of tools for such purpose and the identification of realistic adaptation options for incorporation into national planning for adapting to climate change. The paper also addresses how climate impact assessment and response strategies are undertaken as part of national enabling activities carried out in co-operation with UNEP.","UNEP, Atmosphere Unit, Nairobi, Kenya",,"Usher, P (corresponding author), UNEP, Atmosphere Unit, POB 47074, Nairobi, Kenya.",,,,,,,,0,2,2,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

Intervention programmes aim to build the resilience of local communities to climate shocks, and ultimately their wellbeing by helping them to better prepare, adapt and recover. Resilience, similar to human wellbeing, is a multidimensional construct grounded in local realities and lived experiences. Yet current evaluation frameworks used in resilience programming rarely consider what resilience means in local contexts prior to implementation. This means policy designs risk failing to improve resilience of communities and creating unintended negative consequences for communities' wellbeing. Better processes and indicators for assessing resilience are needed. This paper explores the interplay between local predictors of resilience and wellbeing to assess the validity of self-assessed indicators as part of frameworks to measure resilience. We draw from research on the Devolved Climate Finance (DCF) mechanism implemented between 2014 and 2018 in Tanzania. We find that different factors explain resilience when compared to wellbeing; while resilience is primarily influenced by relationships, wellbeing is correlated with livelihoods. This shows that incentives to improve resilience differ from those of wellbeing. Climate and development practitioners must adopt locally grounded framings for resilience and wellbeing to ensure interventions track appropriate indicators, towards positive outcomes.","[Beauchamp, Emilie; Greene, Sam] Int Inst Environm & Dev, London WC1V 7DN, England; [Sainsbury, Nigel C.; Chaigneau, Tomas] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9FE, England",University of Exeter,"Beauchamp, E (corresponding author), Int Inst Environm & Dev, London WC1V 7DN, England.",emilie.beauchamp@iied.org; nigel_sainsbury@sfu.ca; sam.greene@iied.org; t.w.b.chaigneau@exeter.ac.uk,,"Chaigneau, Tomas/0000-0002-0874-216X",Economic and Social Research Council Impact Acceleration Award Programme [2705.001]; International Institute for Environment and Development,Economic and Social Research Council Impact Acceleration Award Programme; International Institute for Environment and Development,"This research was made possible by funding from Economic and Social Research Council Impact Acceleration Award Programme, grant reference 2705.001 and the support of the International Institute for Environment and Development.",,57,2,2,6,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2021,13,16,,,,,,,8976,10.3390/su13168976,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13168976,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UH8RR,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000690191100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate impact science and the media share a panoptic gaze on atoll islands seeing them as being small, inert and passive in the face of rising seas. The focus in these accounts is on the power of water as the agent of destruction, while the agency of the assemblage of human and non-human actors that is the (is)land itself is ignored. Thus, atolls are said to be vulnerable, and the prevailing ideas of adaptation are either international relocation to avoid the sea or seawalls to contain it. Based on qualitative field research in Pacific atolls, this paper examines the connections between island peoples and their terrestrial environments, and the work that they are doing in response to the impacts of climate change. It shows how land is conceived symbolically, socio-culturally and legally, and considers its role in sustaining livelihoods and anchoring identities through a changing climate.","[Jarillo, Sergio; Barnett, Jon] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Jarillo, S (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",sergio.jarillo@unimelb.edu.au; jbarn@unimelb.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [FL180100040]; Constantine Niarchos Foundation; Kalbfleisch Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the American Museum of Natural History; Australian Research Council [FL180100040] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Constantine Niarchos Foundation; Kalbfleisch Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the American Museum of Natural History; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Kari katuwai MinBuzibuz and kommol tata to the people of Budibudi and Namdrik atolls, and in particular to Manu and Iwa in PNG and to the late Mattlan Zackhras in the RMI, as well as to Wisely Zackhras, Clarence Luther and Alden Luther.

This paper describes how an asset management system can be used as a decision-making framework for incorporating such concerns into a transportation agency's management approach. Types of climate and weather changes as they might affect transportation systems are identified. A typical asset management system is used as a framework for discussing where climate change considerations could be incorporated into the system. Risk appraisal is identified as one of the key components of a climate change-oriented asset management system, and an example is provided of such an application. Some international examples are provided of where climate change has been incorporated into asset management systems. The paper concludes that, given that most state and large local transportation agencies have some form of an asset management system, it is the most convenient and targeted approach to incorporate climate-induced change into state and local transportation decision making.","[Meyer, Michael D.; Amekudzi, Adjo; O'Har, John Patrick] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Meyer, MD (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",michael.meyer@ce.gatech.edu,,,,,,,37,40,41,1,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

But there remains a need for evidence about the efficacy of potential risk communication design metrics. This online experiment (n = 261) sought to understand the necessity of a multifaceted risk perception questionnaire to capture public input. Using six coastal infrastructure examples, risk perceptions were collected using a questionnaire highlighting multiple types of risk (intervention) or not (control). Public evaluations of risk did not differ in most cases. Moreover, the intervention imposed more cognitive strain on participants, which could unintentionally discourage public participation in the climate adaptation process. In this case, the single question provides the same input, with less effort. This finding is a reminder that effective risk communication for managing adaptation processes requires considering both the quality of public input and the effort required to provide it.","[Gordon, Bethany] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Klotz, Leidy] Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Virginia,"Gordon, B (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",bmg1@uw.edu,,"Gordon, Bethany/0000-0003-3759-6277",United States National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [1842490]; United States National Science Foundation [153104],United States National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program; United States National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material is based upon work supported by 1) the United States National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program under grant number 1842490 and 2) the United States National Science Foundation grant number 153104.

Efficient TRS glasses have advantages over other smart windows, such as traditional electrochromic glasses, for radiant energy control because they modulate the sunlight transmission based on light reflection, which prevents unnecessary indoor heating by sunlight through the fenestrations. The high translucence tunability not only allows the optimization of indoor temperature, it also provides glare control for building occupants' visual comfort. There are several aspects, however, that require further improvements to accelerate the commercialization of TRS glasses. This review aims to validate four state-of-the-art TRS glass technologies as ideal energy-efficient building glazing, by comparing their key optical switch response, challenges and potential solutions. With further technical revolutions being made in new materials, device configuration and low-cost manufacturing processes, TRS glasses are touted to be essential elements in climate-adaptive building envelopes.","[Tong, Shi Wun; Goh, Wei Peng; Huang, Xiaohu; Jiang, Changyun] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst Mat Res & Engn, 2 Fusionopolis Way,08-03 Innovis, Singapore 138634, Singapore",Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of Materials Research & Engineering (IMRE),"Tong, SW; Jiang, CY (corresponding author), Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst Mat Res & Engn, 2 Fusionopolis Way,08-03 Innovis, Singapore 138634, Singapore.",tongsw@imre.a-star.edu.sg; jiangc@imre.a-star.edu.sg,"Huang, Xiaohu/O-9083-2014; Jiang, Changyun/GZB-1608-2022","Jiang, Changyun/0000-0002-0655-3584; TONG, SHI WUN/0000-0003-3584-1873; Goh, Wei Peng/0000-0002-7987-7950; Huang, Xiaohu/0000-0002-4477-7191",Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR) [A19D9a0096],Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR)(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR)),This work is supported by Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR) under its Sustainable Hybrid Lighting System for Controlled Environment Agriculture programme (A19D9a0096).,,108,12,12,22,63,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Improvements with minimal interference to inhabitants can be achieved by upgrading facades using elements that enhance energy efficiency and user comfort. Prefabricated energy retrofit systems have been suggested, but at present many lack adaptability to weather and usage conditions. This paper presents BRESAER, a retrofit system that provides adaptability through combination of passive strategies and intelligence features, which can be used in different climates and diverse building types. Energy performance was analysed for five types of European climates, results are shown for two climate types and three usages. A comparison was made of the presented system with a mostly passive retrofit system. Results show that in both climates, adaptability provides higher energy savings, complying with current definitions of very low-energy buildings.","[Capeluto, Guedi] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Climate & Energy Lab Architecture, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Capeluto, G (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Climate & Energy Lab Architecture, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",arrguedi@technion.ac.il,,"Capeluto, Guedi/0000-0003-2523-093X",European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Framework Programme [637186],European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Framework Programme,This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Framework Programme [grant agreement number 637186].,,39,9,10,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-8628,1758-9622,,ARCHIT SCI REV,Archit.

In contrast to prior studies that found negative impacts of elevated daily minimum temperature (T (min)) on rice yield in tropical and subtropical regions, we discovered that rising T (min) increased early and late rice yields in China, with the positive temperature effects varying by rice-growth stage. Consistent with the previous assessments, we found that precipitation had small but negative effects on early and late rice yields. Responses of middle-season rice yield to variations in T (min) and precipitation are statistically insignificant. The effect of radiation on rice yields also differed by rice variety and rice-growth stage.

The former prioritises generalised quantitative information, while the latter is more concerned with capturing complexity. A theoretically driven and empirically tested quantitative vulnerability and capacities index (VCI) for use at the local scale is presented to help connect vulnerability research and policy. There are four versions of the index for use in rural and urban contexts at the household and community levels.

In other words, the aim of this study is to collect and analyze information about the current status of total investment in the field of technology for mitigating GHGs (Greenhouse Gases) from MDBs and identify implications of the status. In this study, a screening technique has been used three times to make a database for project information in the field of mitigation of climate change. So far, based on the finalized DB (Database), mitigation technology projects supported by MDBs have been investigated; based on the result, a connected analysis has been conducted between MDBs, mitigation technology, and countries. According to the derived current status, project support in renewable energy and energy demand areas turned out to be the highest at 75% of the entire mitigation technology. Rather than the renewable energy and energy demand areas where climate technology projects have frequently been performed throughout the world, it was confirmed that long-term climate technology projects for GHG fixation were being performed. According to the results of comparison and analysis of countries with high GHG emissions and their centrality, centrality turned out to be high in the field of GHG fixation in China, the country with the highest GHG emissions. This seems to indicate that countries emitting a substantial amount of GHGs will invest more on projects in the field of GHG fixation as well as on projects on renewable energy. Thus, this study is expected to contribute to understanding the trends of climate technology projects for coping with climate change and using them in establishing future policies on climate technology. In addition, it is expected to be used as a reference for countries with insufficient investment in climate technology despite the high Climate Risk Index (CRI).","[Lee, Joo Young; Han, Su Hyeon] Green Technol Ctr, Div Policy Res, Seoul 04554, South Korea",,"Han, SH (corresponding author), Green Technol Ctr, Div Policy Res, Seoul 04554, South Korea.",zmfkap@gtck.re.kr; sue@gtck.re.kr,,,Green Technology Center Korea [R18123],Green Technology Center Korea,This research has been performed with the support of the unique assignment of Green Technology Center Korea [Publication of the White Paper 2019 on Green Climate Technology (R18123)].,,12,3,3,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JAN,2020,13,2,,,,,,,311,10.3390/en13020311,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13020311,,,12,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,KV4DH,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000520432300025,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study was aimed to investigate the types of indigenous weather forecasting systems, mechanisms of climate information exchange, and how traditional forecasts have been integrated with contemporary forecasts to strengthen adaptation to climatic hazards in Borana pastoralists of southern Ethiopia. Conventional survey methods including participatory rural appraisal tools and factorial scoring technique were used for data collection and interpretation. This study indicated that four major indigenous weather forecasting systems were used by Borana pastoralists for centuries. These include Ayantu, Uchu, Waragu, and Arga-Dhageti. They varied in the kind of indicator used to predict weather events. Forecasting was mainly based on observation and unique analysis of celestial bodies, atmospheric variables, and biological features. Respondents indicated that Uchu and Ayantu systems were the most trusted and reliable sources of local climate information. Indigenous and contemporary forecasts are just different and could complement each other. Our results indicated that integrating indigenous and contemporary forecasting systems can foster the prediction efficiency and applicability of climate information. Borana pastoralists had established coping mechanisms that were performed in three phases: pre, during and post occurrence of predicted weather events; mainly aimed at improving their resilience to climatic shocks. Therefore, sustaining such sacred indigenous knowledge bank is vital, as it directly supports community-based disaster risk reduction programmes.","[Iticha, Birhanu; Husen, Abdulaziz] Wollega Univ, Fac Resource Management & Econ, POB 395, Nekemte, Ethiopia",,"Iticha, B (corresponding author), Wollega Univ, Fac Resource Management & Econ, POB 395, Nekemte, Ethiopia.",birhanuwu@gmail.com,"Iticha, Birhanu/ABH-2004-2020","Iticha, Birhanu/0000-0003-4436-3068",,,,,41,15,15,3,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

System upgrades are required, which are however complicated by the expected future increase in short-term rainfall intensities as a result of climate change. In this case study, focusing on the town of Arvika, Sweden, this issue is investigated in three main steps. In the first, extreme value analyses of 30-min rainfall from an ensemble of climate projections are carried out to estimate the future increase and generate a future design storm. In the second, the existing system's response to both today's and future design storms are simulated by a coarse sewer model setup (MOUSE) and a detailed coupled surface-sewer model setup (TSR). In the third and final step, system upgrades are designed and evaluated by both models. The results indicate an increase by 10-30 % of today's short-term rainfall extremes by the end of the century. Upgrading the system to achieve a satisfactory performance for the future design storm would cost approximately twice as much as an upgrade based on today's design storm.","[Olsson, Jonas] SMHI FoUh, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Olsson, Jonas] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Olsson, Jonas; Amaguchi, Hideo; Kawamura, Akira] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan; [Alsterhag, Elin; Daverhog, Maria] Arvika Municipal, Tech Dept, Arvika, Sweden; [Adrian, Per-Erik] WSP Civils Water Supply & Sewerage, Karlstad, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Tokyo Metropolitan University,"Olsson, J (corresponding author), SMHI FoUh, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.",jonas.olsson@smhi.se,,,EU through the Interreg IVB North Sea Region Programme; Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA) through project Mistra-SWECIA; Swedish Research Council Formas through project Hydroimpacts 2.0; Tokyo Metropolitan University,EU through the Interreg IVB North Sea Region Programme; Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA) through project Mistra-SWECIA; Swedish Research Council Formas through project Hydroimpacts 2.0; Tokyo Metropolitan University,"The study was mainly performed within the project Climate Proof Areas (CPA), funded by EU through the Interreg IVB North Sea Region Programme.

The ancestral nesomyine colonized Madagascar from Africa ca. 30-15 mya at the onset of Oligocene global cooling. We tested the hypothesis that, contrary to what might be expected from Island Biogeography theory, post-colonization character displacement of thermoregulatory traits was constrained by phylogenetic inertia through climate adaptation. The study was conducted in the Parc National d'Ankarafantsika, Madagascar. We measured the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body temperature (T (b)) patterns of naturally warm-acclimated, freshly captured adult long-tailed big-footed mice Macrotarsomys ingens (67.4 g). The mean +/- A SD BMR of M. ingens was 0.298 +/- A 0.032 Watts (n = 12), 31.7 % lower than that predicted by a phylogenetically independent allometric equation. Body mass was correlated with BMR. The lower critical limit of thermoneutrality (T (lc)) was 30.7 A degrees C. The mean +/- A SD T (b) = 36.1 +/- A 0.8 A degrees C (n = 12) compared well with the mean T (b) values for myomorph rodents from the Afrotropical zone, but was lower than those of the Neotropical and Palearctic zones. M. ingens became pathologically hypothermic when exposed to ambient temperatures lower than 18 A degrees C. The soil temperature at depths of 250 mm and deeper did not decrease below 22 A degrees C throughout the austral winter. The thermoregulatory data for M. ingens did not differ from those that characterize mainland Afrotropical rodents. However, BMR and T (b) were lower than those of Holarctic rodents. Thus, contrary to expectations of Island Biogeography theory that rapid character displacement often occurs in morphological and behavioural traits when mammals colonize islands, M. ingens displayed climate-related physiological traits indicative of phylogenetic inertia. Presumably the tropical conditions that prevailed on Madagascar at the time of colonisation differed very little from those of the African mainland, and hence there was no strong driving force for change. Unlike small tenrecs and lemurs that radiated on Madagascar prior to the Oligocene, traits associated with an insular existence, such as daily torpor and hibernation, were not evident in M. ingens.","[Lobban, Kerileigh D.; Lovegrove, Barry G.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa; [Rakotondravony, Daniel] Univ Antananarivo, Fac Sci, Dept Biol Anim, Antananarivo, Madagascar",University of Kwazulu Natal; University Antananarivo,"Lovegrove, BG (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa.",kerilobban@gmail.com; lovegrove@ukzn.ac.za,,,UKZN; NRF; Gay Langmuir Foundation,UKZN; NRF; Gay Langmuir Foundation,"This research was financed by publication incentive grants from UKZN, and grants from the NRF, to BGL.

In 2020, China also pledged itself to the goal of carbon neutrality, which creates an urgent demand for this country to establish a systematic and integrated national climate governance system. Against this background, this paper conducts a systematic literature review of climate governance systems from the perspectives of top-level design and the governance paradigm to bring insights into climate governance toward carbon neutrality. The results show that although there are interactions between decarbonization and other environmental, social and economic fields, research gaps still exist when enhancing climate governance toward carbon neutrality. For example, issues regarding incorporating climate factors into the overall economic and social layout, strengthening the capacity of data collection relevant to climate adaptation, integrating climate mitigation and adaption actions, as well as connecting domestic climate governance and international cooperation, need to be further addressed. In addition, within the national governance system, studies combining both regional and sectoral concerns and the intertemporal dynamic allocation mechanism need to be further addressed when China decomposes its national climate target. Moreover, the division of power between the central government and local government, as well as the communication scheme between government and non-state actors, also turns out to be important for effective governance. Based on this analysis, policy implications are further proposed for China's formulation and implementation of long-term strategies of climate governance toward carbon neutrality.","[Tan, Xian-Chun; Wang, Yi; Gu, Bai-He; Kong, Ling-Si; Zeng, An] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Tan, Xian-Chun; Wang, Yi; Kong, Ling-Si] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Gu, BH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",gubaihe@casisd.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0606504, 2018YFC1509008]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72140007, 71804178, 71573249]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Financial support was obtained from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grants No. 2018YFA0606504, 2018YFC1509008) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 72140007, 71804178, 71573249).",,110,4,4,22,22,KEAI PUBLISHING LTD,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING, DONGCHENG DISTRICT 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",2096-9457,2667-3258,,FUND RES-CHINA,Fundamental Res.,MAY,2022,2,3,,,,,384,391,,10.1016/j.fmre.2022.03.010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fmre.2022.03.010,,MAY 2022,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,6G5VN,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000884823200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Consequently, decision-makers are often left making value-laden judgments of what to preserve, restore, and maintain in their best judgments, which can leave them open to criticism for not protecting the cultural resources most important to various and diverse stakeholder groups. Thus, a transparent and robust process to optimally maintain cultural heritage values for present and future generations is needed. We address this knowledge gap by developing a novel, transparent, and value-based measurement framework for assessing relative historical significance and use potential of diverse historic buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places (United States). Measures of historical significance include: the association of a building with the purpose of a NPS site's foundation, the current physical condition of a building, the building's historic character, and National Register listing criteria. Specific measures of use potential consider the importance of historic building's operational, third party, visitor, interpretative, and scientific uses. The application of the framework is presented using a subset of buildings located within two separately listed historic districts at Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina. The framework focuses on the current status of the cultural resource's significance and use potential while acknowledging that corresponding attributes, metrics and weights can change over time and should be regularly updated. It is hoped that the historical significance and use potential framework can assist the decision-makers and stakeholders, and better inform both the cultural heritage management and allocation prioritization for climate adaptation planning when it is applied in tandem with climate change vulnerability assessments.

Historical sea level records indicate that relative sea level (RSL) has been increasing along the Danish North Sea coast, south of Skagerrak, following the global mean sea level (GMSL) rise. In the central Skagerrak-Kattegat Seas, RSL rise has been practically absent, due to the GMSL rise being off-set by the Fennoscandian post-glacial land-uplift. The new IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) reported that under RCP8.5 GMSL will increase more than the previous estimates in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) at the end of twenty-first century due to Antarctic ice sheet dynamics. We performed a regionalization of the SROCC sea level projections for the Danish Climate Atlas dataset, a nation-wide climate adaptation dataset based on IPCC and various national and international databases. In these complementary datasets, important local data have been considered, which have not been included in the IPCC SROCC GMSL rise estimates, i.e., more precise national-wide land-rise prediction and sets of sea level fingerprints. Our results indicate that sea level projections under RCP8.5 results in a > 40 cm RSL rise at the end of the twenty-first century in the Skagerrak Kattegat Seas, which might call for a new adaptation strategy in this region. The rate of mean sea level rise will exceed the rate of the land-rise earlier than the previous estimates by AR5 under the RCP8.5 scenario. In particular, we stress how these new estimates will affect future extreme sea levels in this region. Based on our results, we suggest this more recent GMSL projection needs to be considered in coastal risk assessments in the Skagerrak-Kattegat Seas also in this century.","[Su, Jian; Andree, Elin; Nielsen, Jacob W.; Olsen, Steffen M.; Madsen, Kristine S.] Danish Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Andree, Elin] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, Lyngby, Denmark",Danish Meteorological Institute DMI; Technical University of Denmark,"Su, J (corresponding author), Danish Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark.",jis@dmi.dk,,"Andree, Elin/0000-0003-3268-3101",Danish State through the Danish Climate Atlas,Danish State through the Danish Climate Atlas,This research was funded by the Danish State through the Danish Climate Atlas.,,77,3,3,2,16,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

We consider a dynamic economy with the following ingredients: (i) natural capital is an input in local production that is degraded as a result of climate change; (ii) the government has two instruments to cope with climate-related damages: it can adjust the population size thanks to migration policies and/or it can undertake adaptation measures in order to slow the degradation of natural assets; (iii) expatriates send remittances back home. We identify two critical conditions on the fundamentals of the economy that helps under-stand the features of the optimal policy. We especially show that in most situations, the migration policy is a valuable instrument. Calibrating the model for Caribbean SIDS, we find that the optimal policy of the Caribbean region displays heterogeneity, that is explained by the different degradation rate, population size, and endowment in natural capital. We also highlight that the higher the climate damages, the higher the incentives to conduct an active adaptation policy, combining conventional adaptation actions and migration.

There is widespread recognition of the need to better understand poverty-vulnerability dynamics in order to improve risk management and poverty reduction investments. This is challenging due to the latent nature of adaptive capacities, frequent lack of baseline data, and the need for high-resolution studies. Here we respond to these challenges by analyzing household-level data in Northeast Brazil to compare drought events 14 years apart. In the period between droughts, the government implemented an aggressive anti-poverty program that includes financial and human capital investments. Poverty declined significantly, but the expected reduction in vulnerability did not occur, in part because the households were not investing in risk management strategies. Our findings complement other research that shows that households make rational decisions that may not correspond with policymaker expectations. We emphasize the need for complementary investments to help channel increased household wealth into risk reduction, and to ensure that the public sector itself continues to prioritize the public functions of risk management, especially in areas where the social cost of climatic risk is high.","[Nelson, Donald R.] Univ Georgia, Dept Anthropol, 250A Baldwin Hall, Athens, GA 30606 USA; [Lemos, Maria Carmen; Lo, Yun-Jia] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Eakin, Hallie] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Nelson, DR (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Anthropol, 250A Baldwin Hall, Athens, GA 30606 USA.",dnelson@uga.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Nelson, Donald R/C-3225-2014","Nelson, Donald R/0000-0002-7878-2853; Eakin, Hallie/0000-0001-8253-1320; Lemos, Maria Carmen/0000-0001-6686-730X","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-NOAA's program on Economics and Human Dimensions of Global Change [NA76GP0385]; National Science Foundation [SES 1061930, SES-1061966]",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-NOAA's program on Economics and Human Dimensions of Global Change; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Funding for 1998 data collection was provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-NOAA's program on Economics and Human Dimensions of Global Change (Grant no.

Adaptation refers to changes in societies and ecological systems as they respond to both actual and anticipated impacts of the changing climate. While adaptation is not limited to the level of planning and policy, existing adaptation practice privileges institutional action. We argue that the definition of adaptation should be broadened to include the small, incremental changes made in our daily lives to accommodate the shifting ecologies in which we live. Drawing on critical adaptation research and our own ethnographic fieldwork in the Global South, we define everyday adaptation as the shifted ways a person works, eats, lives and thinks in response to climate realities, rather than the hardening of coastlines or the relocation of vulnerable structures. We integrate and build on existing scholarship on adaptation and the everyday to theorize the logics of everyday, hyperlocal adaptation. This hyperlocal scale is a critical component of any definition of adaptation and a useful lens for studying the way much of the global population adapts and will continue to adapt their lives to climate change. We offer two theoretical components of adaptation revealed by the everyday - adaptation labor and value adaptation - as lenses to see changes in everyday action. Through considering hyperlocal action, we then identify and explore four logics of everyday adaptation actions: lifestyle stability, socio-ecological reactivity, livelihood flexibility, and community capacity. Everyday adaptations are limited by individuals' capacity to adapt and thereby determine the longevity, livability, and quality of life of places on the frontlines of climate change. We argue for understanding the aggregate effects of everyday adaptation in order to better align the actions of those living with climate change in their everyday lives and the large-scale adaptation projects aiming to protect them.","[Castro, Brianna] Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA USA; [Sen, Raka] Univ Penn, Dept Sociol, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Castro, Brianna] 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; University of Pennsylvania,"Castro, B (corresponding author), 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",briannacastro@g.harvard.edu,,"Castro, Brianna/0000-0002-8246-4487; Sen, Raka/0000-0002-6197-5691",National Science Foundation; Weatherhead Center for International Affairs; Gertrude and Otto Pollak Fellowship; Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship; Center for Advanced Study of India; David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Weatherhead Center for International Affairs; Gertrude and Otto Pollak Fellowship; Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship; Center for Advanced Study of India; David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies,"We thank Eric Klinenberg and the Social Consequences of Climate Change working group at the Institute for Public Knowledge for facili-tating this research.

A variety of adaptation policies, programs and practices have been adopted to this end, yet our understanding of if, how, and where adaptation is occurring is limited. In response, this paper develops a systematic approach to characterize the current state of adaptation in the Arctic. Using reported adaptations in the English language peer reviewed literature as our data source, we document 157 discrete adaptation initiatives between 2003 and 2013. Results indicate large variations in adaptation by region and sector, dominated by reporting from North America, particularly with regards to subsistence harvesting by Inuit communities. Few adaptations were documented in the European and Russian Arctic, or have a focus on the business and economy, or infrastructure sectors. Adaptations are being motivated primarily by the combination of climatic and non-climatic factors, have a strong emphasis on reducing current vulnerability involving incremental changes to existing risk management processes, and are primarily initiated and led at the individual/community level. There is limited evidence of trans-boundary adaptations or initiatives considering potential cross-scale/sector impacts.","[Ford, James D.; McDowell, Graham] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jones, Julie] McGill Univ Lib, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; McGill University,"Ford, JD (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",James.ford@mcgill.ca; grahammcdowell@gmail.com; Julie.jones@mcgill.ca,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; McDowell, Graham/0000-0003-2302-2598","Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, National Sciences and Engineering Research Council; International Development Research Centre, and ArcticNet","Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, National Sciences and Engineering Research Council(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); International Development Research Centre, and ArcticNet","This study was supported by funding from the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, National Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the International Development Research Centre, and ArcticNet.",,72,40,40,0,70,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

In this paper, we identify five scripture-based arguments against greenhouse gas mitigation put forward by a core group of Christian conservatives ('the Cornwallists'): the anti-paganism argument, the enrichment argument, the omnipotence argument, the lack of moral relevance argument and the cost-benefit argument. We evaluate to what extent the arguments express positions that can be characterised as climate science denialist and to what degree they are consistent with support for climate adaptation. Using Stefan Rahmstorf's (2004) taxonomy of climate science denial, we conclude that the Cornwallists could be labelled climate change deniers. However, their opposition is not only based on denial of climate science but often rests on premises that render the science irrelevant, a position we term 'relevance denialism'.","[Bjornberg, Karin Edvardsson] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Philosophy, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Rocklinsberg, Helena] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, SLU, Dept Anim Environm & Hlth, Box 7068, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Sandin, Per] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, SLU, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Bjornberg, KE (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Philosophy, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",karine@kth.se; helena.rocklinsberg@slu.se; per.sandin@slu.se,,"Sandin, Per/0000-0002-8567-1393; Rocklinsberg, Helena/0000-0002-2821-6837","Formas -The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning [211-2014-595]","Formas -The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning(Swedish Research Council Formas)","This research was funded by Formas -The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning under grant 211-2014-595.",,54,2,2,0,8,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0963-2719,1752-7015,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

Results indicate that the penetration of climate change concerns into regional development policies requires a better integration of different policies and improved connectivity and coordination between multiple actors operating across sectors, and at different spatial scales.

However, another but poorly studied main effect of global change appears to be an increase in temperature variability. Most of the current analyses of global change have focused on mean values, paying less attention to the role of the fluctuations of environmental variables. We tested the effects of daily thermal amplitude with constant mean (24-24 degrees C, 27-21 degrees C and 32-16 degrees C) on different performance traits (rollover speed, body mass balance and survival) in populations of woodlouse (Porcellio laevis) from two altitudes. We observed that maximum performance showed a significant effect of population in the first but not in the fifth week, and only the population effect was significant for optimum temperature. Interestingly, populations under higher amplitude in environmental temperature exhibited higher resistance to a fluctuating climatic regime. We suggest that our results indicate that thermal variability may produce important effects on biodiversity. Therefore, in order to develop more realistic scenarios of global climate change effects on biodiversity, the effects of thermal variability as well as mean need to be examined simultaneously.

In this context, this study identifies salinity and waterlogging tolerant crops essential for the sustained livelihood of crop farmers. We developed a multinomial logit model and a cost-benefit analysis for assessing the effectiveness of farmers' selection of crops. Estimating the regression model across 1380 farmers in Koyra Upazila, we find that households' socio-economic-demographic characteristics are important contributors to crop selection. Access to market information, the optimal fertilizer dose, an early warning system, social mobilization, training, credit facilities, farming experience, wage labor, pest control, weed control, and land tenure status are all important factors in crop selection. This study suggests that farmers in this Upazila can cultivate hybrid sunflower, mustard seed, cotton, maize, and wheat in salinity affected farms in dryer locations. Likewise, they can also cultivate Aman paddy in water salinity and waterlogging affected farms. Prediction of the impact of salinity and waterlogging on net revenue must highlight not only changes in yields per crop but also crop selection and switching.","[Iqbal, Md.

Concern over this is rising, as reflected in the increasing number of studies on the subject. However, the majority of these studies focused only on slopes and on a limited geographical scope. In this paper, we attempted to provide a broader picture of potential climate change impacts on the geostructures in Europe by gathering the collective view of geo-engineers and geo-scientists in several countries, and by considering different geo-structure types. We also investigated how geo-structural concerns are being addressed in national adaptation plans. We found that specific provisions for geo-structural adaptation are generally lacking and mainly come in the form of strategies for specific problems. In this regard, two common strategies are hazard/risk assessment and monitoring, which are mainly implemented in relation to slope stability. We recommend that in future steps, other geo-structures are likewise given attention, particularly those assessed as also potentially significantly affected by climate change. Countries considered in this study are mainly the member countries of the European Large Geotechnical Institutes Platform (ELGIP).","[Insana, Alessandra; Barla, Marco] Politecn Torino, Dept Struct Bldg & Geotech Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Beroya-Eitner, Mary Antonette; Zachert, Hauke] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Geotech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Franziska Braun Str 7, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; [Zlender, Bojan; Bracko, Tamara] Univ Maribor, Fac Civil Engn Traff Engn & Architecture, Smetanova 17, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [van Marle, Margreet] Deltares, Boussinesqweg 1, NL-2629 HV Delft, Netherlands; [Kalsnes, Bjorn] Norwegian Geotech Inst, POB 3930, N-0806 Oslo, Norway; [Pereira, Carlos] Natl Lab Civil Engn LNEC, Geotech Dept, Av Brasil 101, P-1700066 Lisbon, Portugal; [Prodan, Iulia] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Dept Struct, Soil Mech Lab, Str Memorandumului 28, Cluj Napoca 400114, Romania; [Szymkiewicz, Fabien] Univ Gustave Eiffel, Lab Sols Roches & Ouvrages Geotech, 5 Bd Descartes, F-77420 Champs Sur Marne, France; [Lofroth, Hjordis] Swedish Geotech Inst, SE-58193 Linkoping, Sweden","Polytechnic University of Turin; Technical University of Darmstadt; University of Maribor; Deltares; Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, NGI; National Civil Engineering Laboratory; Technical University of Cluj Napoca; Universite Gustave-Eiffel","Insana, A (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Struct Bldg & Geotech Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",alessandra.insana@polito.it; mary_antonette.beroya-eitner@tu-darmstadt.de; marco.barla@polito.it; hauke.zachert@tu-darmstadt.de; bojan.zlender@um.si; Margreet.vanMarle@deltares.nl; Bjorn.Kalsnes@ngi.no; tamara.bracko@um.si; cpereira@lnec.pt; iulia.prodan@dst.utcluj.ro; fabien.szymkiewicz@univ-eiffel.fr; hjordis.lofroth@sgi.se,,"Szymkiewicz, Fabien/0000-0003-1719-3243; Zachert, Hauke/0000-0003-0560-3313; INSANA, ALESSANDRA/0000-0001-8383-3718",ELGIP,ELGIP,"Except for the meeting travel fund provided by ELGIP, this research received no other external funding.",,56,2,2,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,DEC,2021,11,12,,,,,,,488,10.3390/geosciences11120488,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences11120488,,,24,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,ZV5HD,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000770560300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their unique nature means there is a need for more studies focused on the limits to CC adaptation on such fragile nations, particularly regarding their problems and constraints. This paper addressed a perceived need for research into the limitations of adaptation on SIDS, focusing on the many unique restrictions. To this end, the study identified and described the adaptation limits they have by using a review of the literature and an analysis of case studies from a sample of five SIDS in the Caribbean and Pacific regions (Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, Cook Islands, Fiji, Solomon Islands and Tonga). This research's findings showed that an adaptable SIDS is characterised by awareness of various values, appreciation and understanding of a diversity of impacts and vulnerabilities, and acceptance of certain losses through change. The implications of this paper are two-fold. It explains why island nations continue to suffer from the impacts of CC and suggest some of the means via which adequate policies may support SIDS in their efforts to cope with the threats associated with a changing climate. This study concluded that, despite the technological and ecological limits (hard limits) affecting natural systems, adaptation to CC is limited by such complex forces and societal factors (soft limits) that more adequate adaptation strategies could overcome.","[Leal Filho, Walter; Wolf, Franziska] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chan, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [Krishnapillai, Murukesan] Coll Micronesia FSM, Cooperat Res & Extens, Yap Campus, Yap 96943, Micronesia; [Sidsaph, Henry] Univ Chester, Chester Business Sch, Dept Management, Chester CH1 4BJ, Cheshire, England; [Nagy, Gustavo J.] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ecol & Ciencias Ambientales IECA, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay; [Luetz, Johannes M.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Social Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Luetz, Johannes M.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Law & Soc, Maroochydore, Qld 4556, Australia; [Dyer, Jack] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia; [Ha'apio, Michael Otoara] Solomon Isl Natl Univ SINU, Inst Ocean Isl & Sustainable Dev, Ranadi Campus,POB R113, Honiara, Solomon Islands; [Havea, Peni Hausia] Live & Learn Tonga, Level 1, Nukualofa 966, Tongatapu, Tonga; [Raj, Kushaal] Minist Econ, Climate Change & Int Cooperat Div, Suva 11462, Fiji; [Singh, Priyatma] Univ Fiji, Sch Sci & Technol, Lautoka 4245, Fiji; [Rogers, Tom] Coventry Univ, Fac Engn Environm & Comp, Sch Energy Construct & Environm, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Ctr Geopolit & Strateg Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Inst Global Innovat & Dev, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunlan] East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Boodhan, Monica K.] Univ Trinidad & Tobago, Fdn & Prior Learning Unit, Dept Phys, Trinidad 724, Trinidad Tobago; [Ayal, Desalegn Yayeh] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Food Secur Studies, Addis Ababa 150129, Ethiopia; [Azadi, Hossein] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Azadi, Hossein] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague 16500, Czech Republic","Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; Manchester Metropolitan University; University of Chester; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of the Sunshine Coast; University of Tasmania; Coventry University; East China Normal University; East China Normal University; East China Normal University; Addis Ababa University; Ghent University; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague","Li, CL (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Ctr Geopolit & Strateg Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Li, CL (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Inst Global Innovat & Dev, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Li, CL (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",walter.lea12@haw-hamburg.de; muru@comfsm.fm; h.sidsaph@chester.ac.uk; gnagy@fcien.edu.uy; j.luetz@unsw.edu.au; Jack.Dyer@utas.edu.au; mhaapio@gmail.com; ilaisiaimoana@yahoo.com; kushaal_raj@hotmail.com; priyatmas@unifiji.ac.fj; tom.rogers@coventry.ac.uk; 15598022233@163.com; monicakboodhan@gmail.com; franziska.wolf@haw-hamburg.de; desalula@gmail.com; hossein.azadi@ugent.be,"Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022; Azadi, Hossein/E-2361-2011; Wolf, Franziska/GWZ-9701-2022; Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; Luetz, Johannes M./AAH-5131-2019","Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Azadi, Hossein/0000-0002-5108-1993; Wolf, Franziska/0000-0002-9724-5586; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Luetz, Johannes M./0000-0002-9017-4471; Rogers, Thomas/0000-0003-2423-6678; Ayal, Desalegn Y/0000-0001-8966-2673; Sidsaph, Henry/0000-0003-0538-0906; Krishnapillai, Murukesan/0000-0002-3237-3149; Havea, Peni/0000-0002-5411-0358; Boodhan, Monica/0000-0001-7852-5120",,,,,118,6,6,7,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

By the end of this century, Serbia will experience an increase in temperature of up to 4 degrees C and a decrease in summer precipitation of up to 50%. Adaptation to those changes calls for the redefinition of a strategic approach and the integration of climate change challenges into the processes of local sustainable development planning. The objective of this study was to assess current local sustainable development strategies (LSDSs) and highlight some of the threats and opportunities which may help or hinder the adaptation process, the evaluation of development priorities, coordination mechanisms at the local level and risk management practice. Based on climate trends and vulnerability level, 20 of the potentially most vulnerable municipalities in Serbia were selected. The analysis shows that although local sustainable development planning still lacks cross-sectorial planning practice and risk management plans and measures, and does not yet recognize vulnerable sectors as climate sensitive, it can still serve as a platform for adaptation planning. Based on the assessed LSDS framework, the most suitable approach to the development of an adaption strategy is the vulnerability-based approach. At the same time, the potential for initiating adaptation planning is recognized in the utilization of already established networks with external and international donors and planning experts, joined county or regional adaptation planning, and cross-border collaboration.","[Vranic, Petar; Milutinovic, Slobodan] Univ Nis, Fac Occupat Safety, Nish 18000, Serbia",University of Nis,"Vranic, P (corresponding author), Univ Nis, Fac Occupat Safety, Carnojeviceva 10A, Nish 18000, Serbia.",petarvvv@gmail.com,,"Vranic, Petar/0000-0002-9671-992X; Milutinovic, Slobodan/0000-0002-4384-3687",South East Europe Transnational Cooperation Programme,South East Europe Transnational Cooperation Programme,The authors acknowledge the ORIENTGATE project (co-funded by the South East Europe Transnational Cooperation Programme) for providing and sharing data on CC scenarios (http://www.orientgateproject.org).,,75,5,5,0,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,1745-2627,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

In Switzerland, the development of climate change scenarios is strongly linked to the climate adaptation strategy of the Confederation. The current climate scenarios for Switzerland CH2018 -released in form of six user-oriented products -were the result of an intensive collaboration between academia and administration under the umbrella of the National Centre for Climate Services (NCCS), accounting for user needs and stakeholder dialogues from the beginning. A rigorous scientific concept ensured consistency throughout the various analysis steps of the EURO-CORDEX projections and a common procedure on how to extract robust results and deal with associated uncertainties. The main results show that Switzerland's climate will face dry summers, heavy precipitation, more hot days and snow-scarce winters. Approximately half of these changes could be alleviated by mid-century through strong global mitigation efforts. A comprehensive communication concept ensured that the results were rolled out and distilled in specific user-oriented communication measures to increase their uptake and to make them actionable. A narrative approach with four fictitious persons was used to communicate the key messages to the general public. Three years after the release, the climate scenarios have proven to be an indispensable information basis for users in climate adaptation and for downstream applications. Potential for extensions and updates has been identified since then and will shape the concept and planning of the next scenario generation in Switzerland.","[Fischer, A.

In this study, the vulnerability of Madagascar's health sector to climate change was assessed and appropriate adaptation measures were identified. In order to assess climate risks, vulnerability and identify adaptation options, the Madagascar Ministry of Public Health as well as the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service worked in close collaboration with a team of local experts to conduct a literature review, field surveys, and analyses of current and future climate and health trends. Four climate-sensitive diseases of primary concern are described in the study: acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrhea, malnutrition, and malaria. Baseline conditions of these four diseases from 2000 to 2014 show acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases are increasing in incidence; while incidence of malnutrition and malaria decreased over this period. To assess future impacts in Madagascar, this baseline information was used with climate projections for the two scenariosRCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5for the periods 2016-2035, 2036-2070 and 2071-2100. Future climate conditions are shown to exacerbate and increase the incidence of all four climate sensitive diseases. Further analysis of the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to the climate hazards suggests that the health sector in four regions of Madagascar is particularly vulnerable. The study recommends adaptation measures to improve the monitoring and early warning systems for climate sensitive diseases, as well as to reduce population vulnerability.","[Rakotoarison, Norohasina; Razafindramavo, Lalao Madeleine; Mafilaza, Victor; Tata, Venance] Minist Publ Hlth Hlth & Environm Serv, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar; [Raholijao, Nirivololona; Rakotomavo, Zo Andrianina Patrick Herintiana; Ramiandrisoa, Voahanginirina Anne Marie Pierrette; Rajaonarivony, Rhino; Andrianjafinirina, Solonomenjanahary] Madagascar Natl Meteorol & Hydrol Serv, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar; [Rakotoarisoa, Alain] Minist Publ Hlth, Direct Hlth Surveillance & Epidemiol Surveillance, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar; [Guillemot, Joy Shumake] World Meteorol Joint Off, WHO, CH-2300 Geneva, Switzerland; [Vololoniaina, Manuela Christophere] Minist Publ Hlth, Emergency, Epidem & Disaster Response Serv, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar; [Rakotomanana, Fanjasoa] Pasteur Inst Madagascar, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar; [Raminosoa, Volahanta Malala] WHO, Madagascar Off, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar",World Health Organization; Le Reseau International des Instituts Pasteur (RIIP); Institut Pasteur Madagascar; World Health Organization,"Raholijao, N (corresponding author), Madagascar Natl Meteorol & Hydrol Serv, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar.",norohasinarakotoarison@gmail.com; niriraholijao@gmail.com; razafindramavolalaomadeleine@gmail.com; yandrianina@yahoo.fr; arissoa@gmail.com; jshumake-guillemot@wmo.int; zjrandriamialisoa@yahoo.fr; mafilaza57@gmail.com; voahangy_ramiandrisoa@yahoo.com; rajaonarivony@gmail.com; njafys@yahoo.fr; tata_ssenv@yahoo.fr; manuelachristophere@gmail.com; fanja@pasteur.mg; raminosoav@who.int,,,GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit),GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit),This article is part of the report of the study entitled Evaluation de la Vulnerabilite et de l'Adaptation du Secteur Sante au Changement Climatique a Madagascar (2016).

However, clarity regarding how to produce transformational adaptation in practice is lacking, creating problems for project design and implementation. This paper examines (1) how transformational adaptation has been defined by major funders of adaptation; (2) how the concept has influenced funding priorities and the financing of projects. The study is based on a comparative analysis of the investment criteria, board meeting minutes, documents, and reports of the primary financial mechanisms under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: the Least Developed Country Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund, the Adaptation Fund and the Green Climate Fund. Our study demonstrates an increasing emphasis on transformational adaptation across funds over time, particularly in the Green Climate Fund. Transformative potential does guide funding decisions, but a clear understanding of whether transformational change is achievable, feasible, and desirable under all conditions has not yet emerged, an issue acknowledged by the funds and regularly discussed. Our analysis suggests that acknowledging tensions which arise with transformation in adaptation finance is critical because investment criteria and definitions of transformation impact the approaches to adaptation countries take.","[Kasdan, Marli] United Nations Dev Programme, Bur Policy & Programme Support, New York, NY USA; [Kuhl, Laura] Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kuhl, Laura] Northeastern Univ, Int Affairs Program, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kurukulasuriya, Pradeep] United Nations Dev Programme, Nat Climate & Energy & Environm Finance, Bur Policy & Programme Support, New York, NY USA",Northeastern University; Northeastern University,"Kuhl, L (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Kuhl, L (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Int Affairs Program, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",l.kuhl@northeastern.edu,,"Kuhl, Laura/0000-0002-1379-9435",,,,,78,14,14,5,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This study aimed to analyse and compare stakeholder-preferred water management options (WMOs) to face climate change related challenges and to foster adaptation in four Mediterranean river basins. The challenges and WMOs of the four river basins identified by stakeholders were analysed examining to what extent the WMOs tackled the identified challenges. The impact of the WMOs resulting from a participatory modelling method was included in a comparative analysis of the stakeholders' WMOs preferences. The results indicate the participatory approach that was applied allowed local priorities and real-world challenges to be defined with adequate detail as well as the definition of tailored responses. The participatory impact analysis provided an integrated view of the river basin as an interrelated system. The participatory evaluation of the WMOs was able to consider a wide range of elements and was able reflect the combined preferences of the stakeholders. Moreover, it allowed groups of basin actors with highly diverse profiles and concerns to further promote sets of these WMOs as input into decision making processes.","[Sanchez-Plaza, Anabel; Broekman, Annelies; Retana, Javier] Ctr Recerca Ecol & Aplicac Forestals, Cerdanyola De Valles 08193, Spain; [Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Unitat Ecol, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Bruggeman, Adriana; Giannakis, Elias] Cyprus Inst, Energy Environm & Water Res Ctr, 20 Konstantinou Kavafi St, CY-2121 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Jebari, Sihem] Natl Res Inst Rural Engn Water & Forests, Rue Hedi Karray, Ariana 2080, Tunisia; [Krivograd-Klemencic, Aleksandra] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Hajdrihova 28, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Libbrecht, Steven] Prospex BVBA, Vlugestal 6, B-3140 Keerbergen, Belgium; [Libbrecht, Steven] ESSET BVBA, Nieuwelaan 61, B-1860 Meise, Belgium; [Magjar, Manca] Inst Water Republ Slovenia, Einspielerjeva Ulica 6, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Robert, Nicolas; Verkerk, Pieter Johannes] European Forest Inst, St Antoni M Claret 167, Barcelona 08025, Spain; [Verkerk, Pieter Johannes] European Forest Inst, Yliopistokatu 6B, Joensuu 80100, Finland",Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universite de Carthage; University of Ljubljana,"Sanchez-Plaza, A (corresponding author), Ctr Recerca Ecol & Aplicac Forestals, Cerdanyola De Valles 08193, Spain.",a.sanchez@creaf.uab.es; a.broekman@creaf.uab.es; javier.retana@uab.cat; a.bruggeman@cyi.ac.cy; e.giannakis@cyi.ac.cy; sihem.jebari@gmail.com; aleksandra.krivograd-klemencic@fgg.uni-lj.si; steven.libbrecht@esset.eu.com; manca.magjar@gmail.com; nicolas.robert@gmx.net; hans.verkerk@efi.int,"Bruggeman, Adriana/J-6345-2013","Bruggeman, Adriana/0000-0002-6475-5221; Broekman, Annelies/0000-0002-8961-0467; Verkerk, Pieter Johannes/0000-0001-5322-8007; Giannakis, Elias/0000-0002-1779-9811; Sanchez-Plaza, Anabel/0000-0001-6676-5119",European Union [612385],European Union(European Commission),"This work has been funded through the European Union 7th Framework Programme, project BeWater (grant agreement 612385).

We developed recommendation domains with common degree of impact requiring incremental, systemic or incremental adaptation effort to provide decision support for interventions to scale out adaptive practices. We used Random Forests to divide the cocoa production belt into four zones with distinct climatic features under current and future climate conditions. To make model results actionable we used an expert validation approach. Cocoa experts evaluated and verified cocoa occurrence data for model input, prioritized climate and soil variables for modeling use and confirmed the validity of the distribution of climate zones. Climate change will reduce the available area for cocoa production in the north due to a shift of the northern transition to the Savanna zone. The current area for cocoa in central Ashanti will remain suitable but will face uncertain climatic conditions. Areas in the Western, Central and Eastern regions will likely become hotter and wetter. Each of these projected impacts will require site-specific adaptation strategies matching the degree of impacts. Failing to prepare may subject rural communities to high risks of losing their livelihoods. Our recommendation domains can support impact specific preparation so that the majority of Ghana's cocoa production area may be sustained despite adverse climatic changes. Institutional and private actors can use our work to scale out locally conceived interventions to alleviate impacts from drought, heat and erratic rainfall.","[Bunn, Christian; Lundy, Mark] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira,Apartado Aereo 6713, Cali 763537, Colombia; [Peter, Laderach] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Rome, Italy; [Quaye, Amos] Cocoa Res Inst, Tafo, Ghana; [Sander, Muilerman] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Noponen, Martin R.

It will also alter seasonal patterns of water availability and affect water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems with various implications for social and economic wellbeing. Policy development for water resource adaptation needs to allow for a holistic and transparent analysis of the probable consequences of policy options for the wide variety of water uses and users, and the existing ecosystem services associated with any stream basin. This paper puts forward an innovative methodological framework for planning development-compatible climate policies drawing on multi-criteria decision analysis and an implicit risk-management approach to the economics of climate change. Its objectives are to describe how the generic methodology could be tailored for analysis of long-range water planning and policy options in developing countries, and to describe the place of climate change considerations in water governance and planning processes. An experimental thought-exercise applying the methodology to water policy development in Yemen provides further insights on the complexity of water adaptation planning. It also highlights the value of conducting sensitivity analysis to explore the implications of multiple climate scenarios, and the importance of accounting for policy portfolios rather than individual policy options. Rather than constituting a tool that can generate clear measures of optimal solutions in the context of adaptation to uncertain climate futures, we find that this approach is best suited to supporting comprehensive and inclusive planning processes, where the focus is on finding socially acceptable paths forward.","[Miller, Kathleen A.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate Sci & Applicat Program, Res Applicat Lab, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Belton, Valerie] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Management Sci, Glasgow G1 1QE, Lanark, Scotland",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Strathclyde,"Miller, KA (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate Sci & Applicat Program, Res Applicat Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",kathleen@ucar.edu; val.belton@strath.ac.uk,,,UNEP; Government of Spain,UNEP; Government of Spain(Spanish Government),"The authors would like to acknowledge the valuable input provided by Sophy Bristow, ECN, The Netherlands to this paper, and the helpful comments provided by Dr. Raghuram Murtugudde, University of Maryland, and Dr. Chu Thai Hoanh, International Water Management Institute, Laos to the initial report and related work carried out as part of UNEP's MCA4climate initiative.

This is particularly the case where adaptive capacity is weak, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and the benefits of global mitigation in the short term will be experienced beyond 2050. A focus on adaptive capacity-building in these vulnerable settings is imperative. Much of the emphasis in climate change since the early 1990s has been on basic science and how public policy should respond to it; less attention has been paid to the governance implications and connections with wider development processes. This article explores the governance challenges of adaptation in the Santiago Metropolitan Region. It points to weaknesses in the water and energy sectors, which have highly sectoral, horizontally unintegrated institutional structures and instruments that pose significant challenges for adaptation. Such cases point to the need to engage with both the wider planning concerns of existing development strategies and the basic elements of transdisciplinarity, finance and human capital-building, in order to forge a more integrated adaptation response. Without an engagement with the governance issue and wider debates around metropolitan planning and socioeconomic development, it is unlikely the response will move beyond a limited physical infrastructure investment programme.","[Barton, Jonathan R.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, CEDEUS, Providencia, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Barton, Jonathan R.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Estudios Urbanos & Terr, Providencia, Santiago De Chi, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Barton, JR (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, CEDEUS, El Comendador 1916, Providencia, Santiago De Chi, Chile.",jbarton@uc.cl,"Barton, Jonathan/E-8512-2011","Barton, Jonathan/0000-0001-6250-8684","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0937777] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,55,33,35,0,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-1317,1468-2427,,INT J URBAN REGIONAL,Int.

Children are particularly vulnerable to GCC due to developing organ systems, psychological immaturity, nature of daily activities, and higher level of per-body-unit exposure. There is a rising trend in the disease burden of childhood asthma and allergies in many parts of the world. The associations of CC, air pollution and other environmental exposures with childhood asthma are attracting more research attention, but relatively few studies have focused on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. This study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap and conducted the first systematic review on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using a set of MeSH terms and related synonyms, and identified 20 eligible studies included for review. We found that there were a number of adaptation measures proposed for childhood asthma in response to GCC, including vulnerability assessment, improving ventilation and heating, enhancing community education, and developing forecast models and early warning systems. Several randomized controlled trials show that improving ventilation and installing heating in the homes appear to be an effective way to relieve childhood asthma symptoms, especially in win-ter. However, the effectiveness of most adaptation measures, except for improving ventilation and heating, have not been explored and quantified. Given more extreme weather events (e.g., cold spells and heatwaves) may occur as cli-mate change progresses, this finding may have important implications. Evidently, further research is urgently war-ranted to evaluate the impacts of CC adaptation measures on childhood asthma.

The best and most timely responses against climate change are suitable adaptation measures. Accurately perceiving the risks associated with climate change is an essential factor for planning and then implementing adaptations. Using farm household-level data of 400 rainfed farmers collected through a well-designed and field-tested questionnaire, this study examines the association between various adaptation stages (climate risk perceptions, adaptation planning, and implementation of adaptation) and their determinants using a multivariate probit (MVP) model. The findings indicate that farmers' perceptions of climatic changes are in line with historical climatic data. Climate risk management (CRM) trainings and digital agriculture extension and communication (DAEC) services (indicators of formal institutional arrangements) show a highly significant impact on all adaptation stages. Input market distance, farmer cooperative meetings (an indicator of informal institutional arrangement), off-farm income, education, and number of male family members are among the other key determinants. A highly significant association between various adaptation stages indicates that accurate climate risk perceptions lead to planning and implementation of adaptations. When risk perceptions are underestimated or lacking, then adaptations do not occur. The results further indicate that the timely availability of reliable information on advanced agricultural inputs, weather parameters, crop farming advisory services, and market information could help rainfed farmers devise sound adaptations to minimize risks associated with climate change. The study recommends the provision of CRM trainings and DAEC services to provide a better understanding and promote sound adaptation planning through the adaptive capacity enhancement of rainfed farming communities for sustainable production and livelihood","[Mahmood, Nasir; Arshad, Muhammad] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Working Grp Sustainable Land Use Developing Count, Res Area Land Use & Governance 2, Eberswalder St 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Mahmood, Nasir] PMAS Arid Agr Univ, Dept Econ & Agr Econ, Rawalpindi, Pakistan; [Mahmood, Nasir] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Arshad, Muhammad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Social Sci & Humanities S3H, House 448,St 11,Sect F-10-2, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Mehmood, Yasir] Natl Univ Med Sci, Dept Social & Behav Sci, Rawalpindi, Pakistan; [Shahzad, Muhammad Faisal] Abdul Wali Khan Univ, Mardan AWKUM, Pakhtunkhwa Econ Policy Res Inst PEPRI, Mardan, Pakistan; [Kaechele, Harald] Eberswalde Univ Sustainable Dev, Schickler Str 5, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Arid Agriculture University; Humboldt University of Berlin; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; Abdul Wali Khan University; Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development,"Mahmood, N (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Working Grp Sustainable Land Use Developing Count, Res Area Land Use & Governance 2, Eberswalder St 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.",nasir.mahmood@zalf.de,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Mahmood, Nasir/GYD-4957-2022; Shahzad, Muhammad Faisal/ABE-5537-2020","Shahzad, Muhammad Faisal/0000-0003-3855-6859","Punjab Higher Education Commission (PHEC) , Pakistan [PHEC/HRD/FS/119/2016/]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany; Fiat Panis, Germany","Punjab Higher Education Commission (PHEC) , Pakistan; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Fiat Panis, Germany","The first author acknowledges the financial support from the Punjab Higher Education Commission (PHEC) , Pakistan (Ref.

However, some important food exporting countries, like Australia, are predicted to be vulnerable to climate change and may require transformative adaptations if they are to continue their role in food exportation. This paper assesses the potential impacts of projected climate change by 2030 (0.4-1.6 degrees increase in mean temperature) on Australian mixed crop-livestock systems and examines the consequences of shifts in land allocations to cropping and grazing, in these systems, as an adaptation option. Farm bio-economic simulation models were developed for these mixed enterprise systems in several regions of Australia. These models were based on biophysically coupled crop, pasture, and livestock simulation models that in turn drew on site-based downscaled climate projection datasets. The farm models calculated farm profitability and risk measures. A range of land use changes was investigated. At drier locations facing adverse climate change, results showed a transition towards a greater emphasis on livestock production could be beneficial when assessed against multiple criteria of farm profit, downside financial risk, and environmental damage. We highlight some industry and government actions and policies that could facilitate these preferred adaptation strategies at such locations.","[Ghahramani, Afshin; Maraseni, Tek Narayan] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Sustainable Agr Syst, Inst Life Sci & Environm Australia, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Kingwell, Ross S.] Univ Western Australia, Dept Primary Ind & Reg Dev, Perth, WA, Australia; [Kingwell, Ross S.] Univ Western Australia, Australian Export Grains Innovat Ctr, Perth, WA, Australia",University of Southern Queensland; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Ghahramani, A (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm, West St, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",Afshin.Ghahramani@usq.edu.au,"kingwell, ross/AAK-2952-2021; Kingwell, Ross/AAU-9315-2020","Kingwell, Ross/0000-0003-0324-9488; Ghahramani, Afshin/0000-0002-9648-4606; Maraseni, Tek/0000-0001-9361-1983","Australian Government's Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Meat & Livestock Australia; Australian Wool Innovation","Australian Government's Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Meat & Livestock Australia; Australian Wool Innovation(Australian Wool Innovation)","The Australian Government's Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Meat & Livestock Australia and Australian Wool Innovation funded this research through the Filling the Research Gap program to be conducted in CSIRO.

For this purpose, a new economic feasibility analysis framework has been developed using real option analysis that can reflect robust and adaptive perspectives in decision making. To reflect uncertainty in climate (robust), the probabilities of drought occurrences are estimated by the results of dam storage simulation. To provide flexibility in decision making (adaptive), three different types of real options are used as a form of a decision tree. By re-evaluating economic feasibility of the Boryeong Dam conduit project, it is found that the abort option can be the best choice for minimal economic loss on the project. Further, more conditions for maximizing economic feasibility on the project are addressed from the sensitivity analysis. It is found that the invest option would be more economically feasible than abort option, when the probability of severe drought increases by approximately 20%. Thus, though the Boryeong Dam conduit project is not economically feasible for now, it might be an appropriate infrastructure if it is constructed in the future, when the probability of drought occurrence increases.","[Ihm, Sun Hoo; Seo, Seung Beom] Korea Environm Inst, Sejong 30147, South Korea; [Kim, Young-Oh] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Korea Environment Institute (KEI); Seoul National University (SNU),"Seo, SB (corresponding author), Korea Environm Inst, Sejong 30147, South Korea.",shihm@kei.re.kr; sbseo7@kei.re.kr; yokim05@snu.ac.kr,,"Seo, Seung Beom/0000-0001-9819-6555","Advanced Water Management Research Program - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korea [18AWMP-B083066-05]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017R1A6A3A11031800]","Advanced Water Management Research Program - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This research was supported by a grant (18AWMP-B083066-05) from the Advanced Water Management Research Program funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korea, and also supported by a grant (NRF-2017R1A6A3A11031800) through the Young Researchers program funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea.",,38,2,2,1,22,KOREAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-KSCE,SEOUL,"3-16 JUNGDAE-RO 25-GIL, SONGPA-GU, SEOUL, 05661, SOUTH KOREA",1226-7988,1976-3808,,KSCE J CIV ENG,KSCE J.

The complexity of the organizational structure required to deliver this breadth of functions, coupled to uncertainty surrounding the onset and severity of climate impacts at local scale, impedes planning for climate change. This paper describes the development of an adaptation planning tool and its application in a pilot planning process for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the agency of the New South Wales (NSW) Government (Australia) responsible for management of national parks and public conservation reserves. The process involved close engagement in knowledge co-production in participatory workshops, and employed two complementary techniques, adaptive pathways and risk assessment. It successfully elicited tacit knowledge of agency staff about the range of interventions available, the need for management practices to evolve, and of discontinuities in management pathways in a dynamic risk environment. Findings suggest that management effort across the NSW reserve system will increase as climate risk rises. Consequently, government will need to respond to increased demand for resources, for better targeting of those resources, and for management innovation in how resources are deployed to support adaptation that is both anticipatory and transformative.","[Jacobs, Brent; Boronyak, Louise] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Mitchell, Polly] Off Environm & Heritage, Impacts & Adaptat Team, POB A290, Sydney South, NSW 1232, Australia; [Vandenberg, Miriam; Batten, Bronwyn] Off Environm & Heritage, Natl Pk & Wildlife Serv, POB A290, Sydney South, NSW 1232, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; Office of Environment & Heritage - New South Wales; Office of Environment & Heritage - New South Wales,"Jacobs, B (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",brent.jacobs@uts.edu.au,,"Batten, Bronwyn/0000-0002-7924-6147; Boronyak, Louise/0000-0001-9932-0394",NSW Office of Environment and Heritage under the NSW Adaptation Research Hub,NSW Office of Environment and Heritage under the NSW Adaptation Research Hub,We thank the staff of NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service for their willingness to contribute their time and knowledge to this project.

With investments into promoting and supporting inter- and transdisciplinary learning in major programs on complex global challenges like climate change on the rise, scholars and practitioners are calling for a more grounded and empirical understanding of learning processes and their outcomes. Yet, methodologies for studying the interplay between learning and change in these initiatives remain scarce, owing to both the hard to measure nature of learning and the complexity of large-scale program implementation and evaluation. This paper proposes a new method for studying social learning in the context of large research programs. It aims to analyze the social learning of researchers and practitioners engaged in these programs and assess the contributions of this learning to the resilience of the natural and social systems that these programs seek to influence. We detail the theoretical basis for this new approach and set out six steps for developing multi-layered contribution pathways and contribution stories with stakeholders to document both the process and outcomes of social learning. The proposed method, we argue, can strengthen our analytical capacity to uncover the structural drivers and barriers to social learning that are often masked by the complexity of large-scale programs. An illustrative example, drawn from a large-scale climate adaptation research program, provides evidence on how this method might advance our methodological strategies for studying learning in these programs. We conclude by highlighting two key methodological contributions brought about through this approach, and by reflecting on opportunities for further methodological development. Enriching our understanding of learning and change processes, we argue, is an important avenue for understanding how we can pursue transformations for sustainability.","[Huang, Ying-Syuan; Harvey, Blane] McGill Univ, Dept Integrated Studies Educ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Huang, Ying-Syuan] United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil, Tokyo, Japan",McGill University; United Nations University,"Huang, YS (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Integrated Studies Educ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Huang, YS (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil, Tokyo, Japan.",ying.huang6@mail.mcgill.ca,"Huang, Ying Syuan/E-9660-2014","Huang, Ying Syuan/0000-0003-0148-6260",Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) [435-20191094]; Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Societe et culture (FRQSC) [2019-NP-253637],Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Societe et culture (FRQSC),This work was supported by Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) (Grant#435-20191094) and the Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Societe et culture (FRQSC) (Grant#2019-NP-253637).,,73,0,0,1,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2297-7775,,FRONT SOCIOL,Front.

In particular, they need to know the extent to which the capacity to adapt exists and whether it can be enhanced. We focus on the role of climate change awareness in influencing adaptive capacity within an Australian primary industry that is already experiencing the impacts of climate change. Climate change awareness is the extent to which primary producers relate to and prioritise climate change as a driver of change. We assess climate change awareness using four fairly representative statements. Adaptive capacity is the human potential to convert existing resources into successful adaptation strategies. We assess adaptive capacity on the basis of current knowledge as comprising four essential dimensions: (1) the management of risk and uncertainty, (2) skills in planning, learning and reorganising, (3) financial and emotional flexibility, and (4) interest in adapting. A telephone survey was completed by 69 peanut producers in Queensland representing 88% of the industry and a response rate of 90%. We empirically show that primary producers that have higher climate change awareness also have a higher capacity to adapt on at least three dimensions of adaptive capacity. Our results suggest that it may be worth investing in supporting climate change awareness within primary industries if broadscale climate adaptation planning is to be successful.

In addition, the appropriateness of the budgets allotted by the Korean government for these two policies in 2021 was examined by comparing them with the benefits to the people at the national level. The average annual WTP per household was estimated to be approximately KRW 27,457 and 25,854 for these two policies. The WTP was found to increase with adverse effects caused by extreme weather conditions; as people developed an interest in climate change, their income level increased and hence they showed preferences for policies by the ruling party. In addition, the benefits of the two policies at the national level were estimated to be worth KRW 573.6 and 540.1 billion, respectively. When the benefits were compared with the amount allotted in the budgets for them, the ratio of the budget to the benefit was found to be 77.55% for flood control in preparation for climate change and 4.46% for the reinforced protection of populations vulnerable to climate change. This confirms that the acceptability of the policy by the populations vulnerable to climate change is high, but the budget is not allocated as per the need.","[Park, JaeHyung; Woo, JongRoul] Korea Univ, Grad Sch Energy & Environm, Energy Environm Policy & Technol, KU KIST Green Sch, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul, South Korea; [Woo, JongRoul] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Policy Dept, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST),"Woo, J (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Grad Sch Energy & Environm, Energy Environm Policy & Technol, KU KIST Green Sch, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",jrwoo@korea.ac.kr,,"WOO, JONGROUL/0000-0002-3576-5180",KIST Institutional Program [2V09130-21-P036],KIST Institutional Program(Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST)),This work was supported by the KIST Institutional Program (Project No.2V09130-21-P036).,,41,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0958-305X,2048-4070,,ENERG ENVIRON-UK,Energy Environ.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/0958305X221130141,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X221130141,,OCT 2022,19,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5C7ES,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000864419700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However in Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) due to dynamic topology the nodes are prone to a variety of security attacks like modifying the data, sniffing the information, inhibited by limited energy, computational power and bandwidth. Black hole attacks are one of the possible attacks in MANET. We propose fuzzy logic strategy to detect black hole attack based on certificate authority, energy auditing, packet veracity check and trust node to improve the performance of AODV. Fuzzy schema is a mathematical logic that attempts to work out problems by assigning the prediction values to an imprecise range of data. Fuzzy logic detect misbehaving node by giving certificate to only trusted node. The proposed technique is more secure and reliable in military data communication.","[Arulkumaran, G.] Vivekanandha Coll Engn Women Autonomous, AP IT, Tiruchengode, Tamil Nadu, India; [Gnanamurthy, R.

We find that plans draw on multiple data sources to analyse future climate impacts and include a breadth of strategies. Most plans, however, fail to prioritize impacts and strategies or provide detailed implementation processes, raising concerns about whether adaptation plans will translate into on-the-ground reductions in vulnerability. Our analysis also finds that plans authored by the planning department and those that engaged elected officials in the planning process were of higher quality.

When the imperative of urban economic and spatial growth is taken as a given, the mechanisms that perpetuate it remain unexplored and unquestioned. Lack of attention to such mechanisms, and specifically the politics of urban land use, can lead to ineffective planning and maladaptation. In this review, we explore the intersection of scholarship on urban climate adaptation governance and the political economy of urban development to identify the specific contemporary mechanisms that perpetuate uneven patterns of urban vulnerability and undermine adaptation planning. We are guided by three questions: What are the mechanisms that urban managers employ to assign rights and responsibilities to land, and thus allocate spatial exposure to risk? How is land implicated in cities' efforts to finance themselves and their activities, and what are the implications for adaptation? What mechanisms enable urban actors to protect themselves from risk and respond to uncertainty? We emphasize the need to place urban climate governance within the broader political dynamics of urban development for more effective, equitable and ultimately sustainable vulnerability interventions. We find that instruments of urban development are often supporting the prioritization of economic rewards over equitable and just distribution of risk and rights to adaptation benefits. We conclude by highlighting the uncomfortable knowledge that if sustainable adaptation is to be achieved, the mechanisms of urban development and associated actors that shape, steer and utilize these instruments for a variety of means and goals, must be made visible and addressed.

The PSIDS have a high ranking in the Climate Risk Index and the World Risk Index. Financial losses due to climate-induced disasters, in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), are also high in the Pacific region. While climate risk insurance solutions could play a key role in the efficient distribution of recovery resources, there are many challenges to their successful implementation. Effective climate risk insurance products for the vulnerable sections of these societies are almost non-existent in this part of the world. Among the worst climate-induced disasters to affect the PSIDS are those related to cyclones and floods. These not only adversely impact the welfare of the households affected by these disasters, but they lower the long-term development potential of the countries involved. There is also evidence to suggest that climate-induced disasters are increasing in frequency and intensity over time due to climate change. It is against this background that an inquiry into the necessity for climate risk insurance products in the context of PSIDS should take place. This paper gives a comprehensive review of the literature addressing climate risk insurance as a risk mitigation or climate adaptation tool for managing the climate-induced financial vulnerabilities in the PSIDS. The paper explores the affordability of climate risk insurance, particularly among the vulnerable sections of society, and discusses the challenges of implementing an appropriate climate risk insurance model in the region. Finally, it examines recent climate risk insurance initiatives that have been attempted by multilateral agencies, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations' Pacific Financial Inclusion Practice (UNCDF), Pacific Insurance and Climate Adaptation Programme (PICAP), and respective local governments.","[Jain, Devendra Kumar] Univ South Pacific, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Laucala Campus, Suva, Fiji; [Chida, Asif] SIDS, Suva, Fiji; [Pathak, R.

We analyzed irrigation as an adaptation measure to ensure the future sustainability of olive tree yields in Alentejo, the main olive producing area in Portugal. A dynamic crop model was used to simulate olive tree yields over the baseline (1981-2005) and two future scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, 2021-2080), using a 4 member-ensemble of state-of-the-art climate model chains. Climate change projections point to an increase in mean temperature (of up to 2 degrees C by 2080) and potential evapotranspiration (40 - 50 mm), while a decrease in precipitation (-80 to -90 mm) and actual evapotranspiration (-50 to - 70 mm), under both future scenarios. Future yield decreases 15-20% (for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and accumulated losses can reach -8 t/ha to -10 t/ha by 2080. This decrease is due to enhanced heat and water stress under future climate conditions. As an adaptation measure, irrigation was simulated, but only applied at a certain water stress level. The results indicate higher yields due to this adaptation strategy, in range with the present values (+/- 1%), thus alleviating the projected yield decreases in the future. The amount of water required for irrigation ranges from 60 to 85 mm, depending on the RCP, which corresponds to 0.6-1 times the projected decrease in precipitation. However, this value can reach up to 2 times for one climate model chain. We conclude that while irrigation is a feasible adaptation measure against the threats of climate change in Alentejo olive orchards, this strategy may be threatened by the scarcity of water resources. Outlining appropriate, timely and cost-effective adaptation measures is critical for the sustainability of both the environment and the Alentejo olive sector.","[Fraga, Helder; Santos, Joao A.] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci CITAB, Vila Real, Portugal; [Fraga, Helder; Pinto, Joaquim G.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK TRO, Karlsruhe, Germany",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Fraga, H (corresponding author), Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci CITAB, Vila Real, Portugal.;Fraga, H (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK TRO, Karlsruhe, Germany.",hfraga@utad.pt,"Santos, João Andrade/G-8805-2011; Santos, João/HHZ-5595-2022; Fraga, Helder/D-8507-2012; Pinto, Joaquim G/A-7352-2009","Santos, João Andrade/0000-0002-8135-5078; Fraga, Helder/0000-0002-7946-8786; Pinto, Joaquim G/0000-0002-8865-1769",FCT -Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [CEECIND/00447/2017]; CoaClimateRisk FCT Project [COA/CAC/0030/2019]; National Funds by FCT [UIDB/04033/2020]; AXA Research Fund; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [COA/CAC/0030/2019] Funding Source: FCT,FCT -Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); CoaClimateRisk FCT Project; National Funds by FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,"Helder Fraga thanks the FCT -Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology for contract CEECIND/00447/2017.

Identifying these perceptions and understanding their determinants help public agencies and seed suppliers design tailored engagement strategies to maximize uptake. We perform the first classification of climate change perceptions among farming communities in Colombia. A latent class analysis (LCA) is applied to a survey designed to capture the climate change perceptions of 566 bean farmers in the Colombian department of Santander. A Multinomial Logistic Model is estimated to determine the drivers behind the climate change perceptions identified. Farmers located at lower elevations and who are further away from their urban centres tend to be more concerned about the future economic consequences of climate change. These farmers also tend to seek climatic information for making productive activities. Accordingly, strategies aimed at maximizing the uptake of new drought-resistant bean varieties should focus on these farmers as they seem to be more receptive to uptake them. Moreover, engagement strategies containing information on management alternatives to appraise uncertainties and mitigate some of the severe effects of extreme weather events will generate increased uptake.","[Botero, Hernan] Environm & Soc Res Grp, Land Econ, Kings Bldg Campus,West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland; [Barnes, Andrew] SRUC, Dept Rural Econ Environm & Soc, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Perez, Lisset; Rios, David; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Cali, Colombia",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Botero, H (corresponding author), Environm & Soc Res Grp, Land Econ, Kings Bldg Campus,West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland.",hernan.degiovanni@sruc.ac.uk,,"perez marulanda, lisset/0000-0003-1918-9547; Botero, Hernan/0000-0003-3461-5313; Rios Segura, David Andres/0000-0002-2349-2285; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/0000-0002-8044-583X; Barnes, Andrew/0000-0001-9368-148X","BBSRC grant Bean Breeding for Adaptation to a Changing Climate and Post-Conflict Colombia (BBACO) [BB/S018964/1]; BBSRC [BB/S018964/1, BB/R022860/1] Funding Source: UKRI",BBSRC grant Bean Breeding for Adaptation to a Changing Climate and Post-Conflict Colombia (BBACO)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),The authors are grateful for funding under the BBSRC grant Bean Breeding for Adaptation to a Changing Climate and Post-Conflict Colombia (BBACO) (BB/S018964/1).,,86,3,3,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Compared to more visible extreme weather events (e.g., typhoons), seasonal and inter-annual weather variations (e.g., in precipitation, wind, temperature) associated with otherwise normal weather systems are less often incorporated into adaptation planning. To better inform such planning, this study examines self-reported household impacts of atypical rainy and dry seasons, with a focus on gender. By collecting data from women and men in the same randomly sampled households, this study contributes an innovative intrahousehold analysis to the growing body of work at the nexus of gender, weather, and climate. The study finds gendered differences in reported impacts for rainier than usual rainy seasons but few differences for drier or longer than usual dry seasons. Climate adaptation plans should further incorporate seasonal and inter-annual weather variability and seek participatory input from both women and men so that a diversity of concerns is addressed.","[Mason, Lisa Reyes; Agan, T.

As the number of repairs and strengthening increases during the service life of a bridge, the cost and environmental impact gradually increase as well. This study aims to propose a framework with climate adaptability considering reliability, environment, and cost, to realize the optimization of the life-cycle maintenance strategy of bridges under climate change. In this study, four preventive maintenance and four essential maintenance of bridges were comprehensively considered, and the reliability, environmental impacts and cost of the bridge at the maintenance stage were quantitatively analyzed. By using the decision tree method, the optimal strategy of bridge life cycle maintenance and reinforcement under climate change scenario was proposed, with the environmental impacts, environmental cost, economic cost and comprehensive cost as the optimization objectives, respectively. Finally, a failure probability calculation model of emission reduction target of bridges was estimated, based on the CO2 emission reduction targets by China in the Paris agreement. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, a typical highway bridge was taken as an example. It can be observed from the results that the maintenance strategies determined with different optimization objectives show great differences in environmental and economic costs. With the deepening of climate scenario, the failure probability of bridge emission reduction of maintenance strategies with diverse optimization objectives will increase by 10%-20%. The findings highlight the climate adaptability assessment framework is of significant for optimizing the maintenance budget and environmental impact of aging bridge structures in China, and is expected to support decision-making for bridge maintenance under the influence of climate change.","[Liu, Yinshan; Pang, Bo; Wang, Yuanfeng; Shi, Chengcheng; Zhang, Boqun; Guo, Xiaohui] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Pang, Bo] China Waterborne Transport Res Inst, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shuowen] China Acad Bldg Res, Beijing 100013, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jingjing] Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Architecture & Civil Engn, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; Beijing University of Technology,"Wang, YF (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",cyfwang@bjtu.edu.cn,,,Major Program of National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China [18ZDA043]; Ove Arup & Partners Hong Kong Limited Foundation [C19L01610],Major Program of National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China; Ove Arup & Partners Hong Kong Limited Foundation,This study was supported by the Major Program of National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China (Grant No. 18ZDA043) and Ove Arup & Partners Hong Kong Limited Foundation (Grant No. C19L01610).,,50,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Emergent evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate risk management; Climate information services; Climate adaptation; Insurance; Malawi; South Africa; Tanzania,INFORMATION USABILITY; RISK-MANAGEMENT; SERVICES; ADAPTATION; CAPACITY; NEEDS,"This paper explores how climate risk information produced in the context of insurance-related activities can support public climate adaptation planning. The central contribution is to outline how relevant climate risk information can translate into behaviour change, and the drivers and barriers that influence this in Sub-Saharan Africa. The insurance industry has the potential to catalyse greater use of climate information, either through existing insurance transactions or through capacity building and investment in data sharing and collaboration. We investigate the interplay of climate risk information and insurance processes from two angles: the use of climate risk data by those who provide insurance - with information as an input to the underwriting process; and the catalyst role of insurance for governments to move towards anticipatory climate risk management. We apply a multi-method approach, combining insights from a survey of 40 insurance experts with key informant interviews and document analysis from three complementary case studies: indemnity-based insurance of private assets in South Africa; parametric sovereign risk pool in Malawi; and collaboration on risk analytics and risk management advice (no insurance) in Tanzania. The analysis offers a new perspective on the catalyst role of insurance by focusing on the ways in which political economy factors, particularly incentives and relationships, influence this process. Overall, there appears to be clear scope for a dynamic interaction between insurers and governments where symbiotic use and generation of climate risk information can advance mutual goals. However, that ambition faces many challenges that go beyond availability and suitability of data. Limited trust, unclear risk ownership and/or lack of incentives are key barriers, even if there is risk awareness and overall motivation to manage climate risks. The three cases show the importance of sustained cross-sectoral collaboration and capacity building to increase awareness and utilization of insurance-related climate risk information.

Employing stra-tegies such as planting early maturing or drought tolerant hybrid seeds is one common climate adaptive strategy for these households. However, seed choice has become increasingly complex for farmers. One way farmers look for clarity about seeds is to consult with other farmers. OBJECTIVE: We investigate smallholders' advice seeking within the context of a community water project in rural Kenya, a type of community-based common pool resource management organization. We examine a maize seed advice seeking network and compare it with a more general advice seeking network to better understand the social networks of maize seed advice seeking, and to characterize how peer-to-peer advice networks might factor into farmer decision-making about seeds. METHODS: We use exponential random graph modeling for the maize seed advice and general advice networks to test what factors predict advice-seeking among farmers in 104, or 92% of households in the community water project.","[Giroux, Stacey; Waldman, Kurt] Indiana Univ, Ostrom Workshop, 513 N Pk Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Giroux, Stacey] Indiana Univ, Dept Anthropol, 701 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Kaminski, Patrick] Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, 1020 Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Kaminski, Patrick] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, 700 N Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Waldman, Kurt; Blekking, Jordan] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, 701 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Evans, Tom] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog Dev & Environm, 1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Caylor, Kelly K.] Univ Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, 1832 Ellison Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Arizona,"Giroux, S (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Ostrom Workshop, 513 N Pk Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.;Giroux, S (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Anthropol, 701 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",sagiroux@indiana.edu,,,United States National Science Foundation [WSC-Category 2 Collaborative] [1830752]; NSF-NRT grant [1735095],United States National Science Foundation [WSC-Category 2 Collaborative]; NSF-NRT grant,"Funding This research was supported by the United States National Science Foundation [WSC-Category 2 Collaborative #1830752; Patrick Kamin-ski is supported by NSF-NRT grant 1735095, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems] .",,104,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-521X,1873-2267,,AGR SYST,Agric.

Samples were collected at various stages during the course of the experiment. The sprinkling intensity used in the experiment prevented efficiently drying-out of the logs. It also prevented blue-stain caused by fungal infections. Dry-stored logs had significantly lower and more inhomogeneous moisture content. The initial fresh-log moisture content could be preserved at an acceptable level (above 50%) by sprinkling the logs during the entire storage (eight weeks), whereas dry-stored logs lost remarkable quantities of moisture already after four weeks of storage. Accordingly the drying-out of dry-stored, debarked logs was even more pregnant.

Leveraging Tsiolkovsky's and Tsander's 1920s idea to use mirrors for space propulsion, Fuller's 1940s Dymaxion Grid, Glaser's 1970s study of solar power satellites, and Forward's 1970-90s concepts of statites and Starwisps, we propose placing one or more large (Sigma area = 700 K km(2)) lightsail(s) in a radiation-levitated non-Keplerian orbit(s) just sunward of the Sun-Earth Lagrange-1 point. The purpose of this syncretic concept is twofold: (I) As a parasol, it would reduce insolation on Earth by at least one-quarter of a percent, same as that which caused 1.8 degrees C drop during the Little Ice Age (similar to 155-1850), and same as the IPCC Third Report's mid-range value for global warming by 2050. Lowering temperature will reduce the atmosphere's water vapor content, which should reverse the increasing frequency and severity of storms, likewise reducing the damage accompanying climate change. It transforms the solar constant to a controlled solar variable. The sail would utilize the very photons it diverts from us to maintain its position without expensive fuel. (II) As a similar to 100+ K km(2) photovoltaic power station, the parasol could displace over 300 EJ/a (similar to 100 trillion kWh/yr) of fossil-fired electricity for its creators, roughly the entire global demand forecast by 2050, in turn displacing most carbon burners from the terrestrial grid, providing US$trillions in revenue from clean energy sales to amortize the scheme. This approach to geoengineering is not precluded by international treaty, but it is not a panacea either because it does not fix the other consequences of exponentially growing combustion of fossil fuels. However, it would buy time because it is self-funding (pay-as-you-go); furthermore it is linear, scalable, minimally intrusive, and above all, reversible. If Tellurian spacefaring civilization bootstraps its exponential growth with lightsails, there might eventually be enough of them to have a detectable effect on Sol's apparent luminosity as seen from far away, similar to the eponymous Dyson Sphere. So we tagged our concept with the moniker Dyson Dot. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This diversity needs to be considered when designing and assessing adaptation strategies to co-ordinate better with these diverse local conditions.Objective: We developed a participatory modeling approach to (1) design adaptation strategies in a viticultural watershed in southern France, (2) numerically and spatially evaluate their effects under future climatic condi-tions, and (3) discuss the results with stakeholders.Methods: We organized two sets of collective workshops, before and after a simulation phase. During the workshops, we designed four adaptation strategies that correspond to different ways to combine adaptation measures proposed by stakeholders. A spatially explicit model was used to evaluate the effects of six adaptation measures (late varieties, irrigation, reducing canopy size, adjusting cover cropping, reducing density, and shading) at field scale and combinations of them at watershed scale. Simulations were realized under a high emissions climate change scenario RCP 8.5. Model-based evaluations were followed by discussions with stake-holders. The cost-effectiveness of adaptation strategies was estimated at farm scale using an indicator designed by the stakeholders. Results and conclusions: The spatial combination of adaptation measures in a viticultural watershed provided options for adapting wine growing systems to climate change. A delayed harvest strategy with currently available late varieties provided only minimal relief from high temperature during ripening. A water stress limitation strategy would compensate for production losses if disruptive adaptations (e.g., reduced density) were adopted and if more vineyards were irrigated. A relocation strategy would encourage premium wine production in the constrained mountainous areas, where grapevines systems are historically adapted to limited water conditions. A soil improvement strategy was mentioned but not evaluated in the model due to scarce data and literature on the possible improvement of soil water holding capacity.Significance: The sharing of knowledge between researchers, technical experts, and wine growers enabled the construction of a common understanding of the local impacts and adaptation potential to climate change in the watershed. In further research, this knowledge could help decision makers to define pathways for adaptive ac-tions at farm scale.","[Naulleau, Audrey; Gary, Christian] Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro Montpellier, Ciheam IAMM, CIRAD,ABSys,INRAE, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Prevot, Laurent; Vinatier, Fabrice] Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro Montpellier, INRAE, LISAH,IRD, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Naulleau, Audrey; Hossard, Laure] Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro Montpellier, CIRAD, INRAE,Innovat, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Naulleau, Audrey] UMR Innovat, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France",CIHEAM; CIHEAM IAM Montpellier; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; Institut Agro; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD,"Naulleau, A (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, INRAE, CIRAD, UMR Innovat,ABSys, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",audrey.naulleau@cirad.fr,"Naulleau, Audrey/AGU-9912-2022; Prevot, Laurent/A-5929-2011","Prevot, Laurent/0000-0002-4627-4379; Vinatier, Fabrice/0000-0003-3693-4422","LACCAVE 2.21 project - meta-program Adaptation of Agriculture and Forests to Climate Change (AAFCC) of the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment (INRAE); Occitanie Regional Council; INRAE AgroEcoSystem division","LACCAVE 2.21 project - meta-program Adaptation of Agriculture and Forests to Climate Change (AAFCC) of the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment (INRAE); Occitanie Regional Council; INRAE AgroEcoSystem division","This work was supported by the LACCAVE 2.21 project funded by the meta-program Adaptation of Agriculture and Forests to Climate Change (AAFCC) of the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment (INRAE) .

Matabeleland South Province was a thriving livestock and small grain-producing province in the 1970s. Today, the province relies heavily on humanitarian assistance from government and humanitarian agencies. Through literature review, observations and focus group discussions with 129 farmers, the qualitative study established the perceptions of farmers around climate variability impacts in the past 20 years in Mangwe, Matobo and Cwanda districts in Zimbabwe. The study (1) analysed changes in climate and weather patterns in the past 20 years; (2) analysed climate impacts on traditional farming systems in the past 20 years in Cwanda, Mangwe and Matobo districts in Zimbabwe; and (3) established farmers' perceptions, experiences and their climate adaptive strategies. The findings showed that the farmers experienced annual heat waves, protracted droughts, chaotic rain seasons, frost and floods, which led to environmental degradation. Traditional farming systems or practices have been abandoned in favour of buying and selling and gold panning, among other alternative livelihood options, because of climate-related threats and misconceptions around the subject of climate change. Farmers fail to access timely and comprehensive weather forecasts, resulting in annual crop and livestock losses, as decision-making is compromised. Given that the smallholder farming system sustains the bulk of the population in Matabeleland South Province in Zimbabwe, climate education and capital investment is needed to change traditional farmer perceptions about climate change impacts on the farming practices. Increased climate awareness initiatives, establishment of village-based weather stations and the marrying of traditional farming climate knowledge to modern practices are highly recommended to enhance resilience to climate.","[Ndlovu, Everson] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Dev Studies, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; [Ndlovu, Everson] North West Univ, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Prinsloo, Barend] North West Univ, Dept Secur Studies & Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Le Roux, Tanya] Bournemouth Univ, Commun & Journalism Dept, Bournemouth, Dorset, England",National University of Science & Technology - Zimbabwe; North West University - South Africa; North West University - South Africa; Bournemouth University,"Ndlovu, E (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Dev Studies, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.;Ndlovu, E (corresponding author), North West Univ, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",mathiya3256@gmail.com,"Prinsloo, Barend Louwrens/N-1677-2016","Prinsloo, Barend Louwrens/0000-0002-7884-150X; Le Roux, Tanya/0000-0003-1796-1572",,,,,76,9,9,5,11,AFRICAN CENTRE DISASTER STUDIES,POTCHEFSTROOM,"INTERNAL BOX 265, NORTH-WEST UNIV, PRIVATE BAG X6001, POTCHEFSTROOM, 2520, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

To fill this knowledge gap, we leverage on 'big data' collected using smart water meters from over 40,000 Chinese urban households, spanning nine years and ten provinces to examine the relationship between daily household water usage and climate variability. At the baseline, we find that municipal water is not only a coping mechanism for heat, but its usage is accelerated during heatwave events. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that households from lower-valued properties are more likely to substitute water for electricity to counter heat. Importantly, we find evidence of adaptation behaviors where over time, households are using increasingly more water to cope with high-temperature days. In all, after feeding our results into climate projection models, it is estimated that household water usage will in-crease by around 7-44% in the long-term (2080-2099) under emissions scenarios of SSP245 and SSP370. Our findings are especially relevant for water-scarce countries such as China as well as developing countries where water is a cheaper and more accessible resource to cope with heat.","[Qin, Ping; Zhang, Xiao-Bing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Appl Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shuai] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Tan-Soo, Jie-Sheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore; [Zhang, Xiao-Bing] Tech Univ Denmark, Odense, Denmark",Renmin University of China; Zhejiang University; National University of Singapore; Technical University of Denmark,"Tan-Soo, JS (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore.",jiesheng.tan@nus.edu.sg,,"Zhang, Xiao-Bing/0000-0001-8155-5769",,,,,46,1,1,18,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Fungi from marine habitats are engaged and adapted to perform diverse ecological functions in marine environments. Several studies focus on how complex interactions with the surrounding environment affect fungal evolution and their adaptation. However, a review addressing the adaptation of marine fungi to climate change is still lacking. Here we have discussed the adaptations of fungi in the marine environment with an example of Hortaea werneckii and Aspergillus terreus which may help to reduce the risk of climate change impacts on marine environments and organisms. We address the ecology and evolution of marine fungi and the effects of climate change on them to explain the adaptation mechanism.

There is growing understanding of the array of factors that affect the strength or efficacy of these ecosystem services in different locations, as well as management interventions which may restore or enhance such values. Improved understanding and application of such knowledge will form a critical part of coastal adaptation planning, likely reducing the need for expensive engineering options in some locations, and providing a complementary tool in hybrid engineering design. Irrespective of future climate change, coastal hazards already impact countless communities and the appropriate use of ecosystem-based adaptation strategies offers a valuable and effective tool for present-day management. Maintaining and enhancing coastal systems will also support the continued provision of other coastal services, including the provision of food and maintenance of coastal resource dependent livelihoods.

We set out to answer this question in the context of Morocco and Turkey by taking into account the impact of climate change on agricultural international markets at the global level. We use the GTAP model, combined with a newly developed global database on climate change impacts on agricultural crop sectors by 2050 as captured by yield projections. Results suggest that the more trade is liberalised, the higher global welfare gains are. However, the gains are not large enough to offset the loss from climate change impacts on agricultural productivity globally. In Morocco, agricultural trade liberalisation, on average, induces additional welfare losses. The main drivers are the deterioration in the terms of trade that offsets all the potential gains from the better allocation of economic resources due to free trade. For Turkey, trade liberalisation induces net welfare gains under all scenarios. The larger the tariff elimination scheme, the larger the net gains due to the more efficient allocation of economic resources, which partially offset the impact of declining terms of trade.","[Ouraich, Ismail] Tillvaxtanalys, Osterdund, Sweden; [Dudu, Hasan] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain; [Tyner, Wallace E.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Cakmak, Erol H.] TED Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Ted University,"Ouraich, I (corresponding author), Tillvaxtanalys Growth Anal, Studentplan 3, S-83140 Ostersund, Sweden.",ismail.ouraich@tillvaxtanalys.se,"Dudu, Hasan/AAX-2338-2020","Dudu, Hasan/0000-0002-2820-1096; Cakmak, Erol H./0000-0001-9873-0113; Ouraich, Ismail/0000-0002-0111-9981",,,,,34,6,6,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1362-9387,1743-9345,,J NORTH AFR STUD,J.

However, there is limited knowledge on how the planning and promotion of synergies between M + A can be operationalized in the current efforts to mitigate climate change through forest carbon. This paper contributes to fill this knowledge gap by exploring ways of planning and promoting M + A synergy outcomes in forest carbon initiatives. It examines eight guidelines that are widely used in designing and implementing forest carbon initiatives. Four guiding principles with a number of criteria that are relevant for planning synergy outcomes in forest carbon activities are proposed. The guidelines for developing forest carbon initiatives need to demonstrate that (1) the health of forest ecosystems is maintained or enhanced; (2) the adaptive capacity of forest-dependent communities is ensured; (3) carbon and adaptation benefits are monitored and verified; and (4) adaptation outcomes are anticipated and planned in forest carbon initiatives. The forest carbon project development guidelines can encourage the integration of adaptation in forest carbon initiatives. However, their current efforts guiding projects and programs to deliver biodiversity and environmental benefits, ecosystem services, and socioeconomic benefits are not considered explicitly as efforts towards enhancing adaptation. An approach for incentivizing and motivating project developers, guideline setters, and offset buyers is imperative in order to enable existing guidelines to make clear contributions to adaptation goals. We highlight and discuss potential ways of incentivizing and motivating the explicit planning and promotion of adaptation outcomes in forest carbon initiatives.","[Chia, Eugene L.] CIFOR POB 2008, Yaounde 237, Cameroon; [Fobissie, Kalame; Kanninen, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Viikki Trop Resources Inst, Latokartanonkaari 7,POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Chia, EL (corresponding author), CIFOR POB 2008, Yaounde 237, Cameroon.",lohchia@gmail.com; fobissie.kalame@helsinki.fi; markku.kanninen@helsinki.fi,"Kanninen, Markku/AAW-9606-2021; Kanninen, Markku T/S-7684-2016","Kanninen, Markku/0000-0002-5708-9443; Kanninen, Markku T/0000-0002-5708-9443",Finish Ministry of Foreign Affairs,Finish Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"This paper was produced as part of WP3 (National Policies and Capacity strengthening) of the Building Biocarbon and Rural Development in West Africa (BIODEV) project, funded by the Finish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",,44,9,9,0,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,JAN,2016,7,1,,,,,,,24,10.3390/f7010024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f7010024,,,16,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,DC8TX,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000369493700015,View Full Record in Web of Science

To better understand the potential implications of the effects of climate change on coastal structures in Hong Kong and to ascertain necessary revisions to the current design standards to minimize the risk of coastal flooding, the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government conducted a study to review the climate change situation in Hong Kong and its implications to coastal structures design. Projection method has been developed to project the two major climate change factors pertinent to design of coastal structures, i.e. the mean sea levels (MSLs) and extreme wind speeds, to different time windows of the 21st century based on IPCC AR5 scenarios. CEDD seriously considered investing in the future coastal structures by designing the new structures with climate change revisions as one of the adaptation measures against the climate change impact and undertook benefit-cost assessment to evaluate whether the adaptation measure is effective in coastal structures design. Three types of common coastal structures to cope with climate impact, i.e. sloping rock armor seawall, vertical block work seawall and piled-deck pier, were investigated. The cost-benefit analysis results demonstrated that the benefits of increased protection on new coastal structures to cope with climate change effects outweigh the additional costs incurred to construct and maintain these structures.","[Chow, Ander; Leung, Terence] Ove Arup & Partners Hong Kong Ltd, Level 5 Festival Walk,80 Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lee, Francis] Hong Kong Special Adm Reg Govt, Civil Engn & Dev Dept, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,"Chow, A (corresponding author), Ove Arup & Partners Hong Kong Ltd, Level 5 Festival Walk,80 Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ander.chow@arup.com; terence.leung@arup.com; francismclee@cedd.gov.hk,,,,,,,12,7,7,0,23,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0578-5634,1793-6292,,COAST ENG J,Coast Eng.

This biophysical impact has been well studied for forestation cases, but the sign and magnitude for persistent earth greening remain controversial. Based on long-term remote sensing observations, we quantify the unidirectional impact of vegetation greening on radiometric surface temperature over 2001-2018. Here, we show a global negative temperature response with large spatial and seasonal variability. Snow cover, vegetation greenness, and shortwave radiation are the major driving factors of the temperature sensitivity by regulating the relative dominance of radiative and non radiative processes. Combined with the observed greening trend, we find a global cooling of -0.018 K/decade, which slows down 4.6 +/- 3.2% of the global warming. Regionally, this cooling effect can offset 39.4 +/- 13.9% and 19.0 +/- 8.2% of the corresponding warming in India and China.

A major physiological function of the nasal cavity is to condition the inhaled air to body core temperature and saturated with vapour to prevent damage to the alveolar epithelium in the lungs. The air conditioning capability of the nose is dependent on the nasal mucosal temperature and the airflow dynamics caused by the airway geometry. Morphological variation of the human nose has been attributed to the ecogeographic adaptation to climate where nasal cavities have been broadly categorised as tall and narrow (leptorrhines) or short and broad (platyrrhines) according to their morphology.

As part of the EU FP7 ACQWA project, the situation was analyzed for agriculture in the case of the Swiss Rhone catchment (Valais) where cultivation of permanent crops (orchards and vineyards) and livestock production are the most important agro-economic activities. The aim of this study was to use daily data from four downscaled and bias corrected transient climate change scenarios to analyze changes in water and temperature related indices over the period 1951-2050 for three locations (Aigle, Sion, Montana) that are representative of different production zones in the catchment. The results indicate that most relevant implications are caused by projected changes in temperature and not in precipitation. They indicate an extension of the thermal growing season with potentially positive effects on pasture and livestock production, most pronounced at the mountain site (Montana), but a trend towards increasing risks of frost in permanent crops and in heat stress for livestock at the valley bottom (Aigle, Sion). The increase in water requirement for irrigation in 2021-2050 relative to 1981-2009 is moderate (4-16%, depending on location). However, in years with low amounts of snow and rain, in small catchments with a nival regime, reduced water supply by rivers could restrict the surface area of grassland that can be irrigated, particularly during springtime. It is concluded that coping with heat-related risks may be most needed at the lower cropland and pasture sites while water-related issues would become more relevant in more elevated locations where pasture-based livestock production is the dominant type of agricultural land use.

Despite the need for forest adaptation, an overall evaluation of the efficacy of current management strategies is lacking. Here we describe a theoretical framework for classifying management strategies, explicitly recognizing trade-offs with other, untargeted ecosystem components. We then use this framework to provide a quantitative synthesis of the efficacy of management strategies in the Mediterranean basin. Our review shows that research has focused on strategies aimed at decreasing risk and promoting resistance in the short-term, rather than enhancing long-term resilience. In addition, management strategies aiming at short-term benefits frequently have unintended consequences on other adaptation objectives and untargeted ecosystem components. Novel empirical studies and experiments focusing both on adaptation objectives and multiple responses and processes at the ecosystem level are needed. Such progress is essential to improve the scientific basis of forest management strategies and support forest adaptation in the Mediterranean basin.","[Vila-Cabrera, Albert] Univ Stirling, Fac Nat Sci, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling, Scotland; [Coll, Lluis] Univ Lleida, Dept Agr & Forest Engn, Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Catalonia, Spain; [Coll, Lluis; Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi; Retana, Javier] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi; Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Catalonia, Spain",University of Stirling; Centre Tecnologic Forestal de Catalunya (CTFC); Universitat de Lleida; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Vila-Cabrera, A (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Fac Nat Sci, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling, Scotland.",albert.vilacabrera@stir.ac.uk,"ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Coll, Lluís/E-8724-2015; Martínez-Vilalta, Jordi/D-3385-2014","Coll, Lluís/0000-0002-8035-5949; Martínez-Vilalta, Jordi/0000-0002-2332-7298; Vila-Cabrera, Albert/0000-0001-7589-7797",ERA-NET FORESTERRA project INFORMED [29183]; EST_RES - Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL2015-70425-R]; EU; ICREA Academia award;  [CGL2013-46808-R],ERA-NET FORESTERRA project INFORMED; EST_RES - Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; EU(European Commission); ICREA Academia award(ICREA); ,This work was funded by the ERA-NET FORESTERRA project INFORMED (29183).

A number of scholars have suggested that insurance shifts the management of climate risks from governments to private actors and places the burden of risk on the shoulders of individuals. Drawing on and extending Michel Callon's work on the problematization of climate change, we suggest that such analyses overlook a significant dimension of the insurance industry's role in urban resilience. Namely, the tools and techniques of insurance are increasingly central to the constitution of climate change as a public problem that can be addressed by collective decision-making institutions.","[Collier, Stephen J.; Cox, Savannah] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept City & Reg Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Collier, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept City & Reg Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",stephenjcollier@berkeley.edu; savannah.cox@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,65,7,7,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Addressing management goals and values while considering the long-term risks associated with local climate change can make forested watershed management plans more robust to uncertainty and changing conditions. We provide a menu of tiered adaptation strategies, which we developed with a focus on forests of the Midwest and Northeastern U.S., as part of a flexible framework to support the integration of climate change considerations into forested watershed management and conservation activities. This menu encapsulates ideas from the literature into statements that signify climate adaptation intention and provide examples of associated tactics to help ground the concepts in specific actions.

In data-sparse areas of the world, where action is often most needed, the daunting scope of the problem can lead to inaction. This paper shows that climate adaptation planning can be accomplished successfully with publicly and globally available data by linking science and stakeholders through a facilitated process. Working with local stakeholders in the western Tanzanian Greater Mahale and Greater Gombe Ecosystems, future climate projections produced using Climate Wizard and analyses of literature provided an understanding of the climate vulnerabilities of local ecosystems and human livelihoods. Facilitated workshops enabled local stakeholders to use this information to develop conceptual models and hypotheses of change for these systems, and to identify possible modifications to conservation plans. Here, climate change planning required the modification of most current conservation strategies, developing some new strategies and abandoning others. The paper indicates that climate adaptation planning is achievable even in data-sparse rural and developing areas, but requires appropriate scientific analyses, engaged stakeholders and a facilitated process.","[Girvetz, Evan H.] Nature Conservancy, Cent Sci Div, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Girvetz, Evan H.] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Nairobi, Kenya; [Gray, Elizabeth] Nature Conservancy, Africa Program, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Tear, Timothy H.] Grumeti Fund, Arusha, Tanzania; [Brown, Matthew A.] Nature Conservancy, Africa Program, Arusha, Tanzania",Nature Conservancy; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Nature Conservancy,"Girvetz, EH (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, Cent Sci Div, 1917 First Ave, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",e.girvetz@cgiar.org,,,,,,,24,12,12,1,43,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0376-8929,1469-4387,,ENVIRON CONSERV,Environ.

We present here a description of the relatively complete ribcage of the Near Eastern Shanidar 3 Neandertal. We also furnish metric and non-metric comparisons of the Shanidar 3 ribs with other Near Eastern and European Neandertals, the Nariokotome (Homo erectus/ergaster) specimen, Levantine archaic/early modern humans, early and later European modern humans, and a sample of recent Euroamerican males, It is clear from these comparisons that Neandertals share with modem humans the fundamentally human thoracic bauplan that first evolved in the early Pleistocene. Yet it is also apparent that the ribcage of Neandertals differ in several anatomical details from those of fully modem humans. Rib curvature, posterior angle, mid-shaft cross-sectional size and shape, and muscle scarring varies considerably among Neandertals and across all samples when considered in isolated ribs. However, normalized metric and discrete patterning across the greater thorax clearly distinguishes Neandertals from our comparative samples. This is most marked in the inferior thorax where Neandertals (and probably earlier Homo) exhibit larger, more rounded and rugose ribs, and a greater costal area (thoracic volume). Greater lower rib cross-sectional robusticity and muscle scarring indicates relatively elevated ventilatory levels. Greater thoracic volume in Neandertals probably reflects greater body mass compared with modem humans since lung volume scales isometrically to body mass among mammals. Neandertal and modem human pulmonary capacity, normalized for body mass differences, was therefore roughly equivalent in the context of detailed differences in thoracic shape. To the extent that cold-climate adaptation is involved, Near Eastern Neandertals appear less hyper-polar in thoracic shape than their European counterparts as is also true for several other body proportion measures that are clinally distributed across the known Neandertal range.

Agroforestry provides assets and income from carbon, wood energy, improved soil fertility and enhancement of local climate conditions; it provides ecosystem services and reduces human impacts on natural forests. Most of these benefits have direct benefits for local adaptation while contributing to global efforts to control atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.

The concept of solution space is a recent contribution to help decision-makers identify feasible and effective adaptation solutions and to provide guidance on when they should be implemented and by whom. Although the current conceptualization of solution space already considers multiple disciplines, it remains dominated by biophysical ones and has not yet fully integrated legal and governance dimensions. This article first reflects on the current solution space framework through the lenses of law and governance and then proposes approaches to enrich legal and governance dimensions in the solution space concept. We argue that the legal and governance dimensions of the current concept of solution space can be improved by taking into account four aspects: 1) understanding the institutional and legal systems in a context-specific way; 2) embracing the dynamics and reflexivity of law and governance in the episteme of path dependency; 3) applying more diverse analytical methods (qualitative, qualitative/ quantitative, value-oriented) and/or assessments on a case-by-case basis; and 4) adding a normative perspective that includes the principles of legitimacy, transparency, accountability, equity, and distributive justice to measure the appropriateness of a certain adaptation strategy.

Here, we assessed the feasibility of adaptation options for the African context. Using the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative, a stocktake of adaptation-related responses to climate change from the peer-reviewed literature in 2013-2020, we found 827 records of adaptation actions in Africa. We categorised and evaluated 24 adaptation options and for each option, six dimensions of feasibility were considered: economic, environmental, social, institutional, technological, and evidence of effectiveness. Over half (51%) of all adaptation actions were reported in the food sector where sustainable water management (SWM) was the most reported option. The fewest actions were reported for cities (5%). The majority of actions (53%) were recorded in just six countries: Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria and South Africa. Encouragingly, effectiveness was assessed as medium or high for 95% of adaptation options. However, no options had high feasibility on any other dimension. Technological and institutional factors present major barriers to implementation. Crop management, SWM, sustainable agricultural practices, agroforestry, livelihood diversification, ecosystem governance and planning, health governance and planning, infrastructure and built environment, all had moderate feasibility across three or more dimensions. Human migration has low feasibility but high potential for risk reduction. Major knowledge gaps exist for environmental feasibility, for assessing adaptation limits at increasing levels of climate hazard, for economic trade-offs and synergies, and for Central and Northern Africa. Our results highlight sectors where enablers for adaptation can be increased. Future assessments can apply the method established here to extend findings to other national and local levels.","[Williams, Portia Adade] CSIR, Sci & Technol Policy Res Inst, Accra, Ghana; [Simpson, Nicholas Philip; Trisos, Christopher H.] Univ Cape Town, Africa Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Totin, Edmond] Univ Natl Agr Benin, Ecole Foresterie Trop, Ketou, Benin; [North, Michelle A.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Trisos, Christopher H.] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Williams, PA (corresponding author), CSIR, Sci & Technol Policy Res Inst, Accra, Ghana.;Trisos, CH (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Africa Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa.;Trisos, CH (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, Cape Town, South Africa.",adadeposh@gmail.com; christopher.trisos@uct.ac.za,"Simpson, Nick/AAC-4578-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Simpson, Nick/0000-0002-9041-982X; Zvobgo, Luckson/0000-0003-3400-8003; Williams, Portia/0000-0002-5919-3930; Trisos, Christopher/0000-0002-5854-1489; Totin, Edmond/0000-0003-3377-6190","UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada [109419-001]; DAAD climapAfrica programme-Climate change research - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); African Academy of Sciences - UK Government's Global Challenges Research Fund; Royal Society - UK Government's Global Challenges Research Fund","UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR); DAAD climapAfrica programme-Climate change research - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); African Academy of Sciences - UK Government's Global Challenges Research Fund; Royal Society - UK Government's Global Challenges Research Fund","This work was carried out with financial support from the UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada (Grant No. 109419-001).

This study addresses this problem by investigating the framing of climate change in eight print and online media outlets in Indonesia, the biggest emerging country in Southeast Asia. It identified three frames using cluster analysis: the climate impact and science frame, the climate politics frame, and the climate action frame. Further analyses revealed that print and online media used these frames selectively, as they relied on different news sources (national and international) and gave voice to various actors. These findings demonstrate the organizational influence on climate reporting. Furthermore, the study discovered that climate adaptation strategies were almost absent in the media coverage despite the urgency of this topic for the Indonesian public. Why the media ignore this important aspect needs to be investigated in future research focused on frame-building processes.","[Rochyadi-Reetz, Mira; Wolling, Jens] Tech Univ Ilmenau, Inst Media & Commun Sci, Ilmenau, Germany",Technische Universitat Ilmenau,"Rochyadi-Reetz, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Ilmenau, Inst Media & Commun Sci, Ilmenau, Germany.",mira.rochyadi-reetz@tu-ilmenau.de,,,,,,,69,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

These functions are particularly crucial in Australia, where climate change is likely to increase extreme weather events and impact water cycles. Yet despite multiscalar legal protections, Australia's total wetland cover is decreasing over time. We examine two contested wetland case studies and find that while legal mechanisms of protection exist in deliberative processes, good environmental outcomes are often undermined by the political mobility of competing commercial and industrial interests. Wetlands must be brought in from the periphery of social and political consciousness and placed at the heart of climate adaptation discourse and policy. Increasing the political mobility and agency of wetland protection has the capacity to simultaneously improve the environmental outcomes of deliberative processes and provide a legitimate pathway to greater regional climate resilience.","[Della Bosca, Hannah; Gillespie, Josephine] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Della Bosca, H (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",hannah.dellabosca@sydney.edu.au,,"Gillespie, Josephine/0000-0002-5103-3449",,,,,56,2,2,4,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Results show that the network can help in deepening knowledge and forging a culture of risk prevention. This is by incorporating risk management and climate change awareness in professional training and intensive activity to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs -11, 13, and 17). Results indicate the importance of gaining consensus (a notoriously difficult task in LA) between the authorities and the operational departments; the role of universities' social responsibilities; incorporating sustainability and risk management themes in the mainstream curricula; and developing a network by learning from similar groupings across LA to improve CRM within universities.","[Espinoza-Molina, Jorge; Acosta-Caipa, Karina; Chambe-Vega, Esther] Natl Univ Jorge Basadre Grohmann, Fac Civil Engn Architecture & Geotech, Tacna 23000, Peru; [Paucar-Caceres, Alberto; Burrowes-Cromwell, Toni] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Fac Business & Law, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [Del Carmen Silva-Cornejo, Maria; Quispe-Prieto, Silvia] Natl Univ Jorge Basadre Grohmann, Fac Hlth Sci, Tacna 23000, Peru; [Osco-Mamani, Erbert] Natl Univ Jorge Basadre Grohmann, Fac Engn, Tacna 23000, Peru; [Cordova-Buiza, Franklin] Univ Privada Norte, Res & Innovat Dept, Lima 15306, Peru; [Nicole Huerta-Tantalean, Lucero] Univ Privada Norte, Fac Business, Lima 15306, Peru",Manchester Metropolitan University; Universidad Privada del Norte; Universidad Privada del Norte,"Paucar-Caceres, A (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Fac Business & Law, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England.",a.paucar@mmu.ac.uk,,"Paucar-Caceres, Alberto/0000-0002-4690-561X; Acosta Caipa, Karina Yanina/0000-0003-1872-9062; Cordova-Buiza, Franklin/0000-0002-7623-7472; Quispe-Prieto, Silvia/0000-0002-1134-3557; CHAMBE VEGA, ESTHER/0000-0001-7723-4700","Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Peru [UPN-20223006]; UPN","Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Peru; UPN","This research was funded by Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN) Grant Number: UPN-20223006, Peru.

The great dependence that agriculture, and rice specially, has on fertilizers alongside extreme events that result from climatic change creates an urge for adaptation. Fertilizers are expensive, finite and a potential environmental problem. Their precise application, by the use of slow-release nanofertilizers, thus avoiding losses and consequently reducing the pressure on water resources, is one step forward in this adaptation. It can reduce costs and protect the environment while ensuring food production. Phosphorous is very important for rice, since it is involved in its flowering and root development, and its low availability to the plants constitutes a serious problem. The delivery of phosphorous through the crop cycle in the form of slow-release phosphorus nanofertilizer (Pnf) instead of the conventional annual bulk application reduces the amount of nutrients applied and increases the absorption by the crop. Combining the fertilizing effect with the use of natural stimulant compounds such as chitosan can protect the crop from diseases and increase its resilience to stress. The use of Pnf reduces the pressure on water resources and avoids imbalances in soil nutrients, thus responding to climatic change challenges and abiotic stresses.","[Saraiva, Raquel; Rodrigues, Goncalo C.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Tapada da Ajuda, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Saraiva, Raquel; Rodrigues, Goncalo C.; Oliveira, Margarida] Univ Lisbon, LEAF Linking Landscape Environm Agr & Food Res Ctr, Associated Lab TERRA, Inst Super Agron, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Ferreira, Quirina] Inst Telecomunicacoes, Ave Rovisco Pais, P-1000268 Lisbon, Portugal; [Oliveira, Margarida] Inst Politecn Santarem, Escola Super Agr, Quinta do Galinheiro, P-2001904 Santarem, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto de Telecomunicacoes; Instituto Politecnico de Santarem,"Saraiva, R (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Tapada da Ajuda, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal.;Saraiva, R (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, LEAF Linking Landscape Environm Agr & Food Res Ctr, Associated Lab TERRA, Inst Super Agron, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal.",raquelcosta@isa.ulisboa.pt,"Oliveira, Margarida/J-8454-2016; Rodrigues, Goncalo/R-9891-2019","Oliveira, Margarida/0000-0003-2491-0669; Ferreira, Quirina/0000-0002-7541-3104; Costa Saraiva, Raquel/0000-0002-7761-9931; Rodrigues, Goncalo/0000-0002-6189-2079","Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia under the scope of Raquel Saraiva's PhD grant [2020.06559.BD, PTDC/CTM-REF/2679/2020, UIDB/50008/2020, UIDB/04129/2020]",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia under the scope of Raquel Saraiva's PhD grant,"This work was funded by the Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia under the scope of Raquel Saraiva's PhD grant 2020.06559.BD, project PTDC/CTM-REF/2679/2020, UIDB/50008/2020 and under the UIDB/04129/2020 project LEAF-Linking Landscape, Environment, Agriculture and Food Research Unit.",,96,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,NOV,2022,10,11,,,,,,,183,10.3390/cli10110183,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli10110183,,,13,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,6V3IQ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000894946400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, I try to understand whether this joint liability is correlated with the adoption of strategies which reduce exposure to climatic risks.

Climate crisis, adaptation finance, and racialized austerity",ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Financialization of nature; green bonds; racial capitalism; climate adaptation; urban political ecology,,"As the effects of austerity continue to ravage cities and the impacts of climate change become more pronounced, municipal officials around the world are struggling to pay for climate adaptation. Some cities have already begun to anticipate the new infrastructures that climate change will require, while others have been forced to adapt in real time as climate crises have arrived in spectacular ways. Two of the most emblematic events are Superstorm Sandy, which drenched New York City in October 2012, and the drought-induced crisis of water scarcity in Cape Town, South Africa, which was most visible between 2016 and 2018. In both cases, the cities turned to green bonds, a form of municipal finance that foregrounds environmental ambitions. In this paper, we track the forms of adaptation projects that green borrowing are earmarked to fund. Drawing from scholarship on the financialization of nature alongside recent work on racial capitalism and austerity, we find that rather than transformative municipal change each city is largely carrying on with projects that reinscribe existing inequalities in the city. In addition to reflecting inequalities already present in the two cities, however, the use of municipal debt for adaptation intensifies risks, both financial and environmental, borne primary by the poor or working class people of color. Building on qualitative fieldwork in Cape Town, New York, and across the green bond investment chain, we argue that the risks posed by climate change in the city cannot be financialized away. Ultimately, we call for the end of municipal austerity driven by national and supranational budgeting choices in favor of increasing national funding of municipal adaptation by rescaling borrowing to higher political scales that can more progressively distribute risks.","[Bigger, Patrick] Univ Lancaster, Lib Ave, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Millington, Nate] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",,"Bigger, P (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lib Ave, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",p.bigger@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Bigger, Patrick/0000-0002-0022-6822",Economic and Social Research Council-Department for International Development [ES/M009408/1]; Swedish Research Council [2015-01694],Economic and Social Research Council-Department for International Development; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding for this paper came from the Economic and Social Research Council-Department for International Development joint fund for poverty alleviation research ES/M009408/1, for the project titled ``Turning Livelihoods to Rubbish?

Goal 4 of the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security promotes adaptation planning for small island ecosystems and communities threatened by climate change, but information to identify vulnerable islands and priority interventions is limited. This study adapted the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) framework in MBP with regional stakeholders to project trends in harvested or cultivated 'provisioning' ecosystem goods and services (EGS), human wellbeing, drivers of change and necessary management strategies, based on their tacit knowledge. In 2010 five island subregions which are susceptible to food insecurity were assessed. Workshop participants identified freshwater, garden food crops, coral, beche-de-mer, reef fish and sharks as the most important EGS in all subregions. Terrestrial EGS contributed 43% of aggregated ecosystem-derived well-being, and marine EGS 57%. By 2030 the overall condition of EGS was projected to decline by > 50%. The primary driver in all subregions was human population growth, and climate change impacts were predicted in only two subregions. Improved garden and agricultural productivity and population control were the highest ranked management strategies. Population relocation was also prioritised for two subregions where human carrying capacities may soon be exceeded. Although none of the strategies addressed climate change directly, all could yield climate adaptation and marine conservation co-benefits by enhancing ecosystem-based adaptation and community adaptive capacity. It is suggested that there is a 20-30 year 'adaptation window' in which to address population growth, which otherwise will continue to erode the capacity of communities and ecosystems to cope with potentially extreme climate impacts after mid-century.

In response, formal adaptation efforts are gaining momentum and financing globally, while those affected address felt changes through a variety of everyday adaptations, the aggregate daily practices articulated in response to ongoing social-ecological change. Our research examined the interplay between formal and everyday adaptations in practice. Specifically, we sought to shed light on the tendency emerging in adaptation literature of what we term interrupted agency, where formal adaptation interventions interrupt everyday adaptation strategies-and agency-of local actors, potentially leading to maladaptation. We did so in North Central Vietnam, where climate change is disrupting lives and livelihoods, and numerous formal and everyday adaptation measures are being implemented in response. We examined three key climate-affected sectors, agriculture, water management, and coastal management, drawing on existing literature as well as interviews and document and policy review. We found that differences in formal and everyday adaptations can indeed lead to interrupted agency yet, in some instances, also support complementarities and even transformative change. Such outcomes required dialogue and pluralistic input to adaptation -related policy, practice, and decision-making, underlining the importance of attention to participation, representation, and influence in decision-making in adaptation efforts. Our exploration of the concepts of everyday adaptation and interrupted agency illustrates that these can valuably contribute to adaptation literature, particularly on the politics of adaptation.","[Lindegaard, Lily S.] Danish Inst Int Studies, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Sen, Le T.

The main objective is to evaluate apple tree responses to two sustainable deficit irrigation strategies with 75% (T2) and 50% (T3) of calculated crop evapotranspiration (ETc), compared to a control irrigated with 100% ETc (T1). During the three experiment years. estimated reference evapotranspiration (ET0) was 630, 684 and 728 mm, respectively, in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Under the two restricted regimes, shoot length and fruit size evolution were not significantly affected. During the fruit set of 2017, no significant effects of sustainable deficit irrigation on the relative water content were observed, whereas they increased significantly during the fruit-swelling stage for the T3 treatment. Likewise, net CO2 assimilation (A(n)) was not affected by the irrigation dose, whereas it increased significantly and inversely proportional to the amount of applied water during fruit swelling. Thus, under our experimental conditions, the trees subjected to extreme deficit irrigation (T3) were not stressed at either stage. Moreover, deficit irrigation at 75% ETc increased apple yield significantly. In contrast, deficit irrigation at 50% ETc throughout the cycle was not enough to maintain an acceptable fruit size for the three studied campaigns. However, the best qualitative performance, notably for fruit firmness and sugar content, was attributed to this irrigation regime (T3). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Changes in the intensity, severity or magnitude of forest insect outbreaks, changes in extreme weather events, and changes in the intensity, severity or magnitude of forest fires were the three impacts most frequently identified as having had an impact on sustainability. More than half of the respondents indicated that commodity prices, availability of timber, trade policies, environmental regulations, and the ability to secure needed capital as presently having more of a negative impact on sustainability than climate change. The assessment of 65 potential adaptation options was structured according to the criteria of the Montreal Process. The majority of respondents considered the goals of adaptation to be synonymous with the criteria of sustainable forest management, indicating the Montreal Process criteria provide a suitable framework for assessing adaptation options in the forest sector.

In particular, I examine the structure and functioning of the public policy networks of the urban tree initiatives in order to investigate the expanding role of NGOs in public service delivery, especially related to sustainability and climate adaptation. This study concludes that urban partnerships often lack network structures that exhibit the centralization and hierarchy to roll out public programs smoothly. An overly horizontal structure leads to overlaps and gaps in management functions. Inadequate hierarchical control by public agencies increases the likelihood of gridlocks in service delivery. From an urban governance perspective, the prominent role of NGOs increases accountability of the public programs in certain limited capacities, while it creates systemic risks that compromise their legitimacy in ways that merit further investigation.","[Foo, Katherine] Worcester Polytech Inst, Int & Global Studies Div, Worcester, MA 01609 USA",Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Foo, K (corresponding author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Int & Global Studies Div, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.",kfoo@wpi.edu,,,,,,,35,14,14,1,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,JUL,2018,77,,,,,,67,72,,10.1016/j.cities.2018.01.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2018.01.002,,,6,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,GH2ZF,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000433269800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous reviews have examined how the temperature-mortality relationship varies by geographical location. There have been no reviews examining the empirical evidence for changes in population susceptibility to the effects of heat and/or cold over time. The objective of this paper is to review studies which have specifically examined variations in temperature related mortality risks over the 20th and 21st centuries and determine whether population adaptation to heat and/or cold has occurred. Methods: We searched five electronic databases combining search terms for three main concepts: temperature, health outcomes and changes in vulnerability or adaptation. Studies included were those which quantified the risk of heat related mortality with changing ambient temperature in a specific location over time, or those which compared mortality outcomes between two different extreme temperature events (heatwaves) in one location. Results: The electronic searches returned 9183 titles and abstracts, of which eleven studies examining the effects of ambient temperature over time were included and six studies comparing the effect of different heatwaves at discrete time points were included. Of the eleven papers that quantified the risk of, or absolute heat related mortality over time, ten found a decrease in susceptibility over time of which five found the decrease to be significant. The magnitude of the decrease varied by location. Only two studies attempted to quantitatively attribute changes in susceptibility to specific adaptive measures and found no significant association between the risk of heat related mortality and air conditioning prevalence within or between cities over time. Four of the six papers examining effects of heatwaves found a decrease in expected mortality in later years. Five studies examined the risk of cold. In contrast to the changes in heat related mortality observed, only one found a significant decrease in cold related mortality in later time periods. Conclusions: There is evidence that across a number of different settings, population susceptibility to heat and heatwaves has been decreasing. These changes in heat related susceptibility have important implications for health impact assessments of future heat related risk. A similar decrease in cold related mortality was not shown. Adaptation to heat has implications for future planning, particularly in urban areas, with anticipated increases in temperature due to climate change.","[Arbuthnott, Katherine; Hajat, Shakoor; Heaviside, Clare; Vardoulakis, Sotiris] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Social & Environm Hlth Res, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Arbuthnott, Katherine; Heaviside, Clare; Vardoulakis, Sotiris] Publ Hlth England, Ctr Radiat Chem & Environm Hazards, Environm Change Dept, Didcot OX11 0RQ, Oxon, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Public Health England,"Arbuthnott, K (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Social & Environm Hlth Res, London WC1H 9SH, England.;Arbuthnott, K (corresponding author), Publ Hlth England, Ctr Radiat Chem & Environm Hazards, Environm Change Dept, Didcot OX11 0RQ, Oxon, England.",Katherine.arbuthnott@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Vardoulakis, Sotiris/0000-0003-3944-7128; Heaviside, Clare/0000-0002-0263-4985",PHE PhD studentship scheme; National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Public Health England (PHE); University of Exeter; University College London; Met Office,PHE PhD studentship scheme; National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Public Health England (PHE); University of Exeter; University College London(General Electric); Met Office,"KA was supported by the PHE PhD studentship scheme.

The uptake of transformational adaptations, involving a significant re-structuring of the agricultural system, is however hindered by a lack of assessment tools capable of quantifying the effects of these often more complex, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes. Agent-based models can simulate decision processes and multi-level feedbacks between system components and may therefore illustrate how transformational adaptations emerge and help identify cases where their implementation is necessary and desirable. We explore this modelling potential and aim to quantify (1) how climate change, farmer behavior and water policies may influence strategic adaptation decision-making at the farm-level, (2) the extent to which implemented adaptations represent transformations, and (3) their impact on farm structure and wider socio-ecological change. We investigate these aims through a case study of crop farming systems in the drought-prone historical region of Romagna (NE Italy), integrating insight from stakeholder interviews, local reports, spatially-explicit biophysical data and behavioral theory in the construction of an agent-based model. Results show that, on average, more than half of all implemented adaptations are transformations, thereby requiring important social and financial investments from farmers. The number of implemented transformations is highest in scenarios where drought risk perception among farmers is more widespread, notably in scenarios simulating drier climates, more adaptive behaviors and policies promoting greater water use efficiency. Under higher drought risk perception, farmers are motivated to explore a broader set of adaptations, including those outside of the trajectory determined by their farming strategy. This process particularly favors the implementation of transformational increases in farm size and irrigated area, eventually stimulating farmers to adopt an expansionist strategy. Regionally, these adaptations lead to the smallest decline in agricultural extent with fewest, yet highest profit-earning farmers, largely exacerbating presently occurring trends. Under policy scenarios simulating increased irrigation availability, fewer farmers initially experience drought and therefore perceive a drought risk. Consequently, fewer farmers undertake transformational adaptations and switch from a contractive to an expansive strategy, culminating in a relatively smaller and less profitable agricultural extent despite a larger farmer population. As transformative changes to farming strategy trigger farmers to engage in new path-dependencies, aims of water policies may therefore rebound into unintended effects, emphasizing the importance of accounting for transformational perspectives.","[Zagaria, Cecilia; Schulp, Catharina J.

One no-policy scenario and two scenarios with population policy assumptions are employed in combination with water availability under the SRES scenarios Alb, B1 and A2 for the impact analysis. The population data used are from the World Bank. The river discharges per grid of horizontal resolution 0.5 degrees are obtained from the Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (TRIP) of the University of Tokyo, Japan. Unlike the population scenarios utilized in the SRES emission scenarios and the newest representative concentration pathways, the scenarios employed in this research are based, even after 2050, on country-level rather than regional-level growth assumptions. Our analysis implies that the heterogeneous pattern of population changes across the world is the dominant driver of water stress, irrespective of future greenhouse gas emissions, with highest impacts occurring in the already water-stressed low latitudes. In 2100, Africa, Middle East and parts of Asia are under extreme water stress under all scenarios. The sensitivity analysis reveals that a small reduction in populations over the region could relieve a large number of people from high water stress, while a further increase in population from the assumed levels (SC1) might not increase the number of people under high water stress considerably. Most of the population increase towards 2100 occurs in the already water-stressed lower latitudes. Therefore, population reduction policies are recommended for this region as a method of adaptation to the future water stress conditions. Population reduction policies will facilitate more control over their future development pathways, even if these countries were not able to contribute significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cuts due to economic constraints. However, for the European region, the population living in water-stressed regions is almost 20 times lower than that in the lower latitudes. For countries with high population momentum, the population policy scenario with fertility-reduction assumptions gained a maximum of 6.1 times the water availability in Niger and 5.3 times that in Uganda compared with the no-policy scenario. Most of these countries are in sub-Saharan Africa. These countries represent 24.5 % of the global population in the no-policy scenario, and the scenario with fertility-reduction assumptions reduces it to 8.7 % by 2100. This scenario is also effective in reducing the area under extreme water stress in these countries. However, the policy scenario with assumptions of population stabilization at the replacement fertility rate increases the water stress in high-latitude countries. Nevertheless, the impact is low due to the high per capita water availability in the region. This research is expected to widen the understanding of the combined impacts of climate change in the future and of the strategies needed to enhance the space for adaptation.","[Gunasekara, N.

However, little practical guidance exists on the potential opportunities offered by mobile phone data for enhancing adaptive capacities in urban areas. Building upon a review of spatial studies mobilizing mobile phone data, this paper explores the opportunities offered by such digital information for providing spatially-explicit assessments of urban vulnerability, and shows the ways these can help developing more dynamic strategies and tools for urban planning and disaster risk management. Finally, building upon the limitations of mobile phone data analysis, it discusses the key urban governance challenges that need to be addressed for supporting the emergence of transformative change in current planning frameworks.","[Dujardin, Sebastien; Linard, Catherine] Univ Namur, Geog Dept, Rue Bruxelles 61, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [Jacques, Damien] Dalberg Data Insights, Pl Champ Mars 5, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Steele, Jessica] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm Sci, Univ Rd,Bldg 44, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Steele, Jessica] Flowminder Fdn, Roslagsgatan 17, SE-11355 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Namur; University of Southampton,"Dujardin, S (corresponding author), Univ Namur, Geog Dept, Rue Bruxelles 61, B-5000 Namur, Belgium.",sebastien.dujardin@unamur.be; Damien.Jacques@dalberg.com; steele.jessica@gmail.com; catherine.linard@unamur.be,"Linard, Catherine/AAF-1670-2021","Linard, Catherine/0000-0002-0819-7755",BELSPO (Belgian Federal Science Policy Office) as part of the STEREO III program [REACT/SR/00/337],BELSPO (Belgian Federal Science Policy Office) as part of the STEREO III program,This research was funded by BELSPO (Belgian Federal Science Policy Office) grant number (REACT/SR/00/337) as part of the STEREO III program.,,71,5,5,2,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 2,2020,12,4,,,,,,,1501,10.3390/su12041501,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12041501,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KY3GT,,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000522460200219,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drawing on Kooiman's interactive governance framework, the study examines through collaborative methodology how adaptation agency and the space for adaptation is constructed and restricted in the case of an Indigenous reindeer herding community in Sweden. Findings demonstrate that climate change and variability is currently a matter of concern. The greatest problem, however, is the diminishing space for adaptation due to accumulated pressure of predation and competing land-uses in combination with herders' lack of direct and indirect power to influence the actors and institutional factors currently limiting adaptation options. This study carries relevance not only for reindeer herding communities in Sweden, but also for the general adaptation literature in demonstrating that limits and barriers to adaptation can be essentially political; requiring the making of hard choices and hence active governmental intervention. It also shows that marginalized groups, even in contexts where adaptive capacity is considered high, are likely to remain highly vulnerable with restricted adaptation opportunities unless deliberate structural and institutional transformation are initiated.","Umea Univ, Dept Polit Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Lof, A (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Polit Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",Annette.lof@pol.umu.se,,,,,,,64,20,20,3,57,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

An effective response system is required to adapt and reduce the impact on agricultural production. There have been calls on the role agriculture can play to reduce the impact without compromising food security. Hence, the present article discusses some of the major difficulties in water-smart sprinkler irrigation to adapt to the impact of climate change on agricultural production. In order to meet investment cost with water-smart sprinkler irrigation, the fixed water dispersion device for an impact sprinkler needs to be optimized to improve its performance under low pressure conditions. This is necessary to produce the desirable droplets sizes for minimising evaporation losses and distortion by wind, whilst maintaining the large distance of throw. Further research should be backed by strong institutional support towards a wide-scale adoption of water-smart sprinkler irrigation technologies. This could be of significant benefit to better water management in the artificially drained catchments and lessen the impact of climate change on agricultural production.","[Issaka, Zakaria; Li, Hong; Yue, Jiang; Tang, Pan; Darko, Ransford Opoku] Jiangsu Univ, Res Ctr Fluid Machinery Engn & Technol, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Issaka, Zakaria] Tamale Tech Univ, Dept Agr Engn, Tamale, Northern Region, Ghana; [Darko, Ransford Opoku] Univ Cape Coast, Dept Agr Engn, Cape Coast, Central Region, Ghana",Jiangsu University; University of Cape Coast,"Li, H (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Res Ctr Fluid Machinery Engn & Technol, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",hli@ujs.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51679109]; Special Scientific Research Fund of Agriculture Public Welfare Profession of China [201503130]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20170555]; Jiangsu Scientific Research and Innovation Program for Graduates in the Universities [KYLX15_1062]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Scientific Research Fund of Agriculture Public Welfare Profession of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Jiangsu Scientific Research and Innovation Program for Graduates in the Universities; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51679109), Special Scientific Research Fund of Agriculture Public Welfare Profession of China (201503130), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20170555), Jiangsu Scientific Research and Innovation Program for Graduates in the Universities (KYLX15_1062), the Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,105,5,5,15,57,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",2040-2244,,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

We do so by exploring the theoretical discourse on thenexusof climate change and heritage discourses and relating these to an analysis of mitigation and adaptation measures on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee in the Dutch river delta. It appears that the scale and political urgency of climate change induces involvement of many different governments, resulting in an inconsistent integration of cultural heritage in these plans and policies.

Formulating effective adaptation initiatives at the local level and integrating them into existing development plans are complicated. Therefore, the integration of adaptation into development plans by local governments in Indonesia is elucidated in this study. The development plans of four local governments in Indonesia were analyzed using the NVivo software in two coding analysis steps. Results of the coding process were then further analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. According to the results, the local governments have already considered adaptation as an important measure of climate change, but the information on climate change and adaptation are mostly general. The adaptation measures by the local governments, correspondingly, focus more on past and current climate-related hazards instead of future climate change. Local governments, therefore, still face challenges in shifting the focus to future climate change impact.","[Yulandari, Eka Dyana; Murayama, Takehiko; Nishikizawa, Shigeo] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Environm & Soc, Tokyo, Japan",Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Yulandari, ED (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Environm & Soc, Tokyo, Japan.",eka.dyana@yahoo.co.id,,"Yulandari, Eka Dyana/0000-0002-8219-2063",,,,,52,0,0,6,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

As more men seek employment opportunities away from home, women are required to acquire new capacities to manage new challenges, including risks from climate change. An action research was conducted to assess impacts of capacity building interventions for women left behind in enhancing adaptive capacity of migrant-sending households in rural areas vulnerable to floods in Nepal. This study finds that capacity-building interventions, which aimed to strengthen autonomous adaptation measures (e.g. precautionary savings and flood preparedness), also positively influenced women to approach formal institutions. Besides, the intervention households were more likely to invest a part of the precautionary savings in flood preparedness measures than control households.","[Banerjee, Soumyadeep; Hussain, Abid; Tuladhar, Sabarnee; Mishra, Arabinda] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Banerjee, S (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Kathmandu, Nepal.",soumyadeep.banerjee@protonmail.ch,"HUSSAIN, ABID/HLX-4328-2023","Hussain, Abid/0000-0001-8703-4681",Rural Livelihoods and Climate Change Adaptation in the Himalayas; Centre for the Study of Labour and Mobility; European Union,Rural Livelihoods and Climate Change Adaptation in the Himalayas; Centre for the Study of Labour and Mobility; European Union(European Commission),"This paper is based on research supported by the Rural Livelihoods and Climate Change Adaptation in the Himalayas (Himalica) Programme, which was implemented by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and funded by the European Union.

It is challenging, however, to navigate through the wide range of possible measures, taking into account the efficacy, economic impact and social justice aspects of these measures, as well as the governance requirements for implementing them. This article presents the approach of selecting and analysing adaptation measures to increasing extreme weather events caused by ongoing climate change that was developed and applied in the H2020 project BINGO (Bringing Innovation to Ongoing Water Management). The purpose of this project is (a) to develop an integrated participatory approach for selecting and evaluating adaptation measures, (b) to apply and evaluate the approach across six case-study river basins across Europe, and (c) to support decision-making towards adaptation capturing the diversity, the different circumstances and challenges river basins face across Europe. It combines three analyses: governance, socio-economic and social justice The governance analysis focuses on the requirements associated with the measures and the extent to which these requirements are met at the research sites. The socio-economic impact focuses on the efficacy of the measures in reducing the risks and the broad range of tools available to compare the measures on their societal impact. Finally, a tentative social justice analysis focuses on the distributive impacts of the adaptation measures. In the summary of results, we give an overview of the outcome of the different analyses. In the conclusion, we briefly assess the main pros and cons of the different analyses that were conducted. The main conclusion is that although the research sites were very different in both the challenges and the institutional context, the approach presented here yielded decision-relevant outcomes.","[Van Alphen, Henk-Jan; Bergsma, Emmy] KWR Water Res Inst, NL-3433 PE Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [Strehl, Clemens; Vollmer, Fabian] IWW Water Ctr, D-45476 Mulheim, Germany; [Interwies, Eduard; Petersen, Anasha; Goerlitz, Stefan] InterSus Sustainabil Serv, D-10405 Berlin, Germany; [Locatelli, Luca; Martinez Puentes, Montse] Aquatec Suez Spain, Barcelona 08038, Spain; [Guerrero Hidalga, Maria] CETAQUA Water Technol Ctr, Barcelona 08940, Spain; [Giannakis, Elias] Cyprus Inst, Energy Environm & Water Res Ctr, CY-2121 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Scheibel, Marc] Wupperverband, D-42289 Wuppertal, Germany; [Kristvik, Erle] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Rocha, Fernanda] Lab Nacl Engn Civil, P-1700066 Lisbon, Portugal",University of Duisburg Essen; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); National Civil Engineering Laboratory,"Van Alphen, HJ (corresponding author), KWR Water Res Inst, NL-3433 PE Nieuwegein, Netherlands.",henk-jan.van.alphen@kwrwater.nl,,"Strehl, Clemens/0000-0002-5290-9377; Locatelli, Luca/0000-0003-3859-3553; Giannakis, Elias/0000-0002-1779-9811; Guerrero Hidalga, Maria/0000-0003-4550-5013; Martinez Puentes, Montse/0000-0003-3017-5541",BINGO European H2020 project [641739],BINGO European H2020 project,This research has been supported by the BINGO European H2020 project (grant no. 641739).,,67,0,0,2,10,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,1684-9981,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

We provide a case study of the U.S. Southwest to investigate the interactions among forest restoration treatments that alter stand density, tree growth and drought resistance in trees of different size classes. Using cores taken from five positions in large trees (coarse roots, breast height, base of live crown, midcrown branch and treetop) and breast height in small trees, we investigated how radial growth response to thinning and precipitation availability varied in 72 ponderosa pines Pinus ponderosa Dougl. in northern Arizona. Ten years after thinning, growth of small trees did not respond significantly to thinning, whereas growth of large trees increased following moderate and heaving thinning, and this response was similar across within-tree core sample positions. The intensity of thinning treatment did not significantly affect dry-year growth in small trees. In large trees, dry-year growth after thinning was maintained at pre-thinning levels in moderate and heavy thinning treatments but decreased in the light thinning and control treatments. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that more aggressive thinning treatments used for forest restoration stimulate growth throughout large residual trees from coarse roots to branches and also improve drought resistance, providing a greater resilience to future climate-related stress.

The AET50 (50th percentile) for N. albicilla (39.6 degrees C) was higher than L. articulata (32.8 degrees C). Loggers (Hobo) in boxes on a seawall positioned for full exposure to air temperature at mean sea level (< 1.1 m) recorded temperature every 20 min during summer months. Temperature frequency distribution plots were generated for day and night, above and below 1.1 m (which is proximal to mean tide level for the region). Using the AET50, N. albicilla would need to thermoregulate for a lower percentage of time compared to L. articulata regardless of day and night. It is likely that designing eco-engineering improvements to include microclimate refugia are particularly relevant in tropical areas, where extreme environmental conditions mean that scale-specific actions are important components for climate adaptation.","[Waltham, Nathan J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Data Technol Hub, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Ctr Trop Water & Aquat Ecosyst Res TropWATER, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University,"Waltham, NJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Data Technol Hub, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",nathan.waltham@jcu.edu.au,,,"College of Science and Engineering, James Cook University, Australia; TropWATER (Centre for Tropical Water and Aquatic Ecosystem Research), James Cook University, Australia","College of Science and Engineering, James Cook University, Australia; TropWATER (Centre for Tropical Water and Aquatic Ecosystem Research), James Cook University, Australia","College of Science and Engineering and TropWATER (Centre for Tropical Water and Aquatic Ecosystem Research), James Cook University, Australia, funded this project.

The study described here focuses on identification of the structural features that define low-temperature adaptation in a Chionodraco hamatus protein, both for the reaction center, at an atomic level, and for the tertiary structure of the protein. To this aim, an x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy/Minuit x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy analysis of the reaction center was undertaken for both a structurally characterized human CAII and CA of C. hamatus. Higher structural levels were analyzed by sequence comparison and homology modeling. To establish whether the structural insights acquired in fish CAs are general, theoretical models were generated by homology modeling for three temperate-climate-adapted fish CAs. The measured structural differences between the two proteins are discussed in terms of the differences in the electrostatic potential between human CAII and CA of C. hamatus. We conclude that modulation of the interaction between the catalytic water molecule and the zinc ion could depend on the effect of the electrostatic potential distribution.","Univ Padua, Dept Biol, I-35121 Padua, Italy; Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, Nazl Frascati Lab, I-00044 Frascati, Italy; Univ Salento, Dept BIol & Environm Sci & Technol, Lecce, Italy",University of Padua; Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN); University of Salento,"Bubacco, L (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Viale Ugo Bassi 58B, I-35121 Padua, Italy.",luigi.bubacco@unipd.it,"Hatada, Keisuke/C-2008-2012; MAFFIA, MICHELE/AAC-2943-2020; Bubacco, Luigi/B-5602-2012","Hatada, Keisuke/0000-0002-3745-2014; Bubacco, Luigi/0000-0001-7927-9208",,,,,45,14,14,0,7,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0006-3495,1542-0086,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

Given the importance of temperature to regulate vital physiological processes, the availability of discrete cold-water patches (CWPs) in rivers to act as potential thermal refugia is critical to support freshwater ecosystem function. Being able to predict their spatial distribution at riverscape scales is the first step to understanding the capacity to maintain thermal refuges and to inform future river management strategies. Novel Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based Thermal Infra-Red (TIR) imagery technologies provide an opportunity to assess riverscape stream temperature. On the example of a 50 km linear length of the groundwater-dominated Upper Ovens River (Australia), this study presents a methodology addressing critical challenges in UAV-based TIR and optical data acquisition, processing, and interpretation. Our methodological approach generated 49 georeferenced high-resolution TIR and optical orthomosaicked imagery sets. The imagery sets allowed us to identify river-length longitudinal patterns of temperature and to detect, characterize, and classify 260 CWPs. Both stream and CWPs temperatures increased but presented considerable variability with downstream distance. CWPs were non-uniformly distributed along the riverscape, with emergent hyporheic water types dominating, followed by deep pools, shading, side channels, and tributaries. We found associations between CWPs and key physical controls including land use, riparian vegetation, longitudinal and lateral CWP location, and CWP area size, illustrating processes acting at multiple spatial scales. This study provides a basis for future works on the thermal associations with physical controls over a riverscape, and it highlights the major challenges and limitations of the use of UAV-based TIR and optical imagery to be used in future applications. In conjunction with studies of thermally linked ecological processes, the predictions of CWPs can help prioritize river restoration measures as effective climate adaptation tools.","[Casas-Mulet, Roser; Pander, Joachim; Geist, Juergen] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Aquat Syst Biol Unit, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Casas-Mulet, Roser; Ryu, Dongryeol; Stewardson, Michael J.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Engn, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Casas-Mulet, Roser] Cardiff Univ, Water Res Inst, Cardiff, Wales",Technical University of Munich; University of Melbourne; Cardiff University,"Casas-Mulet, R (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Aquat Syst Biol Unit, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.;Casas-Mulet, R (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Engn, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Casas-Mulet, R (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Water Res Inst, Cardiff, Wales.",roser.casas-mulet@tum.de,"Geist, Juergen/C-4933-2008; Ryu, Dongryeol/C-5903-2008; Casas-Mulet, Roser/D-4694-2015; Stewardson, Michael/C-8678-2015","Geist, Juergen/0000-0001-7698-3443; Ryu, Dongryeol/0000-0002-5335-6209; Casas-Mulet, Roser/0000-0002-7139-8859; Stewardson, Michael/0000-0003-1356-0472","North East Catchment Management Authority (NECMA, Victoria, Australia); Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship at TUM; ARC [DP130103619]","North East Catchment Management Authority (NECMA, Victoria, Australia); Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship at TUM(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); ARC(Australian Research Council)","The funding for the data acquisition and post-processing of this study came from the North East Catchment Management Authority (NECMA, Victoria, Australia).

We reviewed and thematically synthesized 42 household-level studies published from 2000-2019 to explain how multiple processes interact to affect the effectiveness of adaptation. The findings show the positive impacts of adaptation in increasing crop yields and income, improving food security, and enhancing environmental protection. Not all adaptation strategies are effective, due partly to differences in sensitivity to climate problems, access to livelihood assets, diversification of adaptation strategies, and flexibility and cultural relevance of institutional support. For households with lower adaptive capacity, limited adaptation choices and reliance on climate-sensitive strategies fail to unshackle them from cyclical vulnerability. Improving adaptive capacity and facilitating diversified adaptation strategies are important to address the livelihood challenges of smallholder farmers. Understanding the complexities underlying the effectiveness of adaptation necessitates evaluation focusing on multidimensional livelihood outcomes to disentangle implications for sustainable livelihoods and socio-ecological resilience.","[Etana, Dula] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Etana, Dula; de Cock Buning, Tjard] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Athena Inst Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Snelder, Denyse J.

In this sense, this paper put forward an understanding of the factors that drive individuals to adopt adaptive strategies to cope changing environments as a fundamental issue for the direction and effective formulation of well-targeted public policies. Mediation models were estimated considering two distinct specifications, based in two different groups of variables: (1) adoption of adaptive practices by farmers based only on the impact of climate perception, mediated by belief in the occurrence of climate change; (2) the socioeconomic conditions of the farmers and their properties were additionally included. The main results demonstrated that the Rio das Contas basin farmers' perceptions about the negative effects of climate change, despite being the main driver, will only affect adaptation behavior when the farmers have believe in the occurrence of climate change. Socioeconomic conditions are overshadowed in predictive power of adaptation by belief on climate change. This outcome may be directly related to the farmers' cultural aspects, nevertheless, the importance of technical assistance or rural extension services should be also emphasized as an impressive part of farmers is no longer adapted due to lack of knowledge of suitable techniques.","[Carlos, Sabrina de Matos; da Cunha, Denis Antonio; Pires, Marcel Viana; do Couto-Santos, Fabiana Rita] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Econ Rural, Programa Posgrad Econ Aplicada, Ave Peter Henry Rolfs S-N,Campus Univ, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Vicosa,"da Cunha, DA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Econ Rural, Programa Posgrad Econ Aplicada, Ave Peter Henry Rolfs S-N,Campus Univ, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",denis.cunha@ufv.br,"da Cunha, Dênis Antônio/L-6029-2013; da Cunha, Dênis Antônio/ABI-7436-2020","da Cunha, Dênis Antônio/0000-0003-4838-3795; Couto, Fabiana/0000-0002-6967-1078","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cienti'fico e Tecnologico-CNPq [408382/2013-9, 306647/2015-0, 421791/2016-0, 305807/2018-8]; Fundacao de Amparo a` Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais-FAPEMIG [CSA-PPM-00022-14]; CNPq; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-CAPES [001]",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cienti'fico e Tecnologico-CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao de Amparo a` Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais-FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"This research was funded by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cienti ' fico e Tecnologico-CNPq (Grant Nos. 408382/2013-9; 306647/2015-0, 421791/2016-0 and 305807/2018-8) and by Fundacao de Amparo a` Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais-FAPEMIG (CSA-PPM-00022-14) Granted for DAC.

Green urban infrastructure has been regarded as beneficial, e.g. by balancing water flows, providing thermal comfort. This article explores the existing evidence on the contribution of green spaces to climate change mitigation and adaptation services. We suggest a framework of ecosystem services for systematizing the evidence on the provision of bio-physical benefits (e.g. CO2 sequestration) as well as social and psychological benefits (e.g. improved health) that enable coping with (adaptation) or reducing the adverse effects (mitigation) of climate change. The multi-functional and multi-scale nature of green urban infrastructure complicates the categorization of services and benefits, since in reality the interactions between various benefits are manifold and appear on different scales. We will show the relevance of the benefits from green urban infrastructures on three spatial scales (i.e. city, neighborhood and site specific scales). We will further report on co-benefits and trade-offs between the various services indicating that a benefit could in turn be detrimental in relation to other functions. The manuscript identifies avenues for further research on the role of green urban infrastructure, in different types of cities, climates and social contexts. Our systematic understanding of the bio-physical and social processes defining various services allows targeting stressors that may hamper the provision of green urban infrastructure services in individual behavior as well as in wider planning and environmental management in urban areas.

The impacts were analyzed over the years 1961-2099, split into four periods for comparison purposes: control period (1961-1990), horizon 2020 (2010-2039), horizon 2050 (2040-2069) and horizon 2080 (2070-2099). The main results indicate that annual mean hydropower would decrease by 1.8% for the period 2010-2039 and then increase by 9.3% and 18.3% during the periods 2040-2069 and 2070-2099, respectively. The trend to increase is statistically significant starting from 2061 (Mann-Kendall with p = 5%). The change in the mean annual production is statistically significant for the 2040-2069 and 2070-2099 periods (t-test with p = 5%). Also, the change in the variance is significant for the periods 2010-2039, 2040-2069 and 2070-2099 (F-test). Annual mean unproductive spills would increase from 1961-2099, but the trend is not statistically significant. However, the changes in the variance of the annual mean spills are significant in the periods 2010-2039, 2040-2069 and 2070-2099. Overall, the reliability of a reservoir would decrease and the vulnerability increase as the climate changes.","[Minville, Marie; Brissette, Francois; Leconte, Robert] Univ Quebec, Ecole Technol Super, Dept Construct Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Krau, Stephane] Ecole Polytech, NSERC Hydroquebec Ind Res Chair River Syst Manage, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada",University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; University of Quebec Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal,"Minville, M (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Ecole Technol Super, Dept Construct Engn, 1100 Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.",marie.minville@etsmtl.ca; francois.brissette@etsmtl.ca; Krau.Stephane@ouranos.ca; robert.leconte@etsmtl.ca,,,,,,,32,106,107,2,72,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

In the face of the projected increase in losses and damages, the anticipation and measures needed for adaptation involve physical, socioeconomic and political dimensions at different governance levels and timescales. A large literature addresses these various issues, generally in a targeted way. Drawing on adaptive policy pathways approaches and on research results of the past decade in mainland France, this article proposes an interdisciplinary characterisation of long-term adaptation pathways in coastal areas. Among the different variables and processes of change that characterise coastal zones and their future, particular emphasis is placed on social and institutional dynamics.

Addressing current and future global change, particularly for competing water-governance objectives, requires planning flexibility that may be constrained by physical water-resources infrastructure. This paper reviews infrastructure, the institutions for its management, and adaptive governance. We emphasize mechanisms that enhance adaptive capacity by accounting for: (1) uncertainties in supply, demand, and extreme conditions; (2) institutional inertia and means to overcome path dependence; and (3) flexibility in planning and operation of infrastructure. We define and discuss the 're-adaptation challenge,' that is, accounting for infrastructure and institutions extant from past cycles of development while strengthening the capacity of planners, managers and other stakeholders to confront current complexities and future uncertainties. In so doing, we bring forward resilience as a water-governance goal, identifying infrastructure re-operations, other soft-path measures, and potentially, infrastructure removal as transformative adaptive pathways.","[Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Scott, Christopher A.; Shrestha, Padmendra P.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog Dev & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Lutz-Ley, America N.] El Colegio Sonora, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico",University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Scott, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.;Scott, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Geog Dev & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",cascott@arizona.edu,,,"Morris K.

It also includes assessments from short-and long-term perspectives, such as taking into account climate change. It combines classic risk analysis with life-cycle assessment procedure. It has been developed and tested in co-operation with municipalities. The tests show that the tool is applicable and can be relevant in the planning process.

Reference sites, from both pre-settlement era reconstructions and contemporary forests with active fire regimes, indicate that frequent-fire forests are complex mosaics of individual trees, tree clumps, and openings. There is a broad scientific consensus that restoration treatments should seek to restore this mosaic pattern in order to restore resilience and maintain ecosystem function. Yet, methods to explicitly incorporate spatial reference information into restoration treatments are not widely used. In addition, targets from reference conditions must be critically evaluated in light of climate change. We used a spatial clump identification algorithm to quantify reference patterns based on a specified inter-tree distance that defines when trees form clumps. We used climatic water balance parameters, down-scaled climate projections, and plant associations to assess our historical reference sites in the context of projected future climate and identify climate analog reference conditions. Spatial reference information was incorporated into a novel approach to prescription development, tree marking, and monitoring based on viewing stand structure and pattern in terms of individuals, clumps, and openings (ICO) in a mixed-conifer forest restoration case study. We compared the results from the ICO approach with simulations of traditional basal area and spacing-based thinning prescriptions in terms of agreement with reference conditions and functional aspects of resilience. The ICO method resulted in a distribution of tree clumps and openings within the range of reference patterns, while the basal area and spacing approaches resulted in uniform patterns inconsistent with known reference conditions. Susceptibility to insect mortality was lower in basal area and spacing prescriptions, but openings and corresponding opportunities for regeneration and in situ climate adaptation were fewer. Operationally, the method struck a balance between providing clear targets for spatial pattern directly linked to reference conditions, sufficient flexibility to achieve other restoration objectives, and implementation efficiency. The need to track pattern targets during implementation and provide immediate feedback to marking crews was a key lesson. The ICO method, especially when used in combination with climate analog reference targets, offers a practical approach to restoring spatial patterns that are likely to enhance resilience and climate adaptation.

A total of 384 respondent households were selected from four agro-ecological zones in the middle belt and southern part of the country for questionnaire administration and direct observation of animals under field conditions. The results showed that there are slightly more women (54.2%) keeping WAD goats than men (45.8%) and fall within the economically active population of youthful and middle age categories (53.9%). A majority of these goat keepers were married (73.8%) and educated (87.3%) in one way or the other. They obtained their starter or foundation stock mainly from neighbours (80.5%) and the open market (16.0%). The average flock size from the households sampled was 7.9 +/- 1.5, whereas the flock structure constituted 56.1% adult females, 27.5% adult intact males, 1.2% castrates and 15.2% kids of both sexes. Survivability, fast growth rate and larger litter size were the farmers' most preferred quantitative traits, whereas most of these respondents preferred to keep WAD goats which do not have qualitative traits such as horn, wattle and beard. From the findings of the research, it was concluded that the favourable socio-economic characteristics of WAD goat keepers could sustain intensification and increase the productivity of the breed when given the necessary input assistance along the goat value chain. The primary objective of WAD goat farmers is to produce matured animals for various purposes and the breeding goal for a WAD goat breeding programme would be to increase survival, growth rate and litter size of light coat (white, grey and light brown) goats. Finally, most farmers lack knowledge on the significance of tropically beneficial qualitative traits such as horn, wattle, beard and light coat colouration on the survivability, climate adaptability or resilience and productivity of their goats. Educating farmers on the importance of conserving and inclusion of animals possessing such traits in their selection practices under the Government's Rearing for Food and Jobs Initiative is therefore suggested.","[Ofori, S.

However, a FCCHPS has not been actively applied to building sector in South Korea. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a framework for establishing the optimal implementation strategy of a FCCHPS for multi-family housing complex (MFHC). The implementation strategy of a FCCHPS consists of the operating scheme and operating size. To verify the feasibility of the proposed framework, 'O' MFHC located in Seoul, South Korea was selected as a case study. 'O' MFHC was assessed from the perspective of primary energy saving (PES), and life cycle cost (LCC) and life cycle CO2 (LCCO2). In terms of PES, IS_PLF_500 kW was determined as the optimal implementation strategy of a FCCHPS, where the operating scheme was power load following (PLF) and the operating size was 500 kW. PES and its saving ratio were determined at 1476.8 TOE/year and 54%, respectively. In terms of,LCC and LCCO2, IS_HLF_200 kW was determined as the optimal implementation strategy of a FCCHPS, where the operating scheme was heating load following (HLF) and the operating size was 200 kW. The net present value, its saving ratio, and break-even point were determined at US$ 3,823,091, 15.7%, and 3 year, respectively. The proposed framework can be used for establishing the optimal implementation strategy of a FCCHPS depending on the energy demand of a given building and the government subsidy in introducing a FCCHPS to the building sector.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper applied the Chinese Agricultural Policy Analysis model, in combination with the findings from agronomic literature with highly detailed agricultural census data, to conduct equilibrium analysis under alternative impact (seasonal drought and climate warming) scenarios and adaptation scenarios (promoting water-saving irrigation, introducing new varieties, and the integrated) associated with climate change. Findings - Simulation results indicate that climate change-induced seasonal drought and the resulting yield reduction will incur substantial losses to China's grain production (by similar to 8 percent at a national scale). The application of water saving techniques can be an effective solution to seasonal drought. Introducing new varieties will increase the combination of promoting water-saving irrigation and new variety adoption will increase combination of promoting water-saving irrigation and new variety adoption constitute an effective approach to offsetting the negative effects of climate change on grain production. Research limitations/implications - Simulation results indicate that climate change-induced seasonal drought and the resulting sown area reduction will incur substantial losses to China's grain production by approximately 8 percent, despite farmers' adaptation activities of switching from water use-intensive crops to drought-tolerant crops to mitigate this negative effect. The application of water saving techniques is an effective solution to seasonal drought; it can lead to a nationwide increase in the sown area by 3.48 percent and in the grain production by 4.15 percent. Introducing new varieties will increase grain outputs and change the spatial distribution of crop production across the country.

For its effective and efficient implementation it is important to set priorities based on generally recognized criteria. This paper proposes a cross-sectoral prioritization concept for assessing and selecting federal adaptation measures. Based on a literature review, five key criteria could be distinguished (strategic importance, urgency, side-effects, no-regret, flexibility), which were supplemented with criteria to assess the technical and socioeconomic feasibility (economical aspects, acceptance). The multicriteria approach enhances transparency and traceability of decision making in the adaptation process. Taking account of climate impacts (path 1) and prioritizing adaptation measures using the multi-criteria approach (path 2) constitute only a first step. Step 2 integrates the findings of path 1 and 2 to select appropriate measures for an Adaptation Action Plan.","[Vetter, Andreas; Schauser, Inke] Umweltbundesamt UBA, FGI KomPass Kompetenz Zentrum Klimafolgen & Anpas, D-06844 Dessau Rosslau, Germany",,"Vetter, A (corresponding author), Umweltbundesamt UBA, FGI KomPass Kompetenz Zentrum Klimafolgen & Anpas, Worlitzer Pl 1, D-06844 Dessau Rosslau, Germany.",andreas.vetter@uba.de; inke.schauser@uba.de,,,,,,,14,3,3,4,16,OEKOM VERLAG,MUNICH,"WALTHERSTR 29, MUNICH, 80337, GERMANY",0940-5550,,,GAIA,GAIA,,2013,22,4,,,,,248,254,,10.14512/gaia.22.4.9,http://dx.doi.org/10.14512/gaia.22.4.9,,,7,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,278TZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000328914000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the Indus River Basin, local scale water productivity decisions are affected by international and intra-national scale water governance. Water availability and productivity is modulated by the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan, and within Pakistan by the agreements governing water allocation between and within provinces. Much of the literature on governance at multiple scales in the Indus basin, and others, has employed qualitative methods of institutional analysis. This paper extends that approach with quantitative modeling of surface water allocation rules at multiple scales and the consequent economic impact on water use and productivity in the Indus River of Pakistan. The effects of the existing water allocation mechanisms on the ability to adapt to possible future climate conditions are examined. The study is conducted using the Indus Basin Model Revised - Multi-Year (IBMR-MY), a hydro-agro-economic model of the Indus River within Pakistan that simulates river and canal flows, groundwater pumping, water use and economic activities with a distributed, partial equilibrium model of the local scale agro-economic activities in the basin. Results suggest that without changes in response to changing conditions, the current governance mechanisms impede the provinces' ability to adapt to changing climate conditions, in ways that are significant, inflicting economic costs under both high and low flow conditions. However surface water allocation between the provinces does not appear to hinder adaptation. The greatest gains for economic water allocation are achieved at the sub-provincial level. The results imply that adaptive mechanisms for water allocation that allow response to changing climate conditions within provinces may be a promising adaptive response in the Indus Basin.

The house owners made great alterations for the purpose of decoration, which removed or minimized the effectiveness of natural ventilation elements in the original design. The research shows that the houses show 'International Style' because the natural ventilation design principles were not fully applied in the design and the localized natural ventilation strategies were not fully considered by means of computational simulation in the design stage. Also, the lack of communication between designers and the owners caused the removal of most natural ventilation elements of these houses during the occupancy period.

Rainwater harvesting technologies (RWHTs) help utilise water more productively whilst raising yield levels. In this article it is argued that realising the potential of RWHTs for resilience building and climate adaptation requires a better understanding of global and regional processes influencing RWHTs adoption combined with pre-existing analysis at the household scale. On the basis of a systematic literature review, processes of influence in the diffusion and uptake of RWHTs are identified. These relate to shifting ideology associated with food production systems; the scope of investments in agriculture science and technology; emergent actors shaping development assistance; and patterns of farmer mobility. Drawing insights from theory on transformations for sustainability and development, this article adds to the understanding of connectedness between farm-level adoption of RWHTs, and regional to global level actors, institutions and processes.

Adaptation solutions must counteract these threats while also supporting development in vulnerable SIDS. Suitable options need to ensure that connections between the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of socio-economic systems are defined in a way that can support how decisions are made (and by whom) and how these can impact on other parts of these systems. This is particularly important in many Pacific SIDS, where communities practise customary natural resource management and continue to rely on local natural resources. In this study, we model the anticipated impacts of climate change and the benefits of the ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches on community wellbeing in Vanuatu. To do this, we applied participatory and expert elicitation methods to develop a Bayesian network model, which was designed to evaluate community wellbeing responses at four explicit spatial scales. The model includes both acute and chronic impacts of climate change, the impact of coral bleaching, and the potential loss of Vanuatu's fringing coral reefs. The model predicts that all proposed EbA interventions will have a positive impact on wellbeing in all four locations to some degree, by either directly improving the integrity of Vanuatu's ecosystems or by protecting these ecosystems as a positive spill-over of related actions. Significantly, it also predicts that if climate change exceeds 1.5 degrees C of warming, the costs of achieving the same level of wellbeing are increased.","[Sahin, Oz; Hadwen, Wade L.; Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Act Beacon, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Sahin, Oz] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Hadwen, Wade L.; Smart, James C.

The aim of this article is to reflect on one of the major challenges: facilitating and sharing information on the next adaptation practices. Web portals (i.e., web sites) for disseminating information are important tools in meeting this challenge, and therefore, we assessed the characteristics of select major portals across multiple scales. We found that there is a rather limited number of case studies available in the portals-between 900 and 1000 in total-with 95 that include cost information and 195 that include the participation of stakeholders globally. Portals are rarely cited by researchers, suggesting a suboptimal connection between the practical, policy-related, and scientific development of adaptation. The government portals often lack links on search results between US and European Union (EU) web sites, for example. With significant investments and policy development emerging in both the United States and the European Union, there is great potential to share information via portals. Moreover, there is the possibility of better connecting the practical adaptation experience from bottom-up projects to the science of adaptation.

This paper explains how Community-Based Adaptation Action Plan (CAPA) groups are being studied to assess the climate vulnerability of the local socio-ecosystem and to develop community-level adaptation measures. However, there is insufficient research to differentiate local vulnerabilities caused by climate change. This paper, therefore, examines climate change vulnerability with respect to community vulnerability and potential adaptation measures to increase community resilience and adaptive capacity through CAPAs. The study compares differences by gender, caste/ethnicity, and wealth in relation to specific climate-related hazards (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) of communities. The study draws on secondary sources of information along with field observations, 73 household interviews, 13 key-informant interviews, consultations, and 9 interactive meetings in 3 districts of Nepal. Differential impact analysis refers to the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of local socio-ecological systems. In addition, multivariate analysis was conducted using the Canoco program to analyze the role of actors with respect to climate vulnerability. The results conclude that the degree of vulnerability varies widely at the household level and is strongly influenced by socio-economic characteristics such as gender, caste/ethnicity, and wealth. Immediate and focused attention is needed to improve access to government resources for vulnerable households, requiring positive support from decision makers. Equally important is improving the chain of communication, which includes information, skills, knowledge, capacity, and institutional arrangements. Analysis of the differential vulnerability and the adaptive capacity of a vulnerable community is more appropriate for the design of local adaptation plans. Therefore, the study suggests that engagement of local partners, including local authorities, in addressing vulnerability and adaptation is required to confront the social process, new institutional arrangements, local adaptation, and capacity-building with technical solutions.","[Khadka, Chiranjeewee; Edwards-Jonasova, Magda; Cudlin, Pavel] Czech Acad Sci, Dept Carbon Storage Landscape, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Upadhyaya, Anju; Baral, Sony] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Forestry, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Dhungana, Nabin] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Coll Environm Studies, Hualien 97401, Taiwan",Czech Academy of Sciences; Tribhuvan University; Institute of Forestry (IOF) - Nepal; National Dong Hwa University,"Khadka, C (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Dept Carbon Storage Landscape, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",khadka.c@czechglobe.cz,"Khadka, Chiranjeewee/E-2163-2015","Khadka, Chiranjeewee/0000-0001-9032-6933; Cudlin, Pavel/0000-0003-1464-5160","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the CzeCOS program [LM2018123]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the CzeCOS program","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the CzeCOS program, grant number LM2018123.",,66,0,0,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2022,14,16,,,,,,,9825,10.3390/su14169825,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14169825,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4A7EK,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000845259500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The continent is witnessing an increase in intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, and environmental change. The COVID-19 was managed relatively well across in the continent, providing lessons and impetus for environmental management and addressing climate change. This work examines the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment and climate change, analyses its management and draws lessons from it for climate change response in Africa. The data, findings and lessons are drawn from peer reviewed articles and credible grey literature on COVID-19 in Africa. The COVID-19 pandemic spread quickly, causing loss of lives and stagnation of the global economy, overshadowing the current climate crisis. The pandemic was managed through swift response by the top political leadership, research and innovations across Africa providing possible solutions to COVID-19 challenges, and redirection of funds to manage the pandemic. The well-coordinated COVID-19 containment strategy under the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention increased sharing of resources including data was a success in limiting the spread of the virus. These strategies, among others, proved effective in limiting the spread and impact of COVID-19. The findings provide lessons that stakeholders and policy-makers can leverage in the management of the environment and address climate change. These approaches require solid commitment and practical-oriented leadership.","[Ongoma, Victor; Epule, Terence Epule; Chehbouni, Abdelghani] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Int Water Res Inst, Lot 660, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco; [Brouziyne, Youssef] Int Water Management Inst, Level 3,7 Abd El-Hady Saleh St,Off Nile St, Giza, Egypt; [Tanarhte, Meryem] Hassan II Univ Casablanca, Fac Sci & Tech Mohammedia, Lab Proc Engn & Environm, Mohammadia 20650, Morocco; [Chehbouni, Abdelghani] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Ctr Remote Sensing & Applicat, Lot 660, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco",Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); Hassan II University of Casablanca; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University,"Ongoma, V (corresponding author), Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Int Water Res Inst, Lot 660, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco.",victor.ongoma@gmail.com,,"Tanarhte, Meryem/0000-0001-7347-2146; /0000-0002-5110-2870",,,,,108,0,0,8,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Resulting interactions between historical increases in forested area and density and recent rapid warming, increasing insect mortality, and wildfire burned areas, are now leading to substantial abrupt landscape alterations. These outcomes are forcing forest planners and managers to identify strategies that can modify future outcomes that are ecologically and/or socially undesirable. Past forest management, including widespread harvest of fire- and climate-tolerant large old trees and old forests, fire exclusion (both Indigenous and lightning ignitions), and highly effective wildfire suppression have contributed to the current state of wNA forests. These practices were successful at meeting short-term demands, but they match poorly to modern realities. Hagmann et al. review a century of observations and multi-scale, multi-proxy, research evidence that details widespread changes in forested landscapes and wildfire regimes since the influx of European colonists. Over the preceding 10 millennia, large areas of wNA were already settled and proactively managed with intentional burning by Indigenous tribes. Prichard et al. then review the research on management practices historically applied by Indigenous tribes and currently applied by some managers to intentionally manage forests for resilient conditions. They address 10 questions surrounding the application and relevance of these management practices. Here, we highlight the main findings of both papers and offer recommendations for management. We discuss progress paralysis that often occurs with strict adherence to the precautionary principle; offer insights for dealing with the common problem of irreducible uncertainty and suggestions for reframing management and policy direction; and identify key knowledge gaps and research needs.","[Hessburg, Paul F.; Povak, Nicholas A.] USDA FS, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Wenatchee, WA 98801 USA; [Hessburg, Paul F.; Prichard, Susan J.; Hagmann, R.

Climate change can affect soil functions both directly and indirectly. Direct effects include temperature, precipitation, and moisture regime changes. Indirect effects include those that are induced by adaptations such as irrigation, crop rotation changes, and tillage practices. Although extensive knowledge is available on the direct effects, an understanding of the indirect effects of agricultural adaptation options is less complete. A review of 20 agricultural adaptation case-studies across Europe was conducted to assess implications to soil threats and soil functions and the link to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The major findings are as follows: (a) adaptation options reflect local conditions; (b) reduced soil erosion threats and increased soil organic carbon are expected, although compaction may increase in some areas; (c) most adaptation options are anticipated to improve the soil functions of food and biomass production, soil organic carbon storage, and storing, filtering, transforming, and recycling capacities, whereas possible implications for soil biodiversity are largely unknown; and (d) the linkage between soil functions and the SDGs implies improvements to SDG 2 (achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture) and SDG 13 (taking action on climate change), whereas the relationship to SDG 15 (using terrestrial ecosystems sustainably) is largely unknown. The conclusion is drawn that agricultural adaptation options, even when focused on increasing yields, have the potential to outweigh the negative direct effects of climate change on soil degradation in many European regions.","[Hamidov, Ahmad;

Research has primarily focused on identifying absolute bio-physical limits. This paper contributes empirical insight to an emerging literature on the social limits to adaptation. Such limits arise from the ways in which societies perceive, experience and respond to climate change. Using qualitative data from multi-stakeholder workshops and key-informant interviews with representatives of the fisheries and tourism sectors of the Great Barrier Reef region, we identify psycho-social and structural limits associated with key adaptation strategies, and examine how these are perceived as more or less absolute across levels of organisation. We find that actors experience social limits to adaptation when: i) the effort of pursuing a strategy exceeds the benefits of desired adaptation outcomes; ii) the particular strategy does not address the actual source of vulnerability, and; iii) the benefits derived from adaptation are undermined by external factors. We also find that social limits are not necessarily more absolute at higher levels of organisation: respondents perceived considerable opportunities to address some psycho-social limits at the national-international interface, while they considered some social limits at the local and regional levels to be effectively absolute.","[Evans, Louisa S.; Adger, W.

Much has been written on climate change and its impact on health, but little attention has focused on the realpolitik of how to progress the development and implementation of health-relevant strategies and policies to reduce this impact. The objective of this paper is to propose three solutions to address current deficiencies: i) strengthening the capacity and understanding of health officials in relation to climate change and health; ii) improving cross-sectoral partnerships with sectors relevant to climate change and health, and iii) identifying organisations influential in the development of climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies and policies, with a view to better target advocacy efforts. Practical examples of each solution are provided. In conclusion, as a steward of public health, the health sector must take the initiative to encourage a cross-sectoral approach that includes capacity development, coupled with an understanding of influential organisations. If this is done effectively, health, social and economic development goals can be reached more efficiently.","[Bowen, Kathryn J.; Friel, Sharon] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Bowen, Kathryn J.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Ebi, Kristie] ClimAdapt, Los Altos, CA 94022 USA",Australian National University; University of Melbourne,"Bowen, KJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",kathrynjbowen@gmail.com; krisebi@essllc.org; Sharon.friel@anu.edu.au,,"Bowen, Kathryn/0000-0002-2125-1963; Friel, Sharon/0000-0002-8345-5435",,,,,19,7,7,3,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Agroforestry is necessitated by the need to improve tree population along the Sisili River and other areas in the Kassena Nankana West District. Primary data were generated through survey methods in which questionnaires were administered to 75 agroforestry farmers. It was triangulated with eight focus group discussions and five key informant interviews. Additionally, secondary data on rainfall and temperature (1984-2015) were analysed. The study revealed that farmers have noticed changes in the local climate as declining rainfall and increasing sunshine associated with rising temperature. Secondly, agroforestry was found to be useful in reducing water and wind erosion of soil, it improves soil nutrients, moisture retention and household food availability. Agroforestry is challenged with water shortages, unsupervised livestock grazing and bushfires. The study concludes that agroforestry is a dynamic agricultural adaptation option to a changing local climate. Therefore, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and NGOs should support farmers with dams and fencing materials and encourage more farmers to adopt agroforestry.","[Apuri, Isaac; Peprah, Kenneth; Achana, Godwin Thomas Wedam] Univ Dev Studies, Fac Integrated Dev Studies, Wa Campus,POB 520, Wa, Upper West Regi, Ghana",University for Development Studies,"Peprah, K (corresponding author), Univ Dev Studies, Fac Integrated Dev Studies, Wa Campus,POB 520, Wa, Upper West Regi, Ghana.",kpeprah@uds.edu.gh,,,,,,,50,17,17,2,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-4645,2211-4653,,ENVIRON DEV,Environ.

In particular, it remains unclear when such facial adaptations arose in human populations. Here, we explore climate-associated features of face shape in a worldwide modern human sample using 3D geometric morphometrics and a novel application of reduced rank regression. Based on these data, we assess climate adaptations in two crucial Upper Palaeolithic human fossils, Sungir and Mlade, associated with a boreal-to-temperate climate. We found several aspects of facial shape, especially the relative dimensions of the external nose, internal nose and maxillary sinuses, that are strongly associated with temperature and humidity, even after accounting for autocorrelation due to geographical proximity of populations. For these features, both fossils revealed adaptations to a dry environment, with Sungir being strongly associated with cold temperatures and Mlade with warm-to-hot temperatures. These results suggest relatively quick adaptative rates of facial morphology in Upper Palaeolithic Europe.","[Stansfield, Ekaterina; Mitteroecker, Philipp] Univ Vienna, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Unit Theoret Biol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Vasilyev, Sergey Y.] Moscow State Univ Med & Dent, Moscow, Russia; [Vasilyev, Sergey] Inst Anthropol & Ethnog, Moscow, Russia; [Butaric, Lauren N.] Des Moines Univ, Coll Osteopath Med, Dept Anat, Des Moines, IA USA",University of Vienna; Moscow State University of Medicine & Dentistry,"Stansfield, E (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Unit Theoret Biol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",katya.stansfield@gmail.com,"butaric, l/AFM-9174-2022","butaric, l/0000-0003-3743-2408; Stansfield, Ekaterina/0000-0001-8548-0995",Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [075-15-2020-910]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [M 2772-B],Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"The authors would like to thank the various institutions and archives that house the cranial collections and/or CT scans utilized here, and the curators and researchers who have permitted and facilitated access to them.

At the same time, global warming is causing more frequent and severe flooding and drought, thus destroying crops and reducing the amount of land available for agriculture. Recent studies show that without crop climate adaption, crop productivity will deteriorate. With access to 3D models of real plants it is possible to acquire detailed morphological and gross developmental data that can be used to study their ecophysiology, leading to an increase in crop yield and stability across hostile and changing environments. Here we review approaches to the reconstruction of 3D models of plant shoots from image data, consider current applications in plant and crop science, and identify remaining challenges. We conclude that although phenotyping is receiving an increasing amount of attention - particularly from computer vision researchers - and numerous vision approaches have been proposed, it still remains a highly interactive process.

Such a strategy will have to reflect the long time horizon of, and the prevailing uncertainties about, climate change. An intuitively appealing approach therefore seems to be to enhance the flexibility and resilience of systems to react to and cope with climate shocks and extremes, as well as to improve information. In addition, in the case of quasi-irreversible investments with a long lifetime (e.g. infrastructure investments, development of coastal zones) precautionary adjustments may be called for to increase the robustness of structures, or to increase the rate of depreciation to allow for earlier replacement. Many of these measures may already have to be considered now, and could be worthwhile in their own right, independent of climate change considerations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

These results highlight that understanding large-scale dynamical drivers as well as the thermodynamical response of storms is essential for accurate projections of changes to storm hazards, needed for future climate adaptation.","[Chan, Steven C.; Fowler, Hayley J.; Kahraman, Abdullah] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, England; [Chan, Steven C.; Kendon, Elizabeth J.; Kahraman, Abdullah] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, England; [Kendon, Elizabeth J.] Univ Bristol, Bristol, England; [Crook, Julia] Univ Leeds, Leeds, England; [Ban, Nikolina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Prein, Andreas F.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO USA; [Ban, Nikolina] Univ Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria",Newcastle University - UK; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Bristol; University of Leeds; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Innsbruck,"Chan, SC (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, England.;Chan, SC (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, England.",steven.chan@newcastle.ac.uk,"; Kahraman, Abdullah/E-5026-2014; Prein, Andreas/N-4928-2017","Kendon, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1538-2147; Chan, Steven/0000-0001-7695-3754; Kahraman, Abdullah/0000-0002-8180-1103; Prein, Andreas/0000-0001-6250-179X",United Kingdom NERC Changing Water Cycle programme (FUTURE-STORMS) [NE/R01079X/1]; European Union (Horizon 2020 (European Climate Prediction System (EUCP)) [776613]; European Research Council (INTENSE) [ERC-2013-CoG-617329]; Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award [WM140025],United Kingdom NERC Changing Water Cycle programme (FUTURE-STORMS); European Union (Horizon 2020 (European Climate Prediction System (EUCP)); European Research Council (INTENSE); Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award(Royal Society of London),"We would like the acknowledge the following persons (ordered by surname) for their support in this work: Segolene Berthou (Met Office Hadley Centre), Demory Marie-Estelle (ETH-Zuerich), Christoph Schaer (ETH-Zuerich), Emma D Thomassen (Technical University of Denmark, Danish Meteorological Institute), and Jesus Vergara Temprado (UBS Group AG, ETH-Zuerich).

Instead, libraries of the future will combine information in many formats, print and non-print, and partition their collections into various electronic, computerised, media and print formats; in effect 'freezing' portions of the collection in their most appropriate formats based on the content and usage of the materials, in somewhat the same way as libraries of the late 20th century 'froze' their catalogues during their retrospective conversion projects. As part of the coming climatic adaptation, a new and important occupation of future libraries will be the design, construction and maintenance of unique, value-added databases to hold information that is immediately pertinent to the specific needs of the library's patrons.

The need to shift towards intentional transformative adaptation (ITA) is clear. Using case studies from the Transformative Adaptation Research Alliance (TARA), we explore ITA as a way of thinking and acting that is transformative in concept and objectives, but achieved through a mix of incremental and transformative co-production processes that ultimately lead to the social-ecological system being transformed. Central to ITA are social and political issues of how individuals and collectives address environmental and social change and deal with power imbalances. ITA approaches are claimed to help overcome adaptation challenges, including: 1) re-framing human-nature relationships; 2) dealing with uncertainty; 3) engendering empowerment and agency and 4) addressing conflicting values and interests. However, it is unclear if these approaches work in practice. We examined six adaptation case studies in which participants used processes of: 1) co-producing visions of the future; 2) re-framing values, rules and knowledge to shift decision contexts for adaptation and 3) implementing actions using theories of change and adaptation pathways. We assessed the extent to which participants could use these processes to address their adaptation challenges. We found evidence of many positive achievements towards the implementation of ITA, but also examples where processes were not working, such as communities having difficulties in finding ways to work co-operatively. Different processes will be needed to address these issues, such as promoting pluralism, knowledge contestation, and deliberative re-politicisation of the adaptation agenda to shift power imbalances and enable change.","[Colloff, Matthew J.; Abel, Nick; Wyborn, Carina; van Kerkhoff, Lorrae; Munera-Roldan, Claudia] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Gorddard, Russell; Meharg, Seona; Wise, Russell M.; Dunlop, Michael] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Locatelli, Bruno] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Forests & Societies, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Locatelli, Bruno] CIFOR, Lima 15024, Peru; [Butler, James R.

Downscaled climate data were incorporated in a lumped rainfall-runoff model to project daily reservoir inflow, which was then used to determine the reservoir operation rule curves to minimize the operation cost. The results reveal that climatic change will cause a rise of temperature in the range of 1.5-2.9A degrees C, but decrease in rainfall in most of the months in the end of this century which will casue a change in the seasonal pattern of inflow to reservoir. Comparison of historical and model generated operation costs indicates that annual savings of 23% and 33% is possible with optimized reservoir operation rule curves. Assessment of the performance of the optimized operation curve under climate change scenarios shows that it will be able to cope with the changing pattern of reservoir inflow with proper adjustment. It is expected that the method presented in this paper to derive pumping operation curves to optimize the total volume of water to be pumped from various sources to reservoir can be useful for reservoir operators in the context of climate change.","[Ismail, Tarmizi; Harun, Sobri; Shahid, Shamsuddin; Fadzil, Abu Bakar] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Hydraul & Hydrol, Fac Civil Engn, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Zainudin, Zaitul Marlizawati] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Math, Fac Sci, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Sheikh, Usman Ullah] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Elect Engn, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Ismail, T (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Hydraul & Hydrol, Fac Civil Engn, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",tarmiziismail@utm.my; sobriharun@utm.my; zmarlizawati@utm.my; sshahid@utm.my; abubakarfadzil@yahoo.com; usman@fke.utm.my,"Ismail, Tarmizi/AAO-3422-2020; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010; Sheikh, Usman Ullah/GRO-0863-2022","Ismail, Tarmizi/0000-0002-6748-4703; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452; ",Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM),"Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE)(Ministry of Education, Malaysia); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)",The authors would like to express gratitude to Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE) and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) for providing fund to conduct the research.

Although short-term drying and warming are known to affect forests, it is unknown if such effects translate into long-term responses. Here, we analyze 590 permanent plots measured across the tropics to derive the equilibrium climate controls on forest carbon. Maximum temperature is the most important predictor of aboveground biomass (-9.1 megagrams of carbon per hectare per degree Celsius), primarily by reducing woody productivity, and has a greater impact per degrees C in the hottest forests (>32.2 degrees C). Our results nevertheless reveal greater thermal resilience than observations of short-term variation imply. To realize the long-term climate adaptation potential of tropical forests requires both protecting them and stabilizing Earth's climate.","[Sullivan, Martin J.

Geospatial data consisting of historical climate, land use, soil, and crop management were coupled with a weather generator, three explanatory crop models, and spatially and temporally downscaled mid-century climate change scenarios to conduct the simulations at sub county spatial resolution. Unadapted winter wheat yield increased 48% in response to mid-century projected climate changes, but corn grain declined 19% and potato 42% across the NESR, resulting in a net loss in caloric production. The contribution of the three crops to regional food production with respect to historical and mid-century climate conditions was evaluated on the basis of caloric content as a measure of yield capacity. The caloric content declined by 7 to 15% across the three commodities when averaged among all states in the region if no adaptation changes were implemented. Two land redistribution schemes were derived to compensate for this loss by re-allocating the existing land-base within each county to specific crops based on model predicted changes in productivity along with identifying additional increments of additional potential land. These approaches showed that less than 1.6% of the potentially available agricultural land base in the region would be needed to compensate for calorie losses due to climate change. These results qualify land redistribution as a pragmatic and direct adaptation strategy to the threat of climate change on regional food security.","[Fleisher, David H.; Timlin, Dennis; Reddy, V.

The technical feasibility of EbA in relation to the expected impacts of climate change and the compatibility of adaptation planning processes of the Pacific Islands with EbA requirements was considered.

The study used empirical data of 480 farmers collected from the major rice-growing zone of Punjab province, a region highly vulnerable to climate variability in Pakistan. We employed the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) technique to estimate the impact of OFAA strategies on crop outcomes and used a probit model to investigate the determinants of farmers' adaptation decisions. Findings show that farmers have adopted various OFAA practices such as irrigation water management, changing cultivation dates, and fertilizer management to lessen the adverse effects of climate change. The probit model results indicated farmers' land ownership, tube well ownership, off-farm income, credit use, and access to climate information as the major determinants of farmers' adaptation decisions. The PSM results showed that farmers who adopted at least one OFAA practice attained 340 kg/hectare more rice yield, equivalent to US$74, compared to those who did not adopt any adaptation measure. We further found that farmers who employed multiple adaptation strategies have attained higher profits compared to those implementing a few measures. These findings imply that OFAA strategies are important in minimizing the adverse impacts of climate change and variability on crops leading to improved food production and farmers' livelihood. This study further highlights the crucial role of farmers' education, availability of irrigation facilities, credit, and climate information for an improved farm-level adaptation.","[Khan, Nasir Abbas; Gong, Zaiwu; Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Risk Management & Emergency Decis Making, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Abid, Muhammad] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ, Level 2,Serena Business Complex, Islamabad 45550, Pakistan; [Khanal, Uttam] Dept Jobs Precincts & Reg, Horsham, Vic 3400, Australia",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Khan, NA; Gong, ZW (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Risk Management & Emergency Decis Making, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",nasirkhanpk@outlook.com; zwgong26@163.com; ahmad.ashfaq1986@gmail.com; muhammad.abid@giz.de; uttam.khanal@agriculture.vic.gov.au,"Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/AAT-7073-2021; Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/J-2476-2019; Khan, Nasir Abbas/Z-3608-2019","Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/0000-0001-9142-2441; Khan, Nasir Abbas/0000-0002-6079-715X",,,,,73,3,3,4,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Well-designed and effectively managed marine reserve networks can reduce local threats, and contribute to achieving multiple objectives regarding fisheries management, biodiversity conservation and adaptation to changes in climate and ocean chemistry. Previous studies provided advice regarding ecological guidelines for designing marine reserves to achieve one or two of these objectives. While there are many similarities in these guidelines, there are key differences that provide conflicting advice. Thus, there is a need to provide integrated guidelines for practitioners who wish to design marine reserves to achieve all three objectives simultaneously. Scientific advances regarding fish connectivity and recovery rates, and climate and ocean change vulnerability, also necessitate refining advice for marine reserve design. Here we review ecological considerations for marine reserve design, and provide guidelines to achieve all three objectives simultaneously regarding: habitat representation; risk spreading; protecting critical, special and unique areas; reserve size, spacing, location, and duration; protecting climate resilient areas; and minimizing and avoiding threats. In addition to applying ecological guidelines, reserves must be designed to address social and governance considerations, and be integrated within broader fisheries and coastal management regimes.","[Green, Alison L.] Nature Conservancy, Indopacific Div, West End, Qld 4101, Australia; [Fernandes, Leanne] Earth Ocean Consulting, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Almany, Glenn] USR 3278 CNRS EPHE CRIOBE, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Perpignan, France; [Abesamis, Rene] Silliman Univ, Negros Oriental, Philippines; [McLeod, Elizabeth] Nature Conservancy, Indopacific Div, Austin, TX USA; [Alino, Porfirio M.] Univ Philippines, Manila, Philippines; [White, Alan T.; Salm, Rod] Nature Conservancy, Indopacific Div, Honolulu, HI USA; [Tanzer, John] World Wildlife Fund, Gland, Switzerland; [Pressey, Robert L.] ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia",Nature Conservancy; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Nature Conservancy; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Manila; Nature Conservancy,"Green, AL (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, 245 Riverside Dr, West End, Qld 4101, Australia.",agreen@tnc.org,"Abesamis, Rene A./AAE-1917-2022","Abesamis, Rene A./0000-0001-7456-1415",U.S. Agency for International Development of the United States Government (USAID); American people through USAID [LAG-A-00-99-00048-00],U.S. Agency for International Development of the United States Government (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); American people through USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This article is a synthesis of several documents developed with support from the U.S. Agency for International Development of the United States Government (USAID) funded Coral Triangle Support Partnership (CTSP).

This study assessed the effect of shifting trans- /planting date of dry season Boro rice as an adaptation strategy, with focus on water requirements under future climate scenarios. Potential crop water requirement, effective rainfall and irrigation requirement to satisfy crop evapo-transpiration of Boro rice were estimated using CropWat 8.0 for early, normal and late planting dates for 2050s and 2080s. Future climate scenarios were constructed using five global circulation model (GCM) outputs for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 by statistical downscaling and bias correction. Number of days exceeding the threshold temperatures (maximum of 35 degrees C and minimum of 25 degrees C) was counted for critical period of Boro rice to understand compatibility of the changed planting dates. Results indicate that late planting can substantially reduce irrigation demand by increasing rainfall availability during Boro growth duration, but the option is very limited due to both day- and night-time heat stress. An early planting, on the other hand, accounts for high water demand but ensures suitable temperature during the critical growth stages of the crop. The normal planting dates show the possibility of day-time heat stress. So, late planting of temperature-tolerant cultivars or early planting of high-yielding varieties would be recommended based on local water availability. However, adjustment of the planting date is currently limited because high temperature-tolerant cultivars are not available in the study region.","[Acharjee, Tapos Kumar; Ludwig, Fulco; Supit, Iwan] Wageningen Univ, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Halsema, Gerardo; Hellegers, Petra] Wageningen Univ, Water Resources Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Acharjee, Tapos Kumar] Bangladesh Agr Univ, Dept Irrigat & Water Management, Mymensingh, Bangladesh",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU),"Acharjee, TK (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Acharjee, TK (corresponding author), Bangladesh Agr Univ, Dept Irrigat & Water Management, Mymensingh, Bangladesh.",tapos.acharjee@wur.nl,"Ludwig, Fulco/N-7732-2013","LUDWIG, FULCO/0000-0001-6479-9657; Acharjee, Tapos Kumar/0000-0002-5303-3434; hellegers, petra/0000-0002-4134-0568",Nuffic NICHE-BGD-155 project,Nuffic NICHE-BGD-155 project,"The authors sincerely acknowledge the Nuffic NICHE-BGD-155 project for granting the fellowship to Tapos Kumar Acharjee for his PhD study at Wageningen University and Research, the Netherlands.",,61,24,24,4,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-521X,1873-2267,,AGR SYST,Agric.

However, few if any account for the highly variable risk associated with tidal stage in macro-tidal environments. The purpose of this research was to develop a geomatics tool which interactively determines the biophysical vulnerability of a macro-tidal estuary in the Bay of Fundy to varying levels of storm surge and tide state. A conceptual framework was designed to illustrate the relative interrelationships between exposure conditions (surge height, tidal stage), biophysical state (freeboard, exposure, width of foreshore, intertidal slope, observed erodibility, shore protection) and morphological resilience condition. This conceptual framework was then used to develop a dynamic, custom Python programming script within ArcGIS 9.3 to calculate coastal vulnerability for user determined combinations of surge height and tide state. The analysis was conducted for four coastlines, backshore, upper foreshore, middle foreshore and lower foreshore, to reflect varying biophysical states with varying tide levels. The results of the tool were compared with known areas of concern (high erosion, dyke overtopping), as determined by historical records, local expert knowledge and GIS analysis of aerial photography. The number of known locations of concern is lower than that of the results produced by the tool. This is most likely due to the results being analyzed at extreme water levels, greater than higher high water large tide. However, this estimation of vulnerability may limit negative impacts of climate change by highlighting vulnerable areas prior to an event, allowing coastal managers and planners to install measures to reduce the vulnerability and enhance the adaptive capacity of local communities.","[Tibbetts, Jeremy R.; van Proosdij, Danika] St Marys Univ, Dept Geog, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"van Proosdij, D (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Dept Geog, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",dvanproo@smu.ca,"McLean, Laurence JA/C-7367-2014; Adamiak, Ryszard W/W-5089-2018","Adamiak, Ryszard W/0000-0001-8914-9618",Atlantic Climate Adaptation Solutions Association (ACASA); Natural Resources Canada,Atlantic Climate Adaptation Solutions Association (ACASA); Natural Resources Canada(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service),"We would like to thank Barbara Pietersma, GIS Project Manager, MP_SpARC, Saint Mary's University, Greg Baker, Instrument Technician, MP_SpARC, Saint Mary's University, Ken Carroll and Daryl Hingley, Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture, Don Forbes, Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), Philip Giles, Department of Geography, Saint Mary's University, Devon Olivola Eulie, Department of Geological Sciences at East Carolina University.

In this study, a system dynamic multi-agent model adopting the soil water balance provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56 was developed to explore how farmers' decision making may affect future water needs and use with a focus on the role of climate services, i.e. forecasts and insurance. A climatic projection record representing the down-scaled A1B market scenario (a balance across all sources) of the assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is used to produce future daily data about relative humidity, precipitation, temperature and wind speed. Two types of meteorological services are made available: i) a bi-weekly bulletin; and ii) seasonal forecasts. The precision of these services was altered to represent different conditions, from perfect knowledge to poor forecasts. Using the available forecasts, farming agents take adaptation decisions concerning crop allocation and irrigation management on the basis of their own risk attitudes. Farmers' attitudes are characterized by fuzzy classifications depending on age, relative income and crop profitability. Farming agents' adaptation decisions directly affect the crop and irrigation parameters, which in turn affect future water needs on a territorial level. By incorporating available and future meteorological services, the model allows the farmer's decision making-process to be explored together with the consequent future irrigation water demand for the period 2015 to 2030. The model prototype is applied to a data set of the Venice Lagoon Watershed, an area of 2038 km(2) in north-east Italy, for a preliminary test of its performance and to design future development objectives.","[Balbi, Stefano] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Spain; [Balbi, Stefano; Bhandari, Sabindra; Gain, Animesh K.; Giupponi, Carlo] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy; [Bhandari, Sabindra] Ctr Sustainable Dev Solut, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Gain, Animesh K.; Giupponi, Carlo] Isl San Giorgio Maggiore, Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Chenge, Venice, Italy",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Balbi, S (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Alameda Urquijo 4,4, Bilbao, Spain.",stefano.balbi@bc3research.org,"Gain, Animesh/AGN-4431-2022; Giupponi, Carlo/E-5895-2012; Balbi, Stefano/M-5740-2013","Gain, Animesh/0000-0003-3814-693X; Giupponi, Carlo/0000-0001-5358-9208; Balbi, Stefano/0000-0001-8190-5968",ICARUS project; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA),ICARUS project; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA),this research has been partially funded by the ICARUS project (http://www.cmcc.it/research/research-projects/icarus-1) with the financial support of the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA).,,25,13,13,5,26,PAGEPRESS PUBL,PAVIA,"MEDITGROUP, VIA G BELLI, 4, PAVIA, 27100, ITALY",1125-4718,2039-6805,,ITAL J AGRON,Ital.

Despite these far-reaching transformation processes, within the intended changes security of supply and precautions against the possible consequences of climate change must be ensured. Consequently, the question arises how to direct energy systems. In this context the processes of guiding orientations with the help of the guiding concept of resilient systems and feasible and addressee-oriented guiding design principles can be an option to provide guidance in transformation processes. However, it is questionable whether and how such processes are effective in the long term and if they are able to give direction by doing so. Within the framework of empirical studies of a regional guiding orientation process for the energy system of Northwestern Germany, the long-term effectiveness of the process and its spread resilient guiding design principles of low-exergy solutions and climate-adapted and energy-efficient refrigeration has been confirmed. Such effectiveness requires the implementation of a four-phase guiding orientation process which takes content-related and process-related effectiveness factors into account. Therefore, the study shows how regional energy systems can be designed toward the major challenges of ensuring security and precaution.","[Brand, Urte; von Gleich, Arnim] Univ Bremen, Dept Technol Design & Dev, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Brand, U (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Dept Technol Design & Dev, Enrique Schmidt Str 7, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",ubrand@uni-bremen.de; gleich@uni-bremen.de,,,German Ministry for Education and Research as part of its KLIMZUG initiative,German Ministry for Education and Research as part of its KLIMZUG initiative,"This article was made possible, in part, through support by a grant from the German Ministry for Education and Research as part of its KLIMZUG initiative.

Cropping systems that include forages and allow flexibility for determining if a crop should be planted and which crop to plant (based on available soil water at planting) may provide the opportunity to maintain economic viability in a changing climate environment. The objective of this study was to compare cropping system productivity and profitability of flexible rotations that incorporate forages against grain-based cropping systems that are set rotational sequences. Yield and net returns for five set rotations and three flexible rotations were compared at Akron, CO, over 5 yr. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields were reduced by 57% when the fallow period prior to wheat production was replaced with crop production. Average net income was greatest for the continuously cropped all-forage set 3-yr rotation followed by the flexible 3-yr rotations that included wheat and forage phases. The lowest net returns were seen for the set grain-based rotations and the flexible wheat-grain crop rotation. Incorporating forage production as a phase in dryland wheat rotational systems can add profitability and sustainability to the production system in the face of climate variability.","[Nielsen, David C.; Vigil, Merle F.] USDA ARS, Cent Great Plains Res Stn, 40335 Cty Rd GG, Akron, CO 80720 USA; [Hansen, Neil C.] Brigham Young Univ, 5108 LSB, Provo, UT 84602 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Brigham Young University,"Nielsen, DC (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Cent Great Plains Res Stn, 40335 Cty Rd GG, Akron, CO 80720 USA.",david.nielsen@ars.usda.gov,"Nielsen, David C/A-8044-2009","Nielsen, David C/0000-0002-8240-7183","ARS [ARS-0429466, 911910] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",ARS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service),,,42,21,21,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-1962,1435-0645,,AGRON J,Agron.

For river dikes a return period of 1,250 years is used to determine the design water levels. A problem with this strategy is that it builds on assumptions with regard to the intrinsically uncertain probability distributions for the peak discharges. The uncertainty is considerable and due to (1) the measuring records that are limited to about 100 years and (2) the changing natural variability as a result of climate change. Although the probability distributions are regularly updated based on new discharge data the nature of the statistics is such that a change in the natural variability of the peak discharge affects the probability distribution only long after the actual change has happened. Here we compare the performance of the probabilistic dike design strategy with the older strategy, referred to as the 'self-learning dike'. The basic principle of the latter strategy is that the dike height is kept at a level equal to the highest recorded water level plus a certain safety margin. The two flood prevention strategies are compared on the basis of the flooding safety over a 100-year period. The Rhine gauge station at Lobith serves as case study. The results indicate that the self-learning dike performs better than the probabilistic design in terms of safety and costs, both under current and climate change conditions.","[Hoekstra, Arjen Y.; De Kok, Jean-Luc] Univ Twente, Twente Water Ctr, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Hoekstra, AY (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Twente Water Ctr, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",a.y.hoekstra@utwente.nl,"Hoekstra, Arjen Y./B-4980-2008","Hoekstra, Arjen Y./0000-0002-4769-5239",,,,,21,15,15,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

The assistance of the Soviet Union completely opened the prelude to China's large-scale industrial construction. With the continuous increase of urban energy consumption in China and the huge pressure it brings to the environment, urban planning and design aiming at energy conservation and climate adaptability has attracted more and more attention. Residential building layout is an important part of urban planning and design, which is closely related to building environmental energy consumption and urban microclimate. Therefore, it is necessary to study the energy saving and climate adaptive design strategy of residential building layout. Yichun is a cold city, located in the northernmost part of the three northeastern provinces, with a population of about 1 million. Its climate is characterized by continuous low temperature in winter, and the extreme value of daily lowest air temperature in Yichun City since 1981 is similar to 42.2 degrees C. The highest temperature in summer is 35 degrees C. The unique geographical location and climate have created Yichun's unique urban quality, and outdoor cultural activities are also unique. Yichun is a place with four distinct seasons, and each season has its own characteristics. The beauty of the four seasons contrasts greatly. The best travel time in Yichun is from June to September. In this study, the scientific nature of environment numerical simulation software is verified. Taking the surrounding residential open space as the research object, reasonable grid simulation size and initial boundary conditions are set. The quantitative relationship between design elements and thermal comfort level is established through software simulation. After repeated and a large number of hourly simulation verification, combined with the spatial distribution map and numerical distribution map of thermal comfort, the design elements and open space are established. On this basis, the optimization strategies of open space in residential areas in extreme weather areas are put forward, including the reasonable layout of activity areas, careful selection of open positions, attention to the proportion of open space, attention to plane enclosure and corner units, encouragement of secondary restrictions of activity space, reasonable selection of underlying surface materials, and reasonable layout of water bodies. This paper mainly studies the design of outdoor communication space in Yichun residential area in winter. The average temperature in winter is -14 degrees C similar to -2 degrees C. Through the study of design methods and countermeasures, an operable Yichun residential area design method is found.","[Lu, Ming; Sun, Guofei; He, Zichong] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement En, Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Wang, Endong] Yichun Nat Resources Bur, Yichun 153000, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Sun, GF (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement En, Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",hitlm1969@hit.edu.cn; sunguofei@hit.edu.cn; 18bg34016@hit.edu.cn; 19sk34231@stu.hit.edu.cn,,,,,,,32,0,0,7,7,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",2314-8896,2314-8888,,J FUNCT SPACE,J.

Design/methodology/approach Qualitative research applying in-depth interviews with 24 key stakeholders from a diverse range of property/real estate companies in Australia. Findings This research identified a wide range of information types used by key stakeholders, ranging from reliance on unsophisticated mass media reporting to detailed analysis of scientific research. The capacity of stakeholders to translate this information for their organisation was polarised; 11 of the 24 interviewees indicated they had the capacity, while the other 13 indicated they did not, often owing to time horizons or lack of current interest within the organisation or from clients. Research limitations/implications This research was limited to 24 in-depth interviews and is not intended to be a representative sample. However, this limitation is offset by the fact that a diverse range of stakeholders were interviewed and an in-depth and rich understanding has been provided about their approach to climate change. Practical implications The results can inform the development of better communication channels for climate change for the property industry by supporting science-practice collaborations in the timely and effective dissemination of research. This is important to understand given the identified need to bridge the gap among research, policy and practice. Social implications Climate change poses significant challenges and risks for built environments. The property industry, as a key stakeholder, has great potential to influence current practices. The results reported here assist in addressing these challenges. Originality/value At present, limited research globally has been conducted about climate change actions in the property industry.

Interviews with 44 farmers in the upper Thukela basin, KwaZulu-Natal, were conducted to identify common and specific challenges for the two groups and adaptive strategies for dealing with the effects of climate and other stressors. This work was conducted as part of a larger participatory project with local stakeholders to develop a local adaptation plan for coping with climate variability and change. Although many challenges related to exposure to climate variability and change, weak agricultural policies, limited governmental support, and theft were common to both farming communities, their adaptive capacities were vastly different. Small-scale farmers were more vulnerable due to difficulties to finance the high input costs of improved seed varieties and implements, limited access to knowledge and agricultural techniques for water and soil conservation and limited customs of long-term planning. In addition to temperature and drought-related challenges, small-scale farmers were concerned about soil erosion, water logging and livestock diseases, challenges for which the commercial farmers already had efficient adaptation strategies in place. The major obstacle hindering commercial farmers with future planning was the lack of clear directives from the government, for example, with regard to issuing of water licences and land reform. Enabling agricultural communities to procure sustainable livelihoods requires implementation of strategies that address the common and specific challenges and strengthen the adaptive capacity of both commercial and small-scale farmers. Identified ways forward include knowledge transfer within and across farming communities, clear governmental directives and targeted locally adapted finance programmes.","[Wilk, Julie] Linkoping Univ, Climate Sci & Policy Res Ctr, S-58283 Linkoping, Sweden; [Wilk, Julie] Linkoping Univ, Dept Water & Environm Studies, S-58283 Linkoping, Sweden; [Andersson, Lotta] Swedish Meterol & Hydrol Inst, Hydrol Unit, S-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Warburton, Michele] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Bioresources Engn & Environm Hydrol BEEH, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa",Linkoping University; Linkoping University; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Wilk, J (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Climate Sci & Policy Res Ctr, S-58283 Linkoping, Sweden.",julie.wilk@liu.se,,,Swedish International Development Agency (Sida); Swedish Research Council (VR); South African National Research Foundation (NRF),Swedish International Development Agency (Sida); Swedish Research Council (VR)(Swedish Research Council); South African National Research Foundation (NRF)(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"We would like to gratefully thank the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida), the Swedish Research Council (VR) and the South African National Research Foundation (NRF) for research funds.

Climate change has transformed the potential range of ecosystem services available. The Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework offers a foundation for responding to climate-induced ecosystem modification; however, ecosystem trajectories and current practices must be understood to improve future decisions. Using Wisconsin's diverse inland fisheries as a case study, management strategies for recreational and subsistence fisheries in response to climate change were reviewed within the RAD framework. Current strategies largely focus on resist actions, while future strategies may need to shift toward accept or direct actions. A participatory adaptive management framework and co-production of policies between state and tribal agencies could prioritise lakes for appropriate management action, with the goal of providing a landscape of diverse fishing opportunities. This knowledge co-production represents a process of social learning requiring substantial investments of funding and time.","[Feiner, Zachary S.; Mitro, Matthew G.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Sci Operat Ctr, Off Appl Sci, 2801 Progress Rd, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Feiner, Zachary S.; Trudeau, Ashley; Embke, Holly S.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Shultz, Aaron D.] Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commiss, Odanah, WI USA; [Sass, Greg G.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Escanaba Lake Res Stn, Off Appl Sci, Boulder Jct, WI USA; [Dassow, Colin J.] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Columbia, MO USA; [Latzka, Alexander W.; Maitland, Bryan M.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Bur Fisheries Management, GEF 2, Madison, WI USA; [Isermann, Daniel A.; Homola, Jared J.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Maitland, Bryan M.] Univ Wisconsin, Aquat Sci Ctr, Madison, WI USA; [Embke, Holly S.] US Geol Survey, Midwest Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, St Paul, MN USA; [Preul, Michael] Mole Lake Band Lake Super Chippewa Indians, Sokaogon Chippewa Community, Crandon, WI USA; [Dassow, Colin J.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Off Appl Sci, Spooner Stn, Spooner, WI USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Feiner, ZS (corresponding author), Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Sci Operat Ctr, Off Appl Sci, 2801 Progress Rd, Madison, WI 53711 USA.",zachary.feiner@wisconsin.gov,,"Dassow, Colin/0000-0002-8150-5339; Feiner, Zachary/0000-0001-7880-0778; Embke, Holly/0000-0002-9897-7068",US Fish and Wildlife Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources,US Fish and Wildlife Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources,"Z.S.

However, there remain conceptual and methodological challenges in defining an adaptation goal and mixed evidence on what effective adaptation looks like and how it can be enabled. In this review, we demonstrate how different normative views on adaptation outcomes, arising from different epistemological and disciplinary entry points, can lead to very different interpretations of adaptation effectiveness. We argue that how effectiveness is framed will significantly impact adaptation implementation and outcomes. This, furthermore, represents a way of exercising influence in adaptation decision-making. Eleven principles of effective adaptation are distilled as a way to pluralize guidance in international processes such as the Global Stocktake as well as national and sub-national exercises on tracking and monitoring adaptation.","[Singh, Chandni; Iyer, Soundarya] Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [New, Mark G.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Few, Roger] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Kuchimanchi, Bhavana] Watershed Org Trust, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Segnon, Alcade C.] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Bamako, Mali; [Segnon, Alcade C.] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Cotonou, Benin; [Morchain, Daniel] Oxfam GB, Oxfam House, Oxford, England; [Iyer, Soundarya] RV Univ, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Kuchimanchi, Bhavana] Wageningen Univ & Res, Anim Prod Syst Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Morchain, Daniel] IISD, 220 Laurier Ave West,Suite 1100, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS); University of Cape Town; University of East Anglia; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); University of Abomey Calavi; Wageningen University & Research,"Singh, C (corresponding author), Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",csingh@iihs.ac.in,"Segnon, Alcade/L-3908-2016; New, Mark/A-7684-2008; Iyer, Soundarya/AAN-6693-2020","Segnon, Alcade/0000-0001-9751-120X; New, Mark/0000-0001-6082-8879; Iyer, Soundarya/0000-0001-8307-4870; Kuchimanchi, Bhavana/0000-0002-1335-5228; Few, Roger/0000-0001-6653-1400; Singh, Chandni/0000-0001-6842-6735","UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada","UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR)","This work was carried out with financial support from the UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada.",,152,31,31,4,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This paper presents a scenario-based modelling built on climate change projections and potential alterations of urban greenery in 2030 and 2090 in Adelaide, South Australia. The model is based on regional climate change scenarios, potential urban surface cover alternatives and resulted urban microclimate variations in Adelaide. Projected energy demand variations and corresponding carbon emission are calculated in each scenario. Results indicate that an ideal urban landscape transformation scenario with 30% tree canopy can effectively decrease the surface temperature by 1 degrees C in winter and 3 degrees C in summer by 2090. It is estimated that having greener and more heat resilient public spaces could save a total carbon emission of 140,000 tone CO2e in Adelaide annually compared to a business-as-usual scenario. Urban greenery may be used as a mean of increased urban life resilience to climate change by reducing surface temperature, increasing urban resilience and decreasing the energy demand during summer.

To cushion themselves against climate change, farmers need to invest in appropriate adaptation measures. This study investigates and reviews adaptation measures in the crop sector of 21 African countries. The main source of data are National Communications under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To obtain the latest data and information the Second and Third National Communications were retrieved. Using a grounded theory approach, 33 categories of adaptation measures emerged, which were later collapsed into six thematic adaptation areas. Then an in-depth analysis of relevant documents and a systematic literature review were conducted. From the adaptation categories, conservation agriculture; water, irrigation and flood management; crop diversification; inputs and subsidies; disease and pest management; and weather-based index insurance emerged. The findings show that African governments have identified many adaptation measures and have claimed some success. However, it was evident that some limiting factors remain in building a climate-resilient crop sector. The research concludes that although governments claim success in adaptation measures that have been put in place, additional studies should be conducted to verify and confirm the success of such adaptation approaches being applied.","[Muchuru, Shepherd; Nhamo, Godwell] Univ South Africa, Inst Corp Citizenship, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Muchuru, S (corresponding author), 12 Ouklipmuur Ave, ZA-0081 Pretoria, South Africa.",shephido@yahoo.com,"Nhamo, Godwell/N-5165-2015","Nhamo, Godwell/0000-0001-5465-2168",,,,,54,19,18,8,40,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Here we show the results of a spatial vulnerability assessment for SEQ's coastal region and use them as the basis to assess progress in adaptation in five coastal Local Government areas. An integrated framework based on external (exposure) and internal (sensitivity and adaptive capacity) dimensions is used to produce one single index to provide a measure of SEQ's vulnerability to coastal hazards. Coastal Local Governments' progress in adaptation is evaluated based on a semi-quantitative assessment of pre-determined Adaptation Functions adapted to the SEQ context. The assessment reveals information specifically relevant for adaptation investment at the local government level. It is concluded that the five coastal Local Governments analysed have considerable capacity to deal with coastal hazards. However, there are numerous coastal suburbs that are highly vulnerable and this is mainly, due to the fact that the majority of the SEQ coastal region is intrinsically highly exposed and sensitive to climatic drivers. We argue that this vulnerability can be reduced if Local Governments continue to further their progress in adaptation through coastal planning and management frameworks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Primarily through their combined effects on soil water availability, these climatic changes will modify plant production and community composition, which will, in turn, affect the livelihoods of humans who rely upon livestock grazing. The ability of rangeland managers to assess risk and prepare for climate change varies greatly and reflects their different adaptive capacities.

Vulnerability assessment is central to the implementation of interventions for adapting climate change. However, synthetic vulnerability based on an integrative analysis of ecosystem service and socioeconomic characteristics in urban coastal zones with tightly coupled human-nature interactions is not fully understood. Based on the Coastal Vulnerability model of the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) tool, a holistic framework for assessing coastal vulnerability to multiple hazards (sea level rise, waves and storm surge) was developed by integrating ecological, physical and socioeconomic factors into a single spatial representation and applied to the coast of Shenzhen, China. Based on the levels of biophysical exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of coastal communities, a three-dimensional decision matrix was proposed for planning location-specific interventions. Results show that approximately 15% of the coastline were categorized as having high vulnerability. Spatial vulnerability heterogeneity was found within and across the coastal districts, with Yantian grouped into the most vulnerable district. The biophysical exposure has greater influences on the overall vulnerability than either sensitivity or adaptive capacity. This study highlights the significance of complex interactions between natural ecosystems and socioeconomic conditions in driving vulnerability and suggests that combined natural-based defenses and socioeconomic factors contribute to lower vulnerability. The results can help decision-makers prioritize coastal zones for interventions and identifying adaptive strategies that target drivers of vulnerability.","[Zhang, Yan; Han, Baolong; Lu, Fei; Zheng, Hua; Ouyang, Zhiyun] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Ruckelshaus, Mary; Arkema, Katie K.] Stanford Univ, Nat Capital Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ruckelshaus, Mary; Arkema, Katie K.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); Stanford University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Ouyang, ZY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",zyouyang@rcees.ac.cn,,"Zheng, Hua/0000-0002-2301-1744; Han, Baolong/0000-0003-3574-3974","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71533005, 41701549]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Numbers 71533005 and 41701549).

By and large, the impacts of climate change on Mediterranean agriculture will be heavier for southern areas of the region. This unbalanced distribution of negative impacts underscores the significance and role of ethics in such a context of analysis. Consequently, the aim of this article is to justify and develop an ethical approach to agricultural adaptation in the Mediterranean and to derive the consequent implications for adaptation policy in the region. In particular, we define an index of adaptive capacity for the agricultural systems of the Mediterranean region on whose basis it is possible to group its different sub-regions, and we provide an overview of the suitable adaptation actions and policies for the sub-regions identified. We then vindicate and put forward an ethical approach to agricultural adaptation, highlighting the implications for the Mediterranean region and the limitations of such an ethical framework. Finally, we emphasize the broader potential of ethics for agricultural adaptation policy.","[Grasso, Marco] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Sociol & Ric Sociale, Milan, Italy; [Feola, Giuseppe] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Reading,"Grasso, M (corresponding author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Sociol & Ric Sociale, Milan, Italy.",marco.grasso@unimib.it,,"Grasso, Marco/0000-0002-6869-5959; Feola, Giuseppe/0000-0003-1069-503X",,,,,50,26,27,3,45,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

However, vector control options require localized deployment that is not logistically, ethically, ecologically, nor economically viable everywhere and all the time. Based on thermal tolerances of the sporogonic stages of avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) parasite and its vector, the southern house mosquito (Culex quinquefasciatus), we examined the long-term weather trends for three high value, forest bird refuges (Alakai Wilderness Preserve on Kaua'i, Hanawi Natural Area Reserve on Maui, and Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge on Hawai'i Island) to understand the temporal and site-specific differences of temperature-driven suitability for localized avian malaria transmission. On average, Alakai had mean ambient temperatures suitable for both the vector's immature stage development and parasite sporogonic development most of the time (85.3%), indicating that observed variability in vector abundance or disease transmission may be driven by other factors. At higher elevation sites like Hakalau and Hanawi, current mean ambient temperatures suitable only for vector development prevail (91.7% and 96.6%, respectively), while mean ambient temperatures for both vector and parasite sporogonic development seldom occur (4.4% and 0% respectively). Our results not only show differences in the temperature suitability for transmission across elevation, but also different levels of vulnerability to avian malaria transmission with any additional projected increase in temperature. For instance, under a conservative warming scenario of 1.0 degrees C, the joint temperature suitability of parasite and vector development increases at higher elevation sites such as Hakalau (+35.8%) and Hanawi (+15.4%). While mean ambient temperatures suitable for both vector and parasite development already occur most of the time at Alakai, the occurrence also increases (+8.4%) as well under this conservative warming scenario. By linking current site-specific weather data to real-time weather forecasts, we developed a real-time avian malaria warning system to assist managers in identifying conditions when vector control is most needed at these three selected study sites. This online tool determines when conditions are likely to be suitable for local development of P. relictum and C. quinquefasciatus at Alakai, Hanawi, and Hakalau. This tool illustrates how managers can incorporate climate and current weather patterns into decision making without having to consider the uncertainties of long-term climatic and ecological projections.

In this article, I suggest that animal ethicists who take sentient animals' moral status seriously are likely to agree that, other things being equal, we have moral responsibilities to assist wild animals made vulnerable to climate change. However, I also argue that these ethicists are likely to diverge in terms of the strategies they believe would actually fulfil such moral responsibilities, depending on whether their primary concern is rectificatory justice or duties of beneficence. To support this argument, I consider three plausible strategies for helping wild animals vulnerable to climate change: rescue and rehabilitation, habitat restoration, and assisted migration. I argue that different theoretical approaches to animal ethics are likely to diverge on aspects of all these strategies. These differences mean that the process of creating wide agreement among animal ethicists on climate adaptation strategies to assist vulnerable wild animals faces significant hurdles.","[Palmer, Clare] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Philosophy, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Palmer, C (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Philosophy, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",c.palmer@tamu.edu,"Palmer, Clare/Q-9281-2019","Palmer, Clare/0000-0001-9098-5330",,,,,42,4,4,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0264-3758,1468-5930,,J APPL PHILOS,J.

Daytime on-site measurements were taken in summer in the paved areas of squares, in the proximity of water fountains, and in the shade of trees in order to evaluate levels of heat stress based on the universal thermal climate index (UTCI). The differences in UTCI values between the research points confirm substantial cooling associated with high vegetation (trees induced differences up to 10.5 degrees C in UTCI), while the measurable cooling effect of low vegetation was negligible (not more than 2.3 degrees C UTCI). It was also quite low around water fountains, spray fountains, and misting systems.

This study includes empirical spatial and temporal modeling to identify how urban morphology indicators (UMIs), land surface temperature (LST), and neighboring land-use compositions affect urban energy demand using an extensive data set for the case study of Eindhoven, the Netherlands. For this purpose, the ordinary least square regression (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models are employed. The results show, there is a significant spatial relation between UMIs, neighboring land-use compositions, and urban energy demand.

The analysis identifies adaptive responses and contextual factors enabling or constraining adaptation at different scales and dimensions within rural social-ecological systems.

Our findings suggest that ecosystem-based adaptation mainstreaming in local governments will be assisted by increasing learning and networking opportunities for municipalities and by increasing the profile of the concept of ecosystem-based adaptation, as well as by conducting research on barriers and enablers to collaborative governance.","[Pasquini, Lorena] Univ Cape Town, Fac Law, Inst Humanities Africa HUMA, Global Risk Governance Programme, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Cowling, Richard M.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Bot, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa",University of Cape Town; Nelson Mandela University,"Pasquini, L (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Fac Law, Inst Humanities Africa HUMA, Global Risk Governance Programme, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",lorena.pasquini@gmail.com,"Cowling, Richard/AFU-6261-2022",,National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa; Claude Leon Foundation; Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University; Santam Insurance Company Limited,National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); Claude Leon Foundation; Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University; Santam Insurance Company Limited,"This work is based upon research supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa, the Claude Leon Foundation, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University and Santam Insurance Company Limited.

However, the high transition temperature (>45 degrees C in air) hinders their practical application. Herein, a near-infrared (NIR) activated thermochromic perovskite window that enables reversible transition cycles at room temperature is proposed. Under natural sunlight (>700 W m(-2)), it efficiently harvests 78% NIR light to trigger the thermochromism of perovskites, blocking the heat gain from both the visible and NIR light. Meanwhile, it also exhibits a low mid-infrared emissivity of <0.3, suppressing thermal radiation to the indoor environment. A field test demonstrates that this smart window can reduce the indoor temperature by 8 degrees C compared to a normal glass window at noon. The near-room-temperature color change, multispectral thermal management, outstanding energy-saving ability, and climate adaptability, and solution-based process of this window make it unique and promising for real applications.","[Liu, Sai; Tso, Chi Yan] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Kowloon Tong, Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Yang; Huang, Baoling] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Kowloon, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ying; Yu, Kin Man] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys, Kowloon Tong, Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; City University of Hong Kong,"Tso, CY (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Kowloon Tong, Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",chiytso@cityu.edu.hk,"Li, Yang/AFR-6128-2022; Yu, Kin Man/J-1399-2012; Wang, Ying/HNC-0333-2023; Tso, Chi Yan/A-9933-2017","Li, Yang/0000-0002-3118-7467; LIU, Sai/0000-0001-8218-9641; Yu, Kin Man/0000-0003-1350-9642; Wang, Ying/0000-0003-3643-9165; Tso, Chi Yan/0000-0002-7725-2172","Hong Kong Research Grant Council (RGC) via General Research Fund (GRF) [11200121, 16200518]",Hong Kong Research Grant Council (RGC) via General Research Fund (GRF),S.L. and Y.L. contributed equally to this work.

Current normal ranges are examined and criticised because of the variability of normal values and the poor sampling methods used. Instability of physiological nasal patency is related to factors such as the nasal cycle and the nose's direct exposure to the external environment. Decongestion of the nose is proposed as a way of stabilising anatomical nasal patency, and measurements of patency in this state may be more useful to the surgeon. Population studies are needed to establish a normal range, but these studies must control for factors such as age, height, sex, and nasal shape and size related to climatic adaptation. Rather than classify populations according to unscientific categories such as race, anthropometric measures such as the nasal index are proposed.","[Moore, M.; Eccles, R.] Cardiff Univ, Common Cold Ctr, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Moore, M (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Common Cold Ctr, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales.",matthew.moore@doctors.org.uk,"Eccles, Ron/A-4485-2010","Eccles, Ronald/0000-0001-9492-2062",,,,,54,18,18,2,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0022-2151,1748-5460,,J LARYNGOL OTOL,J.

Crops need water (crop water requirements, CWRs) for their growth and production, which can either be rain-fed or irrigation sourced. However, climate change has affected the hydrological cycle, particularly water available for agricultural crops. Since impacts and consequently adaptation are site-specific, an assessment of the effects of climate change on maize water requirements in Kikafu sub-catchment was conducted using a crop simulation model, CROPWAT. Accordingly, climate scenarios were obtained from A2 emission scenario using three general circulation models (GCMs). These scenarios were downscaled at two site locations using the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) model. The baseline period for the change analysis was 1971-2000. The CWRs are projected to increase by 3.8% in the 2020s and 7.1% in the 2050s at the Moshi Airport and 19.9 and 22.4% at Lyamungu station, respectively. More impact is projected to be during 70-80 days of the development stage and the entire mid-season (81-140 days) whereby the temperature will be high but with low precipitation. With the increasing CWRs, better adaptation measures are increase crop diversification, restore soil organic matter and change cropping systems as established through the multi-criteria analysis.","[Rotich, Stella C.; Mulungu, Deogratias M.

Then, we develop a numerical experiment in the agriculture sector to illustrate the importance of considering mitigation, impacts, and adaptation at the same time. In our experiment, we find that climate change can reduce crop yields, resulting in an expansion of cropland to feed a growing population and a reduction in bioenergy production.

So far, climate change impacts on agriculture for the basin have mostly been assessed for single-cropping systems, which may bias the results considering that the basin is dominated by different cropping systems, with about one-third of the crop area under double cropping. In this study, we simulate single- and double-cropping systems in the Nile basin and assess the climate change impacts on different cropping systems under two scenarios, i.e. no adaptation  and adaptation to a late-maturing cultivar . We find that the mean crop yields of maize, soybean and wheat decrease with future warming without cultivar adaptation. We attribute this to the shortening of the growing season due to increased temperature. The decrease is stronger in all single-cropping systems (12.6-45.5%) than in double-cropping systems (5.9-26.6%). The relative magnitude of yield reduction varies spatially with the greatest reduction in the northern part of the basin experiencing the strongest warming. In a scenario with cultivar adaptation, mean crop yields show a stronger increase in double-cropping systems (14.4-35.2%) than single-cropping systems (8.3-13.7%). In this scenario, farmers could possibly benefit from increasing cropping intensities while adapting to late-maturing cultivars. This study underscores the importance of accounting for multiple-cropping systems in agricultural assessments under climate change within the Nile basin.","[Nkwasa, Albert; van Griensven, Ann] Vrije Univ Brussel VUB, Hydrol & Hydraul Engn Dept, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Waha, Katharina] CSIRO, Agr & Food, 306 Carmody Rd, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [van Griensven, Ann] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Water Sci & Engn Dept, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); IHE Delft Institute for Water Education,"Nkwasa, A (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel VUB, Hydrol & Hydraul Engn Dept, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",albert.nkwasa@vub.be,"Waha, Katharina/G-5808-2017; van Griensven, Ann/M-4312-2013","Waha, Katharina/0000-0002-8631-8639; van Griensven, Ann/0000-0002-2105-6287; Nkwasa, Albert/0000-0002-8685-8854",Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) [G0E2621N]; Flemish Research Council (VLIR) [TZ2019JOI022A105]; EU H2020 programme [101004186],Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)(FWO); Flemish Research Council (VLIR); EU H2020 programme,"The authors thank the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) for funding the International Coordination Action (ICA) Open Water Network: Open Data and Software tools for water resources management (project code G0E2621N), the Flemish Research Council (VLIR) for funding the JOINT project Global Open Water Academic Network: Joint Research and Education on Open Source Software for Integrated Water Resources Management (project code TZ2019JOI022A105) and the EU H2020 programme for funding Water-ForCE - Water scenarios For Copernicus Exploitation (grant agreement No. 101004186).",,89,0,0,6,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The World Bank's latest adaptation project in coastal Bangladesh aims to create higher and wider embankments against rising sea levels. This disregards a long history of how embankments, by stopping beneficial monsoon inundations, result in dying rivers and damaging floods that devastate rural livelihoods. Bangladeshi 'development brokers' must therefore balance their roles as project employees supporting embankments as adaptation, and as locals knowledgeable about their harmful effects. The article shows how donors, NGOs, consultants and government bodies with different agendas, priorities and knowledge backgrounds 'translate' climate change to legitimise their activities. It contributes to debates about the politics of environmental knowledge production by arguing that development brokerage helps explain why some climate adaptation projects increase environmental vulnerability, while others address local needs.","[Dewan, Camelia] Univ Oslo, Dept Social Anthropol, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Dewan, C (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Social Anthropol, Oslo, Norway.",camelia.dewan@sai.uio.no,"Dewan, Camelia/AAU-8930-2020","Dewan, Camelia/0000-0003-3377-2413",Bloomsbury Colleges through Birkbeck College; Bloomsbury Colleges through SOAS; Norwegian Research Council [275204/F10]; Norges Forskningsrad,Bloomsbury Colleges through Birkbeck College; Bloomsbury Colleges through SOAS; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Norges Forskningsrad,This research was funded by Bloomsbury Colleges through a PhD studentship at Birkbeck College and SOAS (2013-2017); and writing up through the Norwegian Research Council under [grant number 275204/F10]; Norges Forskningsrad.,,59,9,9,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0014-1844,1469-588X,,ETHNOS,Ethnos,MAY 27,2022,87,3,,,SI,,538,559,,10.1080/00141844.2020.1788109,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00141844.2020.1788109,,JUN 2020,22,Anthropology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Anthropology,1U3NA,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000550029000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to better examine how climate change impacts interact with socio-economic changes and are experienced at the community scale, this research integrates household survey data with geospatial processing techniques. Two comparative study sites, one rural and one urban, were selected in the region of Ladakh; an area experiencing severe climate change impacts alongside rapid socioeconomic and political changes. Archival data was used to supplement survey responses and provide additional historical context. Survey responses were then combined with Hot Spot and Kernel density analysis in ArcGIS to identify areas of high and low spatial concentration and correlation. While climate change is widely perceived in many Western Himalayan mountain communities, impacts of climate change as an issue of high importance are moderated by other pressing socioeconomic, cultural, and political concerns. The role of locality and place-based themes such as community attachment, social cohesion, and sense of place, emerged as influential factors in enhancing social resilience and thereby reducing dimensions of local vulnerability to climate change impacts.","[Barrett, Kimiko] Headwaters Econ, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA; [Bosak, Keith] Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Soc & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Barrett, K (corresponding author), Headwaters Econ, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA.",kimi@headwaterseconomics.org; keith.bosak@umontana.edu,,,"University of Montana College of Forestry and Conservation, Missoula, Montana","University of Montana College of Forestry and Conservation, Missoula, Montana","This research was supported by the University of Montana College of Forestry and Conservation, Missoula, Montana.",,78,21,22,2,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2018,10,4,,,,,,,898,10.3390/su10040898,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10040898,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ3IY,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000435188000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Countries are now in the process of preparing and aligning their national programmes on climate action with the goals defined under their respective Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted under the Paris Agreement. Building of capacities at sub-national levels will be crucial to enable innovation in policies and technologies essential to achieve these NDC goals. This viewpoint presents key recommendations emerging from a first-of-its-kind capacity building programme on adaptation implemented for the entire Indian Himalayan Region. It emphasizes on strategies and approaches including the Experiential Learning Cycle approach to augment the effectiveness and efficiency of such programmes at sub-national level for supporting development of climate resilient communities in the long term.","[Mohan, Divya] Indian Himalayas Climate Adaptat Programme IHCAP P, Swiss Agcy Dev & Cooperat SDC, New Delhi, India",,"Mohan, D (corresponding author), Indian Himalayas Climate Adaptat Programme IHCAP P, Swiss Agcy Dev & Cooperat SDC, New Delhi, India.",divya.mhn@gmail.com,,,IHCAP,IHCAP,"The author would like to acknowledge the Indian Himalayas Climate Adaptation Programme (IHCAP), a project of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), implemented as a bilateral cooperation programme with the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.

Using panel data from Ethiopia, we investigate the role of social capital and the covariate risk of climate change and their interaction. We find that households with greater social capital tend to be more specialised, implying that diversification and informal insurance are substitutes in the mitigation of risk. We also find that this effect is significantly weaker in regions more prone to climate change, which is consistent with the average farmer being aware that informal insurance is not an effective protection against risks that affect the entire social network. We use instrumental variable random effects estimation to account for the plausible endogeneity of social capital and we also establish that our results do not depend on the poorest and most constrained individuals in our sample.","[Wuepper, David; Ayenew, Habtamu Yesigat; Sauer, Johannes] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Agr Prod & Resource Econ, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Wuepper, D (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Agr Prod & Resource Econ, Munich, Germany.",david.wuepper@tum.de,,"Sauer, Johannes (Jo)/0000-0003-2674-0229; Wuepper, David/0000-0002-1344-6023",,,,,63,28,30,6,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The quality and quantity of work were evaluated through machine performance, fossil-fuel energy requirements and carbon dioxide emissions from agricultural machinery. The fields were previously sampled and mapped to investigate spatial variability of soil properties, to find soil quality indicators and to asses soil workability. The results, revealed good traction performance during CT operations (slip values were lower than 15%). During plowing, time efficiency of the wheeled tractor was 40% lower with respect to the tracked tractor. Global energy employed was of the same magnitude for the tracked and wheeled tractor (220 kWh ha(-1)) while was significantly lower (52 kWh ha-1) for direct-seeding+fertilizing. The degree of crushing of the soil caused by CT required further energy employed (98 kWh ha-1) to seedbed preparation. Fossil-fuel energy requirements from agricultural machinery were significantly lower during direct-seeding+fertilizing (0.52 GJ ha(-1)) with respect to the conventional soil tillage (2.30 GJ ha(-1)).

They can form their own climate which is often characterized by higher temperatures and pollution levels, less wind, and solar access compared to their surroundings. This paper presents a systematic review of publications on cities in cold and polar climate regions as defined by the Kodppen-Geiger climate classification to determine the most-researched topics, identify sparsely incorporated research areas, synthesize research evidence and summarize the most important results. In total, 101 papers have been included, categorized, and analyzed according to their publication year, country, climate, topic, method, keywords, citations, and publication channels. The articles were classified into nine main topics: urban heat island (UHI) magnitude, UHI mitigation, other UHI related, biometeorology, air pollution, urban boundary layer and atmospheric boundary layer, time series analysis, other urban meteorological phenomena, and research not falling under the previous eight categories. The most-covered topic was the UHI effect. The outweighing part of studies used on-site measurements for obtaining data, while some studies were dedicated to understanding the structure, or the temporal and spatial variability of the UHI, often by using numerical tools. The review reveals significant gaps in the research of microclimatic characteristics and physical properties of the materials in urban design. Ongoing climate change and the particular vulnerability of cold and polar climate regions makes it especially important to review, develop, and adopt climate adaption and mitigation strategies for sustainable urban development.","[Brozovsky, J.; Gaitani, N.; Gustavsen, A.] NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Architecture & Design, Dept Architecture & Technol, Hogskoleringen 1, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Brozovsky, J (corresponding author), NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Architecture & Design, Dept Architecture & Technol, Hogskoleringen 1, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",johannes.brozovsky@ntnu.no; niki.gaitani@ntnu.no,,"Brozovsky, Johannes/0000-0001-5485-1431",Research Council of Norway; ZEN partners,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); ZEN partners,This paper has been written within the Research Centre on Zero Emission Neighbourhoods in Smart Cities (FME ZEN).

Cultural resources, such as historic buildings, in coastal areas are vulnerable to climate impacts including inundation, deterioration, and destruction from sea-level rise and storm-related flooding and erosion. However, research that assesses the trade-offs between actions for protecting vulnerable and valuable cultural resources under budgetary constraints is limited. This study focused on developing a decision support model for managing historic buildings at Cape Lookout National Seashore. We designed the Optimal Preservation Decision Support (OptiPres) model to: (a) identify optimal, annual adaptation actions for historic buildings across a 30-year planning horizon, (b) quantify trade-offs between different actions and the timing of adaptation actions under constrained budgets, and (c) estimate the effectiveness of budget allocations on the resource value of historic buildings. Our analysis of the model suggests that: (1) funding allocation thresholds may exist for national parks to maintain the historical significance and use potential of historic buildings under climate change, (2) the quantitative assessment of trade-offs among alternative adaptation actions provides generalizable guidance for decision makers about the dynamics of their managed system, and (3) the OptiPres model can identify cost-efficient approaches to allocate funding to maintain the historical value of buildings vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Therefore, the OptiPres model, while not designed as a prescriptive decision tool, allows managers to understand the consequences of proposed adaptation actions. The OptiPres model can guide park managers to make cost-effective climate adaptation decisions for historic buildings more transparently and robustly.","[Xiao, Xiao] Arizona State Univ, Sch Community Resources & Dev, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 550, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Xiao, Xiao] Hainan Univ, Hainan Univ Arizona State Univ Joint Int Tourism, 58 Renmin Rd, Haikou 570004, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Seekamp, Erin] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Box 8004,Biltmore Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [v an der Burg, Max Post] US Geol Survey, Northern Prairie Wildlife Res Ctr, 8711 37th St SE, Jamestown, ND 58401 USA; [Eaton, Mitchell] US Geol Survey, Southeast Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, 127H David Clark Labs, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Fatoric, Sandra] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [McCreary, Allie] Western Kentucky Univ, Sch Kinesiol Recreat & Sport, 1906 Coll Hts Blvd, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix; Hainan University; North Carolina State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Delft University of Technology; Western Kentucky University,"Xiao, X (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Community Resources & Dev, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 550, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.;Xiao, X (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Hainan Univ Arizona State Univ Joint Int Tourism, 58 Renmin Rd, Haikou 570004, Hainan, Peoples R China.",xiao.xiao.7@asu.edu; elseekam@ncsu.edu; maxpostvanderburg@usgs.gov; mitchell.eaton@usgs.gov; s.fatoric@tudelft.nl; allie.mccreary@wku.edu,"Xiao, Xiao/AAG-3884-2019; Xiao, Xiao/Z-1199-2019; Eaton, Mitchell J/HKW-4534-2023","Xiao, Xiao/0000-0001-5124-0985; Eaton, Mitchell J/0000-0001-7324-6333; McCreary, Allie/0000-0003-2332-3999; Seekamp, Erin/0000-0001-5082-1921; Fatoric, Sandra/0000-0002-3712-0749",U.S. Geological Survey through the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center; Department of Interior Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center [G15AP00141]; National Park Service Climate Change Response Program through U.S. Department of Interior Inter-Agency [P17PG00197],U.S. Geological Survey through the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center; Department of Interior Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center; National Park Service Climate Change Response Program through U.S. Department of Interior Inter-Agency,The research presented in this paper was supported by the U.S. Geological Survey (https://www.usgs.gov) through the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (https://casc.usgs.gov/) and the Department of Interior Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (https://globalchange.ncsu.edu/secsc/) through grant agreement G15AP00141 (project title: Connecting Landscape Adaptation and National Cultural Resource Policy to Climate Change and Cultural Resource Adaptation Decisions.

However investments in technology-based adaptation (seeds, dams, irrigation, etc.) are complicated by the fact that it remains difficult to predict future climate change impacts, especially on a local scale. In addition, evidence for the costs and benefits of implementing adaptation technologies is relatively limited. The analysis presented in this paper shows that there is a large potential for integrating adaptation technologies into the planning and implementation of on-going and future projects. Based on local-level data from a technology needs assessment project in Lebanon, this paper presents two examples of the economic feasibility of implementing adaptation technologies in the agricultural and water sectors. The results show that the technologies can be applied at low cost and with relatively little effort.","[Traerup, Sara] Tech Univ Denmark, UNEP Risoe Ctr, UN City, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Stephan, Jean] Lebanese Univ, Fac Sci 2, Dept Earth & Life Sci, Fanar, Lebanon",Technical University of Denmark; Lebanese University,"Traerup, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, UNEP Risoe Ctr, UN City, Copenhagen, Denmark.",slmt@dtu.dk; dr.jeanstephan@gmail.com,,"Stephan, Jean/0000-0002-7377-8089; Traerup, Sara Laerke Meltofte/0000-0001-6419-9862",,,,,25,14,14,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Moreover, being member of farmer-based organization (FBO), access to credit and extension services, agricultural training of women are the main factors that increase the likelihood of adaptation. The gender-differentiated impact shows that women would earn more than men from adaptation, while losing compared to men if they do not take any adaptation actions. The loss from non-adapting to CC will increase by 0.268% of the soybean revenue. However, the heterogeneity effects suggest further assessment on the adopted technology in soybean farming in the study areas.

This paper contributes to the debate by analyzing different options to scale up climate change mitigation and adaptation. In particular, the empirical analysis indicates that increasing energy efficiency and reducing the use of fossil fuel in electricity generation could lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions, while investing in physical and financial resilience would yield long-run benefits. From a risk-reward perspective, the advantages of reducing the risks associated with climate change and the health benefits from higher environmental quality clearly outweigh the potential cost of climate change mitigation and adaptation in the short run.

However, in poor and low-income countries, this goal has not yet been reached. This is caused by several lacks in the technological mastery of water and wastewater treatment processes, fresh water and sanitation networks, and, finally, financial resources. Increasing the success chances to reach this goal should not happen by copying centralized water and sanitation systems used in high-income countries. Rather efforts need to be made towards energy-efficient decentralized water and wastewater treatment facilities, using simple and sustainable low-cost technologies. The present paper suggests solar wastewater treatment (SOWAT) as an easy decentralized and sustainable wastewater treatment. It combines three steps of conventional wastewater treatment (i.e., pretreatment, biological treatment, and disinfection) by using a single treatment step conducted in a single equipment: solar still. It is has been experimentally tested to treat saline, domestic, municipal, and industrial wastewaters. All obtained results have recorded significant removal of inorganic, organic, bacteriologic, and metallic pollution. For community and industrial use, a new design of a hybrid SOWAT micro-plant proposes the integration of a pretreatment stage and a smart multi-source heating system. It is decentralized because it is powered by solar energy, other renewable energies, recovered flared gas, or conventional energy. Its continuous operation during the decrease or absence of solar radiation, by night, is expected to increase its daily production from 255% to 1,500%.","[Igoud, S.; Aoudjit, L.; Boutra, B.; Sebti, A.] Ctr Dev Energies Renouvelables CDER, Unite Dev Equipements Solaires UDES, Route Natl 11, Bou Ismail 42415, Tipasa, Algeria; [Zeriri, D.; Khene, F.; Mameche, A.] Sonatrach Act Explorat & Prod, Div Laboratoires, Boumerdes, Algeria",Universite de M'hammed Bougara Boumerdes,"Igoud, S (corresponding author), Ctr Dev Energies Renouvelables CDER, Unite Dev Equipements Solaires UDES, Route Natl 11, Bou Ismail 42415, Tipasa, Algeria.",igoud.sadek@udes.dz,,,,,,,36,5,5,4,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1531-0353,1531-0361,,IRRIG DRAIN,Irrig.

Exhaustive case studies must be reported to understand the impact of climate change in a local area. However, there have been some difficulties in presenting all procedures used to derive the impact of climate change. Therefore, the current study presents a local case study of how a local small basin is prepared to mitigate the effects of climate change on extreme rainfall events. From the case study, the full procedure to produce an intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curve regarding a number of future global circulation model (GCM) daily precipitation scenarios is described in detail. The major portion of this work is focused on simply estimating extreme rainfall intensity with an IDF curve considering climate change scenarios from a GCM ensemble. From all available GCMs (19), the IDF ensemble is estimated with the following procedure: (1) daily GCM outputs obtained from the grid point that is closest to the target area were bias-corrected with gamma distribution after checking the suitability of the distribution model; (2) the bias-corrected daily precipitation data were downscaled; and (3) the IDF curves for the future scenarios were estimated and an ensemble was used to produce the final IDF curve. The result indicates that the IDF curve of future scenarios effectively inherits the behaviors of the original GCM daily precipitation outputs. The future IDF estimate will be employed to prepare for the effects of future climate change on extreme rainfall events on a local scale.

By illuminating the gaps between government policies on climate change and actual practices in planning and design, the study aims to provide useful directions for future research and practices. The primary problems we found are as follows: (1) the government's recent aggressive climate change policies have partly resulted in an adverse effect on the environment; (2) planning and design tools to implement climate change policies do not tend to consider local characteristics and different biophysical and sociocultural contexts; (3) climate change policies in Korea developed by different governmental departments are not coordinated well enough to effectively meet the policy goals; and (4) design tools or guidelines intended to aid the implementation of climate change policies at site level must be improved through the use of creative ideas and empirical tests. For future research, we recommend hunting for critical evidence as to why climate change policies are not implemented effectively in a particular local context, and determining how such failures can be overcome by applying adequate measures in planning and design.","[Kim, Jin-Oh; Suh, Joo-Hwan] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, Yongin, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Suh, JH (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, Yongin, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",jhsuh@khu.ac.kr,"Kim, Jin-Oh/ABG-9362-2020; , 서주환/AAM-3914-2021","Kim, Jin-Oh/0000-0003-4229-2120; ","''Cooperative Research Program for Agricultural Science & Technology Development'' Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea [PJ00996001]","''Cooperative Research Program for Agricultural Science & Technology Development'' Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea(Rural Development Administration (RDA), Republic of Korea)","This work was carried out with the support of Cooperative Research Program for Agricultural Science & Technology Development (Project No. PJ00996001)'' Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.",,14,7,7,5,34,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1860-1871,1860-188X,,LANDSC ECOL ENG,Landsc.

Although 'heat waves' are an annual occurrence, the associated heat-related deaths among vulnerable groups, such as older people, suggest that Australians could be better prepared to deal with extreme heat. Objective: To understand ways in which a vulnerable sub-population adapt their personal behaviour to cope with heat within the context of Australians' relationship with heat. Design: We draw upon scientific, historical and literary sources and on a set of repeat interviews in the suburbs of Western Sydney with eight older participants and two focus group discussions. We discuss ways in which this group of older people modifies their behaviour to adapt to heat, and reflect on manifestations of Australians' ambivalence towards heat. Results: Participants reported a number of methods for coping with extreme heat, including a number of methods of personal cooling, changing patterns of daily activity and altering dietary habits. The use of air-conditioning was near universal, but with recognition that increasing energy costs may become more prohibitive over time. Conclusions: While a number of methods are employed by older people to stay cool, these may become limited in the future. Australians' attitudes may contribute to the ill-health and mortality associated with excessive heat.","[Banwell, Cathy; Dixon, Jane; Bambrick, Hilary; Edwards, Ferne; Kjellstroem, Tord] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Bambrick, Hilary] Univ Western Sydney, Ctr Hlth Res, Campbelltown, NSW, Australia",Australian National University; Western Sydney University,"Bambrick, H (corresponding author), Univ Western Sydney, Ctr Hlth Res, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",h.bambrick@uws.edu.au,,"Edwards, Ferne/0000-0003-0389-193X; Banwell, Cathy/0000-0001-6808-1052; Dixon, Jane/0000-0003-4658-4307; Bambrick, Hilary/0000-0001-5361-950X","CSIRO; National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health on Healthy Urban Systems; CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship: Urbanism, Climate Adaptation, and Health Collaboration Cluster","CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health on Healthy Urban Systems; CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship: Urbanism, Climate Adaptation, and Health Collaboration Cluster","This study was funded by collaboration between CSIRO and the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health on Healthy Urban Systems and by the CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship: Urbanism, Climate Adaptation, and Health Collaboration Cluster.",,47,18,18,3,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,1654-9880,,GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION,Glob.

We define normative uncertainties as situations where there are different partially morally defensible -- but incompatible -- options or courses of action, or ones in which there is no fully morally defensible option. We conceptualize normative uncertainties, distinguishing between the four categories of evolutionary, theoretical, conceptual, and epistemic normative uncertainties. We will show different instances of normative uncertainties in climate adaptation strategies. We finally present two methods for identifying and dealing with normative uncertainties, namely, the Wide Reflective Equilibrium and adaptive planning. Situations of normative uncertainties have always been and will continue to be present in risk decisions and they have often been dealt with in an implicit manner.

This article presents one of the first empirical analyses of adaptation to flooding on a global scale. Using a sample of 97 countries between 1985 and 2010, we investigate the extent and pattern of flood adaptation by estimating the effects of a country's climatological risk, recent flood experiences, and socioeconomic characteristics on its flood-related fatalities. Our results provide mixed evidence on adaptation: countries facing greater long-term climatological flooding risks do not necessarily adapt better and suffer fewer fatalities; however, after controlling for the cross-country heterogeneity, we find that more recent flooding shocks have a significant and negative effect on fatalities from subsequent floods. These findings may suggest the short-term learning dynamics of adaptation and potential inefficacy of earlier flood control measures, particularly those that promote increased exposure in floodplains.

The MDP presents policy choices for the development of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. The plan offers economically attractive, climate adaptive and environmentally sustainable paths forward in the face of climate change and economic uncertainties. We collected our data using qualitative techniques, including a literature review and interviews. We found convergence between the MDP's agenda and political actors' agendas, though divergences were also detected. Between the delivery of the MDP in 2013 and formal endorsement of its ideas in 2017, the problem stream, policy stream and politics stream were brought together by the actions of policy entrepreneurs (scientists and experts). Our findings suggest that agenda-setting and convergence were a crucial step towards endorsement of the strategic delta planning process for the Mekong Delta. Further research could explore issues of power mobilization in enabling or constraining decision-making.","[Hoang Thi Minh Vo; van Halsema, Gerardo; Hellegers, Petra] Wageningen Univ, Water Resources Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hoang Thi Minh Vo] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Sci, VNU, HCM, Fac Environm, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Seijger, Chris] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Integrated Water Syst & Governance Dept, Delft, Netherlands; [Nhan Kieu Dang] Can Tho Univ, Mekong Delta Dev Res Inst, Can Tho, Vietnam; [Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Vietnam National University Hanoi; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Can Tho University; Wageningen University & Research,"Vo, HTM (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Water Resources Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Vo, HTM (corresponding author), Ho Chi Minh City Univ Sci, VNU, HCM, Fac Environm, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",vo.thiminhhoang@wur.nl,"Dewulf, Art/C-1271-2010","Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; hellegers, petra/0000-0002-4134-0568","UDW (Urbanizing Deltas of the World) Integrated Project on Strengthening Strategic Delta Planning Processes in Bangladesh, the Netherlands, Vietnam and beyond, of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [W 07.69.106]","UDW (Urbanizing Deltas of the World) Integrated Project on Strengthening Strategic Delta Planning Processes in Bangladesh, the Netherlands, Vietnam and beyond, of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)","This research was funded by the UDW (Urbanizing Deltas of the World) Integrated Project on Strengthening Strategic Delta Planning Processes in Bangladesh, the Netherlands, Vietnam and beyond, of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) under Project number W 07.69.106.",,46,10,10,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

These, in turn, have a considerable effect on two important elements of the Tuscan economy: wine production and tourism. This case study sought to explore the relationship between the perception of Tuscan wine-producing agritourism owners of the potentially abstract notion of climate change and their concrete experiences as entrepreneurs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight wine-producing agritourism owners or managers in Val d'Orcia, a small area of Siena, Tuscany, and analysed thematically. The impact of climate change on the area's viticulture is undeniable but the responses to the challenges are more nuanced. Political leadership on the climate crisis appears absent and perhaps as a consequence, these small-scale operators lack knowledge and funds to enable them to plan ahead: they react often day-to-day to the immediate weather conditions rather than planning long term. While recognizing the difficulties they face from climate change as viticulturists, as agrotourism owners they welcome the longer seasons which enable them to open in the formerly barren shoulder seasons but struggle with last-minute cancellations due to unpredictable weather in the area.","[Germanier, Rachel; Moricciani, Niccolo] Les Roches Global Hospitality Educ, CH-3975 Crans Montana, Switzerland",,"Germanier, R (corresponding author), Les Roches Global Hospitality Educ, CH-3975 Crans Montana, Switzerland.",rachel.germanier@lesroches.edu,,"Germanier, Rachel/0000-0002-5629-0882",,,,,74,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2023,15,3,,,,,,,2100,10.3390/su15032100,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15032100,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8U6NL,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000930066300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used high-resolution fossil pollen, charcoal, diatom and sediment chemistry data from the iconic archaeological setting of Laguna de los Condores, Peru to reconstruct changing land uses and climates in a forested Andean valley. Forest clearance and maize cultivation were initiated during periods of drought, with periods of forest recovery occurring during wetter conditions. Between ad 800 and 1000 forest regrowth was evident, but this trend was reversed between ad 1000 and 1200 as drier conditions coincided with renewed land clearance, the establishment of a permanent village and the use of cliffs overlooking the lake as a burial site. By ad 1230 forests had regrown in the valley and maize cultivation was greatly reduced. An elevational transect investigating regional patterns showed a parallel, but earlier, history of reduced maize cultivation and forest regeneration at mid-elevation. However, a lowland site showed continuous maize agriculture until European conquest but very little subsequent change in forest cover. Divergent, climate-sensitive landscape histories do not support categorical assessments that forest regrowth and peak carbon sequestration coincided with European arrival. Multi-proxy palaeoecological methods reconstruct phases of land clearance, maize cultivation and forest regrowth in the High Andes centuries before European incursion, and do not support the idea that forest regrowth and peak carbon sequestration were coincident with European arrival.","[Akesson, Christine M.; Matthews-Bird, Frazer; Bitting, Madeleine; Fennell, Christie-Jane; Valencia, Bryan G.; Bush, Mark B.] Florida Inst Technol, Inst Global Ecol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Church, Warren B.] Columbus State Univ, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Columbus, GA USA; [Peterson, Larry C.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Valencia, Bryan G.] Univ Reg Amazon IKIAM, Tena, Ecuador",Florida Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Columbus State University; University of Miami,"Akesson, CM (corresponding author), Florida Inst Technol, Inst Global Ecol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA.",ckesson2014@my.fit.edu,"Church, Warren B/HCI-3537-2022","Church, Warren/0000-0001-8003-4195; Fennell, Christie Jane/0000-0002-2229-6848; Akesson, Christine/0000-0002-1442-7019; Valencia Castillo, Bryan/0000-0002-5970-4964","National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX14AD31G]; National Science Foundation [EAR1338694, 1624207]; National Geographic Society [8763-10]",National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Geographic Society(National Geographic Society),"We are grateful to the community of Leymebamba for allowing us access to Lake Condores, and to archaeologists S.

However, the culture of prawn and shrimp in coastal Bangladesh has been accompanied by recent concerns over climate change. Different climatic variables, including cyclone, drought, flood, rainfall, salinity, sea level rise, and sea surface temperature have had adverse effects on prawn and shrimp production. Considering vulnerability to the effects of climate change on coastal aquaculture, one of the adaptation strategies is Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA). Open water IMTA in coastal Bangladesh would be a novel process of growing different finfish and shellfish with seaweeds in an integrated farm. IMTA is considered an ecosystem approach adaptation strategy to climate change which could generate environmental and economic benefits.

Our analysis is based on hedonic valuation of climatic conditions combining accommodation and travel cost estimations. Our results suggest that climatic change is likely to affect the relative attractiveness of EU regions for tourism activities. In certain regions, most notably the Southern EU Mediterranean regions, climate condition in 2100 could under current economic conditions, lower tourism revenues for up to -0.45 % of GDP per year. On the contrary, other areas of the EU, most notably Northern European regions would gain from altered climatic conditions, although these gains would be relatively more modest, reaching up to 0.32 % of GDP on an annual basis. Our results also suggest that the change in holiday duration would be more beneficial than the change in holiday frequency in view of mitigating the cost of climate change.

Key areas of good practice include: i. the development, running and documentation of crop models, with attention given to issues of spatial scale and complexity; ii. the methods used to form crop-climate ensembles, which can be based on model skill and/or spread; iii. the methods used to assess adaptation, which need broadening to account for technological development and to reflect the full range options available. The analysis highlights the limitations of focussing only on projections of future impacts and adaptation options using pre-determined time slices. Whilst this long-standing approach may remain an essential component of risk assessments, we identify three further key components: 1. Working with stakeholders to identify the timing of risks. What are the key vulnerabilities of food systems and what does crop-climate modelling tell us about when those systems are at risk? 2. Use of multiple methods that critically assess the use of climate model output and avoid any presumption that analyses should begin and end with gridded output. 3. Increasing transparency and inter-comparability in risk assessments. Whilst studies frequently produce ranges that quantify uncertainty, the assumptions underlying these ranges are not always clear. We suggest that the contingency of results upon assumptions is made explicit via a common uncertainty reporting format; and/or that studies are assessed against a set of criteria, such as those presented in this paper.","[Challinor, Andrew J.; Deva, Chetan; Nicklin, Kathryn Jane; Whitfield, Stephen; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian; Koehler, Ann -Kristin] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Challinor, Andrew J.; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, CGIAR ESSP Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secu, AA 6713, Cali, Colombia; [Mueller, Christoph] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Asseng, Senthold] Univ Florida, Agr & Biol Engn Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Wallach, Daniel] INRA, UMR AGIR, BP 52627, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Vanuytrecht, Eline] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Soil & Water Management, Celestijnenlaan 200E,PO 2411, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",University of Leeds; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; INRAE; KU Leuven,"Challinor, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",a.j.challinor@leeds.ac.uk,"Vanuytrecht, Eline/N-1699-2019; Challinor, Andrew J/C-4992-2008; Asseng, Senthold/Y-6014-2019; Challinor, Andrew/AAK-3023-2020; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/AAY-8073-2020; Wallach, Daniel/A-1194-2012; Müller, Christoph/E-4812-2016","Vanuytrecht, Eline/0000-0002-1247-6183; Challinor, Andrew J/0000-0002-8551-6617; Asseng, Senthold/0000-0002-7583-3811; Challinor, Andrew/0000-0002-8551-6617; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/0000-0002-8044-583X; Wallach, Daniel/0000-0003-3500-8179; Müller, Christoph/0000-0002-9491-3550","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/N004914/1, BB/K010476/1]; European Union Seventh Framework Programme under EUPORIAS project [308291]; European Union Seventh Framework Programme under SPECS project [308378]; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR; MACMIT project through the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LN1317A]; Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) [12I2216N]; BBSRC [BB/N004914/1, BB/K010476/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/K010476/1, BB/N004914/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); European Union Seventh Framework Programme under EUPORIAS project; European Union Seventh Framework Programme under SPECS project; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR(CGIAR); MACMIT project through the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","This work was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) grant numbers BB/N004914/1 and BB/K010476/1 (as part of the CropM theme of the FACCE-JPI MACSUR knowledge hub); and the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under the EUPORIAS project and the SPECS project (grant agreement number 308291 and 308378 respectively).; JRV and AJC are also supported by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

We combine the household-level panel data with weather and climate data to examine the heterogeneity of the impacts of climate change on crop yields across different crops and agro-ecologies in Ethiopia. Our results show that climate change will induce an increase in coffee and teff yields by 31% and 8.3%, respectively, at high altitudes by the years 2041-2060 compared to 1988-2018, under a medium emissions scenario. Conversely, it will reduce coffee yield by 3% at low altitudes, and barley, maize, and wheat yield by 22.7%, 48%, and 10%, respectively, at high altitudes. These findings suggest that tailoring agricultural development programs and climate adaptation strategies to address location and crop-specific sensitivity to climate change may help to build resilience and improve the livelihood of smallholder farmers.","[Ginbo, Tsegaye] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, POB 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Ginbo, T (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, POB 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",tsegaye.ginbo@slu.se,"Gatiso, Tsegaye Ginbo/HMV-2886-2023","Gatiso, Tsegaye Ginbo/0000-0003-2450-6236",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,Open access funding provided by Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.,,45,5,5,8,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Using anonymized data on mobility and calling behavior from 5.1 million Grameenphone users in Barisal Division and Chittagong District, Bangladesh, we investigate the effect of Cyclone Mahasen, which struck Barisal and Chittagong in May 2013. We characterize spatiotemporal patterns and anomalies in calling frequency, mobile recharges, and population movements before, during and after the cyclone. While it was originally anticipated that the analysis might detect mass evacuations and displacement from coastal areas in the weeks following the storm, no evidence was found to suggest any permanent changes in population distributions. We detect anomalous patterns of mobility both around the time of early warning messages and the storm's landfall, showing where and when mobility occurred as well as its characteristics. We find that anomalous patterns of mobility and calling frequency correlate with rainfall intensity (r = .75, p < 0.05) and use calling frequency to construct a spatiotemporal distribution of cyclone impact as the storm moves across the affected region. Likewise, from mobile recharge purchases we show the spatiotemporal patterns in people's preparation for the storm in vulnerable areas. In addition to demonstrating how anomaly detection can be useful for modeling human adaptation to climate extremes, we also identify several promising avenues for future improvement of disaster planning and response activities.","[Lu, Xin; Bengtsson, Linus] Karolinska Inst, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lu, Xin; Wetter, Erik; Tatem, Andrew J.; Bengtsson, Linus] Flowminder Fdn, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lu, Xin] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Informat Syst & Management, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wrathall, David J.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Sundsoy, Pal Roe; Iqbal, Asif; Qureshi, Taimur; Canright, Geoffrey S.; Engo-Monsen, Kenth] Telenor Res, Oslo, Norway; [Nadiruzzaman, Md.] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter, Devon, England; [Nadiruzzaman, Md.] Int Ctr Climate Change & Dev, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Wetter, Erik] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Tatem, Andrew J.] Univ Southampton, Dept Geog & Environm, WorldPop, Southampton, Hants, England",Karolinska Institutet; National University of Defense Technology - China; Oregon State University; University of Exeter; Stockholm School of Economics; University of Southampton,"Bengtsson, L (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Stockholm, Sweden.;Bengtsson, L (corresponding author), Flowminder Fdn, Stockholm, Sweden.",linus.bengtsson@flowminder.org,"Nadiruzzaman/AAD-2520-2021; Nadiruzzaman/AAF-4528-2019; lu, xin/C-1940-2009; Engø-Monsen, Kenth/M-3223-2019","Nadiruzzaman/0000-0002-4829-5114; lu, xin/0000-0002-3547-6493; Engø-Monsen, Kenth/0000-0003-1618-7597; Tatem, Andrew/0000-0002-7270-941X","Rockefeller Foundation; Munich Re Foundation; United Nations University-Institute for Environment and Human Security; International Centre for Climate Change and Development; Natural Science Foundation of China [71301165, 71522014]; Wellcome Trust [106866/Z/15/Z]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1106427, 1032350, OPP1134076, OPP1117016]; Swedish Research Council",Rockefeller Foundation; Munich Re Foundation; United Nations University-Institute for Environment and Human Security; International Centre for Climate Change and Development; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"Grameenphone provided data, analysis and dedicated support to the project.

In addition to correcting an erroneous rib rejoin, we document that Kebara 2 shows significant metric and morphological differences in comparison to a wide range of modern human comparative samples. Moreover, Kebara 2's thorax is large, but it is not an isometrically scaled version of a modern human thorax. We also present updated information regarding additional Neandertal rib remains that weakens the case for previous speculations regarding marked ecogeographical patterning in the Neandertal upper thorax. From these results, in combination with various other lines of evidence, we hypothesize that the large chest of Neandertals, while different from modern humans, is not autapomorphic but instead related to a primitive body bauplan: wide bodies with high body mass. A large thorax in pre-modern Homo, indicating a large vital capacity, would be consistent with the idea of increased oxygen consumption derived from higher energetic demands of a larger body and higher activity levels when compared to modem industrial samples. The likely presence of larger chests in the large bodied individuals from the middle Pleistocene of Eurasia and Africa (and even from the African lower Pleistocene) calls into question cold climate adaptation as a primary force for this skeletal morphology in Neandertals.","[Gomez-Olivencia, Asier; Miguel Carretero, Jose] Univ Burgos, Dpto Ciencias Hist & Geog, Lab Evoluc Humana, Burgos 09001, Spain; [Gomez-Olivencia, Asier; Miguel Carretero, Jose; Luis Arsuaga, Juan] Ctr UCM ISCIII Invest Evoluc & Comportamiento Hum, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Eaves-Johnson, K.

This paper examines rice farmers' vulnerability, adaptation strategies, and adaptation barriers to managing climate change impacts in the coastal region of Bangladesh. Survey data were collected from 220 randomly selected rice farmers located across two coastal districts of Bangladesh. A multinomial logit model was applied to analyze determinants of adaptation strategies of rice farmers. The results reveal that flood is the main risk to vulnerability, followed by cyclones and storms surges and saline intrusion. The main adaptation strategies are cultivating flood and salinity tolerant rice varieties, direct seeding of rice, supplementary irrigation, cultivation of non-rice crops that have shorter growth duration, and rearing of livestock, poultry, and duck. The econometric analysis shows that factors such as household head's education, household income, farm size, access to information, and extension services significantly influence the choice of adaptation strategies of the rice farmers. We recommend to increase investment in research, training of farmers, and targeted extension services to disseminate climate-smart technologies and information for minimising vulnerability of the farmers.","[Islam, Faijul; Begum, Rokeya] Sher E Bangla Agr Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Alam, G.

In accordance, identifying the additional science needed to improve our understanding of climate change and its impacts, including the scientific advances needed to improve the effectiveness of actions taken to adapt water systems, is of the utmost importance. To this aim, this research draws on a systematic bibliometric study of data, generated from the Web of Science research engine between 1990 and 2019, combined with a statistical analysis, to explore academic publication trends, and identify the strategic gaps and opportunities in global scientific research. The analysis shows the consistent level of national and international collaboration among authors, institutions, and countries, and highlights the substantial contribution of the USA and the UK to this research field. The statistical examination shows that the adaptation-informed literature on water systems remains fragmented, and predominantly centred on the framing of water resource planning and management, in addition to water engineering and infrastructure. The analysis also revealed a relatively skewed understanding of various important dimensions, such as governance, integrated water resources management, and stakeholder engagement, which are crucial for planning and implementing an efficient adaptation process. Observations reflect on the need to build water-related adaptive approaches based on a thorough understanding of potential climate uncertainties, rather than to generically address all the uncertainties in one scenario analysis. These approaches are required to combine short and longterm actions rather than considering only current and short-term measures, and to similarly associate policy and engineering, and equally consider the robustness, flexibility, reliability, and vulnerability during the planning phase.","[Sawassi, Aymen; Khadra, Roula] Mediterranean Agron Inst Bari, Int Ctr Adv Mediterranean Agron Studies, Via Ceglie 9, I-70010 Valenzano, Italy; [Sawassi, Aymen] Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Sci & Technol, I-80133 Naples, Italy",CIHEAM; CIHEAM BARI; Parthenope University Naples,"Khadra, R (corresponding author), Mediterranean Agron Inst Bari, Int Ctr Adv Mediterranean Agron Studies, Via Ceglie 9, I-70010 Valenzano, Italy.",aymen.sawassi@uniparthenope.it; Khadra@iamb.it,"Khadra, Roula/U-3862-2019","Khadra, Roula/0000-0003-2117-1557; Sawassi, Aymen/0000-0002-7390-2000",,,,,45,2,2,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2021,13,12,,,,,,,6738,10.3390/su13126738,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13126738,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TB3YF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000667882000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the third year, the productivity at FM increased to a level similar to the GM site. The higher productivity at GM was mainly caused by its higher photosynthetic capacity. Grazing exclusion did not increase carbon sequestration capacity for this alpine grassland system. The higher optimal photosynthetic temperature and the weakened ecosystem response to climatic factors at GM may help to facilitate the adaption of alpine meadow ecosystems to changing climate.","[Zhang, Tao; Zhang, Yangjian; Xu, Mingjie; Zhu, Juntao; Yu, Guirui; Niu, Shuli; Xi, Yi; Zhang, Xianzhou; Wang, Jingsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tao; Xu, Mingjie] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Agron, Shenyang 110866, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tao; Zhang, Yangjian; Zhu, Juntao; Xi, Yi; Zhang, Xianzhou; Wang, Jingsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tao; Xi, Yi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wimberly, Michael C.] S Dakota State Univ, Geospatial Sci Ctr Excellence, Brookings, SD 57007 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Shenyang Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; South Dakota State University","Zhang, YJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhangyj@igsnrr.ac.cn,"于, 贵瑞/C-1768-2014; Zhang, XZ/HJA-4189-2022; zhang, xian/GYA-0290-2022","于, 贵瑞/0000-0002-1859-8966; Niu, Shuli/0000-0002-2394-2864; Xu, Mingjie/0000-0002-5923-2901","973 Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2013CB956302]; One Hundred Talent Plan, Chinese Academy of Sciences","973 Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China(National Basic Research Program of China); One Hundred Talent Plan, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This work was supported by the 973 Program (2013CB956302) of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and One Hundred Talent Plan, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In those regions, climate change is projected to exacerbate water-scarcity and increase the recurrence and intensity of droughts. These circumstances call for methodologies that can support the design of sustainable water management. This paper presents a hydro-economic model that links a reduced form hydrological component, with economic and environmental components. The model is applied to an arid and semiarid basin in Southeastern Spain to analyze the effects of droughts and to assess alternative adaptation policies. Results indicate that drought events have large impacts on social welfare, with the main adjustments sustained by irrigation and the environment. The water market policy seems to be a suitable option to overcome the negative economic effects of droughts, although the environmental effects may weaken its advantages for society. The environmental water market policy, where water is acquired for the environment, is an appealing policy to reap the private benefits of markets while protecting ecosystems. The current water management approach in Spain, based on stakeholders' cooperation, achieves almost the same economic outcomes and better environmental outcomes compared to a pure water market. These findings call for a reconsideration of the current management in arid and semiarid basins around the world. The paper illustrates the potential of hydro-economic modeling for integrating the multiple dimensions of water resources, becoming a valuable tool in the advancement of sustainable water management policies.

Yet, international and national policies to tackle climate change have focused more on mitigation than adaptation. On the other hand, indigenous communities have been continuously adapting to environmental stresses for millennia, including more recent cascading impacts of climate change. Indigenous communities have developed a wealth of information in the form of their traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), based on their observations of the obvious linkages between changing climatic conditions and biodiversity. Here, I hypothesize that in harsh environments such as the alpine Himalaya, social systems particularly local institutions that are largely based on TEK are important in improving adaptive capacity by providing social, economic, and ecological security to the community. I provide an insight into the adaptation strategies of two communities that inhabit the alpine zones of the Sikkim Himalaya, in India. We address two broad questions: (1) How are indigenous communities in the vulnerable alpine zones of the Himalaya adapting to the complex challenges posed by climate change particularly in conjunction with their indigenous governing institution? We give examples of adaptation strategies and broadly categorize them into six groups, namely (a) Institutional capital, (b) Rationing, (c) Forecasting, (d) Mobility, (e) Economic diversification, and (f) Communal pooling. (2) How can TEK be integrated with climate change sciences for improving data availability and better policy? I conclude with a framework that uses a holistic approach complementing the rigor of science with the wealth of TEK to suggest pathways for improved policy response to climate change.","[Ingty, Tenzing] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Ingty, T (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",tenzingingty@gmail.com,"ingty, tenzing/GRY-2854-2022","ingty, tenzing/0000-0001-7993-4241",,,,,69,35,36,3,77,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

J,"Oliver-Smith, A",,,,"Oliver-Smith, Anthony",,,Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation: The View from Applied Anthropology,HUMAN ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In working with and researching in communities that have suffered the impacts of disasters or displacement over the last 40 years, I am convinced of the need to link theory to practice in applied anthropology. The trying circumstances faced by people in disasters and displacement, as well as the enormous variation that these millions of people in their diverse contexts represent, test the resilience of real communities, the fundamental constructions we have developed about community, and the theories and methods employed to assist them in recovery. In my work, I have found that it is both appropriate and necessary that theoretical and policy oriented projects be closely linked. If policies and projects related to disasters and displacement are not based on a solid understanding of human behavior in general and cultural behavior specifically, their success in terms of how they respond to human needs is jeopardized. By the same token, policy and practice can form the testing ground for theory. In other words, if policy or practice fail to produce beneficial outcomes, it is not the fault of the people, but in effect, signals us that we need to improve our theory and methods in addressing the losses and needs of affected people. In broader terms, then, my goals have always been to bring theory and practice together to better inform applied anthropological practice in disasters and displacement. The 20th century saw enormous numbers of people and their communities damaged, destroyed, or uprooted by conflict, environmental upheaval, natural and technological disasters, and infrastructural development projects. Forces ranging from intensified disasters, ethnic nationalism, global climate change, and globalized forms of development promise more of the same for the century we are just beginning. This paper traces the development of applied anthropological theory and method in meeting the challenges posed by such forces in the 21st century.","[Oliver-Smith, Anthony] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Oliver-Smith, Anthony] UN Univ Inst Environm & Human Secur, Munich Re Fdn Chair Social Vulnerabil, Bonn, Germany",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Munich RE Group,"Oliver-Smith, A (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",,,,,,,,26,35,35,2,52,SOC APPLIED ANTHROPOLOGY,OKLAHOMA CITY,"3000 UNITED FOUNDERS BLVD, STE 148, OKLAHOMA CITY, OK 73112 USA",0018-7259,1938-3525,,HUM ORGAN,Hum.

Coastal population growth and projected climate change impacts will expose more people, land and assets to erosion and inundation increasing demand for coastal protection. Established coastal protection funding approaches, such as general taxation, intergovernmental transfers (grants with no obligation for repayment), and private investment to protect private property are constrained in meeting the funding required for future coastal protection needs in many areas. The coastal adaptation funding gap is the difference between current funding and future demand, a problem for governments that requires the identification of alternative approaches to funding coastal protection. This article presents four case studies of alternative funding approaches used to deliver coastal protection projects in Australia. These cases we analysed to identify strategies governments can adopt to reduce the coastal adaptation funding gap: i) use statutory powers to coerce funding from private beneficiaries thereby ensuring that public funds are focused on public goods, where opportunities for private funding is limited; ii) seek standardisation of design of coastal protection and adopt a coordinating role to reduce costs for coastal protection across the project lifecycle; iii) include opportunities for income generation within the design stage of coastal protection projects to extend public funds; and; iv) use debt finance to align the timing of project costs to local benefits and reduce the time to obtain the required capital. In each of the cases, the combination of political imperative to act and the absence of access to established funding approaches appear to have motivated the use of alternative approaches. The findings provide important lessons for climate adaptation finance and coastal protection governance where identification of alternative funding approaches is necessary.","[Ware, Daniel] Griffith Univ, Griffith Ctr Coastal Management, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Banhalmi-Zakar, Zsuzsa] James Cook Univ Townsville, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",Griffith University; James Cook University,"Ware, D (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Ctr Coastal Management, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",d.ware@griffith.edu.au; zsuzsa.banhalmizakar@jcu.edu.au,,"Banhalmi-Zakar, Zsuzsa/0000-0003-3544-9353",Commonwealth of Australia through the Australian Climate Change Adaptation Research Network for Settlements and Infrastructure,Commonwealth of Australia through the Australian Climate Change Adaptation Research Network for Settlements and Infrastructure,This work was supported by the Commonwealth of Australia through the Australian Climate Change Adaptation Research Network for Settlements and Infrastructure.,,56,1,1,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,DEC 1,2020,198,,,,,,,,105223,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105223,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105223,,,10,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,OZ2CC,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000594739500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using data from a systematic review of peer-reviewed empirical research on adaptation responses to climate change (n = 1,682), we present an assessment of how social equity is considered in adaptation across regions, sectors, and social groups. Roughly 60% of peer-reviewed literature on adaptation responses considers social equity by reporting on which marginalized groups were involved in planning or implementation. Articles on responses in Africa and Asia and those focusing on poverty reduction most frequently considered social equity. Equity was less likely to be considered in adaptation responses in Europe, Australasia, and North America, as well as in literature focused on cities. Income-based inequity was more frequently considered than gender, age, or Indigenous status. Ethnic and racial minorities, migrants, and people with disabilities were rarely considered. Attention to the levels and forms in which equity is integrated into adaptation research and practice is needed to ensure just adaptation.","[Araos, Malcolm] NYU, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Jagannathan, Kripa] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA USA; [Shukla, Roopam] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Ajibade, Idowu] Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [de Perez, Erin Coughlan; van Aalst, Maarten] Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, The Hague, Netherlands; [Davis, Katy; Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Galappaththi, Eranga K.] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Grady, Caitlin] Penn State Univ, State Coll, PA USA; [Hudson, A.

In order to disrupt this securitization of climate policy, we draw on the insights of feminist geopolitics and what Koopman calls alter-geopolitics to consider how contemporary grassroots movements like the Sanctuary movement and #BlackLivesMatter have made connections between political, economic and environmental vulnerabilities while developing relationships of solidarity and care that broaden, disseminate, distribute and regenerate security as an expansive and inclusive project.

We develop different sets of simple and multiple linear regression models using both traditional climate indices and tailored indices based on nearby atmospheric/oceanic variables (winds, pressure, sea surface temperature) as independent predictors. The models, after being tested for spatial and temporal stability, are capable of explaining large fractions of the observed variability, up to 96% at individual sites and more than 80% on average across the region. Using the model predictions as covariates in a quasi nonstationary extreme value analysis also significantly reduces the range of change in the 100 year RWLs over time, turning a nonstationary process into a stationary one. This suggests that the modelswhen used with regional and global climate model output of the predictorswill also be capable of projecting future RWL changes.

The necessary paradigm shift from the traditional approaches to embracing environmental sustainability requires maintaining a firm and stable balancing act between opposing forces. The policy-making process in the transition period is complex and requires a detailed analysis that the academic literature lacks. This study analyzes the decision-making process for urban mobility planning to contribute the academic liter-ature on sustainable transitions. In order to illustrate the complexities in the decision-making process, we design an original case scenario. In the case, the planners are supposed to choose the best project from among four recent green strategies. In the process, they need to take the conflicting requirements on the social, economic, environmental and technical issues into account. Sixteen constraints reflect the available physical and financial conditions. Because the decision-making process includes complexities, a novel two-stages model is introduced in the method that is used to solve the problem. In the first stage, the fuzzy D PIvot Pairwise RElative Criteria Importance Assessment (PIPRECIA) algorithm is applied to determine the weights. In the second stage, the fuzzy D Dombi (fuzzy 2D) algorithm is proposed to evaluate the alternatives. The results show that societal dynamics are crucially important in choosing the best alternative. Among four alternatives, the one that is inclusive and makes the existing investments more efficient is highly prioritized. Our findings offer policy implications emphasizing the importance of green mobility projects that favors the social benefits as well as financial issues.","[Pamucar, Dragan] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Deveci, Muhammet] Natl Def Univ, Turkish Naval Acad, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34940 Istanbul, Turkey; [Stevic, Zeljko] Univ East Sarajevo, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Vojvode Mis 52, Doboj 74000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Gokasar, Ilgin] Bogaz Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey; [Isik, Mehtap] Bogaz Univ, Dept Int Trade, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey; [Deveci, Muhammet; Coffman, D'Maris] UCL, Bartlett Sch Sustainable Construct, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Coffman, D'Maris] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, Via Festa Perdono 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Belgrade; University of London; University College London; University of Milan,"Deveci, M (corresponding author), Natl Def Univ, Turkish Naval Acad, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34940 Istanbul, Turkey.;Deveci, M (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Sch Sustainable Construct, London WC1E 6BT, England.",dragan.pamucar@fon.bg.ac.rs; muhammetdeveci@gmail.com; ilgin.gokasar@boun.edu.tr; ozcanli@boun.edu.tr; d.coffman@ucl.ac.uk,"Deveci, Muhammet/V-8347-2017; Isik, Mehtap/AGT-3430-2022; Pamucar, Dragan/AAG-8288-2019; Stević, Željko/P-6467-2018; GOKASAR, ILGIN/N-7044-2016","Deveci, Muhammet/0000-0002-3712-976X; Isik, Mehtap/0000-0002-5210-4480; Pamucar, Dragan/0000-0001-8522-1942; Stević, Željko/0000-0003-4452-5768; GOKASAR, ILGIN/0000-0001-9896-9220; Coffman, D'Maris/0000-0003-3792-4744",,,,,87,3,3,14,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

A purposive sample of 26 older adults' survivors who had experienced typhoon, without experience, with family, and without family were interviewed using a focus group discussion. Four themes were generated: 'Understanding one's culture generates resilience that can turn huge impact in coping with disaster', 'Holding on to their faith by praying or acting practically during adversities still promotes adaptation', 'Gaining previous experiences is crucial to the positive outcome', 'Getting social support or not promotes adaptation'. These concepts are connected with each other, and the relationship of these factors facilitates the rebuilding of the older adults' lives.

In the contextual model of future climate change, peasant households' net income of unit land area will be greatly reduced. Except that temperature rise in autumn has positive effects on peasant households' net income of unit land area, temperature rise in winter, spring and summer all reduces peasant households' income. When the temperature rises 1 degrees C, peasant households' net income per Mu land reduces 28.50 Yuan; when the precipitation rises 1mm, net income per Mu land reduces 16.47 Yuan.

The WaterExe4.0 Meta-Study Identifies Barriers as well as Success Factors, and Reveals Expectations for the Future",ENERGIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,smart water; success factors; digitization; sustainability,,"Water is increasingly taking center stage when it comes to coping with climate change. Especially in urban areas, negative consequences from heavy rainfall events and prolonged dry periods are rising worldwide. In the past, the various tasks of urban water management were performed by different departments that often did not cooperate with each other (water supply, wastewater disposal, green space irrigation, etc.), as the required water supply was not a question of available water volumes. This is already changing with climate change, in some cases even dramatically. More and more, it is necessary to consider how to distribute available water resources in urban areas, especially during dry periods, since wastewater treatment is also becoming more complex and costly. In the future, urban water management will examine water use in terms of its various objectives, and will need to provide alternative water resources for these different purposes (groundwater, river water, storm water, treated wastewater, etc.). The necessary technological interconnection requires intelligent digital systems. Furthermore, the water industry must also play its role in global CO2 reduction and make its procedural treatment processes more efficient; this will also only succeed with adequate digital systems. Although digitization has experienced an enormous surge in development over the last five years and numerous solutions are available to address the challenges described previously, there is still a large gap between the scope of offerings and their implementation. Researchers at Hof University of Applied Sciences have investigated the reasons for this imbalance as part of WaterExe4.0, the first meta-study on digitization in the German-speaking water industry, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Only 11% of roughly 700 identified products, projects and studies relate to real applications. For example, the surveyed experts of the water sector stated that everyday problems are considered too little or hardly at all in new solutions, which greatly overburdens users. Furthermore, they see no adequate possibility for a systematic analysis of new ideas to identify significant obstacles and to find the best way to start and implement a digitization project. The results from four methodologically different sub-surveys (literature and market research, survey, expert interviews and workshops) provide a reliable overview of the current situation in the German-speaking water industry and its expectations for the future.

The changing climate is a global challenge to sustainable livelihoods and economic development. Peasant farmers in Zimbabwe depend entirely on rain-fed agriculture, a situation that makes agriculture and rural livelihoods vulnerable to climate change. This paper discusses the findings of the study carried out in the Zvimba District amongst peasant farmers on their knowledge of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies. Semi-structured interviews, observations and document analysis were used as methodologies for data collection for the study. Purposeful sampling technique was applied to 40 peasant farmers. Qualitative data from interviews and focus group discussion were analysed using context analysis. Households acknowledged that rainfall amount has decreased over the last 30 years. Such changes have reduced agricultural productivity, and in response, communities have developed multiple adaptation strategies such as harnessing social capital, crop and livelihood diversification, engaging in small businesses and water harvesting for livestock keeping. The study concludes that there is a need to recognise the validity of indigenous knowledge and an inventory should be created for future use. The paper notes that diversification of adaptive strategies is vital for sustainable livelihood in a changing climate.","[Mashizha, Tinashe M.] Community Capac Bldg Initiat Ctr Africa, Kadoma, Zimbabwe",,"Mashizha, TM (corresponding author), Community Capac Bldg Initiat Ctr Africa, Kadoma, Zimbabwe.",tmashizha@gmail.com,"Mashizha, Tinashe/Q-3070-2019","Mashizha, Tinashe/0000-0001-5582-2157",,,,,40,17,17,1,7,AFRICAN CENTRE DISASTER STUDIES,POTCHEFSTROOM,"INTERNAL BOX 265, NORTH-WEST UNIV, PRIVATE BAG X6001, POTCHEFSTROOM, 2520, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

The study of migration in the context of anthropogenic climate change is often approached using the concept of vulnerability and its key functional elements: exposure, system sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. This article explores the interaction of climate change and vulnerability through review of case studies of dry-season migration in the West African Sahel, hurricane-related population displacements in the Caribbean basin, winter migration of 'snowbirds' to the US Sun-belt, and 1930s drought migration on the North American Great Plains. These examples are then used as analogues for identifying general causal, temporal, and spatial dimensions of climate migration, along with potential considerations for policy-making and future research needs.

Scholars describe this framing process as climatization. In our research, we conduct a qualitative content analysis of sector journal articles to investigate the climatization of drought within the three most affected policy fields in Germany: agriculture, water management, and forestry. The research objectives are to investigate how climatization processes evolve and take place within a specific policy field, and what different modes of climatization can be identified. The results are based on a framing analysis of 267 articles from journals published by political associations of farmers, water managers, and foresters at both the national and a state level, covering drought problematization relating to two major drought events in 2003 and 2011-2012. The article shows that four modes of climatization can be distinguished: scientification, securitization, technocratization, and transformation. With this empirically based heuristic, we contribute to advancing the concept of climatization by operationalizing it into a more profound, empirically grounded analytical concept that can be applied to critically investigate policymaking processes related to reducing disaster risks and achieving climate adaptation.","[Mueller, Wibke; Kruse, Sylvia] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Forest & Environm Policy, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Muller, W (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Forest & Environm Policy, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",wibke.mueller@ifp.uni-freiburg.de,"Kruse, Sylvia/E-7096-2014","Muller, Wibke/0000-0002-5656-0408","Ministry of Science, Research, and Art of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg","Ministry of Science, Research, and Art of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg","Ministry of Science, Research, and Art of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg",,51,0,0,4,16,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

After two decades of practice, recent analysis is highlighting that CBA has its limits, which we argue is in part because it is predicated on an idea of 'the communal' as being local, static, and spatially distinct. We investigate the relationship between the nature of community and the successful implementation of CBA through an ethnographic longitudinal study in Namdrik in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. We show that the Namdrik community is best understood as a spatially dynamic network of actors whose sense of shared purpose and capacity to act varies over time in response to demographic, economic and political circumstances. These processes at times weaken the shared commitment necessary for collective action on adaptation, especially as the material support and leadership that initiated CBA in Namdrik has waned. In such circumstances, the success of CBA is spatiotemporally contingent, and depends heavily on the persistence of factors that sustain shared commitment to the task, which most often means ongoing financial and technical support for activities and for community leaders.","[Jarillo, Sergio; Barnett, Jon] Univ Melbourne, Fac Sci, Sch Geog Earth & Atmospher Sci SGEAS, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Jarillo, S (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Sci, Sch Geog Earth & Atmospher Sci SGEAS, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",sergio.jarillo@unimelb.edu.au; jbarn@unimelb.edu.au,"Barnett, Jon/E-2122-2013","Barnett, Jon/0000-0002-0862-0808",Australian Research Council [FL180100040]; Constantine Niarchos Foundation; Australian Research Council [FL180100040] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Constantine Niarchos Foundation; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Kommol tata to the people of Namdrik Atoll and in particular to the late Mattlan Zackhras, Wisely Zackhras, Clarence Luther and Alden Luther.

As the use of LIDs for climate adaptation increases, practitioners need more knowledge on LID performance in future climates for successful planning and implementation. In this study, temporal downscaling of regional climate projections for three cities in Norway is performed, using the concept of scale invariance to downscale the distribution of extreme precipitation from daily to sub-daily timescales. From this, local-scale intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves for future precipitation were obtained. Using climate projections of daily temporal resolution as input to water balance models and the obtained IDF relationships as input to event-based models allowed for assessing the retention capacity, peak flow reduction potential and pollution control of three different types of LIDs: green roofs, bioretention cells, and detention basins. The downscaling resulted in large local variations in presumed increase of both precipitation amount and intensity, contradicting current design recommendations in Norway. Countrywide, a decrease in the overall LID performance was found, although some positive effects of temperature rises were detected. The study illustrated the importance of evapotranspiration- and infiltration-based processes in future stormwater management and how coupling of LID structures in series can significantly reduce required detention volumes.","[Kristvik, Erle; Johannessen, Birgitte Gisvold; Muthanna, Tone Merete] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn IBM, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Kristvik, E (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn IBM, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",erle.kristvik@ntnu.no; birgitte.g.johannessen@ntnu.no; tone.muthanna@ntnu.no,"Muthanna, Tone Merete/S-2449-2019","Muthanna, Tone Merete/0000-0002-4438-2202; Johannessen, Birgitte Gisvold/0000-0003-0053-5016","European Commission through the H2020 project BINGO-Brining INnovation to onGOing water management-a better future under climate change [641739]; Research Council of Norway [241827]; Municipality of Trondheim, Norway","European Commission through the H2020 project BINGO-Brining INnovation to onGOing water management-a better future under climate change; Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Municipality of Trondheim, Norway","This research was funded in part by the European Commission through the H2020 project BINGO-Brining INnovation to onGOing water management-a better future under climate change (Grant No 641739), in part by The Research Council of Norway (Grant No 241827), and in part by the Municipality of Trondheim, Norway.",,65,15,15,4,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR 1,2019,11,5,,,,,,,1231,10.3390/su11051231,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11051231,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HQ8GA,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000462661000015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Forest management decisions (with or without anticipation of climate change) are made by each forest owner individually. Within a forest landscape, anticipation of climate change will thus reflect the different attitudes of the different owners. Many forest-based ecosystem services integrate the effect of the management strategies of different owners at a landscape scale. Some ecosystem services are enjoyed privately by the forest owners; others are enjoyed publicly without clear feedback to the individual owners. Here we use a spatially explicit simulation of a forest landscape in the Netherlands. This landscape is managed by a patchwork of different forest owners with different objectives: from strict nature reserve to more timber production oriented. We simulate the development of the forest landscape under different climatic scenarios and with different management scenarios to adapt the forest to anticipated climate change. We evaluate the impact of these scenarios using indicators for six ecosystem services. Both climate change and anticipation of climate change can severely affect the provisioning of ecosystem services by the forest landscape. Precautionary management, designed to minimise damage from climate change, was able to balance, at the landscape level, the effect of changes in ecosystem services and avoids landscape shifts between privately and publicly enjoyed ecosystem services. On the other hand, a scenario mainly consisting of management schemes that tried to extract extra (private) benefits from anticipated climate change would greatly reduce the supply of the other (publicly enjoyed) ecosystem services at the landscape level.","[Hengeveld, Geerten M.; Didion, Markus; Clerkx, Sandra; Nabuurs, Gert-Jan; Schelhaas, Mart-Jan] Wageningen UR, Alterra, Vegetat Forest & Landscape Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hengeveld, Geerten M.] Wageningen Univ, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Didion, Markus] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Resource Anal Forest Resources & Management, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Elkin, Che] ETH, Waldokol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Hengeveld, GM (corresponding author), Wageningen UR, Alterra, Vegetat Forest & Landscape Ecol, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",Geerten.hengeveld@wur.nl; Markus.Didion@wsl.ch; Sandra.Clerkx@wur.nl; Che.Elkin@env.ethz.ch; Gert-Jan.Nabuurs@wur.nl; MartJan.Schelhaas@wur.nl,"Hengeveld, Geerten/O-8943-2019; Nabuurs, Gert-Jan/D-8048-2015","Schelhaas, Mart-Jan/0000-0003-4525-2677; Didion, Markus/0000-0003-0346-0646; Hengeveld, Geerten/0000-0002-9592-3080",Motive project [226544]; Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Netherlands; Integral [282887],"Motive project; Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Netherlands(Ministry of Economic Affairs, Netherlands); Integral","The authors are indebted to Age Fennema (Middachten), Arjan van Knapen (Gelders Landschap), Andre ten Hoedt, Wim Knol (Natuurmonumenten), W.J.

An integrated approach was followed concentrating on enhancement of food security and preservation of environmental quality. Climate change projections were extracted from the Hadley Climate Center (HadCM3) coupled global circulation model (GCM). Impact and adaptation strategies were evaluated with a coupled modeling framework based on the soil-water-atmosphere-plant (SWAP) field scale model and the water and salinity basin model (WSBM) basin scale model. Three time periods were considered where the 1961-1990 period was used to adjust climate change projections to local conditions and to provide a reference to compare expected changes in the near future (2010-2039) and distant future (2070-2099). The overall impact of climate change on food security and environmental quality appears to be positive as a result of enhanced crop growth due to higher CO2 levels and a small increase in precipitation. However, extremes will be more profound in the future, making adaptation strategies necessary. Results from the modeling framework have been presented in a format accessible to water resources managers and policy makers to enable them to make sound decisions on the required adaptation strategies.

In order to evaluate potential impacts and adaptation options for Mozambique, we develop an integrated modeling framework that translates atmospheric changes from general circulation model projections into biophysical outcomes via detailed hydrologic, crop, hydropower and infrastructure models. These sector models simulate a historical baseline and four extreme climate change scenarios. Sector results are then passed down to a dynamic computable general equilibrium model, which is used to estimate economy-wide impacts on national welfare, as well as the total cost of damages caused by climate change. Potential damages without changes in policy are significant; our discounted estimates range from US$ 2.3 to US $7.4 billion during 2003-2050. Our analysis identifies improved road design and agricultural sector investments as key 'no-regret' adaptation measures, alongside intensified efforts to develop a more flexible and resilient society.

The existence of an adaptation strategy does not, however, equal implementation of adaptation and the fact that adaptation is taking place across multiple levels also poses new challenges to its efficient implementation. The literature on barriers of adaptation has been increasing rapidly, questioning whether there is a misconception that barriers to implementation can be solved at the local level. Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses the implementation of adaptation strategies across multiple levels of governance by focusing on the land use planning in Finland. The case study examines the implementation of adaptation in the metropolitan region of Helsinki through a policy document analysis. Findings - The conclusions highlight that there are barriers at the local level that emerge from the existing governance structures and cannot be solved by the local level alone. There needs to be a further recognition that coordination across levels of governance is a factor in overcoming barriers. Originality/value - So far, there are very few studies that have analysed barriers in relation to the implementation of adaptation in a multi-level setting, and none in the land use sector, which is inherently hierarchical in nature.","[Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Juhola, Sirkku] Aalto Univ, Dept Built Environm, Espoo, Finland",University of Helsinki; Aalto University,"Juhola, S (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland.;Juhola, S (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Dept Built Environm, Espoo, Finland.",sirkku.juhola@helsinki.fi,"Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282",,,,,56,13,14,1,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

As rising waters threaten communities inhabiting the low-lying coastal islands scattered across the deltaic plain, many within the government and donor community have identified shrimp aquaculture as a principal adaptation strategy. Shrimp aquaculture is integral to the dynamics of what I call anticipatory ruination, a discursive and material process of social and ecological destruction in anticipation of real or perceived threats. I elaborate anticipatory ruination as a process that both responds to and produces Bangladesh's climate crisis.

Much spatial and temporal variation in the response of different crops to climate change can thus be anticipated. In previous work we showed that a large part of this variation can be explained in terms of temperature and, to a lesser extent, water effects. Here, we summarise simulated yield response in two crops that are widely grown in the region, maize and beans, and investigate how the impacts of climate change might be addressed at two levels: the agricultural system and the household. Regionally, there are substantial between-country and within-system differences in maize and bean production responses projected to 2050. The arid-semiarid mixed crop-livestock systems are projected to see reductions in maize and bean production throughout most of the region to 2050. Yields of these crops in the tropical highland mixed systems are projected to increase, sometimes substantially. The humid-subhumid mixed systems show more varied yield responses through time and across space. Some within-country shifts in cropping away from the arid-semiarid systems to cooler, higher-elevation locations may be possible, but increased regional trade should be able to overcome the country-level production deficits in maize and beans caused by climate change to 2050, all other things being equal. For some places in the tropical highlands, maize and bean yield increases could have beneficial effects on household food security and income levels. In the other mixed systems, moderate yield losses can be expected to be offset by crop breeding and agronomic approaches in the coming decades, while more severe yield losses may necessitate changes in crop types, movement to more livestock-orientated production, or abandonment of cropping altogether. These production responses are indicative only, and their effects will be under-estimated because the methods used here have not accounted for increasing weather variability in the future or changes in the distribution and impacts of biotic and other abiotic stresses. These system-level shifts will take place in a context characterised by high population growth rates; the demand for food is projected to nearly triple by the middle of this century. Systems will have to intensify substantially in response, particularly in the better-endowed mixed systems in the region. For the more marginal areas, the variability in yield response, and the variability in households' ability to adapt, suggest that, even given the limitations of this analysis, adaptation options need to be assessed at the level of the household and the local community, if research for development is to meet its poverty alleviation and food security targets in the face of global change.

Therefore, unfavourable environmental and climatic conditions render them more vulnerable to increasing food insecurity and poverty rates. However, few studies have investigated how farmers' adaptation strategies affect farm productivity and household food security in the Sahelian region, notably Mali. We analyse factors that influence adaptation strategies to climate change and the impacts of the adaptation strategies on maize productivity and household food security in southern Mali. Farmers use adaptation strategies such as organic fertilizers, changing planting dates and growing of short duration maize varieties to mitigate against the negative effects of climate change. We find that farmer experience, number of livestock owned, off-farm employment, access to credit, farmer association and technical training exert positive effects on the use of planting short-duration maize varieties as an adaptation strategy, while distance to the farm shows a negative effect. We observe that household size, experience in maize farming, number of livestock owned and technical training positively influence farmers to change planting dates as an adaptation strategy. The use of organic fertilizers and short-duration maize varieties promote maize productivity and food security. We conclude that building farmers' adaptive capacity tends to reduce their vulnerability to climate change by increasing crop yields and food security.","[Diallo, Aboubacar] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Bamako, Mali; [Diallo, Aboubacar] Rhine Waal Univ Appl Sci, Bamako, Mali; [Emmanuel, Donkor] Rhine Waal Univ Appl Sci, Fac Life Sci, Marie Curie Str 1, D-47533 Kleve, Germany; [Owusu, Victor] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agr Econ Agribusiness & Extens, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Diallo, A (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Bamako, Mali.;Diallo, A (corresponding author), Rhine Waal Univ Appl Sci, Bamako, Mali.",dialloaboubacar44@yahoo.fr; edonkor.knust@gmail.com; vowusu.agric@knust.edu.gh,"Donkor, Emmanuel/H-3745-2014; Owusu, Victor/GQA-8523-2022","Donkor, Emmanuel/0000-0001-9279-1484; Owusu, Victor/0000-0002-5277-1128",Borlaug Higher Education for Agricultural Research and Development (BHEARD) [BFS-G-11-00002],Borlaug Higher Education for Agricultural Research and Development (BHEARD),This study was funded by the Borlaug Higher Education for Agricultural Research and Development (BHEARD) (BFS-G-11-00002).,,31,36,37,5,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Highlighting the importance of adaptation in this context, failure to account for this behavioral response overstates climate change impacts by 17%.","[Manning, Dale T.; Goemans, Christopher] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Maas, Alexander] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",Colorado State University; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Manning, DT (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",,"Maas, Alexander/K-4360-2019",,"National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture [1004960, 0230501 (W-3133)]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This material is based upon work that is supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Hatch/Multi State under 1004960 and 0230501 (W-3133).",,50,12,12,0,6,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0023-7639,1543-8325,,LAND ECON,Land Econ.,NOV,2017,93,4,,,,,631,653,,10.3368/le.93.4.631,http://dx.doi.org/10.3368/le.93.4.631,,,23,Economics; Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FK5OC,,Green Published,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000413548300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although there has been some progress in formulating national adaptation policies and strategic planning in different countries of South Asia, research to identify local-level adaptive strategies and practices is still limited. Through eight case studies and a survey of 300 households in 15 locations in India, Nepal and Bangladesh, this paper generates empirical evidence on emerging agricultural innovations in contrasting socio-economic, geographical and agro-ecological contexts. The study demonstrates that several farm practices (innovations) have emerged in response to multiple drivers over time, with various forms of institutional and policy support, including incentives to reduce risks in the adoption of innovative practice. It further shows that there is still limited attempt to systematically mainstream adaptation innovations into local, regional and national government structures, policies and planning processes. The paper shows that the process of farm-level adaptation through innovation adoption forms an important avenue for agricultural adaptation in South Asia. A key implication of this finding is that there is a need for stronger collaborations between research institutions, extension systems, civil society and the private sector actors to enhance emerging adaptive innovations at the farm level.","[Bhatta, Gopal Datt; Aggarwal, Pramod Kumar] IWMI, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, New Delhi Off, NASC Complex,DPS Marg, New Delhi 110012, India; [Ojha, Hemant Raj] Univ New South Wales, Sch Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Sulaiman, V.

Systems that capture water for later subirrigation use have potential as a climate adaptation strategy to mitigate this increased crop water stress. Three such systems were operated in northwest Ohio from 1996 to 2008, and they exhibited substantial crop yield benefits, especially in dry growing seasons, but also to a lesser extent in near normal or wet growing seasons. The goal of this research was to estimate the increase in crop yield benefits of water capture and subirrigation systems that can be expected under projcted 2041-2070 climate conditions in northwest Ohio. Historical subirrigated field crop yield differences with fields having free drainage only, relative to growing season dryness/wetness, were used to determine future northwest Ohio subirrigated field crop yield increases, based on the modeled climate for 2041-2070. Climate records for 2041-2070 were projected using three bias corrected model combinations, CRCM + CGCM3, RCM3 + GFDL, and MM5I + HadCM3. Growing season dryness/wetness was classified based on the difference between rainfall and the crop adjusted potential evapotranspiration using the 1984-2013 climate record at the three system locations. Projected 2041-2070 growing season precipitation varied substantially between the three model combinations; however, all three indicated increased growing season dryness due to rising temperature and solar radiation. The overall subirrigated field corn yield increase rose to an estimated 27.5%-30.0% in 2041-2070 from 20.5% in 1996-2008, while the subirrigated field soybean yield increase improved from 12.2% in 1996-2008 to 19.8%-21.5% for 2041-2070. Consequently, as growing season drought becomes more frequent, the crop yield benefits with water capture and subirrigation systems will improve, and these systems therefore provide a viable climate adaptation strategy for agricultural production.

A wider range of actors have to be empowered to understand and improve governance arrangements in order to create second-order reflexivity. As a contribution to this challenge, a heuristic framework is developed from two complementary approaches to reflexive governance: the multi-level perspective (MLP) and the conflict-orientated understanding (COU) approach. The new framework is applied to two case studies - water management and long-term climate adaptation - where it has helped to develop a participatory process to analyse and reflect on local networks and multi-stakeholder arenas. The two contrasting processes are analysed and their contribution to reflexive capacity building is assessed. Building on the findings, further advancements of MLP, COU, and the concept of reflexive governance are recommended.","[Gottschick, Manuel] Univ Hamburg, Res Ctr Biotechnol Soc & Environm, Ohnhorststr 18, D-22609 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Gottschick, M (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Res Ctr Biotechnol Soc & Environm, Ohnhorststr 18, D-22609 Hamburg, Germany.",manuel.gottschick@uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,62,9,9,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-908X,1522-7200,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

To tackle this challenge, the participation of stakeholders in defining potential adaptation strategies is crucial to building awareness and capacity for the community, providing agreed solutions, and reducing conflict. However, there is also a need for a top-down approach to incorporate other, large-scale, or innovative adaptation strategies. This article describes a bottom-up-meets-top-down approach to estimate the optimal implementation intensity of adaptation strategies under different climate scenarios on a complex water resources system. Future streamflow projections were used in a water allocation model combined with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling process to obtain optimal combinations of measures to meet different sustainability objectives. The methodology was applied to the Gallego-Cinca River system in NE Spain, which relies on water from the Pyrenees. A stakeholder workshop identified storage development and irrigation modernisation as the preferred adaptation options. However, the modelling results show that more storage in the basin, especially on-farm reservoirs, is not enough to maintain current sustainability levels. This will enable the adoption of demand management measures that optimise water use despite not being among stakeholder preferences.","[Haro-Monteagudo, David] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Geosci, Dept Geog & Environm, Aberdeen AB9 2UF, Scotland; [Haro-Monteagudo, David; Palazon, Leticia; Begueria, Santiago] Consejo Super Invest Cient EEAD CSIC, Estn Expt Aula Dei, Avda Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Zoumides, Christos] Cyprus Inst, Energy Environm & Water Res Ctr, POB 27456, CY-1645 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Aberdeen; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Experimental de Aula Dei (EEAD),"Haro-Monteagudo, D (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Geosci, Dept Geog & Environm, Aberdeen AB9 2UF, Scotland.;Haro-Monteagudo, D (corresponding author), Consejo Super Invest Cient EEAD CSIC, Estn Expt Aula Dei, Avda Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.",david.haromonteagudo@abdn.ac.uk,,"Haro-Monteagudo, David/0000-0002-7885-8248","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Interreg V SpainFrance-Andorre Programme (POCTEFA 2014-2020) of the European Union [EFA210/16/PIRAGUA, EFA346/19/ADAPYR]; INNOMED - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of Spain; Fundacion Biodiversidad of the Spanish Ministerio para la Transicion Ecologica",European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Interreg V SpainFrance-Andorre Programme (POCTEFA 2014-2020) of the European Union; INNOMED - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of Spain; Fundacion Biodiversidad of the Spanish Ministerio para la Transicion Ecologica,"The following projects provided funding for this research: EFA210/16/PIRAGUA and EFA346/19/ADAPYR co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Interreg V SpainFrance-Andorre Programme (POCTEFA 2014-2020) of the European Union, INNOMED co-funded by the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of Spain in the framework of the ERA-NET WaterWorks2015 co-funded Call (project INNOMED).

Protecting vulnerable communities is, therefore, a key public policy objective. Natural flood management measures (NFM)-notably re-afforestation on hillslope and floodplain-are increasingly discussed as cost-effective means for providing flood regulation, particularly when considering ecosystem services other than flood regulation. However, studies that place flood benefits alongside other benefits are rare, potentially causing uncertainty in policy decision-making. This paper provides a cost-benefit analysis of the impacts of afforestation on peak river flows under UKCP09 climate change projections, and on additional ecosystem services in a rural catchment in Scotland. We find significant positive net present values (NPV) for all alternatives considered. However, benefits are dominated by ecosystem services other than flood regulation, with values related to climate regulation, aesthetic appeal, recreation and water quality contributing to a high positive NPV. The investment in riparian woodland (under low and central climate change scenarios) delivers a positive NPV alone when considering flood regulation benefits only. The case study suggests that afforestation as a sole NFM measure provides a positive NPV only in some cases but highlights the importance of identifying and quantifying additional ecosystem co-benefits.","[Dittrich, Ruth] Univ Portland, 5000 N Willamette Blvd, Portland, OR 97203 USA; [Ball, Tom] Univ Winchester, Dept Geog, Winchester, Hants, England; [Wreford, Anita] Lincoln Univ, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Moran, Dominic] Scodands Rural Coll, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Spray, Chris J.] Univ Dundee, Ctr Water Law Policy & Sci, Dundee, Scotland",University of Portland; University of Winchester; University of Dundee,"Dittrich, R (corresponding author), Univ Portland, 5000 N Willamette Blvd, Portland, OR 97203 USA.",dittrich@up.edu,"Wreford, Anita/Y-1996-2018","Wreford, Anita/0000-0002-9546-4080; Spray, Chris/0000-0001-8622-335X",European Union [266018]; NERC [NE/R017522/1] Funding Source: UKRI,European Union(European Commission); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"European Union, Seventh Framework Programme, 2007-2013, Grant/Award Number: T266018",,57,20,21,9,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1753-318X,,,J FLOOD RISK MANAG,J.

Our hypothesis was that globe artichoke irrigated with a traditionally drip system could be converted to an innovative water management system based on precision irrigation techniques and on evaporative cooling application in order to improve crop physiological status with positive impacts on earliness, total heads yield and water saving. Over two experiments carried out at plot- and field-scale, two litigation management systems, differing in type and application lime, were compared: (i) conventional, and (ii) canopy-cooling. Plant physiological status at a weekly sampling interval and the head atrophy incidence (as the ratio of the total primary heads collected) were monitored. We also recorded and determined heads production, and yield components. In both experiments, throughout the application period of evaporative cooling (three months), canopy-cooling showed the lowest value of leaf temperature and the highest photosynthesis values compared with the conventional one (+3 degrees C and -30%, respectively). The physiological advantage gained by the crop with evaporative cooling has led to a higher production both in terms of total yield (+30%), and in terms of harvested first order heads that from an economic viewpoint are the most profitable for farmers. At farm-scale, the canopy-cooling treatment resulted in a higher earliness (35 days) and water productivity (+36%) compared with conventional one. Our findings show that by combining evaporative cooling practice with precision irrigation technique the heads yield can be optimized also leading to a relevant water saving (-34%). Moreover, the study proved that canopy-cooling set up might be a winning strategy in order to mitigate climatic changes and heat stress conditions. (C) 2018 The Authors.

With climate change becoming inevitable, coastal cities are considering the mitigation of the impact of sea level rise on infrastructure. Transportation equity and sea level rise adaptation are usually considered separately. However, research pointed out that these two challenges could have considerable overlap and interaction. The present paper discusses transportation equity issues resulting from the impact of sea level rise and associated protection strategies. A case study of the San Francisco Bay Area points out cases where transportation equity can be negatively impacted when the optimal protection strategy against sea level rise is implemented. An integrated hydrodynamic and transportation model system is used in the present paper to demonstrate several scenarios where the most efficient protection strategies for the whole region increase the inequity that exists between the disadvantaged communities and other communities. Nevertheless, this impact can be mitigated with a relatively small addition to the protection strategy. The paper suggests that transportation equity cannot be overlooked in planning climate adaptation, as even the protection plan that maximizes benefits for the region may negatively impact the most vulnerable communities.","[Sun, Jiayun; Chow, Aaron C.

A few empirical studies concentrate on how climate change influences firm performance. Climate change brings higher production costs and lower efficiency on the supply side and leads to beneficial sale performance and improves profit. However, it is ambiguous to the relationship of supply-demand and revenue-cost levels, and their change is not consistent. Using panel data of 99 China-listed firms active in the energy sector over the period 2000-2020, this study aims to identify the causal relation between climate change and the profitability of energy firms while controlling for firm-specific and energy market-related factors. The quantile regression results show that temperature deviation (TDEV) positively impacts the profitability of energy firms, and this impact varies at different quantiles of the profitability distribution. These findings remain unchanged by four robustness checks. Moreover, mechanism results indicate that revenue and cost have different interaction effects on the causal relation. The findings of this study can provide forward-thinking expectations and assess climatic adaptation and risks, particularly inspired stakeholder engagements.","[Cao, Ming; Zhang, Fan; Li, Jianglong; Meng, Guanfei] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Li, JL (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Peoples R China.",lijianglong@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703120, 72173095]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 71703120, 72173095",,66,1,1,19,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0964-4733,1099-0836,,BUS STRATEG ENVIRON,Bus.

Climatic extremes, like Sandy, are projected to increase in magnitude and frequency, calling upon societies to adapt appropriately to imminent threats. In this paper, we describe the knowledge and policy disconnect exposed by Sandy between what we submit are four key elements of adaptive capacity: resources, institutions, knowledge and innovation of technology. Our synthesis of multi-disciplinary expert knowledge and admonition from civil engineers, climatologists, and urban planners demonstrates the significance of mobilizing knowledge to design robust socio-ecological systems. We contrast the U.S. model to the Dutch system of climate adaptation to emphasize the feasibility, value, and effectiveness of adopting robust adaptive capacities, rather than policies steeped in reactionary responses. Such strategies that integrate coordination and imagination from members across society are imperative in translating scientific foresight into institutional action. The solution we offer is not only material for a more action-based discussion, but also provides an illustration of crafting policy that enhances adaptive capacities of socio-ecological systems.

Trends in water levels, flow, and water quality are discussed, along with technical measures and operational rules that were developed for implementation of RBF systems. This paper also provides an overview of the average lifespan of the wells and operational strategies. The emerging reconstruction and reconditioning needs are highlighted, and existing alternatives are presented. Large-scale infrastructural elements, such as the Danube-based RBF systems, have to be adapted to a changing environment.

We analyze climate adaptation of railway infrastructure, based on an in-depth case study of the German railway system. The case includes a unique set of qualitative interviews with key players of operating and regulative organizations, as well as a document study. Our analysis crucially extends previous technology-oriented research on the railway sector by applying core insights and categories from the actor-centered institutionalism. We trace observed obstacles for a climate resilient railway system and adaptation decisions back to deeper causes, in particular political priorities and values. Moreover, diverging perceptions and the competition among different actors hamper adaptation. On the other hand, single actors who display a great willingness to act are able to make use of unclear responsibilities to integrate adaptation concerns into existing institutions.

First, empirical evidence of such moral hazard or risk compensation in general is inconclusive, and the empirical evidence to date in the case of climate engineering indicates that the reverse may occur. Second, basic economics of substitutes shows that reducing mitigation in response to climate engineering implementation could provide net benefits to humans and the environment, and that climate engineering might theoretically increase mitigation through strong income effects. Third, existing policies strive to promote other technologies and measures, including climate adaptation, which induce analogous risk-compensating behaviours. If the goal of climate policy is to minimize climate risks, this concern should not be grounds for restricting or prohibiting climate engineering research. Three potential means for this concern to manifest in genuinely deleterious ways, as well as policy options to reduce these effects, are identified.","[Reynolds, Jesse] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Reynolds, Jesse] Tilburg Univ, Fac Law, Dept European & Int Publ Law, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Reynolds, J (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Fac Law, Dept European & Int Publ Law, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",j.l.reynolds@uvt.nl,"Reynolds, Jesse/L-2335-2018","Reynolds, Jesse/0000-0002-0624-5741",,,,,80,46,46,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-0196,2053-020X,,ANTHROPOCENE REV,Anthr.

Water resources that are already over allocated face competing demands from growing urban populations, unresolved tribal water claims, and for maintenance of riparian habitats. While many believe we can meet these demands by reallocating water from agriculture, climate change complicates this calculus. Warmer temperatures and longer droughts will reduce regional water supplies and increase agricultural water demands, making transfers more costly. Hydrological-economic modeling studies suggest agricultural water use will decline, leaving urban use relatively unchanged. Although this agriculture-to-urban reallocation of water is often treated primarily as an engineering problem, many legal and institutional barriers exist to large-scale water transfers. Technological fixes to conserve and transfer agricultural water to other uses will likely fail to facilitate climate adaptation unless changes in water management institutions, policies, and economic incentives accompany those technological fixes.","[Frisvold, George B.] Univ Arizona, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tucson, AZ USA",University of Arizona,"Frisvold, GB (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tucson, AZ USA.",,,,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA12OAR431],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"George Frisvold is a Professor and Extension Specialist in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of Arizona, Tucson.

One view posits that HOAs will use outdoor landscaping and scarce water resources to maintain the aesthetic appearance and hence property values of homes in their domain. An alternative view from commons theory suggests that they will behave in a variety of ways and have diverse environmental resource management outcomes. This research compares water consumption in single-family residential communities with and without HOAs in Phoenix, Arizona. Findings reveal there is not a significant correlation between water consumption and presence or absence of HOAs, after accounting for other relevant variables. HOAs did not co-opt a disproportionate share of urban water use, lending credence to the claims of commons theory that similar institutional types may result in diverse resource outcomes, depending upon geographical and social context.

In India, studies have shown an increasing trend in surface temperature, with decreasing trends in rainfall. Farmers are also more affected by the climate variability which has a serious influence on their production and income. The climate change and adaptation (ClimaAdapt) programme was implemented from 2012 to 2016 to build farm-level capacities and enhance the adaptive capacity of the agricultural and water sectors in the Krishna basin of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states. Water-saving interventions such as direct seeded rice, a modified system of rice intensification and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) of rice were implemented in a cluster approach and enhanced water productivity. The training and implementation programmes increased the adaptation and awareness of farmers. Water measurements were carried out by using flumes and ultrasonic sensors. The area under direct seeded rice has increased to 64% in the study district and 77% of the trained farmers are adopting the practice. Capacity building, implementation and science-policy linkages are the key pillars of the programme to improve the adaptive capacity and scaling-up of water management practices.

Identification of stakeholders should be followed by providing information about climate change impacts on natural and human systems, a discussion of goals and objectives, a community based assessment, then elaboration of adapted strategies and measures. There is strong need to differentiate between stakeholders, and customise communication strategies for different groups.

In the absence of externally funded, policy-driven adaptation investments, Ethiopia's GDP in 2050 will be up to 10% below the counterfactual no climate change (historical climate) baseline. Suitably designed adaptation investments could restore aggregate welfare to baseline levels at a cost that is substantially lower than the welfare losses as a result of climate change.

Addressing this gap, as well as the need for greater learning about 'how' urban adaptation finance operates, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for such analysis that considers complexity, uncertainty, transformation and vulnerability. We analyse 39 urban projects financed by Climate Adaptation Funds (CAFs) using a qualitative approach. The findings indicate the ongoing dominance of national governments at all stages of the funding cycle, and of a focus on hard adaptation measures, but also a diverse set of stakeholder relationships involved in CAF finance which offers potential for greater multi-stakeholder and multisectoral management of complexity. Few projects, however, address the management of uncertainty. While upscaling from projects is a common preoccupation, catalysing effects across sectors are limited, and transformative mechanisms for addressing vulnerability are limited to consultation with vulnerable groups. Innovations are highlighted which merit further exploration through case study analysis.","[Forino, Giuseppe] Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Human Geog, Bangor, Wales; [Forino, Giuseppe] bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2dG, Wales; [Fraser, Arabella] Open Univ, Global Dev, Milton Keynes, England; [Tandaric, Neven] Green Infrastruct Planning Vita Projekt Ltd, Zagreb, Croatia",Bangor University; Bangor University; Open University - UK,"Forino, G (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Human Geog, Bangor, Wales.",g.forino@gmail.com; arabella.fraser@open.ac.uk; neven.tandaric@vitaprojekt.hr,"Tandarić, Neven/AAF-6637-2019","Tandarić, Neven/0000-0003-0161-3653",University of Nottingham's Nottingham Research Fellowship Scheme; AHRC Midlands3Cities Doctoral Training Partnership Project Placement scheme,University of Nottingham's Nottingham Research Fellowship Scheme; AHRC Midlands3Cities Doctoral Training Partnership Project Placement scheme,"Funding for work on this paper was supported by the University of Nottingham's Nottingham Research Fellowship Scheme and by the AHRC Midlands3Cities Doctoral Training Partnership Project Placement scheme, in which Neven Tandaric participated in 2019.",,39,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

Although a drastic reduction in carbon emissions would slow climate change, an alteration in the climate is already certain. Therefore, the impact of climate change on retrofitted historic buildings should be considered in terms of occupants' comfort, heritage conservation, and energy performance. Inappropriate interventions might weaken the potential of traditional climate adaptive solutions, such as thermal mass and night cooling, leading to higher risks of overheating in a warming climate. Similarly, retrofit solutions will change the moisture dynamics of historic envelopes, which might lead to moisture damages when combined with more extreme precipitation events. This paper reviews recent literature that provides evidence of climate change's impact on retrofitted buildings, reveals potential future risks, and thereby sheds light on new factors influencing the decision-making process in the retrofit of historic buildings.","[Hao, Lingjun; Del Pero, Claudio] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Hao, Lingjun; Herrera-Avellanosa, Daniel; Troi, Alexandra] Eurac Res, Inst Renewable Energy, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano,"Hao, LJ (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.;Hao, LJ (corresponding author), Eurac Res, Inst Renewable Energy, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",Lingjun.Hao@polimi.it; Daniel.Herrera@eurac.edu; Claudio.delPero@polimi.it; Alexandra.Troi@eurac.edu,"Troi, Alexandra/GNP-7146-2022","Del Pero, Claudio/0000-0003-4205-2805; Herrera-Avellanosa, Daniel/0000-0002-9661-8387; Troi, Alexandra/0000-0002-7450-4688; hao, lingjun/0000-0002-1036-9085",Thematic Scholarship Energy Retrofit of Historic Buildings [32b-T4]; Politecnico di Milano,Thematic Scholarship Energy Retrofit of Historic Buildings; Politecnico di Milano,"This research was funded by Thematic Scholarship Energy Retrofit of Historic Buildings, grant number 32b-T4 and The APC was funded by Politecnico di Milano.",,113,20,20,8,43,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,12,18,,,,,,,7557,10.3390/su12187557,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12187557,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OJ9ZE,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000584311600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We compare results from dynamic modelling of nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea under projections of climate change and scenarios for shared socioeconomic pathways. Average nutrient loads are projected to increase by 8% and 14% for nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, in response to climate change scenarios. In contrast, changes in the socioeconomic drivers can lead to a decrease of 13% and 6% or an increase of 11% and 9% in nitrogen and phosphorus loads, respectively, depending on the pathway.

However, the use of single-method ensembles and variations arising from different methodologies has resulted in unquantified uncertainty amongst existing global wave climate projections. Here, assessing the first coherent, community-driven, multi-method ensemble of global wave climate projections, we demonstrate widespread ocean regions with robust changes in annual mean significant wave height and mean wave period of 5-15% and shifts in mean wave direction of 5-15 degrees, under a high-emission scenario. Approximately 50% of the world's coastline is at risk from wave climate change, with similar to 40% revealing robust changes in at least two variables. Furthermore, we find that uncertainty in current projections is dominated by climate model-driven uncertainty, and that single-method modelling studies are unable to capture up to similar to 50% of the total associated uncertainty.","[Morim, Joao;

Inherent methodological uncertainties in vulnerability assessments, however, require greater attention. This study examines Swedish agricultural vulnerability to climate change, the aim being to review various indicator approaches for assessing agricultural vulnerability to climate change and to evaluate differences in climate vulnerability depending on the weighting and summarizing methods. The reviewed methods are evaluated by being tested at the municipal level. Three weighting and summarizing methods, representative of climate vulnerability indices in general, are analysed. The results indicate that 34 of 36 method combinations differ significantly from each other. We argue that representing agricultural vulnerability in a single composite index might be insufficient to guide climate adaptation. We emphasize the need for further research into how to measure and visualize agricultural vulnerability and into how to communicate uncertainties in both data and methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the face of this threat, policy-and decision-makers are increasingly calling for new approaches and tools to support risk management and climate adaptation pathways that can capture the full extent of the impacts. In this frame, a GIS-based Bayesian Network (BN) approach is presented for the capturing and modelling of multi-sectoral flooding damages against future 'what-if' scenarios. Building on a risk-based conceptual framework, the BN model was trained and validated by exploiting data collected from the 2014 Secchia River flooding event, as well as other contextual variables. Moreover, a novel approach to defining the structure of the BN was performed, reconfiguring the model according to expert judgment and data-based validation. The model showed a good predictive capacity for damages in the agricultural, industrial and residential sectors, predicting the severity of damages with a classification accuracy of about 60% for each of these assessment endpoints. 'What-if' scenario analysis was performed to understand the potential impacts of future changes in i) land use patterns and ii) increasing flood depths resulting from more severe flood events. The output of the model showed a rising probability of experiencing high monetary damages under both scenarios. In spite of constraints within the case study dataset, the results of the appraisal show good promise, and together with the designed BN model itself represent a valuable support for disaster risk management and reduction actions against extreme river flooding events, enabling better informed decision making.","[Harris, Remi; Furlan, Elisa; Pham, Hung Vuong; Torresan, Silvia; Mysiak, Jaroslav; Critto, Andrea] Univ CaFoscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, I-30170 Venice, Italy; [Harris, Remi; Furlan, Elisa; Pham, Hung Vuong; Torresan, Silvia; Mysiak, Jaroslav; Critto, Andrea] Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-73100 Lecce, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Critto, A (corresponding author), Univ CaFoscari Venice, Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30170 Venice, Italy.",critto@unive.it,"PHAM, HUNG VUONG/AAM-9212-2021","PHAM, HUNG VUONG/0000-0002-0441-3799",LODE project (Loss Data Enhancement for DRR & CCA management) - European Union Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG ECHO) [825567],LODE project (Loss Data Enhancement for DRR & CCA management) - European Union Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG ECHO),"The research leading to these results has been funded by the LODE project (Loss Data Enhancement for DRR & CCA management, https://www.lodeproject.polimi.it/) funded by the European Union Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG ECHO, contract number: 825567).

They accelerate innovation, while contributing to societal adaptation. Research has explored the advancements of climate services in multiple fields, producing a wealth of interdisciplinary knowledge ranging from climatology to the social sciences. The aim of this paper is to map the global landscape of research on climate services and to identify patterns at individual, affiliation and country level and the structural properties of each community. We use a sample of 358 records published between 1974 and 2018 and quantitatively analyze them. We provide insights into the main characteristics of the community of climate services through Bibliometrics and complement these findings with Network Science. We have computed the centrality of each actor as derived from a Principal Component Analysis of 42 different measures. By exploring the structural properties of the networks of individuals, institutions and countries we derive implications on the most central agents. Furthermore, we detect brokers in the network, capable of facilitating the information flow and increasing the cohesion of the community. We finally analyze the abstracts of the sample via Content Analysis. We find a progressive shift towards climate adaptation and user-centric visions. Agriculture and Energy are the top mentioned sectors. Anglophone countries and institutions are quantitatively dominant, and they are also important in connecting different discipline of the network of scholars, by building on established partnerships. Finding that nodes facilitating the diffusion of information flows (the brokers) are not necessarily the most central, but have a high degree of interdisciplinarity facilitating interactions of different communities.","[Larosa, Francesca; Mysiak, Jaroslav] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC, Risk Assessment & Adaptat Strategies, Venice, Italy; [Larosa, Francesca; Mysiak, Jaroslav] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Venice, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Larosa, F (corresponding author), Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC, Risk Assessment & Adaptat Strategies, Venice, Italy.;Larosa, F (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Venice, Italy.",francesca.larosa@cmcc.it,"Mysiak, Jaroslav/A-8683-2019","Mysiak, Jaroslav/0000-0001-9341-7048; Larosa, Francesca/0000-0002-4350-8790",CLARA Project under the European Union [730482],CLARA Project under the European Union,"This research was funded by the CLARA Project under the European Union's H2020 Framework Programme for research and innovation, grant Agreement No. 730482.",,35,10,10,4,18,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Erratic rainfall and steady rise in temperature create widely uncertain outcomes for the farming communities. Against this backdrop, the present study has used a climate dataset constructed at a finer spatial level from a southern Indian state namely Karnataka to analyze the yield response of rice and maize crops to climate change. Using a time period from 1992 to 2012, a panel dataset has been made at the district level. The fixed effect regression results show that rice and maize productivity has been impacted adversely due to a steady rise in temperature in the state. The extent of damage is found to be 7% to 10%. Further, the study has also probed the role of irrigation as a climate adaptation strategy and has found out that adverse yield impact is reduced in the presence of irrigation. These findings provide some specific directions for policy framing to curb yield damage arising from climate variability. (C) 2020 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

The benefit of adapting infrastructure assets is evaluated as the reduction in risk relative to the do nothing case. However, evaluating the full benefits of risk reduction is challenging because of the complexity of the systems, the scarcity of data, and the uncertainty of future climatic changes. We address this challenge by integrating methods from the study of climate adaptation, infrastructure systems, and complex networks. In doing so, we outline an infrastructure risk assessment that incorporates interdependence, user demands, and potential failure-related economic losses. Individual infrastructure assets are intersected with probabilistic hazard maps to calculate expected annual damages. Protection measure costs are integrated to calculate risk reduction and associated discounted benefits, which are used to explore the business case for investment in adaptation. A demonstration of the methodology is provided for flood protection of major electricity substations in England and Wales. We conclude that the ongoing adaptation program for major electricity assets is highly cost beneficial.","[Thacker, Scott; Pant, Raghav; Hall, Jim W.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Kelly, Scott] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Oxford; University of Technology Sydney,"Thacker, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",scott.thacker@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Hall, Jim W/ABF-1407-2020; Kelly, Scott/ABC-7526-2020; Kelly, Scott/F-8774-2011","Hall, Jim W/0000-0002-2024-9191; Kelly, Scott/0000-0002-8454-6144","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N017064/1, EP/I01344X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/I01344X/1, EP/N017064/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,38,20,21,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0272-4332,1539-6924,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,JAN,2018,38,1,,,,,134,150,,10.1111/risa.12839,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.12839,,,17,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",FR5WP,28666064,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000419137600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of these issues need to be addressed at several scales simultaneously, ranging from local to global. They require action at the scale of large landscapes given that the geographic scope of the issues often transcends the legal and geographic reach of existing jurisdictions and institutions. No single entity has the authority to address these types of cross-boundary issues, resulting in gaps in governance and a corresponding need to create formal and informal ways work more effectively across administrative boundaries, land ownerships, and political jurisdictions. In response to this challenge, numerous models of network governance are emerging. These approaches vary in terms of purpose, spatial scale, composition, organization, and complexity. This article explains what network governance is, why it is emerging, how it compares to other models of natural resource governance, and the different ways in which it develops and evolves.","[Scarlett, Lynn] Nature Conservancy, Washington, DC USA; [McKinney, Matthew] Univ Montana, Ctr Nat Resources & Environm Policy, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",Nature Conservancy; University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Scarlett, L (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, Washington, DC USA.",lscarlett@tnc.org,"Lobo, Diele/I-9106-2012",,"National Socio--Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) - US National Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1052875]; MacroSystems Biology Program in the Emerging Frontiers Division of the Biological Sciences Directorate [EF-1065548, 1065737, 1065740, 1065741, 1065772, 1065785, 1065831, 121238320]; NSF [VOSS-1322296, SES-0951366]; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1052875] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1639145] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Socio--Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) - US National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MacroSystems Biology Program in the Emerging Frontiers Division of the Biological Sciences Directorate; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This Special Issue was partially supported by the National Socio--Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) - US National Science Foundation (NSF) award DBI-1052875 and the MacroSystems Biology Program in the Emerging Frontiers Division of the Biological Sciences Directorate (EF-1065548, 1065737, 1065740, 1065741, 1065772, 1065785, 1065831, 121238320) and the NSF VOSS-1322296 and SES-0951366 (Decision Center for a Desert City II: Urban Climate Adaptation) through the Center for Policy Informatics; the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas; the Maxwell School of Syracuse University; and the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada through the Community Conservation Research Network; and L Scarlett.",,43,78,78,3,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1540-9295,1540-9309,,FRONT ECOL ENVIRON,Front.

In this paper, the numerical evaluation of these two types of solar water heaters in different climate zones of China was reported on the aspects of system energy performance and economical return. The single-phase system is found having better cost payback period in all these cities, and can be a suitable choice except for locations with extreme cold weather. The two-phase design is an attractive and sustainable alternative since its thermal efficiency is higher under the same weather condition and this is important for supporting zero-carbon building design. On the other hand, it can be readily used to enhance the outside appearance of a building. Hence when considering climate adaptability and aesthetic compatibility, the potential of the two-phase system is higher. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A particular concern is climate adapted solutions in the design and construction of prefabricated houses in response to the large geographic variations in climate. Two main research questions are raised. First, how does organizational structure of prefabricated housing manufacturers affect decision making processes, information flows and local adaptation actions? Second, how does institutional change in terms of regulatory reform of the sector affect adaptive capacity in terms of organizational structure of manufacturers and the co-generation of adaptation knowledge between public and private sector institutions? Findings suggest that the type of development demonstrated by the housing sector, strongly influenced by New Public Management type reforms, may weaken adaptive capacity unless particular measures are taken to strengthen the role of local knowledge and responsibilities for adaptation actions.

Economic assessment for urban drainage planning and decision making often focuses on flood criteria. This study presents an economic assessment of GI based on a conventional cost-benefit analysis (CBA) that includes several benefits related to urban drainage (floods, combined sewer overflows and waste water treatment), environmental impacts (receiving water bodies) and additional societal and environmental benefits associated with GI (air quality improvements, aesthetic values, etc.). Benefits from flood damage reduction are monetized based on the widely used concept of Expected Annual Damage (EAD) that was calculated using a 1D/2D urban drainage model together with design storms and a damage model based on tailored flood depth-damage curves. Benefits from Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) damage reduction were monetized using a 1D urban drainage model with continuous rainfall simulations and prices per cubic meter of spilled combined sewage water estimated from literature; other societal benefits were estimated using unit prices also estimated from literature. This economic assessment was applied to two different case studies: the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Badalona. The results are useful for decision making and also underline the relevancy of including not only flood damages in CBA of GI.","[Locatelli, Luca; Russo, Beniamino; Sunyer, David; Martinez, Montse] AQUATEC Suez Adv Solut, Ps Zona Franca 46-48, Barcelona 08038, Spain; [Guerrero, Maria; Martinez-Gomariz, Eduardo] Cetaqua, Water Technol Ctr, Carretera Esplugues 75, Barcelona 08940, Spain; [Martinez-Gomariz, Eduardo] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Flumen Res Inst, Jordi Girona 1-3, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Locatelli, L (corresponding author), AQUATEC Suez Adv Solut, Ps Zona Franca 46-48, Barcelona 08038, Spain.",luca.locatelli@aquatec.es; maria.guerrero@cetaqua.com; brusso@aquatec.es; eduardo.martinez@cetaqua.com; dsunyer@aquatec.es; mmartinezp@aquatec.es,"Gomariz, Eduardo Martínez/I-1269-2019; Russo, Beniamino/Z-6372-2019","Gomariz, Eduardo Martínez/0000-0002-0189-0725; Russo, Beniamino/0000-0001-9437-0085; Guerrero Hidalga, Maria/0000-0003-4550-5013; Martinez Puentes, Montse/0000-0003-3017-5541; Sunyer, David/0000-0002-5400-3536; Locatelli, Luca/0000-0003-3859-3553",BINGO European H2020 project [641739]; RESCCUE European H2020 project [700174],BINGO European H2020 project; RESCCUE European H2020 project,"This research was funded by the BINGO European H2020 project, Grant Agreement No.641739 and the RESCCUE European H2020 project, Grant Agreement No. 700174.",,45,26,26,6,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2020,12,9,,,,,,,3792,10.3390/su12093792,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12093792,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LU0TK,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000537476200290,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach Field observations, focus group discussions (FGDs), semi-structured interviews, and transects were accomplished in both the dry and wet season. Spatial database generated and land use mapping integrated social and technical investigation. Five FDG sessions with participants from different livelihood options (fishermen, farmers and social representatives) were organised and, on average, 15 similar to 18 participants participated in each participatory session. Findings Mangrove plantation can be used to access new land and create alternative livelihoods, which are important for local community adaptation and to reduce disaster risks. Mangrove plantations provide chances for new land management options to be developed for use in Bangladesh. Research limitations/implications - This study was conducted only at the south-central coastal district of Bangladesh. Data collection to summarise all the socio-economic issues is limited. Practical implications - This paper can be used for the integration of geospatial and social research techniques to understand the community approach to fight against climate change-induced impacts.

Climate change is an issue without boundaries impacts will cut across administrative and geographical borders and be felt by every sector of society. Responses to climate change will need to employ system approaches that take into account the relationships that cross organisational and sectoral boundaries. Solutions designed in isolation from these interdependencies will be unlikely to succeed, squandering opportunities for long-term effective adaptation. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) provides a structural approach to identify, evaluate and manage health impacts of climate change that is inclusive of a wide range of stakeholders. Climate change will affect decision-making across every government level and sector and the health implications of these decisions can also be addressed with HIA. Given the nature of the issue, HIA of climate change will identify a large number of variables that influence the type and extent of health impacts and the management of these impacts. In order to implement the most effective adaptation measures, it is critical that an understanding of the interactions between these variables is developed. The outcome of HIA of climate change can therefore be strengthened by the introduction of system dynamics tools, such as causal loop diagrams, that are designed to examine interactions between variables and the resulting behaviour of complex systems.","[Brown, Helen L.; Spickett, Jeffery] Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Proust, Katrina; Capon, Anthony] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Curtin University; Australian National University,"Brown, HL (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",h.brown@curtin.edu.au,,"Brown, Helen/0000-0001-9873-5969; Capon, Anthony/0000-0003-0354-6810",,,,,33,8,8,0,16,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1036-1073,2201-1617,,HEALTH PROMOT J AUST,Health Promot.

The estimated coefficients are used to decompose a multiplicative total factor productivity index that accounts for different sources of productivity growth. Annual productivity growth is estimated at 2.16 per cent, driven primarily by technical progress (1.91 per cent per annum).

Climate-and stakeholder-oriented research streams iterate and build on each other, coming together over time to inform the development of decadal prediction images. These images are discussed with stakeholders to identify potentially usable formats and the decisions they may inform. Several potentially usable formats are identified: predictions alongside projections, predictions relative to historical climate, multivariate information, and information at the weather scale and in terms of hydrologic impacts.

Different thermomechanical properties were tested and applied to make building shape change possible according to the variation of outside temperature. For design experiments, the SMC models were fabricated and deployed over the exterior surface of a test building scale model. To help architectural communities better understand responsive material phenomena for building design application, the self-shaping material performance was modeled and evaluated through digital simulation, using theoretical constitutive equations and physical observation of the test building model.

Since secular increase is small compared to interindividual variation, the Trotter and Gleser formulae are still appropriate as long as the 95% confidence intervals are applied. A secular trend for increasing childhood and adolescent obesity is associated with a trend for accelerated skeletal maturation, but does not predict a consistent direction or a quantitative correction for traditional standards.

Here, we extend this research to comparisons under seminatural conditions. To test for clinal variation in reproductive patterns and survival over winter, Drosophila melanogaster populations were initiated from seven collection sites along the eastern coast of Australia, ranging front tropical to temperate regions. The fecundity and survival of these populations were monitored in field cages at a temperate location until all adults had died more than 5 months later. Total fecundity showed a curvilinear relationship vith latitude, due to higher egg production by high- and low-latitude populations. Adults front temperate locations survived winter conditions better than those from subtropical populations but not tropical ones. There vas a linear cline in the timing of egg production: temperate populations produced eggs later than populations front lower latitudes. This cline is likely to be adaptive because egg-to-adult viability experiments indicated that only eggs laid in spring developed successfully to the adult stage. There vas no evidence for climatic adaptation in the immature stages. The adult mortality rate increased gradually over winter, and in some populations vas also correlated with the minimum ambient temperature. These results indicate that adaptation to winter conditions in D. melanogaster has involved shifts in reproductive patterns.","La Trobe Univ, Ctr Environm Stress & Adaptat Res, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"Hoffmann, AA (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Ctr Environm Stress & Adaptat Res, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",a.hoffmann@latrobe.edu.au,"Hoffmann, Ary/C-2961-2011; Hoffmann, Ary/R-2972-2019","Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645",,,,,25,84,84,0,21,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Changing climate may continue this trajectory, but it also provides a catalyst for renewal of ecosystems and a window of opportunity for change in institutions. Resilience provides a bridging concept that predicts that change in ecological and social systems is often dramatic, abrupt, and surprising. Adapting to the uncertainty of climate driven change must be done in a manner perceived as legitimate by the participants in a democratic society. Adaptation must begin with the current hierarchical and fragmented social-ecological system as a baseline from which new approaches must be applied. Achieving a level of integration between ecological concepts and governance requires a dialogue across multiple disciplines, including ecologists with expertise in ecological resilience, hydrologists and climate experts, with social scientists and legal scholars.

A better understanding of farmers' perceptions of climate change and adaptation strategies will benefit farmers and policymakers in outlining an effective adaptation mechanism to climate change. Therefore, this study assessed wheat farmers' perceptions of climate change, identified major adaptation strategies, factors influencing adaptations, and barriers to effective adaptation by surveying 160 wheat farmers in northwest Bangladesh. The results revealed that farmers experienced more frequent droughts due to higher temperatures, decreased and irregular precipitation, reduced ground and surface water availability, and shorter winter seasons over the last two decades. Key adaptation strategies identified were more irrigation, switching to other crops, and changing fertilizer and insecticide usage. Multinomial logit model results indicate that farming experience, access to climate information and extension services, access to subsidies, farm size, family size, and electricity for irrigation were the significant factors influencing farmers' adaptation decisions. Limited access to climate information, inadequate knowledge of appropriate adaptation measures, and low price of wheat represented major adaptation barriers. The study recommends strengthening agricultural research and extension services to farmers, including education and training, to develop effective adaptation strategies to climate change.","[Tasnim, Zarin; Hossain, Md.

Irrigated farmers have multiple options for minimizing the impact of drought including switching to more efficient irrigation technologies. More efficient technologies that increase the fraction of the water available to the crop root zone would allow farmers to maintain current production levels with less water. However, these systems are capital intensive. The objective of this study is to explore when (and under what climatic conditions) it makes economic sense for farmers to invest in new irrigation systems. We examine this in the Yakima River Basin in Washington State of the U.S. We use VIC-CropSyst, a large-scale grid-based modeling framework that mechanistically simulates hydrologic and agricultural processes. Water supply simulated by VIC-CropSyst drives a river system and water management model (YAK-RW). A computational platform was developed to perform the economic analysis for each grid cell, crop type, and future climate scenario separately, which allowed us to explore whether the implementation of more efficient irrigation systems would be economically viable. Our results indicate that investing in a more efficient irrigation system improves agricultural economy of the Yakima River Basin (9% -25%). We also show that at the farm level, more significant droughts can provide economic incentives for investment up to a point. For severe climate change projections, droughts become frequent and severe enough that economic benefits of improving water use efficiency do not exceed investment costs.","[Malek, Keyvan; Adam, Jennifer] Washington State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Stockle, Claudio] Washington State Univ, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Brady, Michael] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Rajagopalan, Kirti] Washington State Univ, Ctr Sustaining Agr & Nat Resources, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University; Washington State University; Washington State University; Washington State University,"Malek, K (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",keyvan.malek@wsu.edu,,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2012-67003-19805, 2011-67003-30346]; National Science Foundation [1639458]; Washington State University's Graduate School","U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Washington State University's Graduate School","This research was funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture grant 2012-67003-19805 (Watershed Integrated Systems Dynamics Modeling; WISDM), grant 2011-67003-30346 (Biosphere Relevant Earth System Model; BioEarth), and National Science Foundation grant 1639458 (Increasing regional to global-scale resilience in Food-Energy-Water systems through coordinated management, technology and institutions).

People living in forests are highly dependent on forest goods and services, and are vulnerable to forest changes both socially and economically. In the Congo basin, climate change effects on forest ecosystems are predicted to amplify the existing pressure on food security urging expansion of current agricultural lands at the expense of forest, biodiversity loss and socioeconomic stresses. The paper aimed at exploring vulnerability and adaptation needs to climate change of local communities in the humid forest zone of Cameroon. Field work was conducted in two forest communities in Leki, and in Yokadouma in the Center and Eastern Regions of Cameroon respectively. The assessment was done using a series of approaches including a preparatory phase, fieldwork proper, and validation of the results. Results show that: (a) the adverse effects of climate conditions to which these communities are exposed are already being felt and exerting considerable stress on most of their livelihoods resources; (b) drought, changing seasons, erratic rain patterns, heavy rainfall and strong winds are among the main climate-related disturbances perceived by populations in the project sites; (c) important social, ecological and economic processes over the past decades seemed to have shaped current vulnerability in the sites; (d) Some coping and adaptive strategies used so far are outdated; and specific adaptation needs are identified and suggestions for facilitating their long-term implementations provided.","[Bele, Mekou Y.; Tiani, Anne M.; Sonwa, Denis J.] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Somorin, Olufunso A.] African Dev Bank, Tunis 1002, Tunisia; [Somorin, Olufunso A.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr WUR, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); African Development Bank Group (AfDB); Wageningen University & Research,"Bele, MY (corresponding author), Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, POB 2008, Yaounde, Cameroon.",b.youssoufa@cgiar.org,,,International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Department for International Development (DFID),International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Department for International Development (DFID),"This research was the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the Department for International Development (DFID) funded Congo Basin Forest Climate Change Adaptation project of the Center for International Forestry Research.

India presents us with a unique opportunity to study this phenomenon in a large developing country. This study finds that climate adaptation policies of India should consider the significance of air conditioners (A/Cs) in mitigation of human vulnerability due to unpredictable weather events such as heat waves. However, the energy demand due to air conditioning usage alone will be in the range of an extra similar to 750,000 GWh to similar to 1,350,000 GWh with a 3.7 degrees C increase in surface temperatures under different population scenarios and increasing incomes by the year 2100. We project that residential A/C usage by 2100 will result in CO2 emissions of 592 Tg to 1064 Tg. This is significant given that India's total contribution to global CO2 emissions in 2009 was measured at 1670 Tg and country's residential and commercial electricity consumption in 2007 was estimated at 145,000 GWh.

Data from three smaller coastal cities and their wider regional governance systems in Florida, US; West Sussex, UK and Sao Paulo, Brazil are used to compare the influence of scale and sector on city adaptive capacity. These tensions are described through the lens of the Adaptive Capacity Index (ACI) approach. The ACI is built from structuration theory and presents an alternative to social-ecological systems framing of analysis on adaptation. Structuration articulates the interaction of agency and structure and the intervening role played by institutions on information flow, in shaping adaptive capacity and outcomes. The ACI approach reveals inequalities in adaptive capacity to be greater across scale than across government, private and civil society sector capacity in each study area. This has implications for adaptation research both by reinforcing the importance of scale and demonstrating the utility of structuration theory as a framework for understanding the social dynamics underpinning adaptive capacity; and policy relevance, in particular considering the redistribution of decision-making power across scale and/or compensatory mechanisms, especially for lower scale actors, who increasingly carry the costs for enacting resilience planning in cities.

We group our cities into three types: industrial cities (which may have experienced recent structural change), historic cities (in which a significant proportion of the buildings or landscape is under monument protection) and university cities (in which academic or research institutions play a major role in the local community). Drawing on document analysis and expert interviews, we find that budgetary constraints, weaker civil societies and lower levels of political support result in unfavourable structural conditions for successful transformations in industrial cities. Historic cities have often only limited options to change their built environments, but many have identified climate change as a major threat to their built heritage and are therefore keen to take action in climate adaptation. Lastly, university cities are further along the transformation pathways than the other city types, largely due to having more favourable economic conditions as well as greater support from civil society, politics and the local research community.","[Haupt, Wolfgang; Eckersley, Peter; Irmisch, Janne; Kern, Kristine] Leibniz Inst Res Soc & Space, Res Grp Urban Sustainabil Transformat, Erkner, Germany; [Eckersley, Peter] Nottingham Trent Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Nottingham, Notts, England; [Kern, Kristine] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Turku, Finland",Leibniz Institut fur Raumbezogene Sozialforschung (IRS); Nottingham Trent University; Abo Akademi University,"Haupt, W (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Res Soc & Space, Res Grp Urban Sustainabil Transformat, Erkner, Germany.",wolfgang.haupt@leibniz-irs.de,,"Kern, Kristine/0000-0001-9923-4621; Haupt, Wolfgang/0000-0002-1042-2106; Eckersley, Peter/0000-0001-9048-8529",Bundesministerium f?r Bildung und Forschung;  [FKZ 01LR1709B];  [FKZ 01LR1709B1],Bundesministerium f?r Bildung und Forschung; ; ,"This work was supported by Bundesministerium f?r Bildung und Forschung [grant number FKZ 01LR1709B,FKZ 01LR1709B1].",,62,0,0,8,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-4313,1469-5944,,EUR PLAN STUD,Eur.

Tourism in mountain regions is highly dependent on natural resources and attractions which are very sensitive to climatic changes. This systematic review analyzing 276 papers, provides a comprehensive analysis of scientific literature dealing with climate change impacts on mountain tourism. While the impacts on the snow season are predominantly negative, impacts to summer season activities range from positive to negative. Contradictory results and lack of research in some regions and tourism activities means the overall impact is far from clear. We identified seven key knowledge gaps: underrepresentation of studies for South America and Africa, lack of appropriate data and indicators, an all-season perspective and investigation of opportunities, economic and socio-political consequences for mountain communities, the need for better science communication, and a lack of studies addressing liability and regulatory risks. Increasing our multidisciplinary understanding of potential climate impacts on mountain tourism and engaging stakeholders to prepare for the projected changes will help local populations in mountain communities create applicable and effective climate adaptation strategies.","[Steiger, Robert; Poll, Katharina] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Knowles, Natalie] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada; Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Innsbruck; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Steiger, R (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",robert.steiger@uibk.ac.at,"Steiger, Robert/N-5724-2014","Steiger, Robert/0000-0002-1752-6450; Knowles, Natalie/0000-0002-5605-5954; Rutty, Michelle/0000-0002-4567-7766",,,,,294,4,4,28,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

This article draws upon a political ecology lens to understand gendered recovery processes following disasters across four districts in Assam, northeastern India using empirical research from 2012 to 2018. The findings add nuances to the displacements of women in Assam as being 'climate-induced' by showing the different mechanisms of displacement and how it impacts particular groups of women, as well as their differential ways of coping with these changes. This article draws on sustained long-term qualitative research among rural villagers, particularly women, in Assam where migration is connected to riverbank erosion, exacerbated by the construction of a new embankment, and disrupted due to waterlogging caused by embankments and government relocation schemes in order to construct further dams/embankments.","[Krishnan, Sneha] OP Jindal Global Univ, Jindal Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Sonipat, Haryana, India; [Krishnan, Sneha] ETCH Consultancy Serv, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",O.P.

A flexible combination of exploratory factor analysis and principal component analysis was used to elucidate farmers' opinions towards risks and their corresponding management strategies. For risk perceptions, low and unstable selling price, unstable input supply, high and fluctuating input price, lack of health protection in pesticide use, and poor quality pesticides were perceived as the top five most important sources of risk in the studied area. For management strategies, make use of the combined harvester, adoption of certified varieties, selecting prestigious partners, increase the percentage of mechanization, matching production schedule with neighbors, and using climate-adaptive varieties were the most pivotal strategies to mitigate risks. The regression results showed that some idiosyncratic strategies can be driven by multiple perceptions, either negative or positive.

It remains unclear, however, how climate warming and human intervention (e.g., agricultural management) will affect V-NH3,V-AG. Here, we use a fully coupled agroecosystem/chemical transport model and multiple climate projections to quantify the changes in climate-induced V-NH3,V-AG over the US. We show that climate change under an intensely warming scenario will increase V-NH3,V-AG by 81% (95% confidence interval, 69%-92%) from 2010 to 2100. The increase in V-NH3,V-AG will cause a 10% loss of nitrogen applied, decrease crop yields by 540 Gg-N year(-1), increase atmospheric burden of ammonia/ammonium by 18%, and increase ammonia/ammonium deposition to sensitive ecosystems by 14%. We have found that combining climate-adaptive agricultural practices with feasible mitigation measures can fully offset the warming-induced increase in V-NH3,V-AG, saving 13% of applied nitrogen, increasing yields by 735 Gg-N year(-1), and providing net benefits for air quality and ecosystem health.","[Shen, Huizhong; Chen, Yilin; Hu, Yongtao; Pavur, Gertrude K.; Russell, Armistead G.] Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ran, Limei; Pleim, Jonathan E.] US EPA, Natl Exposure Res Lab, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA; [Lam, Shu Kee] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Sch Agr & Food, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Zhou, Feng] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ran, Limei] USDA, Nat Resources Conservat Serv, Greensboro, NC 27401 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; United States Environmental Protection Agency; University of Melbourne; Peking University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Shen, HZ (corresponding author), Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",hshen73@gatech.edu,"Shen, Huizhong/E-8152-2017; Zhou, Feng/C-9377-2011; Chen, Yilin/HLW-9992-2023","Shen, Huizhong/0000-0003-1335-8477; Zhou, Feng/0000-0001-6122-0611; Chen, Yilin/0000-0001-5532-4115","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [R835880]; National Science Foundation (NSF SRN grant) [1444745]; EPA [R835880, 909403] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(United States Environmental Protection Agency); National Science Foundation (NSF SRN grant)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"We thank Ellen Cooter (US EPA, retired) and Verel Benson (Benson Consulting) for their discussions and suggestions.

Exploring discourses amongst development actors in the Pacific Island region,REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change adaptation; Migration; Pacific Islands; Development discourse; Poststructuralist discourse theory; Qualitative discourse analysis,ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; REFUGEES; INSECURITY; POLICIES; WORLD,"This paper investigates the perspectives of a set of actors devoted to development in the Pacific on climate change, migration, and adaptation. While much of the debate over climate and migration is centred around the Small Island Developing States in the Pacific, little is known about how the debate is articulated at that regional level. Drawing on poststructuralist discourse theory and using semi-structured interviews with a set of development actors working in the region, the paper discerns three distinctive discourses on climate and migration. These are (1) a main discourse that promotes international labour migration as an adaptation response and two alternative discourses that challenge the main discourse's views, by suggesting (2) that migration is of marginal importance and engagement with socio-economic factors that influence Pacific Islands' vulnerability is more pressing, and (3) that out-migration is undesirable but that communities may have to be relocated within their countries. The paper further explores why the discourse on labour migration may have emerged and why it is being perpetuated by actors that originate outside the Pacific region. The paper concludes by suggesting that significant differentials in economic and political resources exist between the main discourse and the alternative discourses. In addition to these empirical insights, the paper adds new findings to the growing literature on the politics of climate migration discourses. Unlike earlier work that identifies a shift from an alarmist to an optimist framing, it illustrates that both alarmist and optimistic imaginaries operate simultaneously in the discourse on labour migration.","[Remling, Elise] Sodertorn Univ, Sch Nat Sci Technol & Environm Studies, Huddinge, Sweden",Sodertorn University,"Remling, E (corresponding author), Sodertorn Univ, Sch Nat Sci Technol & Environm Studies, Huddinge, Sweden.",elise.remling@sh.se,,"Remling, Elise/0000-0003-2466-3506",Sodertorn University,Sodertorn University,Open access funding provided by Sodertorn University.,,72,7,7,1,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

In view of this, there is the need to marshal efforts and utilize available knowledge from diverse sources to enable society adapt to challenges associated with climate change. While a number of scientifically based and tested strategies have been utilized, indigenous means of adapting to global warming and other climate change impacts are also available. This study unearthed coping strategies adopted by Dupong, an indigenous community in Ghana to limit adverse impacts of climate change-induced water shortages. Community members were able to identify simple indicators that signalled climate change and its impacts on their water supply conditions. In addition, they adopted key strategies such as rainwater harvesting, reliance on alternative sources of water and increased roles of males in household water collection that enabled them to minimize the adverse impacts of climate change on their water supply situation. This paper argues that while these indigenous adaptation strategies are not perfect, they are affordable hence key adaptive measures such as rainwater harvesting could be improved upon to enhance their usefulness as coping mechanisms against climate change-induced declining water supply.","[Opare, Service] Univ Canada West, Fac Business Management, Vancouver, BC, Canada",,"Opare, S (corresponding author), Univ Canada West, Fac Business Management, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",sopare@ucalgary.ca,,,International Development Research Centre,International Development Research Centre,This work was supported by International Development Research Centre.,,38,7,8,2,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Despite this, some reefs show resilience to such extreme environmental changes. This review shows how techniques in computational modelling, genetics, and transcriptomics are being used to unravel the complexity of coral reef ecosystems, to try and understand if they can adapt to new and extreme environments. Considering the ambitious climate targets of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees C, with aspirations of even 1.5 degrees C, questions arise on how to achieve this. Geoengineering may be necessary if other avenues fail, although global governance issues need to play a key role. Development of large and effective coral refugia and marine protected areas is necessary if we are not to lose this vital resource for us all.","[Crabbe, M.

Researchers are using various climate models to assess the impacts and identifying relevant alternative adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change. In India, rice is the major cereal crop grown and is influenced due to climate change and variability, inadequate water supply, labour shortage and methane emissions from rice ecosystems. This necessitates adoption action and upscaling of key adaption strategies like direct seeded rice (DSR) using validated data from rice growing areas in India. The study used experimental data of 2010-2014 and field survey data of DSR and non-DSR farmers collected during 2014. Results show that DSR method has incurred less tillage and labour costs by eluding puddling and transplantation by labour. Large-scale adoption of DSR was observed during 2012-2015 in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. This was mainly due to the delayed monsoon and water supply, reduction in cost of cultivation, capacity building of stakeholders and their active involvement in awareness and training programmes. The study has demonstrated that integrated extension approach in technology dissemination and scaling-out through stakeholder integration is crucial. However, a mission mode framework is needed for technology upscaling at system level.","[Kakumanu, Krishna Reddy; Kotapati, Gurava Reddy] Natl Inst Rural Dev & Panchayati Raj, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Kakumanu, Krishna Reddy; Kotapati, Gurava Reddy] Acharya NG Ranga Agr Univ, Guntur 522509, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Nagothu, Udaya Sekhar] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, As, Norway; [Kuppanan, Palanisami] Int Water Management Inst, New Delhi, India; [Kallam, Suresh Reddy] Agr Res Agcy Knowledge Advocacy, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India",Acharya N.

The adaptation policy framework (APF) sets out indicative activities and features of an adaptation strategy. Understanding the extent to which existing practices can support adaptation in societies and ecosystems is an important step towards the solution. This study uses vulnerability, policy and financial analyses to investigate the compatibility of the modified taungya system (MTS) (a reforestation programme) in Ghana with the indicative activities of the APF. The findings indicate that MTS takes into consideration most of the activities of an adaptation strategy, is a profitable venture (BCR > 1) and has a high potential to reduce vulnerability due to short-term food production and long-term plantation establishment. Resource management in MTS is promising in the short term, but challenges remain to meet livelihood and adaptation needs in the medium and long term. Policy instruments related to MTS align with the forestry, climate change and the development goals of Ghana. We conclude that MTS is a potential win-win practice for forestry and adaptation. The legalization of all contractual arrangements coupled with continuous monitoring, evaluation and improvement may drive MTS to become a lasting activity that will support the long-term horizon of an adaptation strategy.

We assess the views of Aboriginal people in Arnhem Land on the impacts of climate change and their possible precautionary responses to both sea level rise and a potential increase in the intensity of tropical cyclones in coastal communities. All respondents had heard about climate change, and 48 % had already seen environmental changes, particularly sea level rise, which they attributed to climate change. Fifty-eight percent of respondents would consider relocating in the future for safety reasons, although most respondents perceived living close to the sea as highly important for their future well-being, emphasising their strong connection to their traditional sea country. Many of those willing to relocate would consider moving inland, either temporarily or permanently, provided that community facilities could also be moved. Other respondents who said they would be unlikely to relocate in the future because of climate change impacts, and would prefer to adapt in situ with government support (e.g. building more shelters for severe cyclones, building sea walls and better roads for quick evacuation if necessary). We recommend that the diversity of adaptation preferences among Aboriginal people should be accommodated in policy to minimise social impacts of climate change and to take advantage of potential opportunities that could arise from moving.","[Zander, Kerstin K.; Garnett, Stephen T.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Zander, Kerstin K.] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Petheram, Lisa] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Arts & Social Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Charles Darwin University; Charles Darwin University; Australian National University,"Zander, KK (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Ellengowan Dr, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia.",kerstin.zander@cdu.edu.au,"Garnett, Stephen/M-3877-2013; Zander, Kerstin/M-2888-2013","Garnett, Stephen/0000-0002-0724-7060; Zander, Kerstin/0000-0002-2237-1801","Charles Darwin University, Darwin, Australia; Australian Research Council [DP0987528]; Australian Research Council [DP0987528] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","Charles Darwin University, Darwin, Australia; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","We sincerely thank all Yolngu participants of this study as well as John Rolfe, Kevin Boyle and Deanne Bird for their valuable inputs.

These results in turn indicate that agricultural land dedicated to cotton could be reclaimed for food production by extending poplar plantations to produce textile fibers. Based on climate-adapted poplar clones capable of growth on marginal lands in the Nordic region, we estimate an environmentally sustainable annual biomass production of similar to 11 tonnes/ha. At scale, lignin-first biorefining of this poplar could annually generate 2.4 tonnes/ha of dissolving pulp for textiles and 1.1 m(3) biofuels. Life cycle assessment indicates that, relative to cotton production, this approach could substantially reduce water consumption and identifies certain areas for further improvement. Overall, this work highlights a new value chain to reduce the environmental footprint of textiles, chemicals, and biofuels while enabling land reclamation and water savings from cotton back to food production.","[Adler, Anneli; Karacic, Almir] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Kumaniaev, Ivan; Baddigam, Kiran Reddy; Subbotina, Elena; Huertas-Alonso, Alberto J.; Samec, Joseph S.

Research on urban ventilation corridors is a hotspot in the field of urban planning. Traditional studies on ventilation corridors mostly focus on qualitative or simulated research on urban climate issues such as the intensified urban heat island effect, serious environmental pollution, and insufficient climate adaptability. Based on the high-precision urban remote sensing image data obtained by aeromagnetic oblique photography, this paper calculates the frontal area density of the city with reference to the urban wind statistics. Based on the existing urban patterns, template matching technology was used to automatically excavate urban ventilation corridors, which provides scientific and reasonable algorithmic support for the rapid construction of potential urban ventilation corridor paths. It also provides technical methods and decision basis for low-carbon urban planning, ecological planning and microclimate optimization design. This method was proved to be effective through experiments in Deqing city, Zhejiang Province, China.","[Chen, Chaoxiang; Ye, Shiping; Bai, Zhican; Wang, Juan; Zhang, Zongbiao] Zhejiang Shuren Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chaoxiang; Ye, Shiping; Bai, Zhican; Wang, Juan; Zhang, Zongbiao; Ablameyko, Sergey] Int Sci & Technol Cooperat Base Zhejiang Prov Rem, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China; [Ablameyko, Sergey] Belarusian State Univ, Fac Appl Math & Comp Sci, Minsk 220004, BELARUS; [Ablameyko, Sergey] Natl Acad Sci, United Inst Informat Problems, Minsk 220004, BELARUS",Zhejiang Shuren University; Belarusian State University; National Academy of Sciences of Belarus (NASB); United Institute of Informatics Problems of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus,"Ye, SP (corresponding author), Zhejiang Shuren Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China.;Ye, SP (corresponding author), Int Sci & Technol Cooperat Base Zhejiang Prov Rem, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China.",ccx@zjsru.edu.cn; ysp@zjsru.edu.cn; 600352@zjsru.edu.cn; juanw@zjsru.edu.cn; zzb@zjsru.edu.cn; ablameyko@bsu.by,,"Ye, Shiping/0000-0002-9771-7168","Zhejiang Province Basic Public Welfare Research Program Project [LGJ19F020002, LGF19F020016]",Zhejiang Province Basic Public Welfare Research Program Project,"FundingThis research was funded by Zhejiang Province Basic Public Welfare Research Program Project, grant number LGJ19F020002 and LGF19F020016.",,23,2,2,10,49,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2021,21,22,,,,,,,7537,10.3390/s21227537,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21227537,,,18,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,XG1AM,34833612,"gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000724492600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper examines the role of racial identities in debates about the security implications of climate-induced migration (CIM). The paper proposes a reconceptualization of 'racial logics': a form of discursive construction that connects naturalized assumptions about racialized Others with possible outcomes in conditions of future climate insecurity. The paper argues that 'Muslim' and 'African' migrant populations in the context of possible CIM from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to the EU - are racialized with a potential capacity for radicalization and terrorism. Constructed as racialized Others, 'Muslim' and 'African' migrant populations could face exclusionary containment policies in climate-insecure futures.

This study addresses this problem by investigating the framing of climate change in eight print and online media outlets in Indonesia, the biggest emerging country in Southeast Asia. It identified three frames using cluster analysis: the climate impact and science frame, the climate politics frame, and the climate action frame. Further analyses revealed that print and online media used these frames selectively, as they relied on different news sources (national and international) and gave voice to various actors. These findings demonstrate the organizational influence on climate reporting. Furthermore, the study discovered that climate adaptation strategies were almost absent in the media coverage despite the urgency of this topic for the Indonesian public.

In this paper, we provide an economic framework to incorporate investment timing and insurance market risk preferences when evaluating projects related to reducing climate impacted risks. The model is applied to a case study of bushfire risk management. We find that optimal timing of the investment may increase the net present value (NPV) of an adaptation project for various levels of risk aversion. Assuming risk neutrality, while the market is risk averse, is found to result in an unnecessary delay of the investment into risk reduction projects. The optimal waiting time is shorter when the insurance market is more risk averse or when a more serious scenario for climatic change is assumed. A higher investment cost or a higher discount rate will increase the optimal waiting time. We also find that a stochastic discount rate results in higher NPVs of the project than a discount rate that is assumed fixed at the long run average level. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

How the soil can contribute to making cities more climate proof is often neglected. Unsealed soil and green spaces increase water storage capacity and can consequently prevent flooding. The planning of public or private green spaces can have a cooling effect and, in general, have a positive effect on how people perceive their health. This paper reviews existing guidelines from Dutch policy documents regarding unsealed soil and green spaces in the Netherlands; do they support climate adaptation policies? Scientific literature was used to quantify the positive effects of green spaces on water storage capacity, cooling and public health. Finally we present a case study of a model town where different policy areas are linked together. Maps were made to provide insight into the ratio of unsealed soil and the number of green spaces in relation to existing guidelines using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Maps marking the age and social-economic status of the population were also made. The benefits of green spaces are difficult to express in averages because they depend on many different factors such as soil properties, type of green spaces, population characteristics and spatial planning. Moreover, it is not possible to provide quantifications of the benefits of green spaces because of a lack of scientific evidence at the moment Based on the maps, however, policy assessments can be made, for example, in which site a neighborhood will most benefit from investment in parks and public gardens. Neighborhoods where people have a low social-economic status have for example fewer green spaces than others. This offers opportunities for efficient adaptation policies linking goals of several policy fields. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Research objectives of this study were (1) to determine the proper N application rate for current practice, (2) to select a range of synthetic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to expand the existing wheat cultivar pool for adaptation purpose, (3) to quantify the potential impacts of climate change on wheat grain yield and (4) to evaluate the effectiveness of three common management options such as early sowing, changing N application rate and use of different wheat cultivars derived in (2) and given in the APSIM-Wheat model package in dealing with the projected negative impacts for Keith, South Australia. The APSIM-Wheat model was used to achieve these objectives. It was found that 75 kg ha(-1) N application at sowing for current situation is appropriate for the study location. This provided a non-limiting N supply condition for climate change impact and adaptation evaluation. Negative impacts of climate change on wheat grain yield were projected under both high (-15%) and low (-10%) plant available water capacity conditions. Neither changes in N application level nor in wheat cultivar alone nor their synergistic effects could offset the negative climate change impact. It was found that early sowing is an effective adaptation strategy when initial soil water was reset at 25 mm at sowing but this may be hard to realise especially since a drier environment is projected.

Climate adaptation strategies are essential to minimize the detrimental effects of global warming on grape and wine quality. This review summarized the effect of viticultural techniques to delay grapevine ripening with emphasis on canopy management and we overviewed the effects of high temperatures on grape and wine quality. Some viticultural techniques such as severe shoot trimming, minimal pruning, late winter pruning and apical leaf removal may delay grapevine ripening close to 15 days.

We found that most of the producers perceived climate impacts, and they encountered multiple adaptation obstacles, of which institutional and normative obstacles were more serious, such as farmers unable to obtain resources or government incentives, lacked scientific, and efficient coping measures. The survey also observed that crop farmers had a pressing need for agricultural subsidies, while animal farmers and agro-tourism operators had a strong enabler for animal housing infrastructure and credit facilities, respectively. Given the heterogeneity of the context and climate change experience of different categories of farmers, it is necessary to formulate flexible adaptation strategies and adjust them according to specific climate stress and farming conditions. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, policymakers should plan and introduce appropriate adaptation strategies to minimize the adverse effects of climate change such as improving irrigation and weather forecasting system through technological advancement, cost reduction of farm inputs, ensuring availability of information, providing agricultural subsidies to the farmers, and increasing the access to agricultural markets.","[Mu, Lan; Fang, Lan; Liu, Yuhong; Wang, Chencheng] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Northwest Inst Hist Environm & Socioecon Dev, Xian 710062, Peoples R China",Shaanxi Normal University,"Mu, L (corresponding author), Shaanxi Normal Univ, Northwest Inst Hist Environm & Socioecon Dev, Xian 710062, Peoples R China.",mulan820706@snnu.edu.cn; fanglan@snnu.edu.cn; liuyuhong8023@snnu.edu.cn; wangchencheng123@snnu.edu.cn,,,"major projects of the humanities and Social Sciences base of the Ministry of Education [17JJD790015]; Shaanxi Normal University, China [18QNGG011]; Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Science Research Youth Foundation [17XJC790010]; Shaanxi Social Science Fund [2018D29]; Key Laboratory Project of Shaanxi Education Department [05JS040]","major projects of the humanities and Social Sciences base of the Ministry of Education; Shaanxi Normal University, China; Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Science Research Youth Foundation; Shaanxi Social Science Fund; Key Laboratory Project of Shaanxi Education Department","This research was funded by the major projects of the humanities and Social Sciences base of the Ministry of Education (17JJD790015); the funded Projects for the Academic Leaders and Academic Backbones, Shaanxi Normal University, China (18QNGG011); the Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Science Research Youth Foundation (17XJC790010); Shaanxi Social Science Fund (2018D29); Key Laboratory Project of Shaanxi Education Department (05JS040).",,51,6,6,2,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,12,18,,,,,,,7494,10.3390/su12187494,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12187494,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OJ9QZ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000584290200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nepal makes an interesting case study as it is one of the most vulnerable agricultural economies within South Asia. We develop a comparative static multi household computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for Nepal, with a nested set of constant elasticity of transformation (CET) functional forms, to model the allocation of land within different agricultural sectors. Land transformation elasticities in these CET functions are allowed to reflect the ease of switching from one crop to another based on their agronomic characteristics. The results suggest that, in the long run, farmers in Nepal tend to allocate land to crops that are comparatively less impacted by climate change, such as paddy, thereby minimising the economy-wide impacts of climate change. Furthermore, the results reveal that land-use change tends to reduce the income disparity between different household groups by significantly moderating the income losses of marginal farmers. Therefore, it is suggested that policy makers in Nepal should prioritise schemes such as providing climate-smart paddy varieties (i.e., those that are resistant to heat, drought and floods) to farmers, subsidising fertilizers, improving agronomic practices, and educating farmers to switch from crops that are highly impacted by climate change to those that are not, such as paddy.

This duality has important implications for forest management in terms of requirements for enhanced and integrated adaptation and mitigation interventions. Two ideal conceptual level changes could provide the means for implementation. First, the incorporation of climate change considerations into definitions of sustainable forest management (SFM) would provide mandates for enhanced approaches. Second, the mainstreaming of enhanced SFM would facilitate implementation. There are, however, factors that may impede implementation. Identifying and evaluating these factors informs our understanding of requirements for adaptation and mitigation mainstreaming. This study reviews, organizes, and interprets the literature for the purposes of identifying and evaluating potential impediments. Harmonization barriers pertain to differences between adaptation and mitigation in preexisting frames and beliefs. Enabling barriers are psychological and institutional in nature. Implementation barriers include capacity deficits (e.g., funding limits, science and knowledge deficits regarding benefits, trade-offs, and synergies between adaptation and mitigation) and governance issues. Barriers are interrelated, dynamic, and subjective. Addressing barriers requires a holistic approach that recognizes the complex and dynamic nature of forest management policy change processes.","[Williamson, Tim B.] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, 5320-122 St, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada; [Nelson, Harry W.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service; University of British Columbia,"Williamson, TB (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, 5320-122 St, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada.",twilliam@nrcan.gc.ca,,,,,,,108,15,15,2,32,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

This paper explores three major European cities that have policies in place that are supposed to facilitate the installation of green roofs. We ask what approaches were chosen by local authorities to promote green roofs and which factors facilitated their implementation. Our analysis is based on implementation literature in general as well as adaptation policy literature in particular. It combines literature reviews and eleven interviews with policymakers and other stakeholders. The study reveals that immediate threats and particular events (e.g., urban heat islands or floods), an overall social and political environment favoring green solutions, so-called change agents, and a supportive framing determine if green roofs are considered as an attractive solution. However, even when multiple benefits of green roofs are beyond doubt, local governments largely prefer fiscal incentives over mandatory policies.","[Clar, Christoph; Steurer, Reinhard] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Clar, C (corresponding author), Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",christoph.clar@boku.ac.at,,"Clar, Christoph/0000-0003-3556-8256",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) - 8th Call [KR15AC8K12542],Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) - 8th Call,This work was supported by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) - 8th Call (grant number: KR15AC8K12542).,,99,1,1,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0735-2166,1467-9906,,J URBAN AFF,J.

An analysis of data collected using semi-structured interviews with 27 households reveals that household adaptability - the ability or capacity to adapt to the impacts of climatic variations - depends on access to livelihood assets. All households have access to social capital through familial networks, which lessens the burden of extreme weather events, namely cyclones and flooding. Households with access to tangible assets such as land and the equipment and resources to utilize it, together with intangible assets like motivation and knowledge are better positioned to adapt their agricultural practices to changing climatic conditions. Households headed by a capable individual were also better positioned to adapt.

Drawing on the hypothesis of induced innovation, we investigate whether spatial variations in climatic resources prompted the development of location-specific technologies that led to increased rice productivity in Nepal. Using Nepal's district-level time-series data (1991-1992 and 2002-2003), this article examines the extent to which technological innovations have provided farmers with means to respond to climatic constraints to enhance rice productivity in climatically marginal regions of the country. Complementing this analysis with relevant case studies, we also investigate how and to what extent Nepal's research establishments have provided farmers with technological options to alleviate climatic constraints in rice cultivation across the country's climatically diverse terrain. The findings from both the empirical and qualitative assessment indicate that Nepal's research establishment is engaged in and committed to the development of location-specific technologies that address the constraints of climate. The outcome of such commitment has been a series of technological innovations and changes in policies in agriculture. Together, this might have been responsible for higher yields among the districts with marginal climate, which have subsequently led to convergence of the rice productivity growth rate in the country. If the current trend of addressing the constraints of climate in agriculture through appropriate technological as well as institutional changes continues, then the prospect of adapting to further climate becomes more apparent in Nepal.","[Chhetri, Netra B.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Chhetri, Netra B.] Arizona State Univ, Consortium Sci Policy & Outcomes, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Easterling, Andwilliam E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Chhetri, NB (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Netra.Chhetri@asu.edu; Easterling@psu.edu,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020",,,,,,74,25,25,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

Sixty-five interviews of cross-sectoral local stakeholders were conducted in: Boston (MA), Los Angeles (CA), Portland (OR), Raleigh (NC), and Tampa (FL). Findings demonstrate that conceptualizations of vulnerability are affected by intellectual frameworks that tend to orient around infrastructure and human health; that retrospective and prospective thinking are inter-related and affect one another; and that institutionalized forms and biases are critical.

Based on results from a national survey of municipal governments in Canada, the paper reveals that municipal governments are engaged in many climate activities and processes that common inventories and reporting systems do not capture. The paper argues that these 'in between activities' - the not-yet counted climate actions that take place between and outside of milestone initiation and completion - have practical importance for future climate action and theoretical importance by complementing growing evidence about the nature of municipal climate activities and climate governance.","[Robinson, Pamela] Ryerson Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Gore, Christopher] Ryerson Univ, Polit & Publ Adm, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Robinson, P (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.",pamela.robinson@ryerson.ca; chris.gore@politics.ryerson.ca,"Gore, Christopher/AAF-4325-2020","Robinson, Pamela/0000-0002-7936-8988",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada) [865-2008-0037],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada) under Grant 865-2008-0037.",,49,12,12,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-774X,1472-3425,,ENVIRON PLANN C,Environ.

For the hazard assessment, hazard indicators were constructed utilizing design rainfall standards, which represented the local flood protection capability, as a flood threshold. We constructed high-resolution spatial images from data of buildings, roads, agriculture areas, and the population that have suffered significant flood damage in the Republic of Korea. We also calculated flood exposure levels by analyzing the scales of the targets in low-lying areas. Environmental and anthropogenic conditions that can directly increase or decrease river flooding and urban flooding were set as indicators and utilized as proxy variables. As a result of the risk assessment, we found 43 risk areas in the historical period, accounting for 19% of the total administrative districts, 42 in the projected period under RCP 4.5 (18%), and 51 in the projected period under RCP 8.5 (22%). This study's results can be utilized by the central government to determine flood risk priority areas in various administrative districts and by the local government to select priority areas to install flood reduction facilities.","[Yu, Insang; Jung, Huicheul] Korea Environm Inst, Korea Adaptat Ctr Climate Change, Sejong 30121, South Korea",Korea Environment Institute (KEI),"Jung, H (corresponding author), Korea Environm Inst, Korea Adaptat Ctr Climate Change, Sejong 30121, South Korea.",hchjung@kei.re.kr,,"JUNG, Huicheul/0000-0002-1908-342X; Yu, Insang/0000-0002-8127-4892",Korea Environment Institute (KEI) upon the request of the Korea Ministry of Environment [2022-001-05],"Korea Environment Institute (KEI) upon the request of the Korea Ministry of Environment(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","This paper is based on the results of the research work Assessment of climate change vulnerability and support tool (2022-001-05), conducted by the Korea Environment Institute (KEI) upon the request of the Korea Ministry of Environment.",,71,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2022,14,21,,,,,,,14335,10.3390/su142114335,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142114335,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6E7SV,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000883576700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Focusing on individual sectors and institutions, researchers have given insights as to how climate knowledge is reframed according to institutional cultures and priorities. This study extends such scholarship by comparing how four sectors-greenspace management, building technology, spatial planning, and health-perceive, judge, transfer, and appropriate knowledge on urban heatwaves, and what adaptation options are proposed. Based on semi-structured interviews, documentary materials and observations of two workshops collected in two Swiss cities, I draw on Eviatar Zerubavel and his 'cultural cognitive sociology' whose work emphasises how collectively shared patterns of recognition and thinking guide and facilitate human judgement. I find two factors to influence knowledge appropriation. On the one hand, theformativedimension of knowledge underscores that experts understand climate knowledge similarly when a sector shares key concepts with climate science. If such 'cognitive links' are missing, the answers on how heatwaves impact experts' work are more varied. On the other hand, theperformativedimension of knowledge highlights that experts' eagerness to adapt is influenced by diverging technical, legal, and social possibilities. When experts' decision scope is large, then uptake of climate knowledge is more fluid. With a more explicit understanding of why sectors differ in their appropriation and integration of climate knowledge into their work, this study is a reminder that only fitting knowledge is of value to sectoral experts.","[Skelton, Maurice] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CHN K72-1,Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Skelton, Maurice] MeteoSwiss, Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss),"Skelton, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CHN K72-1,Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;Skelton, M (corresponding author), MeteoSwiss, Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol, Zurich, Switzerland.",maurice.skelton@usys.ethz.ch,,,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich(ETH Zurich),Open access funding provided by Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.,,62,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Growing suitable cultivars in a given region is essential for maintaining viticulture sustainability, particularly in the face of climate change. We created a database composed of three different subsets of data. The first subset was created by digitizing and curating the seminal report of Amerine and Winkler (1944), which provided grape harvest dates (GHDs), the quality of musts and wines, and wine tasting notes for 148 cultivars from 1935-1941 across five contrasting climatic regions of California. To put this dataset into a climate change context, we collected GHDs and must sugar content (degrees Brix) records from 1991 to 2018 for four representative cultivars in one of the five studied regions (Napa). Finally, we integrated meteorological data of the five regions during 1911-2018 and calculated bioclimatic indices important for grape. The resulting database is unique and valuable for assessing the fitness between cultivars across environments in order to mitigate the effects of climate change.","[Bai, Huiqing; Wang, Yongjian; Kong, Junhua; Long, Qinqin; Fan, Peige; Duan, Wei; Liang, Zhenchang; Dai, Zhanwu] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Key Lab Grape Sci & Enol, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Bai, Huiqing; Wang, Yongjian; Kong, Junhua; Long, Qinqin; Fan, Peige; Duan, Wei; Liang, Zhenchang; Dai, Zhanwu] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Resources, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Gambetta, Gregory A.] Univ Bordeaux, EGFV, Bordeaux Sci Agro, INRAe,ISVV, 210 Chemin Leysotte, F-33882 Bordeaux, France","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux","Dai, ZW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Key Lab Grape Sci & Enol, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.;Dai, ZW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Resources, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",zhanwu.dai@ibcas.ac.cn,"Long, Qinqin/HGC-9682-2022","Long, Qinqin/0000-0002-6844-0067; Dai, Zhanwu/0000-0002-7625-8337",National Key R&D Program of China [2021YFE0109500]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U20A2041]; Agricultural Breeding Project of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region [NXNYYZ202101]; LIA INNOGRAPE International Associated Laboratory,National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Agricultural Breeding Project of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region; LIA INNOGRAPE International Associated Laboratory,"This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFE0109500), National Natural Science Foundation of China (U20A2041), and the Agricultural Breeding Project of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NXNYYZ202101).

People in the region are particularly sensitive to these changes given their resource-based livelihoods and high dependence on rainfall for their freshwater needs. Despite this, little attention has been given to understanding the implications of climatic changes for people and their capacity to manage these changes. This paper assesses human vulnerability to climate change (as it relates to fresh water resources) in Vusama, an iTaukei village in southwest Viti Levu, Fiji in the context of recent social and ecological changes. An analysis of data collected using a vulnerability approach that included semi-structured interviews, participant observation and analysis of secondary sources reveal that climate change together with behavioural changes are negatively affecting availability and access to clean freshwater, with implications for household economies, food security and human health. In particular, prolonged drought and changing seasonal patterns, together with people's increasing reliance on a village borehole in lieu of family wells have resulted in a freshwater crisis. People are coping by using earnings from wage employment and harvesting and selling seafood to buy water and vegetables, rationing freshwater and depending on extended social networks for fresh produce. Current responses are reactive and short-term. Longer-term adaptation strategies are needed that consider expected future climate change and broader human development goals.","[Pearce, Tristan; Currenti, Renee; Doran, Brendan] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4558, Australia; [Mateiwai, Asinate] Univ South Pacific, Laucala Campus, Suva, Fiji",University of the Sunshine Coast; University of the South Pacific,"Pearce, T (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4558, Australia.",tpearce@usc.edu.au; rcurrent@usc.edu.au; s11141654@student.usp.ac.fj; bfdoran@gmail.com,"Pearce, Tristan/L-9139-2019","Pearce, Tristan/0000-0002-5384-5870",University of the Sunshine Coast; New Colombo Plan scholarships,University of the Sunshine Coast; New Colombo Plan scholarships,"Vinaka vaka levu to the people of Vusama.

Lodging, which is the permanent displacement of crop plants from upright position, is one of the main causes of yield loss and quality reduction in canola/oilseed rape. However, there has been little research to date on how the mechanisms of crop lodging might be affected by high temperature. The objectives of this study were to examine the effect of high temperature on the structural features of lodging resistance in four canola genotypes, to determine what kind of lodging (stem or root) was more prevalent, and to identify corresponding mechanistic traits associated with lodging under high temperature conditions. The experiment was carried out in controlled growth facilities with the genotypes tested under normal (23/17 degrees C; CK) and high temperature (27.01/24.3 degrees C) regimes. The results showed that high temperature reduced root lodging resistance significantly, as indicated by a dramatic reduction in both root anchorage and safety factor (against anchorage failure). These were attributable to the large suppression on lateral root growth (32%), and thereby reduction in root bending resistance (33%), root-soil cone dimension (13%), and its shear strength (33%). High temperature showed an inconsistent effect on stem lodging resistance, which was in alignment with the engineering mechanics theory and supported by the anatomical observations. These results indicated that canola genotypes were more prone to anchorage failure than stem buckling. Consequently, root lodging resulted from anchorage failure would become a critical aspect under rising temperatures with the global warming. The present study indicates that root lodging should be targeted as a priority to improve crop lodging resistance through breeding selection for a root system with high anchorage strength, especially when the crop plants are expected to encounter inevitable high temperature stress.","[Wu, Wei] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wei; Ma, Bao-Luo] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Ottawa Res & Dev Ctr, 960 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada",Northwest A&F University - China; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,"Ma, BL (corresponding author), Agr & Agri Food Canada, Ottawa Res & Dev Ctr, 960 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada.",Wei.Wu@agr.gc.ca; baoluo.ma@agr.gc.ca,"Wu, Wei/AAG-3230-2020","Wu, Wei/0000-0003-1867-1446",Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) Growing Forward II Canola/Flax Cluster [J-000349.001.01],Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) Growing Forward II Canola/Flax Cluster(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada),"This study was financially supported, in part, by the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) Growing Forward II Canola/Flax Cluster project J-000349.001.01 through the Collaborative Research and Development Agreement between AAFC and the Canola Council of Canada (CCC).

So far, however, experiences and theoretical analyses of PES specifically for adaptation have not been well documented. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the opportunities and constraints of PES as an instrument for EBA. Specifically, we examine the potential for PES to address key elements for adaptation by focusing on three pathways: the user side, the provider side and institutional and societal change. In addition, we assess whether PES fulfils key requirements for adaptation policy instruments, notably effectiveness, efficiency, equity and legitimacy. We find that PES are not a panacea for all environmental services and country contexts, but can be promising adaptation policy instruments where certain preconditions are met and synergies prevail. We conclude on four points especially relevant for the practical scope for PES-adaptation synergies: (i) natural adaptation co-benefits (where the targeted environmental service serves a dual function, e. g. secured water quality and increased adaptive capacity), (ii) piggy-backing (where adaptation benefits are coincidental outcomes), (iii) adaptation-relevant institutional and sectoral spillovers from PES schemes, and (iv) direct payments for adaptation benefits.","[Wertz-Kanounnikoff, Sheila] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Maputo, Mozambique; [Locatelli, Bruno] CIRAD, UPR Forest Resources, Montpellier, France; [Wunder, Sven] CIFOR, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Locatelli, Bruno; Brockhaus, Maria] CIFOR, Bogor 16115, Indonesia",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); CIRAD; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Wertz-Kanounnikoff, S (corresponding author), Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Maputo, Mozambique.",s.wertz-kanounnikoff@cgiar.org,"Locatelli, Bruno/C-9957-2009; Wunder, Sven/ABE-7773-2020","Locatelli, Bruno/0000-0003-2983-1644; Wunder, Sven/0000-0002-9422-0260; Brockhaus, Maria/0000-0001-7348-4921",,,,,78,18,19,4,99,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Using a mixed-method case study approach, the current study compares two sites (Khyber and Khudaabad) in northern Pakistan with comparable socioeconomic features but varying levels of effectiveness of CBC/CBNRM programmes. The CBC in Khyber has been proactive than that of Khudaabad. The data was collected through household surveys (n = 220, 110 at each site), key informant interviews (n = 8 office-bearers of community-based organizations, 4 at each site), and extensive document review. In comparison to Khudaabad, the findings revealed that the local communities in Khyber demonstrated improved resilience to climate change because of a proactive community-based governance system, improved practices, access to social services, disaster preparedness, and improved knowledge of climate change. The study concludes that CBC/CBNRM contributes to building climate resilience among vulnerable mountain communities by strengthening social and ecological systems. The study suggests that for building the climate resilience of vulnerable communities, instead of investing in stand-alone adaptation measures, the governments must focus on ecosystem-based adaptions or integrate the specific adaptation or mitigation actions into the existing CBC/CBNRM programmes.","[Zafar, Shameen; Begum, Farida] Karakoram Int Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Gilgit, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Zafar] Karakoram Int Univ, Dept Forestry Range & Wildlife Management, Univ Rd, Gilgit 15100, Pakistan; [Mehmood, Tahir] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Nat Sci SNS, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Sadiq, Maryam] Univ Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Dept Stat, Muzaffarabad, Pakistan",Karakoram International University; Karakoram International University; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; University of Azad Jammu & Kashmir,"Khan, MZ (corresponding author), Karakoram Int Univ, Dept Forestry Range & Wildlife Management, Univ Rd, Gilgit 15100, Pakistan.",zafar.khan@kiu.edu.pk,"Begum, Farida/V-9379-2019","Begum, Farida/0000-0003-3966-8545; Khan, Muhammad Zafar/0000-0001-9682-6701",Hashoo Foundation Pakistan,Hashoo Foundation Pakistan,This work was supported in part by Hashoo Foundation Pakistan.,,78,0,0,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

It is also well-recognized that coastal zones, characterized by an increasing population growth, are vulnerable to climate change. In addition, coastal erosion, resulting from natural environment changes and human activities, acts worldwide. Consequently, it is necessary to quantify coastal hazards vulnerability and develop tools to monitor coastal risks and support making targeted climate adaptation policies. In this paper, a framework to estimate coastal vulnerability to flooding and erosion has been developed for the Ionian Basilicata coast. It is based on two methods: the integrated vulnerability index (flooding and erosion) and the CeD physical vulnerability index (multi-risk assessment). Our results are in agreement with the recent shoreline evolution: the integrated coastal risk of the Ionian Basilicata coast is generally medium to high, while the physical erosion vulnerability is generally high to very high. In addition, the results highlight a spatial variability of the vulnerability, probably due to the morphology of the beach, which requires developing a strategic approach to coastal management and defining mitigation measures, considering relevant risk aspects as the vulnerability and exposure degree.","[Corbau, Corinne; Olivo, Elisabetta] Univ Ferrara, Dept Environm & Prevent Sci, I-44120 Ferrara, Italy; [Greco, Michele; Martino, Giovanni] Univ Basilicata, Sch Engn, I-85100 Potenza, Italy; [Simeoni, Umberto] Consorzio Univ Ric Socioecon & Ambiente CURSA, I-00187 Rome, Italy",University of Ferrara; University of Basilicata,"Corbau, C (corresponding author), Univ Ferrara, Dept Environm & Prevent Sci, I-44120 Ferrara, Italy.",cbc@unife.it; michele.greco@unibas.it; giovanni.martino@unibas.it; elisabetta.olivo@unife.it; g23@unife.it,"Corbau, Corinne/GXG-6338-2022; Greco, Michele/B-6809-2013","Greco, Michele/0000-0002-3986-7117; Corbau, Corinne/0000-0002-9210-9745",,,,,77,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

Climate projections foresee an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat-related impacts on human health. To reduce these climate risks, governments need a better understanding of not only the scale and the factors affecting those risks, but also how to prepare and protect the city and citizens against these risks and prevent them through effective policy making. Therefore, climate adaptation decisions need to be made in complex systems with manifold uncertainties. In response to these deep uncertainties, different planning approaches have been developed to assist policymakers in decision making. This paper is focused on one of the dynamic adaptive policy planning approaches: the adaptation pathway. This approach allows designing alternative feasible plans that are flexible and can respond when new information appears or when conditions in the environment change. This paper presents a structured methodology for designing adaptation pathways. The work describes a high-level adaptation pathway covering heatwave impacts on productivity and health at city level in Antwerp to ensure the city adapts to future conditions.

This paper investigates: 1) changes in heatwave characteristics such as peak temperature, number of events, frequency and duration over a past 67-year period in Australia; 2) projected changes in heatwave characteristics for this century in Queensland, northeast Australia; and 3) the avoided heatwave impacts of limiting global warming by 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C and 3.0 degrees C. The results reveal that heatwaves have increased in intensity, frequency and duration across Australia over the past 67 years, such intensification was particularly higher on recent decades. Downscaled future climate projections for Queensland suggest that heatwaves will further intensify over the current century. The projections also highlight that distinct climatic regions within Queensland may have different heatwave responses under global warming, where tropical and equatorial heatwaves appear to be more sensitive to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations than temperate and arid regions. The results offer new insights to support climate adaptation and mitigation at regional scales.

The urban heat island effect, combined with warming effects of climate change, is likely to cause an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events. Alterations to the physical, built environment are a viable option for mitigating urban heat, yet few studies provide systematic guidance to practitioners for adapting diverse land uses. In this study, we examine the use of green infrastructure treatments to evaluate changes in ambient temperatures across diverse land uses in the city of Portland, Oregon. We apply ENVI-met((R)) microclimate modeling at the city-block scale specifically to determine what built environment characteristics are most associated with high temperatures, and the extent to which different physical designs reduce ambient temperature. The analysis included six green infrastructure interventions modeled across six different land-use types, and indicated the varying degrees to which approaches are effective. Results were inconsistent across landscapes, and showed that one mitigation solution alone would not significantly reduce extreme heat. These results can be used to develop targeted, climate- and landscape-specific cooling interventions for different land uses, which can help to inform and refine current guidance to achieve urban climate adaptation goals.","[Makido, Yasuyo; Shandas, Vivek] Portland State Univ, Sch Urban Studies & Planning, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Hellman, Dana] Portland State Univ, Sch Environm, Portland, OR 97201 USA",Portland State University; Portland State University,"Shandas, V (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Sch Urban Studies & Planning, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",ymakido@pdx.edu; dhellman@pdx.edu; vshandas@pdx.edu,,"Hellman, Dana/0000-0002-3798-0693",U.S. Forest Service's National Urban and Community Forestry Challenge Grant [17-DG-11132544-014]; National Science Foundation's Sustainable Research Network Grant [1444755],U.S. Forest Service's National Urban and Community Forestry Challenge Grant; National Science Foundation's Sustainable Research Network Grant,"This research was funded by the U.S. Forest Service's National Urban and Community Forestry Challenge Grant (No. 17-DG-11132544-014), and the National Science Foundation's Sustainable Research Network Grant (No. 1444755).",,75,23,23,13,65,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,MAY,2019,10,5,,,,,,,282,10.3390/atmos10050282,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos10050282,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,IE9EL,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000472677600056,View Full Record in Web of Science

India has experienced unprecedented urbanization over recent decades with an urban population of 380 million. Here, we present the first study of the diurnal and seasonal characteristics of SUHII in India. We found negative SUHII over a majority of urban areas during daytime in pre-monsoon summer (MAM), contrary to the expected impacts of urbanization. This unexpected pattern is associated with low vegetation in non-urban regions during dry pre-monsoon summers, leading to reduced evapotranspiration (ET). During pre-monsoon summer nights, a positive SUHII occurs when urban impacts are prominent. Winter daytime SUHII becomes positive in Indo-Gangetic plain. We attribute such diurnal and seasonal behaviour of SUHII to the same of the differences in ET between urban and non-urban regions. Higher LST in non-urban regions during pre-monsoon summer days results in intensified heatwaves compared to heatwaves in cities, in contrast to presumptions made in the literature. These observations highlight the need for re-evaluation of SUHII in India for climate adaptation, heat stress mitigation, and analysis of urban micro-climates.","[Shastri, Hiteshri; Barik, Beas; Ghosh, Subimal; Venkataraman, Chandra; Sadavarte, Pankaj] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Shastri, Hiteshri] Charotar Univ Sci & Technol, CS Patel Inst Technol, Anand 388421, Gujarat, India; [Barik, Beas; Ghosh, Subimal] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Venkataraman, Chandra; Sadavarte, Pankaj] Indian Inst Technol, Chem Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Charotar University of Science & Technology - Charusat; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Ghosh, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.;Ghosh, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.",subimal@civil.iitb.ac.in,"Shastri, Hiteshri/AAH-1728-2020","Shastri, Hiteshri/0000-0002-1831-2972; Sadavarte, Pankaj/0000-0002-7337-683X","Department of Science and Technology, Government of India; Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India","Department of Science and Technology, Government of India(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India(Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation)","The work presented here is financially supported by Department of Science and Technology and Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India.",,42,85,86,5,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JAN 9,2017,7,,,,,,,,40178,10.1038/srep40178,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep40178,,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,EH4RY,28067276,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000391759500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent research has shown that coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves provide climate mitigation services because they are particularly effective at sequestering and storing carbon dioxide, referred to as coastal blue carbon. Unfortunately, degradation of blue carbon ecosystems due to anthropogenic impacts contributes to anthropogenic carbon emissions from land use impacts and prevents these ecosystems from continuing to sequester and store carbon. Given the impressive carbon sequestration and storage in coastal ecosystems, many countries with blue carbon resources are beginning to implement blue carbon restoration projects using carbon financing mechanisms. This study analyzed four case studies of projects in Kenya, India, Vietnam, and Madagascar, evaluating the individual carbon financing mechanisms, the project outcomes, and the policy implications of each. Strengths and challenges of implementing blue carbon projects are discussed and considerations that all projects should address are examined in order to develop long-term sustainable climate mitigation or adaptation policies.

Significant ethnic differences in single polymorphisms were found between all groups except for African Blacks-Dravidian Indians, who differed only in their MspI7-16-bp duplication haplotype distribution. Since previous results have shown that p53 alleles are correlated with latitude (degree of insolation), the similarity between these two groups, who are genetically quite distinct, may be due to ecological adaptation to similar climatic conditions. All other major ethnic groups differed significantly from each other with respect to their haplotype distributions; thus, p53 alleles and haplotypes should be very useful as anthropological markers. Asiatic Mongoloid groups appear to be characterized by very low frequencies of the 16-bp duplication and the MspI Al allele. These mutations have probably been introduced by migration to east Asia from either Europe or Africa, where the highest frequencies were found. The results of this study indicate that p53, besides its role as a tumor suppressor, shows distinct ethnic heterogeneity and may be involved in ecological (climatic) adaptation.","UMEA UNIV, DEPT MED GENET, S-90185 UMEA, SWEDEN; NATL UNIV SINGAPORE, DEPT PAEDIAT, DIV GENET, SINGAPORE 117548, SINGAPORE",Umea University; National University of Singapore,,,,,,,,,27,82,84,0,3,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0001-5652,,,HUM HERED,Hum.

We identify the traditional sequential cropping systems in ten sub-Saharan African countries from a survey dataset of more than 8600 households. We find that at least one sequential cropping system is traditionally used in 35% of all administrative units in the dataset, mainly including maize or groundnuts. We compare six different management scenarios and test their susceptibility as adaptation measure to climate change using the dynamic global vegetation model for managed land LPJmL. Aggregated mean crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa decrease by 6-24% due to climate change depending on the climate scenario and the management strategy. As an exception, some traditional sequential cropping systems in Kenya and South Africa gain by at least 25%. The crop yield decrease is typically weakest in sequential cropping systems and if farmers adapt the sowing date to changing climatic conditions. Crop calorific yields in single cropping systems only reach 40-55% of crop calorific yields obtained in sequential cropping systems at the end of the 21st century. The farmers' choice of adequate crops, cropping systems and sowing dates can be an important adaptation strategy to climate change and these management options should be considered in climate change impact studies on agriculture.

However, full potential of this crop has not been realized due to the presence of a toxin, beta-N-oxalyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid (CHAP) which causes a paralytic disorder known as neurolathyrism in humans. Conventional breeding and selection methods have failed to produce varieties free of the neurotoxin. Research utilizing recombinant DNA technology and tissue culture has been initiated in the recent years to produce Lathyrus sativus plants free of neurotoxin. The progress in this area of research includes isolation and characterization of ODAP-degrading gene from pure cultures of bacteria, It offers the scope for introducing this gene into L. sativus by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, As part of the second approach, oxalyl-CoA (coenzyme A) synthetase, which is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of ODAP, has been purified and monoclonal antibodies raised against it. This can be used to construct antisense gene of this enzyme for introducing into L. sativus. Somaclones having very low toxin contents have also been developed, All these results show the potential of producing neurotoxin-free L. sativus plants in the near future.","INDIAN AGR RES INST, DIV BIOCHEM, NEW DELHI 110012, INDIA",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute,"YADAV, VK (corresponding author), RAJASTHAN AGR UNIV, SKN COLL AGR, DEPT BIOCHEM, JOBNER 30329, INDIA.",,,,,,,,45,13,14,0,2,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0011-3891,,,CURR SCI INDIA,Curr.

J,"Dolan, DA",,,,"Dolan, Dana A.",,,Multiple Partial Couplings in the Multiple Streams Framework: The Case of Extreme Weather and Climate Change Adaptation,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In this paper, I draw insights from a detailed case study of adaptation policymaking to develop a novel interpretation of John Kingdon's original work that shows how policy entrepreneurs can couple the problem, policy, and political streams through multiple partial couplings. Researchers and policymakers often assume that extreme weather opens a window to adopt policies aimed at adapting to long-term climate change. However, empirical evidence shows that crises can redirect attention to urgent, short-term goals. Using the Multiple Streams lens in an abductive case study, I investigate how these competing forces interact to influence the policy process. By unpacking Kingdon's familiar streams metaphor and elaborating his overlooked concept of partial couplings, I illustrate how the policy entrepreneurs' strategy of issue linking explains Australia's adoption of the 2007 Water Act, one of the world's first major adaptation policies, at the height of its decade-long Millennium Drought. Employing this novel theoretical understanding offers new insights into this important case. I conclude by developing tentative hypotheses for testing in future studies.","[Dolan, Dana A.] Masons Honors Coll, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",,"Dolan, DA (corresponding author), Masons Honors Coll, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",,,"Dolan, Dana/0000-0002-4851-0240",,,,,86,16,16,3,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0190-292X,1541-0072,,POLICY STUD J,Policy Stud.

In response, analysts have developed multiple robust decision frameworks to help identify investments and policies that can withstand a wide range of future states. Although these frameworks are adept at supporting decisions where uncertainty cannot be represented probabilistically, analysts necessarily choose probabilistic bounds and distributions for uncertain variables to support exploratory modeling. The implications of these assumptions on the analytical outcomes of robust decision frameworks are rarely evaluated, and little guidance exists in terms of how to select uncertain variable distributions. Here, we evaluate the impact of these choices by following the robust decision-making procedure, using four different assumptions about the probabilistic distribution of exogenous uncertainties in future climatic and economic states. We take a water reservoir system in Ethiopia as our case study, and sample climatic parameters from uniform, normal, extended uniform, and extended normal distributions; we similarly sample two economic parameters. We compute regret and satisficing robustness decision criteria for two performance measures, agricultural water demand coverage and net present value, and perform scenario discovery on the most robust reservoir alternative. We find lower robustness scores resulting from extended parameter distributions and demonstrate that parameter distributions can impact vulnerabilities identified through scenario discovery. Our results suggest that exploratory modeling within robust decision frameworks should sample from extended, uniform parameters distributions.","[Reis, Julia; Shortridge, Julie] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Shortridge, J (corresponding author), Dept Biol Syst Engn, Seitz Hall,RM 205,155 Ag Quad Lane, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",jshort-ridge@vt.edu,,"Reis, Julia/0000-0002-5357-6148; Shortridge, Julie/0000-0003-1612-5740",Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,"We thank the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) for providing the water resources data and Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model for the Lake Tana regional system.

The current body of research on infrastructure adaptation does not adequately account for the interconnectedness of infrastructures, both internally and with one another. We take a step toward addressing this gap through the introduction of a framework for infrastructure adaptation that conceptualizes infrastructures as complex socio-technical systems of systems embedded in a changing natural environment. We demonstrate the use of this framework by structuring potential climate change impacts and identifying adaptation options for a preliminary set of cases-road, electricity and drinking water infrastructures. By helping to clarify the relationships between impacts at different levels, we find that the framework facilitates the identification of key nodes in the web of possible impacts and helps in the identification of particularly nocuous weather conditions. We also explore how the framework may be applied more comprehensively to facilitate adaptation governance. We suggest that it may help to ensure that the mental models of stakeholders and the quantitative models of researchers incorporate the essential aspects of interacting climate and infrastructure systems. Further research is necessary to test the framework in these contexts and to determine when and where its application may be most beneficial.","[Bollinger, L. A.; Chappin, E. J.

This study was conducted to examine the adaptive behaviours currently being employed by A. aegypti mosquitoes exposed to the force of climate change in LAC countries. The literature on the association between climate and dengue incidence is small and sometimes speculative. Few laboratory and field studies have identified research gaps. Laboratory and field experiments were designed and conducted to better understand the container preferences, climate-associated-adaptive behaviour, ecology and the effects of different temperatures and light regimens on the life history of A. aegypti mosquitoes. A. aegypti adaptive behaviours and changes in container preferences demonstrate how complex dengue transmission dynamics is, in different ecosystems. The use of underground drains and septic tanks represents a major behaviour change identified and compounds an already difficult task to control A. aegypti populations. A business as usual approach will exacerbate the problem and lead to more frequent outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya in LAC countries unless both area-wide and targeted vector control approaches are adopted. The current evidence and the results from proposed transdisciplinary research on dengue within different ecosystems will help guide the development of new vector control strategies and foster a better understanding of climate change impacts on vector-borne disease transmission.

A gendered lens is of particular importance as women are simultaneously one of the most vulnerable social groups to climate change and carry a significant adaptation burden. Individuals' adaptive capacity is partially determined by learning and cognition, specifically one's ability to process, assess and react to a changing climate. Formal education experience is thought to increase the learning and cognitive aspects of adaptive capacity. This study uses a novel method, Participatory Adaptation Scenario and Mapping Activity (PASMA) to explore the influence formal education may have on the decision-making processes of pastoral women as they adapt to drought in Samburu, Kenya. Our results indicate participants with formal education may be more risk-averse following drought, but initially assess and react to signs of drought similarly to peers without formal education experience. We argue that increased risk perception might be explained by formal education's influence on the learning component of adaptive capacity. We also contend that formal education may fail to influence the agency of pastoral women as a result of systemic issues, and therefore limiting the potential of formal education to improve adaptive capacity.","[Walker, Sarah E.; Bruyere, Brett L.; Yasin, Apin; Lenaiyasa, Elizabeth; Lolemu, Anna] Colorado State Univ, Human Dimens Nat Resources, 1001 Amy Van Dyken Way, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Zarestky, Jill] Colorado State Univ, Sch Educ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Pickering, Tomas] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University; Colorado State University,"Walker, SE (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Human Dimens Nat Resources, 1001 Amy Van Dyken Way, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",sewalker@colostate.edu,,"Pickering, Tomas/0000-0002-1362-0749; Walker, Sarah E./0000-0003-3095-9194; Zarestky, Jill/0000-0003-1728-1796",,,,,77,4,4,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The collaborative research design featured iterative interactions involving an interdisciplinary research team and local stakeholders that produced climate science information identified by stakeholders as necessary to support adaptation to climate-induced water supply variability. This information included plausible climate scenarios to test the resiliency of the river system and models simulating hydrologic results to examine changes in water availability. In this paper, we present formative and summative evaluation data collected over the course of the project to determine the extent to which this collaborative research project met stakeholders' climate science information needs. Results indicate that over a five-year period, the project: 1) co-produced new climate science information to support local climate adaptation; 2) consistently engaged stakeholders in research that facilitated social learning to identify innovative strategies to adapt water management; 3) provided iterative interactions between stakeholders and researchers to ensure resulting information services were useful to stakeholders; 4) combined diverse, practical stakeholder knowledge with rigorous scientific research to co-produce legitimate climate science information; and 5) effectively utilized Extension as a boundary organization to design, implement, and evaluate collaborative research processes and outcomes. Further empirical work is necessary to continue testing and standardizing metrics that illuminate collaborative research successes and failures, and to identify best practices that guide future collaborations to co-produce climate science information.","[Singletary, Loretta; Sterle, Kelley] Univ Nevada, Global Water Ctr, 1072 Evans Ave, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Singletary, Loretta; Sterle, Kelley] Univ Nevada, Grad Program Hydrol Sci, 1664 North Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Singletary, Loretta; Sterle, Kelley] Univ Nevada, Extens, 1664 North Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Singletary, Loretta] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, 1664 North Virginia St,MS 0204, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Singletary, L (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, 1664 North Virginia St,MS 0204, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",singletaryl@unr.edu,,,National Science Foundation Division of Earth Sciences Water Sustainability and Climate program [1360506]; U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2014-67003-22105],National Science Foundation Division of Earth Sciences Water Sustainability and Climate program; U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Earth Sciences Water Sustainability and Climate program (award #1360506), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (award #2014-67003-22105).The authors acknowledge local Truckee-Carson River System stakeholders who contributed substantively to this study, especially the Stakeholder Affiliate Group for their consistent participation.

Specifically, drought increases resource scarcity, causing social problems that impact women, which can be described as the gendered sociocultural construction of vulnerabilities. Given this constructed dimension of gender-based vulnerability, this paper explores the effects of drought on marginalized women in one local case study, namely Badlagaree village in Gaibandha district, Bangladesh. To examine this linkage, we collected qualitative primary data using ethnographic research methods, primarily focus group discussions. Findings show that gender-based vulnerability is increasing due to growing drought effects, including agricultural production loss. Marginalized women, because of their gender identity, encounter these drought effects through unemployment, food insecurity, illiteracy, early marriage, dowry costs and violence. While further national-scale research is required, this paper argues that in order to overcome such gender-based vulnerability, current development policies, social programs, and adaptation strategies should better recognize such social dynamics. Further, a gender-specific understanding requires incorporation into adaptation policies through greater collaborative governance as an important prerequisite for sustainability.","[Hossen, M.

The paper observes that through tripartite mechanismsclimate advocacy, direct climate service provision and local empowerment, NGOs significantly play a complementary role in building local adaptive capacities, especially among people who are already living at or close to the margins of survival. The paper again found that NGOs tacitly explore four interrelated social tactics (rulemaking, alliance brokerage, resource brokerage, and framing) to gain the cooperation of local actors for the implementation of adaptation interventions. In order to improve the performance and sustainability of adaptation interventions, the paper puts forward that NGOs should, among other things, harmonize their interventions to resonate with local interest and identity and also nurture capable project caretakers before community exit.","[Musah-Surugu, Issah Justice; Bawole, Justice Nyigmah; Ahenkan, Albert] Univ Ghana, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Bawole, JN (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Accra, Ghana.",Musah123@gmail.com; jnbawole@ug.edu.gh,,,,,,,65,6,6,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0957-8765,1573-7888,,VOLUNTAS,Voluntas,APR,2019,30,2,,,,,312,326,,10.1007/s11266-018-9962-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11266-018-9962-5,,,15,Social Issues,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Issues,HY4TA,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000468119600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is a cause for concern given that 70 % of the continent's population derives its livelihoods directly from rain-fed agriculture. There is need for adaptation strategies at all levels from the national to the local level to mitigate these adverse impacts from climate change. It is important to take advantage of and strengthen already existing household and community strategies. This study used both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to explore the role that livelihood dynamics play in local-level decision-making for adaptation to everyday vulnerability. Risk is considered to extend beyond climate to non-climatic stressors, and the notion of climate change as the major shock among many others is downgraded to one that is secondary to other shocks that even pose more danger to household and community livelihoods. The natural capital remains the basis upon which all the other capitals depend as drivers of choice for adaptation practices. A reorientation of capitals and associated activities is inevitable to deal with everyday vulnerability given that livelihood capitals play a key role in adaptation. Choice of household response strategies to shocks is not entirely intrinsic, but rather integral to a context where other players such as the extension operate to influence adaptation choices. This then highlights the need for embeddedness and context in understanding adaptation and livelihood changes.","[Mubaya, Chipo Plaxedes; Mafongoya, Paramu] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Mubaya, Chipo Plaxedes] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Directorate Res & Resource Mobilizat, Private Bag 7724, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mubaya, CP (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.;Mubaya, CP (corresponding author), Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Directorate Res & Resource Mobilizat, Private Bag 7724, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe.",mubayacp@yahoo.com,,,National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa,National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),We acknowledge financial support from the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa.,,59,15,17,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Southeast Asian countries are among those most heavily affected by climate change. The number and intensity of extreme weather events in the region have been increasing markedly, causing severe social and economic damage. Southeast Asian economies are also exposed to gradual effects of global warming as well as transition risks stemming from policies aimed at mitigating climate change. To empirically examine the effect of climate change on the sovereign risk of Southeast Asian countries, we employ indices for vulnerability and resilience to climate change and estimate country-specific OLS models for six countries and a fixed effects panel using monthly data for the period 2002-2018. Both the country-specific and the panel results show that greater climate vulnerability appears to have a sizable positive effect on sovereign bond yields, while greater resilience to climate change has an offsetting effect, albeit to a lesser extent. A higher cost of debt holds back much-needed investment in public infrastructure and climate adaptation, increases the risk of debt sustainability problems, and diminishes the development prospects of Southeast Asian countries.","[Beirne, John; Renzhi, Nuobu] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Renzhi, Nuobu] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Volz, Ulrich] Univ London, SOAS, London, England; [Volz, Ulrich] German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany",Capital University of Economics & Business; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE),"Volz, U (corresponding author), Univ London, Dept Econ, SOAS, Thornhaugh St, London, England.",uv1@soas.ac.uk,"Beirne, John/GPJ-9935-2022; Renzhi, Nuobu/AEN-7210-2022","Beirne, John/0000-0003-0781-291X; Renzhi, Nuobu/0000-0002-4899-4492","International Network for Sustainable Financial Policy Insights, Research and Exchange (INSPIRE); Beyond Ratings/FTSE Russell","International Network for Sustainable Financial Policy Insights, Research and Exchange (INSPIRE); Beyond Ratings/FTSE Russell","International Network for Sustainable Financial Policy Insights, Research and Exchange (INSPIRE) and Beyond Ratings/FTSE Russell",,43,10,10,9,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0968-0802,1099-1719,,SUSTAIN DEV,Sustain.

By combining them, we obtained the regional and seasonal database of thermal comfort in China. The regional and seasonal distribution characteristics of indoor/outdoor air temperatures and of human thermal responses have been compared, establishing some relationships. In winter, the thermal environment and human thermal responses between northern and southern China were statistically different; however, they were not statistically different in summer. The seasonal differences in thermal environment and human thermal responses in each region were statistically significant. In neutral thermal environments, the neutral temperature was always close to the indoor mean temperature. In warmer (colder) environments, although the neutral temperature of the subjects was higher (or lower) than the indoor mean temperature, people could always accept their surroundings if provided with available adaptation opportunities. Overall, these findings support the climate adaptation theory and can serve as reference for the design of low-energy buildings. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In comparison, the IPCC's socio-economic assessments of climate change have accentuated the ethical implications of their own policy recommendations. Our analysis of ten IPCC reports (19902012) shows a turn from a claimed non-political position in human-induced climate change to an outspoken ethical position in climate-induced disasters. We argue that a professionalization of climate ethics is sought through ecological reason, specifically by calls for resilience to foster adaptable subjects. This neoliberal position leans on a problematization of vulnerable subjects' resistance to social adaptation, underpinned by an aim to redirect resistance towards physical disasters to stimulate climate adaptation. Conclusively, climate ethical mastery is formed by detailed elaborations of how the vulnerable subject should not only subsume to ecological reason, but also ethically embrace physical threats and dangers as if productive of life supportive qualities.

One way that farmers may adapt is by sowing their wheat earlier to avoid this terminal heat stress. However, many farmers in the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) sow their wheat later than is optimal, likely leading to yield reductions. There is limited documentation of why farmers sow their wheat late and the potential constraints to early sowing. Our study uses data from 256 farmers in Arrah, Bihar, a region in the eastern IGP with late wheat sowing, to identify the socioeconomic, biophysical, perceptional, and management factors influencing wheat-sowing-date decisions. Despite widespread awareness of climate change, we found that farmers did not adopt strategies to adapt to warming temperatures and that wheat-sowing dates were not influenced by perceptions of climate change. Instead, we found that the most important factors influencing wheat-sowing-date decisions were irrigation type and cropping decisions during the monsoon season prior to the winter wheat growing season. Specifically, we found that using canal irrigation instead of groundwater irrigation, planting rice in the monsoon season, transplanting rice, and transplanting rice later during the monsoon season were all associated with delayed wheat sowing. These results suggest that there are system constraints to sowing wheat on time, and these factors must be addressed if farmers are to adapt wheat-sowing-date decisions in the face of warming temperatures.","[Newport, Danielle; Rao, Preeti; Umashaanker, Maanya; Jain, Meha] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Balwinder-Singh; Srivastava, Amit K.; Malik, Ram K.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, New Delhi, India; [Mcdonald, Andrew] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Soil & Crop Sci Sect, Ithaca, NY USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Stanford University; Stanford University; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Cornell University,"Jain, M (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",mehajain@umich.edu,", Balwinder-Singh/F-3063-2011",", Balwinder-Singh/0000-0002-6715-2207; Lobell, David/0000-0002-5969-3476","National Science Foundation SEES Fellowship [1415436]; NASA Land Cover and Land Use Grant [NNX16AI19G]; NASA [NNX16AI19G, 902366] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",National Science Foundation SEES Fellowship; NASA Land Cover and Land Use Grant; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"We thank the CSISA-CIMMYT field team who helped conduct household surveys.

A series of large-scale experiments have been performed in the context of the European HYDRALAB-PLUS PROTEUS (Protection of offshore wind turbine monopiles against scouring) project in the Fast Flow Facility in HR Wallingford. These experiments make use of state of the art optical and acoustic measurement techniques to assess the damage of scour protections under the combined action of waves and currents. These novel PROTEUS tests focus on the study of the grading of the scour protection material as a stabilizing parameter, which has never been done under the combined action of waves and currents at a large scale. Scale effects are reduced and, thus, design risks are minimized. Moreover, the generated data will support the development of future scour protection designs and the validation of numerical models used by researchers worldwide. The testing program objectives are: (i) to compare the performance of single-layer wide-graded material used against scouring with current design practices; (ii) to verify the stability of the scour protection designs under extreme flow conditions; (iii) to provide a benchmark dataset for scour protection stability at large scale; and (iv) to investigate the scale effects on scour protection stability.","[Chavez, Carlos Emilio Arboleda; Stratigaki, Vasiliki; Wu, Minghao; Troch, Peter] Univ Ghent, Dept Civil Engn, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Schendel, Alexander; Welzel, Mario; Villanueva, Raul; Schlurmann, Torsten] Ludwig Franzius Inst Hydraul Estuarine & Coastal, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [De Vos, Leen] Flemish Govt, Dept Mobil & Publ Works, Geotech Div, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Kisacik, Dogan] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Inst Marine Sci & Technol, TR-35340 Izmir, Turkey; [Pinto, Francisco Taveira; Fazeres-Ferradosa, Tiago; Santos, Paulo Rosa] Univ Porto, CIIMAR Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Re, Fac Engn, Hydraul Water Resources & Environm Div, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; [Baelus, Leen; Szengel, Viktoria; Bolle, Annelies] Int Marine & Dredging Consultant NV, B-2018 Antwerp, Belgium; [Whitehouse, Richard; Todd, David] HR Wallingford Ltd, Howbery Pk, Wallingford OX10 8BA, Oxon, England",Ghent University; Leibniz University Hannover; Dokuz Eylul University; Universidade do Porto; HR Wallingford Limited,"Chavez, CEA (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Civil Engn, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.",carlosemilio.arboledachavez@ugent.be; vicky.stratigaki@ugent.be; minghao.wu@ugent.be; peter.troch@ugent.be; schendel@lufi.uni-hannover.de; welzel@lufi.uni-hannover.de; villanueva@lufi.uni-hannover.de; schlurmann@lufi.uni-hannover.de; leen.devos@mow.vlaanderen.be; dogan.kisacik@deu.edu.tr; fpinto@fe.up.pt; tferradosa@fe.up.pt; pjrsantos@fe.up.pt; leen.baelus@imdc.be; viktoria.szengel@imdc.be; annelies.bolle@imdc.be; r.whitehouse@hrwallingford.com; d.todd@hrwallingford.com,"Troch, Peter/L-2463-2017; Schlurmann, Torsten/AAE-8223-2019; Taveira-Pinto, Francisco/AAB-7090-2020; kisacik, dogan/S-5842-2019; Ferradosa, Tiago João Fazeres/AAC-2360-2019; Pinto, Francisco T/J-8714-2015; Stratigaki, Vasiliki/P-5942-2014; Santos, Paulo Jorge Rosa/B-5351-2019","Troch, Peter/0000-0003-3274-0874; Taveira-Pinto, Francisco/0000-0003-4337-8428; kisacik, dogan/0000-0001-5933-6770; Ferradosa, Tiago João Fazeres/0000-0002-8549-3320; Pinto, Francisco T/0000-0003-4337-8428; Stratigaki, Vasiliki/0000-0002-4898-5692; Santos, Paulo Jorge Rosa/0000-0002-3768-3314; Wu, Minghao/0000-0002-2357-7238; Schendel, Alexander/0000-0003-4938-1062; Whitehouse, Richard/0000-0002-4270-6445; Villanueva, Raul/0000-0001-8264-3824; Arboleda, Carlos/0000-0002-5316-4477; Todd, David/0000-0003-2403-6158; Schlurmann, Torsten/0000-0002-4691-7629","European Community's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program [654110]; FWO (Research Foundation-Flanders) [3G052716]; European Fund for Regional Development (FEDER), through the COMPETE2020 [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-032170]; Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI); FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC)","European Community's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program; FWO (Research Foundation-Flanders)(FWO); European Fund for Regional Development (FEDER), through the COMPETE2020; Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI); FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC)","The work described in this publication was supported by the European Community's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the grant to HYDRALAB-PLUS, Contract no. 654110.

The RISA program has sustained regional research to advance climate adaptation for 20+ years. Managed to build and sustain relationships through a network, RISA aims to foster capacity necessary for addressing complex climate and social welfare challenges. Reflecting on the design and evolution of the RISA network, we discuss three enduring design characteristics, pointing to examples of contributions to advancing practical climate risk management and adaptation, and relevance for similar networks. We offer our assessment of the utility of social learning as a way to understand the importance of these design characteristics and suggest it as a useful framing for network design and evolution.

Among 2-week old tadpoles, the southern population tolerated 32 C better than tadpoles from other populations. A parallel difference was found in Hsp70 expression, with the southern population showing the highest expression level. Nevertheless, at a highly stressful temperature (36 C) the northern population showed highest tolerance. 4. The heat shock pre-treatment increased heat tolerance of the tadpoles.

It is especially true for smallholder farmers in coastal Bangladesh, where some adaptation initiatives appeared to be short-sighted and reproduced further inequity, poverty, and food insecurity. Based on empirical insights, this paper shows how short-sighted climate responses can adversely affect gender equity, illustrated through three adaptation strategies. First, agricultural institutions have traditionally and historically linked with gender roles. Outmigration from the region is gendered as males leave first. This forces increased household and farm responsibilities onto female household members and increased vulnerability. This gendered vulnerability becomes compounded by the ways critical weather information flows at the local level. Taking this gendered lens, this paper illustrates how shrimp farming has caused long-term woes for society. These insights help in understanding the complexity of climate-society interactions and the importance of long-term planning on any climate adaptation initiatives.","[Ahmed, Saleh] Boise State Univ, Sch Publ Serv, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Eklund, Elizabeth] Univ Arizona, Sch Anthropol, Tucson, AZ USA; [Kiester, Elizabeth] Albright Coll, Sociol, Reading, PA 19612 USA",Idaho; Boise State University; University of Arizona,"Ahmed, S (corresponding author), Boise State Univ, Sch Publ Serv, Boise, ID 83725 USA.",salehahmed@boisestate.edu,,"Ahmed, Saleh/0000-0002-5064-1389",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA13OAR4310184]; U.S. Agency for International Development under the International Research and Applications Project,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); U.S. Agency for International Development under the International Research and Applications Project,This research was supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Grant NA13OAR4310184 with contributions from the U.S. Agency for International Development under the International Research and Applications Project.,,92,0,0,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

The relationship as well as the current spatial pattern and future risks of the climate change impacts on societies are summarized. The complexity of social and climatic systems leads to the spatial heterogeneity of climate impacts and risks in China.

Even when discussed, narratives around droughts emphasize implications on rural populations and there remain empirical and conceptual gaps on drought impacts in urban areas. We focus on losses and damages associated with urban drought and water insecurity through a review of interventions and policies in seven Asian countries. We find evidence of urban droughts leading to tangible losses (e.g. groundwater over-extraction, economic impacts) and intangible losses (e.g. conflict, increased drudgery). We highlight examples of Asian cities minimizing urban drought-related losses and damages through nature-based, institutional, technological, and behavioral adaptation interventions. We argue that water management policies that take into account current and projected L&D of urban droughts as well as beyond-urban dynamics of water availability and sharing are essential for effective climate adaptation.","[Singh, Chandni; Jain, Garima] Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Sukhwani, Vibhas; Shaw, Rajib] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Media & Governance, Tokyo, Japan",Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS); Keio University,"Singh, C (corresponding author), Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",csingh@iihs.ac.in,,"Jain, Garima/0000-0001-7991-4865; SUKHWANI, VIBHAS/0000-0002-5231-2722","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) , Japan","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) , Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","The authors would like to thank Amrita Chattopadhyay for her research assistance and to the guest editor and reviewers for their constructive comments.

Dominant carbon mitigation efforts resemble what Michel Callon calls civilizing markets', a deliberate harnessing of formal markets to achieve social goals by engaging with multiple political constituencies in market design. This paper looks at carbon marketization in the Democratic Republic of Congo and finds that, despite inclusive planning, climate finance experts produce unintended consequences by assigning social and environmental goals separate strategies within a national portfolio of climate finance interventions. Resulting from the challenges of finding commensurate criteria for measuring market impacts in both social and environmental domains, this programmatic segregation obscures the interconnections between poverty, forest use and climate change in the Congo. Findings suggest a need to reconcile the design of environmental-focused markets with the difficult-to-measure embedded social benefits of informal natural resource economies.","[Gray, Ian] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Box 951551, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Gray, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Box 951551, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",igray@ucla.edu,,,"Woods Hole Research Center; Public Service Fellowship from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Graduate Summer Research Mentorship from the University of California, Los Angeles","Woods Hole Research Center; Public Service Fellowship from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Graduate Summer Research Mentorship from the University of California, Los Angeles(University of California System)","Fieldwork for this project was supported by the Woods Hole Research Center and a Public Service Fellowship from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Efforts to support climate adaptation in developing countries occur within highly dynamic contexts. Macro-level changes in national and regional economies manifest in dynamic local conditions, such as migration, changing household labour dynamics, market access and land-use options. Research aimed at developing adaptation options is often focused on particular activities or industries and struggles to take into account the broader, interrelated suite of household livelihood activities or the non-climate stressors driving change and adaptation. This paper explores the use of household types to (a) understand the diversity of household circumstances and (b) place agricultural adaptation options within the broader context of household livelihoods. Results from application in four countries are discussed, which highlight the utility of the method and identify broader level trends and drivers that are common challenges (experienced differently) across multiple contexts.","[Williams, Liana J.; Roth, Christian H.] CSIRO Land & Water, EcoSci Precinct, GPO Box 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Afroz, Sharmin] Social Econ Resource Dev Inst, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Brown, Peter R.] CSIRO Agr, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Chialue, Lytoua; Sacklokham, Silinthone] Natl Univ Laos, Fac Agr, POB 7322, Xaythani Dist, Vientiane Capit, Laos; [Grunbuhel, Clemens M.] Asian Inst Technol, POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand; [Jakimow, Tanya] Univ New South Wales, Sch Social Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Khan, Iqbal] Int Dev Profess, 1011-3380 Eglinton Ave East, Toronto, ON M1J 3L6, Canada; [Minea, Mao; Soeun, Mak] Minist Agr Forestry & Fisheries, Dept Agr, 200 Norodom Blvd, Khan Chamkar Mon, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Reddy, V.

The thermal resilience of a river is likely to be affected by variables such as stream order, groundwater depth, flow predictability, water yield (precipitation minus evaporation) and catchment transformation. A database of values for these variables indicating resilience against thermal stress was developed for all sub-catchments in South Africa. Radar plots show the relative importance of the five variables potentially affecting system resilience. The resilience scores (from 0 to 1) for each variable were summed to generate a total resilience score for each sub-catchment and used to generate a map of system resilience to thermal stress for South Africa. This was extended to show hotspots in South Africa where river systems were most likely to show high resilience. These areas, in association with other criteria such as conservation value, provide an additional metric for prioritizing freshwater focal areas for restoration and conservation intervention, and identifying climate change refugia.","[Rivers-Moore, Nicholas A.; Dallas, Helen F.] Freshwater Res Ctr, Scarborough, South Africa; [Rivers-Moore, Nicholas A.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Ctr Water Resources Res, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Dallas, Helen F.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Fac Sci, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; Nelson Mandela University,"Rivers-Moore, NA (corresponding author), Freshwater Res Ctr, Scarborough, South Africa.;Rivers-Moore, NA (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Ctr Water Resources Res, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",blackfly1@vodamail.co.za,,"Dallas, Helen/0000-0001-8133-3365; Rivers-Moore, Nicholas/0000-0002-6546-4215",Water Research Commission [K5/2537],Water Research Commission,"Water Research Commission, Grant/Award Number: K5/2537",,53,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

This assumption may no longer be valid under climate change scenarios. Water availability may change dramatically at some locations due mainly to possible impacts of changes in temperature and precipitation over streamflow volume and seasonality, adding pressure to water supply systems. It has been shown that snowmelt-dominated basins are particularly sensitive to such changes. Hence, human settlements and economic activities developed in such areas are particularly vulnerable. The Maipo river basin in Central Chile - where more than 6 million people live - is one of these areas. We used a calibrated water resources model of the Maipo river basin, in order to propose a general framework to evaluate adaptation options at the urban level. When comparing a mid-21st century period to a historic control period, results for three selected performance metrics showed a decrease in water system performance. Adaptation measures were evaluated in their capacity to maintain current water security standards. Two alternatives stand as highly effective options to this end: water rights purchases and improvements in water use efficiency. The political and economic costs of implementing these options, which could deem them unviable, are not considered here but are worthy of further research.","[Bonelli, Sebastian; Vicuna, Sebastian; Meza, Francisco J.; Gironas, Jorge; Barton, Jonathan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Interdisciplinario Cambio Global UC, Santiago, Chile; [Meza, Francisco J.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Dept Ecosistemas & Med Ambiente, Santiago, Chile; [Gironas, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ingn Hidraul & Ambiental, Santiago, Chile; [Barton, Jonathan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Arquitectura Diseno & Estudios Urbanos, Inst Estudios Urbanos & Terr UC, Santiago, Chile; [Gironas, Jorge; Barton, Jonathan] CONICYT FONDAP, Ctr Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Bonelli, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Interdisciplinario Cambio Global UC, Santiago, Chile.",sjbonell@uc.cl,"Vicuna, Sebastian/M-2747-2016; Gironás, Jorge/F-8297-2013; Barton, Jonathan/E-8512-2011; Meza, Francisco J/F-9297-2014","Vicuna, Sebastian/0000-0001-6971-0068; Gironás, Jorge/0000-0002-6933-2658; Barton, Jonathan/0000-0001-6250-8684; Meza, Francisco/0000-0002-9853-227X",Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) SGP-HD [003]; US National Science Foundation [GEO-0642841]; FONDECYT [1090393]; INNOVA CORFO [09CN14-5704]; CONICYT/FONDAP [15110020]; Directorate For Geosciences [1138881] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; ICER; Directorate For Geosciences [1128040] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) SGP-HD; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); INNOVA CORFO; CONICYT/FONDAP(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDAP); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); ICER; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This work was carried out with the aid of a grant from the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) SGP-HD #003 which is supported by the US National Science Foundation (grant no.

However, coral reef communities are increasingly threatened by the adverse impacts of human activities at both global and local scales. This study aims to develop an integrated dynamic assessment framework to evaluate coral reef conditions under different adaptation and climate change scenarios, and their consequential economic impacts in the small island community of Port Resolution on Tanna Island in Vanuatu. Our assessment framework follows a sequential multilayered modelling approach that uses System Dynamics (SD) coupled with Bayesian Network (BN) modelling to deal with the complexity and dynamicity of socioeconomic and environmental systems, and impacts from trans-discipline variables. The BN incorporated existing data and expert knowledge to project the future conditions of coral reefs under different scenario settings, and to parametrise and quantify the SD model where the existing data and information was insufficient. The SD was then used to simulate the dynamic relationship between coral reef condition and the economic benefits derived from its ecosystem services under different climate change (i.e. RCPs) and management scenarios through to 2070. Our findings show that sustainable community-based conservation management strategies are key to preserving the flow of coral reef ecosystem services under RCP 2.6 and 6.0. Importantly, we demonstrate that the implementation of an integrated portfolio of management strategies better protects ecosystem services provided by coral reefs and maximises the total economic benefits achieved over the longterm despite a temporary and short-term economic loss due to high initial capital investments and income reduction due to fishing and tourism restrictions.","[Hafezi, Mehdi; Stewart, Rodney A.; Sahin, Oz] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Hafezi, Mehdi; Stewart, Rodney A.; Sahin, Oz] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Sahin, Oz] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Giffin, Alyssa L.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Sch Sci & Environm, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Act Beacon, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Stewart, RA (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.",r.stewart@griffith.edu.au; o.sahin@griffith.edu.au; alyssa.giffin@griffithuni.edu.au; b.mackey@griffith.edu.au,"Sahin, Oz/HLG-7805-2023; Jorge, Crisaldo/GNP-4575-2022; Stewart, Rodney/H-5561-2018","Sahin, Oz/0000-0002-1914-5379; Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064; Stewart, Rodney/0000-0002-6013-3505",Port Resolution community; Australian government,Port Resolution community; Australian government(Australian Government),"This research project was undertaken as part of the Griffith University Climate Change Response EcoAdapt Project which operates in Vanuatu and Tanna Island under a memorandum of understanding with the Tafea Provincial Government whereby Griffith undertakes research and capacity building to support the Provincial Government's and local communiauthors are grateful for the support of the Port Resolution community and Tanna Council of Chiefs, and Alan Dan for his key role as project community liaisons and Kastom ties sustainable development planning, and a permit from the Vanuatu Cultural Centre dated 17 May 2018.

Most previous studies focused on optimization problems of infrastructure adaptation for climate change in a single urban district, but multiple key variables of an adaptation plan-investment target, amount, and timing-should be developed simultaneously for interconnected urban districts. Thus, there is a knowledge gap regarding optimization for infrastructure adaptation in interconnected urban districts. This study suggests a model for establishing an infrastructure adaptation plan in urban areas under various climate change scenarios using an optimization method. The proposed model derives the infrastructure investment plan, which includes the key decision variables of investment amount, location, and timing. The model was applied to derive an investment plan for a sewer system covering the 25 administrative districts in Seoul under six future scenarios.

Several studies have proposed early planting, increased irrigation, and increased fertilizer applications as climate adaptation strategies, yet none have considered combined and site-specific field management strategies as a comprehensive solution. Here, we analyzed non-irrigated wheat yield responses to climate change and field management adaptation using a mechanistic crop model evaluated against observed global non-irrigated wheat-yield over 3-year intervals spanning 13 years at 3749 sites (RMSE = 36 gC m-2). Early planting with later-maturing varieties provided the most benefit to future yields among the proposed field management adaptation strategies. Improved water use efficiency from increased CO2 led to relatively low benefits of additional irrigation. We estimated that spatially heterogeneous adaption strategies had the potential to improve global wheat yields by 91% by 2100 compared to the present day. The yield improvements from combined field adaptation strategies were larger than the sum of improvements from the individual strategies. These synergistic benefits were shown to result from complementary processes regulating nutrient and water uptake, physiological tolerance to heat stress, and internal carbon and nutrient cycling.","[Woo, Dong Kook] Keimyung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Daegu 42601, South Korea; [Riley, William J.; Wu, Yuxin] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Grant, Robert F.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Keimyung University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Alberta,"Woo, DK (corresponding author), Keimyung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Daegu 42601, South Korea.",dkwoo@kmu.ac.kr,"Woo, Dong Kook/F-8784-2014","Woo, Dong Kook/0000-0003-1807-3606",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [2021R1C1C1004801]; Reducing Uncertainties in Biogeochemical Interactions through Synthesis and Computation (RUBISCO) Scientific Focus Area - Earth and Environmental Systems Modeling (EESM) Program under the Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Departme [16/CJ000/04/08]; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231],"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Reducing Uncertainties in Biogeochemical Interactions through Synthesis and Computation (RUBISCO) Scientific Focus Area - Earth and Environmental Systems Modeling (EESM) Program under the Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Departme; U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The model and parameters used in this study are available at an online repository (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.4489946) .

China is a country that crosses diverse geomorphic and climatic regions in the world and is frequently affected by various climate hazards. In this study, we propose a comprehensive analysis on the spatial pattern of major climate hazards in China from 1991 to 2020, including rainstorms, droughts, heatwaves, coldwaves, typhoons, and snowstorms, and generate an integrated sketch map on multi-hazard zones. It is detectable that South of the Yangtze River is in danger of heatwaves, rainstorms, and typhoons, while the North China Plain is more likely to suffer droughts. Coldwaves, snowstorms, and freezing mainly affect Northeast China, Northwest China, and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In the view of climate governance, cities are hotspots affected by intensified climate hazards in a warmer climate. There is an urgent need to incorporate a climate adaptation strategy into future city construction, so as to improve social resilience and mitigate climate impacts in rapid urbanization process. Specific adaptation measures have been developed from the perspectives of land-use planning, prevention standard, risk assessment, and emergency response to facilitate the understanding of climate resilience and urban sustainability.","[Sun, Shao; Wang, Zunya; Hu, Chuanye; Gao, Ge] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration,"Wang, ZY; Hu, CY (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",wangzy@cma.gov.cn; hucy@cma.gov.cn,,"hu, chuanye/0000-0002-5698-6118; SUN, Shao/0000-0003-3411-5466","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1509003, 2019YFC1510202]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701103]; Major Research and Development Program of China Railway Group [P2018T006]; UK-China Cooperation on Climate Change Risk Assessment",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Research and Development Program of China Railway Group; UK-China Cooperation on Climate Change Risk Assessment,"This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFC1509003 and 2019YFC1510202), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41701103), the Major Research and Development Program of China Railway Group (P2018T006), and the UK-China Cooperation on Climate Change Risk Assessment.",,63,3,3,13,35,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2021,13,24,,,,,,,13886,10.3390/su132413886,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132413886,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XZ1WH,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000737450000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a consequence, the growing outdoor environmental temperatures entail a slight reduction in heating consumption and an increase in cooling consumption, with different overall effects depending on the latitudes. This document focuses attention on the Italian residential sector, considering the current and reduced meteorological data, in anticipation of future climate scenarios. According to a sample of 419 buildings, referring to the climatic conditions of Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples, the heating and cooling needs are calculated by a simplified dynamic model, in current and future conditions. The effects of the simplest climate adaptation measure, represented by the introduction of new air conditioners, have been also evaluated. The simulations results show an important reduction in complex energy consumption (Milan -6%, Florence -22%, Rome -25%, Naples -30%), due to the greater incidence of heating demand in the Italian context. However, the increase in air conditioning electrical consumption over the hot season (Milan +11%, Florence +20%, Rome +19%, Naples +16%) can play a critical role for the electrical system; for that reason, the introduction of photovoltaic arrays as a compensatory measure have been analysed.","[Mancini, Francesco] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Planning Design & Technol Architecture, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Lo Basso, Gianluigi] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Astronaut, Elect Energy Engn, I-00184 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Sapienza University Rome,"Mancini, F (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Planning Design & Technol Architecture, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",francesco.mancini@uniroma1.it; gianluigi.lobasso@uniroma1.it,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Mancini, Francesco/AAS-9593-2020","Mancini, Francesco/0000-0001-9262-6040; Lo Basso, Gianluigi/0000-0002-8947-2164","ENEA-DTE-SEN-SCC (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development-Department of Energy Technologies-Smart Energy Division); CITERA (Sapienza University of Rome-Interdepartmental Research Center for Territory, Construction, Restoration and Environment)","ENEA-DTE-SEN-SCC (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development-Department of Energy Technologies-Smart Energy Division); CITERA (Sapienza University of Rome-Interdepartmental Research Center for Territory, Construction, Restoration and Environment)","This work is a part of a wider research activity dealing with: Study of an aggregator model for a smart district.

As adaptation moves from theory to implementation, there is a need for positive case studies to use as benchmarks. Building from literature on actionable science this paper presents one such positive case-the development of a hydropower and reservoir decision-support tool. The focus of this history is on the multiple phases of interaction (and noninteraction) between researchers and a semidefined community of stakeholders. The lessons presented from the Integrated Forecast and Reservoir Management (INFORM) system project stress that collaborations between managers and researchers were crucial to the success of the project by building knowledge networks, which could outlast formal processes, and by incorporating policy preferences of end users into the model. The history also provides examples of how even successful collaborative projects do not always follow the usual expectations for coproduced science and shows that, even when those guidelines are followed, external circumstances can threaten the adoption of research products. Ultimately, this paper argues for the importance of building strong knowledge networks alongside more formal processes-like those in boundary organizations-for effective collaborative engagement.","[Ziaja, S.] Calif Publ Util Commiss, Climate Initiat Sect, Publ Advocates Off, San Francisco, CA 94102 USA",,"Ziaja, S (corresponding author), Calif Publ Util Commiss, Climate Initiat Sect, Publ Advocates Off, San Francisco, CA 94102 USA.",s.ziaja@wolfson.oxon.org,,"Ziaja, Sonya/0000-0002-0309-3199",,,,,156,5,5,0,16,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1948-8327,1948-8335,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

The aim of this paper is to find out how different policy experts envision the climate change-human migration nexus. The Netherlands has been nominated as the seat of a Global Center of Excellence for climate Adaptation and aims to become a Global Center of Excellence in the water safety and security domain. Policy experts were selected based on a structured nominee process. We conducted semistructured interviews with policy experts and analyzed policy expert documentation. Interview transcripts and documents were examined via a coding frame. Unlike policymakers who link climate change and conflict, policy experts stress the economic and political factors of migration in which climate change issues happen. The major difference between the view of policymakers and policy experts on the link between climate change and human migration emerges from the frame of the climate refugee. In the context of the climate change-human migration nexus, policy experts act as a countervailing power that prevents the political exploitation of the nexus into a security issue.","[Ebrahimi, Sanaz Honarmand; Ossewaarde, Marinus] Univ Twente, Dept Publ Adm, Fac Behav Management & Social Sci BMS, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Ebrahimi, S (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Publ Adm, Fac Behav Management & Social Sci BMS, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands.",s.honarmandebrahimi@alumnus.utwente.nl,,"Honarmand Ebrahimi, Sanaz/0000-0003-3769-6438; Ossewaarde, Marinus/0000-0003-3449-1074",,,,,89,2,2,4,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0760,,SOC SCI-BASEL,Soc.

In this paper, I present the results of an advanced discourse analysis that analyses trends in the relationship between conflict and climate change. I present two primary discourses dominate discussion: (i) climate as a security risk and (ii) climate as one of many factors affecting power relations that may lead to conflict. Both narratives implicitly or explicitly discuss climate conflict as a cause-outcome relationship, and further primarily construct conflict and climate change within normative frames. Yet, conflict has transformative potential and can be incorporated into management in ways that harness its capacity to drive innovation and lead to more robust and just adaptive governance. I argue for a shift in the discursive frame from a cause-outcome-oriented approach to a process-driven approach, one that treats conflict as an integral part of adaptive governance processes, thus being more just and equitable. Such a shift in focus can lead to positive on ground climate adaptation outcomes, in ways that respect rather than are counterintuitive to dominant political and societal imbalances and institutional structures.","[Nursey-Bray, Melissa] Univ Adelaide, Geog Environm & Populat, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Nursey-Bray, M (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Geog Environm & Populat, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",melissa.nursey-bray@adelaide.edu.au,"Nursey-Bray, Melissa/J-8183-2019","Nursey-Bray, Melissa/0000-0002-4121-5177","Faculty of Arts, University of Adelaide","Faculty of Arts, University of Adelaide","Thank you to my colleagues in the department of Geography, Environment and Population who critiqued this article when I gave it as a paper and thus strengthened it as a text.

Climate change is projected to significantly alter rainfall patterns, with implications for the annual runoff for the Godavari River basin of the Indian subcontinent. Agriculture, especially rain-fed agriculture, will be particularly affected, due to changes such as periodicity and intensity of rainfall. This paper describes field interventions in 2005-2007 designed to restore traditional water management systems (in the form of water tanks; that is, wetlands embedded in a semi-arid region), with the aim of mitigating the effects of increased climate variability and the frequency of weather extremes. Our findings suggest that traditional water management methods can be both socially and economically effective in coping with variability in precipitation patterns, decentralizing management institutions, improving crop productivity and increasing groundwater recharge. This approach is preferable to large projects for increasing water storage capacity or expanding areas under irrigation, which are expensive, and can displace people and degrade ecosystems.","[Dalai, Sraban; Goud, Vinod] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, WWF Int Project, Patancheru, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Gujja, Biksham] WWF Int, Global Freshwater Programme, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland",CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); World Wildlife Fund,"Goud, V (corresponding author), Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, WWF Int Project, Patancheru, Andhra Pradesh, India.",v.goud@cgiar.org,,,,,,,25,9,9,2,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Existing methods to forecast resource demand and capacity do not consider this phenomenon of a global change affecting many localities and the resulting increased demand for resources. Current methods do not relate to the most up-to-date climate science information, and they are too costly or too imprecise to generate global, regional, and local forecasts of climate-critical resources that will be required for infrastructure protection. They either require too much effort to create the many localized designs or are too coarse to consider information sources about local conditions and structure-specific engineering knowledge. We formalized the concept of a minimum assumption credible design (MACD) to leverage available local information (topography/bathymetry and existing infrastructure) and the essential engineering knowledge and required construction materials (i.e., a design cross-section template). The aggregation of the resources required for individual local structures then forecasts the resource demand for global adaptation projects. We illustrate the application of the MACD method to estimate the demand for construction materials critical to protect seaports from sea level -rise-enhanced storm surges. We examined 221 of the world's 3,300+ seaports to calculate the resource requirements for a coastal storm surge protection structure suited to current upper-bound projections of two meters of sea level rise by 2100. We found that a project of this scale would require approximately similar to 49 million cubic meters of construction materials, including cement, sand, aggregate, steel rebar, and riprap. For cement alone, 49 million metric tons would be required. The deployment of the MACD method would make resource forecasts for adaptation projects more transparent and widely accessible and would highlight areas where current engineering knowledge or material, engineering workforce, and equipment capacity fall short of meeting the demands of adaptation projects.

Analysis of historical data revealed that the region is experiencing climate change to a degree higher than generally reported elsewhere. The relationship between climate change and its effect on water resources of a region has been sparsely addressed in published literature. To fill that gap this research work first investigates if there has been a significant change in climate in the region, which has been found to be true. In the next stage, the research projects future climatic scenarios of the region based on six oft-used General Circulation Model (GCM) ensembles, namely CCSM4, CSIRO-Mk3.6.0, GFDL-ESM2M, MEROC5, HadGEM2-ES, and IPSL-CM5A-LR. The relationship between climate change and its impact on water resources is explored through the application of the popular, widely used SWAT model. The model depicts the availability of water resources, classified separately as blue and green waters, for near and distant futures for the region. Some of the findings are foreboding and warrants urgent attention of planners and decision makers. According to model outputs, the region may experience precipitation reduction of about 12.6% and 21% in near (2049-2069) and distant (2080-2099) futures, respectively under RCP8.5. Those figures under RCP4.5 are 15% and 23.4%, respectively and under RCP2.6 are 12.2% and 18.4%, respectively. As a consequence, the blue water may experience decreases of about 22.6% and 40% under RCP8.5, 25.8% and 46% under RCP4.5, and 34.4% and 31% under RCP2.6 during the periods 2049-2069 and 2080-2099, respectively. Green water, by contrast, may reduce by about 10.6% and 19.6% under RCP8.5, by about 14.8% and 19.4% under RCP4.5, and by about 15.8% and 14.2% under RCP2.6 during the periods 2049-2069 and 2080-2099, respectively.

In this paper we reflect on knowledge practices among a partnership of researchers and NRM planners, under a federal program of NRM investment intended to 'deliver information' to regional NRM planners to support planning for climate change. We unpack 'container' and 'conduit' metaphors of linear, one-way communication invoked by the starting conditions, and explore whether more relational ways of communicating were achieved. A key theme emerged early in the research that NRM planners felt overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information available and discouraged by the irrelevance of much of it to their climate change planning. Our research-practice collaboration unfolded in this context and through ongoing face-to-face and virtual engagement over a period of two years. The collaborative approach featured joint identification of priority activities, co-design of planning approaches, and the iterative co-development of an online 'information portal', which acted as a boundary object. We report the emergence of a 'knowing system', resulting from these efforts to foster relationships and co-produce boundary objects in a particular geographic context. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of investing in the capacity of researchers and NRM practitioners to engage in collaborative research partnerships premised on the emergence of knowing systems.","[Wallis, Philip J.] Monash Univ, Monash Sustainabil Inst, 8 Scen Blvd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Bosomworth, Karyn] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Harwood, Andrew] Univ Tasmania, Sch Land & Food, Geog & Spatial Sci, Private Bag 78, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Leith, Peat] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Private Bag 98, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",Monash University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Wallis, PJ (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Monash Sustainabil Inst, 8 Scen Blvd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",Philip.J.Wallis@gmail.com; Karyn.Bosomworth@rmit.edu.au; Andrew.Harwood@utas.edu.au; Peat.Leith@utas.edu.au,"Leith, Peat/ABB-2829-2021; Bosomworth, Karyn/A-6435-2016; Harwood, Andrew/C-2388-2014","Bosomworth, Karyn/0000-0001-9907-0858; Harwood, Andrew/0000-0003-4562-2906",Australian Government through the Regional Natural Resource Management Planning for Climate Change Fund,Australian Government through the Regional Natural Resource Management Planning for Climate Change Fund,"We acknowledge all of the NRM planners who were enthusiastic participants in the action research, and their colleagues who contributed to focus group interviews.

However, the discussion of 'climate policy integration' has tended to focus on mitigation decisions mostly taken at international and national levels. Clearly, there is also a more locally focused adaptation dimension to climate policy integration, which has not been adequately explored by academics or policy makers. Drawing on a case study of the UK, this paper adopts both a top-down and a bottom-up perspective to explore how far different sub-elements of policies within the agriculture, nature conservation and water sectors support or undermine potential adaptive responses. The top-down approach, which assumes that policies set explicit aims and objectives that are directly translated into action on the ground, combines a content analysis of policy documents with interviews with policy makers. The bottom-up approach recognises the importance of other actors in shaping policy implementation and involves interviews with actors in organisations within the three sectors. This paper reveals that neither approach offers a complete picture of the potentially enabling or constraining effects of different policies on future adaptive planning, but together they offer new perspectives on climate policy integration. These findings inform a discussion on how to implement climate policy integration, including auditing existing policies and 'climate proofing' new ones so they support rather than hinder adaptive planning.

There is sharp imbalance in investments in mitigation and adaptation, with the latter attracting barely 5% of the allocated funds. Adaptation is limited not only by restricted access to money and technology, but also by endogenous causes related to willingness to invest in the future, and attitude to risk taking and integration of technology. Models based on paleoecological evidence of early Holocene floral migration can be used for initiating intelligent adaptive actions. Developed countries should concentrate on transformational changes using the latest technologies through their mitigation efforts, rather than crowd out the developing countries from low-cost and low-technology mitigation opportunities in the forestry sector. Confluence of adaptation with mitigation in tropical forests is a challenge yet a possibility, and the UNFCCC mechanisms should actively encourage this overlap.","[Kant, Promode] Inst Green Econ, New Delhi 110024, India; [Wu, Shuirong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Policy & Informat, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Forestry,"Kant, P (corresponding author), Inst Green Econ, New Delhi 110024, India.",promode.kant@gmail.com,"Wu, Shuirong/GSD-9778-2022","Wu, Shuirong/0000-0001-8188-9646",,,,,25,7,8,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1758-3004,1758-3012,,CARBON MANAG,Carbon Manag.,JUN,2012,3,3,,,,,303,311,,10.4155/CMT.12.29,http://dx.doi.org/10.4155/CMT.12.29,,,9,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,094BP,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000315238300015,View Full Record in Web of Science

This roadmap is based upon sectoral adaptation strategies. As the first step in the development of the roadmap, framing scenarios for the external driving forces were built. These scenarios both incorporate the different regional climate projections in consistent regional developments and capture the most relevant socio-economic uncertainties from the sectors involved. The main difficulty in building the scenarios was the cross-sectoral integration of the different perspectives from the various sectors, which is necessary to be able to integrate the sectoral adaptation strategies in the regional roadmap. Therefore we built the framing scenarios with strong participation of stakeholders from all the sectors. We present the methodology used to build the scenarios and discuss the insights we drew from the process. Our findings support the thesis that it is important to integrate the stakeholders in the building of the scenarios to achieve acceptance and enable learning.

Current on-farm yields in this region are low and are expected to decrease in response to climate change, through warming and shifts in rainfall. Interventions intended to improve yields and climate adaptation require an understanding of the main drivers of yields across farms. OBJECTIVE: In this regard, we quantified the extent to which environmental (i.e., climate and soil) conditions drive cocoa yields and how this differs for farms achieving on average low- and high mean production levels based on an unprecedented dataset of 3827 cocoa farms spanning the environmental gradients of Ghana. We further quantified the relative importance of management practices based on a subset of 134 farms for which management information was available. METHODS: We modelled on-farm annual cocoa yield as a function of environmental variables for the large dataset and cocoa yield per tree as a function of environmental and management variables for the subset farms using mixed-effects models. Differences in effects on yield between farms with low and high mean production levels were evaluated using quantile mixed-effects models. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable variability in yields across farms, ranging from similar to 100 to >1000 kg ha(-1) (mean = 554 kg ha(-1)). Mixed-effects models showed that the fixed effects (i.e., environmental variables) only explained 7% of the variability in yields whilst fixed and random effects together explained 80%, suggesting that farm-to-farm variation played a large role. Explained variation in cocoa yields per tree of 134 farms in the subset increased from 10% to 25% when including management variables in addition to environmental variables. In both models, climate-related factors had a larger effect on yields than edaphic factors, with radiation of the main dry season and that of the previous year having the strongest effects on on-farm- and tree yields, respectively. The quantile regression analyses showed that productivity in high-yielding farms (90th percentile) was more strongly driven by environmental factors than in low-yielding farms (10th percentile). In conclusion, agronomic management is the dominant determinant of on-farm cocoa yields in Ghana, more so than environmental conditions. Furthermore, high-yielding cocoa farms are more sensitive to environmental conditions than low-yielding ones. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggests that good agricultural practices need to be in place before investing in additional climate adaptation practices.","[Asante, Paulina A.; Rozendaal, Danae M.

The required investments in urban adaptation are inherently expensive, uncertain and long-term. These factors pose significant challenges for both effective choice and collective action. This paper argues that metropolitan 'resilience districts' offer the appropriate decision-making unit (DMU) to analyze, plan and implement resilience strategies. The working concept of 'resilience districts' for urban areas vulnerable to coastal flooding was first coined by a design team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology spurred by a case study on the New Jersey Meadowlands from the 'Rebuild By Design' (RBD) competition. Cities have since begun using this term for their own resilience policies, failing to recognize the original intentions of its meaning. This analysis details a resilience districting strategy for the Greater Boston Metropolitan Area. The research culminates with a generalizable urban planning and design framework for protecting critical infrastructure, 'thickening' regional soft systems and transferring density to less vulnerable areas.

In California, high commodity prices and increased frequency of drought have encouraged orchard turnover, providing an opportunity to recycle tree biomass in situ prior to replanting an orchard. Whole orchard recycling (WOR) has potential as a carbon (C) negative cultural practice to build soil C storage, soil health, and orchard productivity. We tested the potential of this practice for long term C sequestration and hypothesized that associated co-benefits to soil health will enhance sustainability and resiliency of almond orchards to water-deficit conditions. We measured soil health metrics and productivity of an almond orchard following grinding and incorporation of woody biomass vs. burning of old orchard biomass 9 years after implementation. We also conducted a deficit irrigation trial with control and deficit irrigation (-20%) treatments to quantify shifts in tree water status and resilience. Biomass recycling led to higher yields and substantial improvement in soil functioning, including nutrient content, aggregation, porosity, and water retention. This practice also sequestered significantly higher levels of C in the topsoil (+5 t ha(-1)) compared to burning. We measured a 20% increase in irrigation water use efficiency and improved soil and tree water status under stress, suggesting that in situ biomass recycling can be considered as a climate smart practice in California irrigated almond systems.","[Jahanzad, Emad; Brewer, Kelsey M.; Gaudin, Amelie C.

Climate adaption and resilience will need to involve restoring the decimated natural ecosystem and integration of indigenous systems in the study area and similar low-income coastal urban communities.","[Adegun, Olumuyiwa Bayode] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Architecture, Akure, Nigeria; [Adegun, Olumuyiwa Bayode] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Architecture & Planning, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Adegun, OB (corresponding author), Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Architecture, Akure, Nigeria.",muyiwaadegun@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,39,0,0,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1946-3138,1946-3146,,INT J URBAN SUSTAIN,Int.

A database of near zero energy buildings was established and tailored data-mining programs were developed to collect data. Statistical test, data distribution visualization, and correlation analysis were implemented using customized statistical metrics programs to reveal the trends, preferences and potentials of the design strategies summarized as follows: (1) Climate-adaptable design of exterior form was paid more attention to than envelope system, and the design optimization focused on the adjustment of building shape coefficients. (2) The humidity and average high temperature were the most influential factors. (3) The design strategy of envelope system focused on adapting to cold climates, while hot climates were little considered. (4) For EEBs in China, correlations between the CPs and BPs were higher than buildings in the other countries. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

HIPERPAV (R) software and the associated models developed by the U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) were used to identify cracking potential. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of different levels of air temperature, mix temperature, base layer temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity. Additionally, projected extreme temperatures predicted by the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CanRCM) were used to determine the relative impact of climate change on cracking risk. The results demonstrated the increased cracking risk under changing climate in several Canadian cities by mid-century and highlighted the importance of developing a pathway forward for climate adaptation.","[Shafiee, Mohammad; Maadani, Omran] Natl Res Council Canada, Construct Res Ctr, Bldg M-20,1200 Montreal Rd, Montreal, ON K1A 0R6, Canada",National Research Council Canada,"Shafiee, M (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Canada, Construct Res Ctr, Bldg M-20,1200 Montreal Rd, Montreal, ON K1A 0R6, Canada.",Mohammad.Shafiee@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca,,,Climate Resilient Building-Core Public Infrastructure (CRBCPI) initiative,Climate Resilient Building-Core Public Infrastructure (CRBCPI) initiative,"The authors would like to extend their appreciation and gratitude to the Climate Resilient Building-Core Public Infrastructure (CRBCPI) initiative for the financial support and inspiration.

Whether these changes will undermine national-level food security depends upon the ability of the small-scale farmers that dominate rice production and the institutions that support them to overcome the challenges presented by changing water availability. Analyzing household survey data, this research identifies household, institutional, and agroecological factors that influence how water-stressed farmers are working to adapt to changing conditions and how the strategies they employ impact rice yields. Paralleling studies conducted elsewhere, we identified institutional factors as particularly relevant in farmer adaptation decisions. Notably, our research identified farmers' use of hybrid seed varietals as the only local climate adaptation strategy to positively correlate with farmers' rice yields. These findings provide insight into additional factors pertinent to successful agricultural adaptation and offer encouraging evidence for policies that promote plant breeding and distribution in Sri Lanka as a means to buffer the food system to climate change-exacerbated drought.","[Williams, Nicholas E.; Carrico, Amanda] Univ Colorado Boulder, Environm Studies Program, 397 UCB, Boulder, CO 90309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Williams, NE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Boulder, Environm Studies Program, 397 UCB, Boulder, CO 90309 USA.",nicholas.e.williams@colorado.edu; amanda.carrico@colorado.edu,,"Carrico, Amanda/0000-0001-8571-8238",National Science Foundation [EAR-1204685]; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Earth Sciences [1204685] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Earth Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Support for this project was provided by a Grant from the National Science Foundation (EAR-1204685).

Previous research indicates that experiencing extreme weather events has the potential to heighten engagement with climate change, however the process by which this occurs remains largely unknown, and establishing a clear causal relationship from experience to perceptions is methodologically challenging. The UK winter flooding offered a natural experiment to examine this question in detail. We compare individuals personally affected by flooding (n = 162) to a nationally representative sample (n = 975). We show that direct experience of flooding leads to an overall increased salience of climate change, pronounced emotional responses and greater perceived personal vulnerability and risk perceptions. We also present the first evidence that direct flooding experience can give rise to behavioural intentions beyond individual sustainability actions, including support for mitigation policies, and personal climate adaptation in matters unrelated to the direct experience.","[Demski, Christina; Capstick, Stuart; Pidgeon, Nick; Sposato, Robert Gennaro] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Understanding Risk Res Grp, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; [Spence, Alexa] Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Horizon Digital Econ Res, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England",Cardiff University; University of Nottingham,"Demski, C (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Understanding Risk Res Grp, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.",DemskiCC@cardiff.ac.uk,"; Capstick, Stuart/E-8622-2010; Demski, Christina/H-3746-2015","Sposato, Robert/0000-0001-7724-5653; Capstick, Stuart/0000-0002-1934-4503; Demski, Christina/0000-0002-9215-452X",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M005135/1]; Climate Change Consortium of Wales (C3W); Cardiff Sustainable Places Research Institute; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M005135/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M005135/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Climate Change Consortium of Wales (C3W); Cardiff Sustainable Places Research Institute; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was supported by a research grant from the Economic and Social Research Council (ES/M005135/1) as well as the Climate Change Consortium of Wales (C3W) and the Cardiff Sustainable Places Research Institute.

Our paper seeks to demonstrate how we, as guests on Maori land, were able to develop a partnership with a Maori community facing difficult adaptation decisions regarding climate change hazards through the pragmatic navigation of multi-disciplinary research and practice. In particular, we co-developed and tested the potential of a serious game (Marae-opoly) approach as a platform which assembles cross-cultural climate change knowledge to learn, safely experiment and inform adaptation decisions. Marae-opoly was developed bespoke to its intended context-to support the creation of mutually agreeable dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP) for localized flood adaptation. Game material was generated by drawing together detailed local knowledge (i.e. hydrology, climate data, matauranga hapu) and situated adaptation options and accurate contextual data to create a credible gaming experience for the hapu of Tangoio Marae. We argue that the in-situ co-development process used to co-create Marae-opoly was fundamental in its success in achieving outcomes for the hapu. It also provided important lessons for the research team regarding how to enter as respectful guests and work together effectively to provide a resource to support our partners' adaptation decisions. The paper discusses the steps taken to establish research partnerships and develop the serious game and its subsequent playing, albeit we do not evaluate our indigenous research partners' adaptation decisions. Our contribution with this paper is in sharing an approach which cultivated the ground to enter as respectful guests and work together effectively to provide a resource for our partners' adaptation decisions.","[Blackett, Paula; FitzHerbert, Stephen; Luttrell, Jordan; Colliar, Jackie] Natl Inst Water & Atmosphere Res NIWA, POB 11115, Hamilton 3251, New Zealand; [Hopmans, Tania; Lawrence, Hayley] Maungaharuru Tangitu Trust, Napier, New Zealand; [Colliar, Jackie] Hamilton City Council, Hamilton, New Zealand",,"Blackett, P (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmosphere Res NIWA, POB 11115, Hamilton 3251, New Zealand.",paula.blackett@niwa.co.nz,,,Deep South National Science Challenge [DEPSV16201],Deep South National Science Challenge,"To the esteemed ones, the leaders of Tangoio Marae, the Maungaharuru-Tangitu Trust (Ngati Marangatuhetaua, Ngati Whakaari, Ngai Tauira, Ngati Kurumokihi, Ngai Te Ruruku ki Tangoio me Ngai Tahu), to the Doohan family, the Hawkes Bay Regional Council.

In this short discussion piece, I re-stage the Latour-Beck debate as part of on-going inquiries into the morethan-human politics of climate adaptation in Copenhagen, exploring what exact senses of 'cosmos' might be helpful in making sense of this increasingly common-place situation. At issue, I suggest, is the question of what it means to say that `natures', in the plural, are put at stake in such settings. Far from any synthesis, in turn, I conclude that scholars in STS and beyond might do well to extend a shared hesitation towards both sides of the debate - cosmopolitics, cosmopolitanism - and thus take the opportunity to share unresolved conceptual tensions in the service of posing better problems.","[Blok, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Blok, A (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, Copenhagen, Denmark.",abl@soc.ku.dk,,"Blok, Anders/0000-0002-3403-698X",,,,,25,0,0,1,1,FINNISH SOC SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY STUDIES,TAMPERE,"C/O OTTO AURANEN, SEPANKATU 4-8, TAMPERE, 33230, FINLAND",2243-4690,,,SCI TECHNOL STUD,Sci.

Many adaptation strategies implemented in coastal areas remain inadequate or ineffective. Using primarily events and interventions carried out along the Portuguese Atlantic coast, this work aims to show the paradigm shift that has occurred in Portugal since the last century (the 1990s) within the scope of the National Coastal Zone Management Strategy, taking into account the new guidelines for the implementation of coastal defence works. In this context, this paper also aims to assist coastal communities in carrying out operational coastal management by presenting and discussing management tools and primary options that should be considered in any adaptation programme that is to be implemented. Both nonstructural and structural measures are considered. Action plans, warning systems, emergency plans, and evacuation plans belong to the first category. Education and training are also considered, because they play a key role in the sustainability of coastal areas, especially in the coming generations. Structural measures are adaptation options that are designed to increase the safety of people and reduce risks. They are discussed and grouped into categories that include accommodation, protection, and retreat. Recent cases of successful accommodation and protection measures implemented along the Portuguese coast are also presented and discussed.","[Antunes do Carmo, Jose Simao] Univ Coimbra, FCTUC, Dept Civil Engn, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"do Carmo, JSA (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, FCTUC, Dept Civil Engn, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal.",jsacarmo@dec.uc.pt,"do Carmo, José Simão Antunes/H-6296-2019","do Carmo, José Simão Antunes/0000-0002-5527-3116",,,,,68,5,5,1,24,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,COCONUT CREEK,"5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA",0749-0208,1551-5036,,J COASTAL RES,J.

The mean streamflow increased after 1994 (AMO phase change). This increase is related to the strengthening of the zonal gradients of the sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) between the tropical central Pacific and the tropical Atlantic after 1994 (warm AMO phase). These gradients contributed to strengthen the Walker cell related upward movement over northern and northwestern South America, in particular during November-December (ND). Consistently, the frequency (R20 mm) and intensity (SDII) of extreme daily rainfall events increased during the 1995-2015 period. Our results show a connection between the AMO and the increase in the streamflow in the ARB during the last five decades. These results contribute to the studies of resilience and climate adaptation in the region.","[Loaiza Ceron, Wilmar] Univ Valle, Fac Humanities, Dept Geog, Calle 13 100-00, Cali 25360, Colombia; [Loaiza Ceron, Wilmar; Rivera, Irma Ayes] Univ Estado Amazonas UEA, Postgrad Program CLIAMB, Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazonia INPA, Ave Andre Araujo 2936, BR-69060001 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Kayano, Mary Toshie] Ctr Previsao Tempo & Estudos Climat, Inst Nacl Pesquisas Espaciais, Div Modelagem & Desenvolvimento, Av Astronautas 1758, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Andreoli, Rita Valeria; Ferreira de Souza, Rodrigo Augusto] Univ Estado Amazonas, Escola Super Tecnol, Av Darcy Vargas 1200,Parque 10 Novembro, BR-69065020 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Avila, Alvaro] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Agr Engn, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Canchala, Teresita] Univ Valle, Sch Nat Resources & Environm Engn, Res Grp Water Resources Engn & Soil IREHISA, Calle 13 100-00, Cali 25360, Colombia; [Frances, Felix] Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Res Grp Hydrol & Environm Modelling GIMHA, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Alfonso-Morales, Wilfredo] Univ Valle, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Res Grp Percept & Intelligent Syst PSI, Calle 13 100-00, Cali 25360, Colombia; [Carvajal-Escobar, Yesid] Univ Valle, Engn Sch, Nat & Environm Resources Engn Sch EIDENAR, Calle 13 100-00, Cali 25360, Colombia",Universidad del Valle; Institute Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; Universidade do Estado do Amazonas; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); Universidade do Estado do Amazonas; Universidade Federal de Vicosa; Universidad del Valle; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universidad del Valle; Universidad del Valle,"Ceron, WL (corresponding author), Univ Valle, Fac Humanities, Dept Geog, Calle 13 100-00, Cali 25360, Colombia.;Ceron, WL (corresponding author), Univ Estado Amazonas UEA, Postgrad Program CLIAMB, Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazonia INPA, Ave Andre Araujo 2936, BR-69060001 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",wilmar.ceron@correounivalle.edu.co; mary.kayano@inpe.br; rasouza@uea.edu.br; alvaro.diaz@ufv.br; teresita.canchala@correounivalle.edu.co; ffrances@hma.upv.es; ayesrivera@hotmail.com; wilfredo.alfonso@correounivalle.edu.co; rasouza@uea.edu.br; yesid.carvajal@correounivalle.edu.co,"Ferreira de Souza, Rodrigo/B-8453-2013; Alfonso, Wilfredo/AAL-4063-2020; Ávila-Díaz, Álvaro/L-6200-2019; Frances, Felix/H-7179-2015; CERON, WILMAR LOAIZA/P-3759-2019; CERÓN, WILMAR L./P-3678-2018; Kayano, Mary T/U-5716-2017; Andreoli, Rita V/B-8415-2013","Ferreira de Souza, Rodrigo/0000-0003-0838-3723; Alfonso, Wilfredo/0000-0002-3091-6082; Ávila-Díaz, Álvaro/0000-0002-0404-4559; Frances, Felix/0000-0003-1173-4969; CERON, WILMAR LOAIZA/0000-0003-1901-9572; CERÓN, WILMAR L./0000-0003-1901-9572; Kayano, Mary T/0000-0002-2516-295X; Andreoli, Rita V/0000-0001-5531-0733; Canchala Nastar, Teresita del Rocio/0000-0002-5208-5515; Ayes Rivera, Irma/0000-0003-4376-8709","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brazil (CAPES) [001]; Universidad del Valle (Cali-Colombia); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) of Brazil [302322/2017-5, 305942/2015-8]; CAPES-Brazil; Universidade Federal de Vicosa; Program for Strengthening Regional Capacities in Research, Technological Development and Innovation in the department of Narino; CEIBA Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [RTI2018-093717-B-I00]","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brazil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Universidad del Valle (Cali-Colombia); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) of Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES-Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Universidade Federal de Vicosa; Program for Strengthening Regional Capacities in Research, Technological Development and Innovation in the department of Narino; CEIBA Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government)","The first author was supported by the Doctoral Scholarship of the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brazil (CAPES), Finance Code 001 and Universidad del Valle (Cali-Colombia).

This paper proposes a systematic approach to evaluate the climate change impact on the risk of bridge scour. The proposed approach pivots on global climate models and their downscaled simulation data for future climate prediction. For scour hazard analysis, the climate simulation data are converted to flow discharge data using hydrologic modeling. Because future climates involve considerable uncertainties, different climate futures and global climate models are considered. In addition, long-term regional analyses are adopted to reduce these uncertainties. The proposed approach is applied to bridges over the Lehigh River in the Lehigh River watershed. With data from various public databases, the long-term regional risk of bridge scour is assessed using various global climate models under three climate change scenarios. The impact of climate change on bridge scour risk is quantified in monetary terms. The proposed approach and the obtained results provide an important basis for the planning of climate adaptation actions for river bridges.","[Yang, David Y.; Frangopol, Dan M.] Lehigh Univ, ATLSS Engn Res Ctr, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",Lehigh University,"Frangopol, DM (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, ATLSS Engn Res Ctr, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",dan.frangopol@lehigh.edu,"Yang, David Y./L-2053-2017; Frangopol, Dan M./A-7408-2015","Yang, David Y./0000-0003-0959-6333; Frangopol, Dan M./0000-0002-9213-0683",US National Science Foundation [CMMI 1537926],US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The authors are grateful for the financial support received from the US National Science Foundation Grant CMMI 1537926.

Through a rise in popularity, its meaning has morphed depending upon scale, audience, and what system must be resilient. This poses a problem of consistency for agencies, firms, and others working to make cities more adaptable to increasingly variable climate conditions. This work provides a critical examination of the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) $10.4billion Emergency Relief program funding after Superstorm Sandy. The program, funded through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013, allowed transportation providers the chance not only to rebuild but to make postemergency system improvements. This new paradigm for emergency funding creates opportunities to develop climate-adaptive infrastructure and services to prepare for the next, rather than the last, disaster. By examining and categorizing the allocation of FTA funds with respect to storm surge vulnerability, we consider the social equity implications of projects funded to date.","[Frick, K.

The complex social, economic, and environmental landscapes in the region today are not new phenomena and understanding their interactions requires a nuanced, multidisciplinary understanding of the past. This review builds on a history of collaboration between the social and natural palaeoscience disciplines. We provide a multidisciplinary, multiscalar perspective on the relevance of past climate, environmental, and archaeological research in assessing present day vulnerabilities and risks for the populations of southwest Asia. We discuss the complexity of palaeoclimatic data interpretation, particularly in relation to hydrology, and provide an overview of key time periods of palaeoclimatic interest. We discuss the critical role that vegetation plays in the human-climate-environment nexus and discuss the implications of the available palaeoclimate and archaeological data, and their interpretation, for palaeonarratives of the region, both climatically and socially. We also provide an overview of how modelling can improve our understanding of past climate impacts and associated change in risk to societies. We conclude by looking to future work, and identify themes of scale and seasonality as still requiring further focus. We suggest that by appreciating a given locale's place in the regional hydroscape, be it an archaeological site or palaeoenvironmental archive, more robust links to climate can be made where appropriate and interpretations drawn will demand the resolution of factors acting across multiple scales.

This paper finds that the Ricardian model with spatial effects leads to 20 % loss of land value under the UK Hadley center (UKMO hereafter) model and 11 % loss under the milder US Goddard Institute (GISS hereafter) model by the middle of the century. The micro portfolio adaptation model (G-MAP hereafter), on the other hand, results in a much smaller damage estimate: 1 % loss of land value under the GISS model and 3.4 % loss under the UKMO model. Even with the G-MAP model, however, the land value of the crops-only system falls sharply by as much as 9.5 % under the GISS scenario. In contrast to the Ricardian model, the G-MAP model can explicitly explain the decisions to choose one of the agricultural systems as well as the conditional land value function for each system of agriculture. Under the GISS model, the choice of a crops-only farm declines by 3.3 % which is offset by an increase in the mixed system by 2.1 % and an increase in the livestock-only system by 1.2 %. Although the land value of the crops-only system falls by 9.5 %, the land value of the mixed system falls only by 3.5 % while that of the livestock-only system increases by a large percentage. This paper finds that the differences in the impact estimates between the two models result from the treatment of sunk cost. The result from the Ricardian model would deviate from that from the G-MAP model if sunk cost is significantly large.","[Seo, S.

These buildings are under operation in the Antalya Province of Turkiye, which is a large city having the densest tourism activities. The significance of the work performed through the cost-benefit analyses for the selected case studies basically lies on the water savings while serving to four of the sustainable development goals, namely, clean water and sanitation, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, and climate action. These efforts may be considered valuable urban-based solutions toward climate change effects. Thorough surveys on the existing selected typologies are conducted regarding their water consumption and probable water savings via reuse activities. As-built plumbing projects and plans are also investigated during the accomplishment of the comprehensive design work leading to the calculation of the total investment and operation costs of the rainwater harvesting and graywater reuse practices. The up-to-date prices are used in monetary terms, and euro currency is used to make the results more meaningful by the interested parties. All the selected typologies undergo cost-benefit analysis for both of the alternative water reuse systems. The payback periods are calculated as 6, 2, and 9 years for RWH and as 5, 6, and 9 years for GWR for the hospital, shopping mall, and the hotel, respectively. The water savings for RWH varied between 20% and 50% whereas for GWR, the range was 48%-99%. Both of the systems are performed for the shopping mall simultaneously, and the resulting payback period is found to be 5 years, and water saving reached 72%. Recent information on the amortization periods in the literature states that less than a decade demonstrates achievable and highly acceptable applications. As such, the design attempts in this study also correlated with these findings. However, feasibility of these practices may be increased by encouraging the public on their utility and benefit of water savings. As is the case in many of the developed countries, incentives like tax reductions and even exemptions may be realized to achieve better applicability of these alternative technologies.","[Kilinc, Elif Ayyuce; Tanik, Aysegul; Gorgun, Erdem] Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Environm Engn, Istanbul, Southern Ethiop; [Hanedar, Asude] Namik Kemal Univ, Corlu Fac Engn, Dept Environm Engn, Tekirdag, Southern Ethiop",,"Tanik, A (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Environm Engn, Istanbul, Southern Ethiop.",tanika@itu.edu.tr,,,,,,,69,0,0,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Climate models used for future global warming predictions and attribution of past changes generally consider only global climate drivers, ignoring local drivers, such as land use change and urban effects. Impacts studies are generally carried out in isolation from each other and hence ignore interactions between different impacts sectors, such as hydrology, natural ecosystems and agriculture. Feedbacks from impacts to climate change, which often involve land ecosystem- atmosphere interactions, are often neglected. This can result in representations of global changes that are at best inconsistent and at worst completely misleading. Moreover, a number of climate change mitigation strategies, such as carbon sequestration and biofuels involve changes in land ecosystems. In addition to affecting climate through the exchange of carbon with the atmosphere, these land ecosystem changes may affect climate change or its impacts through a variety of additional processes, such as surface albedo change or changes in the surface moisture budget. Failure to account for these may have consequences that are potentially at odds with the aims of climate change mitigation.","Met Off, Hadley Ctr Climate Change, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Betts, R (corresponding author), Met Off, Hadley Ctr Climate Change, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",richard.betts@metoffice.gov.uk,"Betts, Richard A/P-8976-2015","Betts, Richard A/0000-0002-4929-0307",,,,,47,75,79,2,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1600-0889,,,TELLUS B,Tellus Ser.

GrazingFutures (AU$6 million budget, 2016-2022) is an extension project focussed on enhancing business management skills of extensive livestock producers in western Queensland, Australia. The region's rangelands are in productivity decline, span 1 million km2 and are managed by graziers operating more than 2400 livestock businesses (beef, sheep and goats). The Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries delivers GrazingFutures as a component of the Drought and Climate Adaptation Program, in partnership with regional natural resource management groups and other public and private organisations. Project delivery emphasised upskilling multi-agency staff and livestock producers to promote practice change within three whole of business themes: (1) grazing land management; (2) animal production; and (3) peoplebusiness. Three independent surveys (2018, 2019, 2020) indicated positive practice change was occurring in grazing businesses as a consequence of the project. Graziers instigated management changes even under major environmental challenges including extended drought (2013-2020), an extreme flood event in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This paper details the rationale, progress against the objectives, challenges and future direction of the GrazingFutures extension project.","[Rolfe, Joe] Dept Agr & Fisheries, Mareeba, Qld 4880, Australia; [Perry, Lindsey] Dept Agr & Fisheries, Cloncurry, Qld 4730, Australia; [Long, Peter] Peter Long Consulting, Yeppoon, Qld 4703, Australia; [Frazer, Caitlyn] Dept Agr & Fisheries, Charleville, Qld 4824, Australia; [Beutel, Terry] Dept Agr & Fisheries, Rockhampton, Qld 4470, Australia; [Tincknell, Jane; Phelps, David] Dept Agr & Fisheries, Longreach, Qld, Australia",,"Rolfe, J (corresponding author), Dept Agr & Fisheries, Mareeba, Qld 4880, Australia.",joe.rolfe@daf.qld.gov.au,"Phelps, David/J-8990-2019",,Queensland Government Drought and Climate Adaptation Program,Queensland Government Drought and Climate Adaptation Program,The authors acknowledge funding through the Queensland Government Drought and Climate Adaptation Program.,,56,3,3,0,2,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1036-9872,1834-7541,,RANGELAND J,Rangeland J.,,2021,43,3,,,,,173,183,,10.1071/RJ20078,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ20078,,OCT 2021,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WO2IX,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000711360800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While scientists have suggested that results could be relevant for climate adaptation policy, this has had little empirical investigation, particularly in developing regions. Taking the case of Senegal, the national adaptation policy context regarding extreme precipitation and flooding in urban areas, and the scientific information needed to support this policy is investigated using key informant interviews, a workshop and document analysis. Flooding in Senegal was found to be viewed primarily as an urban planning concern rather than a climate change issue, with actions to address the impacts focussing on current vulnerabilities of urban communities without considering changing climate risks. While stakeholders thought event attribution might be useful to inform about climate change impacts and future risks of extreme events, it is unclear whether there would be an opportunity for this at present, due to the limited role climate information has in adaptation decision-making. While addressing vulnerability to extremes is necessary whether or not the risk is climate change-related, if long-term planning is to be resilient then knowledge about future changes in risks of extremes will need to be considered, even if individual events are not attributed to climate change.","[Young, Hannah R.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Cornforth, Rosalind J.] Univ Reading, Walker Inst, Reading, Berks, England; [Gaye, Amadou T.] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, Lab Phys Atmosphere & Ocean Simeon Fongang, ESP, Dakar, Senegal; [Boyd, Emily] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Boyd, Emily] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, Lund, Sweden",University of Reading; University of Reading; University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar; University of Reading; Lund University,"Young, HR (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",hannah.young@reading.ac.uk,"; Cornforth, Rosalind/D-2263-2019","Gaye, Amadou Thierno/0000-0002-3688-1351; Boyd, Emily/0000-0002-1643-9718; Young, Hannah/0000-0002-7997-9471; Cornforth, Rosalind/0000-0003-4379-9556","Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K005472/1]; NERC [NE/P021077/1, NE/K005472/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council [grant number NE/K005472/1].,,86,5,5,1,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

In Germany, landscape plans assess and organize the spatial allocation of land use as an environmental contribution to general spatial planning. Collaborative planning processes are important to develop sustainable and ecosystem-based strategies to make coastal landscapes climate proof. However, there is little experience with collaborative processes in practical planning in Germany, and probably in other countries as well. This paper conducts an empirical case study in the low-lying coastal areas of northwest Germany. During a collaborative landscape planning process, four different ecosystem-based land management scenarios have been co-designed by regional experts and researchers. The participatory and iterative process included the development of scenario narratives to define planning goals, the use of land use elements and their relations to ecosystem services as planning entities in terms of indicators, the art-based illustrations of the different scenarios, and an evaluation and monitoring of the outcomes by regional experts. The decision-maker group decided on the so-called actor-based scenario, which contained freshwater retention areas (polders) to prevent potential uncontrolled flooding of the hinterland. This climate adaptation strategy has been implemented in the regional development plan of the county.","[Karrasch, Leena] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ecol Econ Grp, Dept Business Adm Econ & Law, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Maier, Martin; Kleyer, Michael] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Landscape Ecol Grp, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Karrasch, Leena; Klenke, Thomas] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, COAST Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Karrasch, L (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ecol Econ Grp, Dept Business Adm Econ & Law, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.;Karrasch, L (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, COAST Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",leena.karrasch@uni-oldenburg.de; Martin.maier@uni-oldenburg.de; Michael.kleyer@uni-oldenburg.de; Thomas.klenke@uni-oldenburg.de,"Maier, Martin/AFS-5352-2022; Maier, Martin/F-5642-2010","Maier, Martin/0000-0002-3782-6370; Maier, Martin/0000-0002-3782-6370; Klenke, Thomas/0000-0001-7190-8495; Kleyer, Michael/0000-0002-0824-2974; Karrasch, Leena/0000-0002-7722-1720",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LL0911],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The development of the actor-based scenario was only possible with the active participation of the experts.

The results indicate that the MaxEnt model is suitable for simulating the geographic distribution of F. longipetiolata. The importance of the five factors and their thresholds of climatic adaptability are ranged as annual precipitation (P > 770 mm) > annual average daily minimum temperature (7 degrees C < T-min <20 degrees C) > annual temperature range (DTY <23 degrees C) > annual average daily maximum temperature (16 degrees C < T-max) > annual solar radiation (1.10 x 10(5) W/m(2) < Radi < 1.42 x 10(5) W/m(2)).

The polyethylene glycol(PEG) fractionation protocol developed in this lab was used to identify as many differentially expressed low-abundance proteins as possible. In comparison with those of the biological controls, 67 protein spots with at least two-fold difference in expression were identified for the plant exposed to cold temperatures; and from these spots, 50 proteins were successfully identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry(MALDI-TOF MS). Bioinformatics studies on these proteins show that 57.8% of these proteins were localized in the chloroplast. Of these proteins, 8 ones have functions in photosynthesis, including glycine hydroxymethyltransferase, Rubisco large subunit, Rubisco activase, PSBO2, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase, sedoheptulose bisphosphatase and photosystem II reaction center PsbP family protein, suggesting that photosynthesis is greatly affected by cold stress. The identified proteins were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(qPCR). Taken together, our results suggest that the chloroplast might also act as a cold stress sensor and that photosynthesis-related proteins may play important roles in cold acclimation for Arabidopsis.","[Wang Shang; Xi Jinghui] Jilin Univ, Coll Plant Sci, Changchun 130062, Peoples R China; [Li Shanyu] Jilin Univ, Hosp 1, Changchun 130021, Peoples R China; [Liu Xiangguo; Hao Dongyun] Jilin Acad Agr Sci, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Changchun 130124, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Jilin University; Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences,"Xi, JH (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Coll Plant Sci, Changchun 130062, Peoples R China.",jhxi1965@jlu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [30470159]; Public Benefit Research Foundation of Ministry of Agriculture of China [201003025]; World Bank Loan Project from Department of Finance of Jilin Province, China [2011-Z19]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Public Benefit Research Foundation of Ministry of Agriculture of China; World Bank Loan Project from Department of Finance of Jilin Province, China","Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China(No. 30470159), the Public Benefit Research Foundation of Ministry of Agriculture of China(No. 201003025) and the World Bank Loan Project from Department of Finance of Jilin Province, China(No.2011-Z19).",,35,5,5,2,28,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"SHATANHOU ST 55, BEIJING 100009, PEOPLES R CHINA",1005-9040,2210-3171,,CHEM RES CHINESE U,Chem.

A few countries, mostly in high latitudes, may experience gains, while most will see average yield decrease. This paper aims to quantify the role of market-mediated adjustments in attenuating the effects of climate change by allowing the expression of the new climate-induced pattern of comparative advantages within and between countries. To do this, we develop a quantitative general equilibrium trade model where the representation of land use choice is inspired from modern Ricardian trade models. We use spatially explicit information from the agronomic literature about potential yields before and after climate change for calibration and counterfactual simulations. The results show that the climate-induced yield changes generate large price movements that incentivize adjustments in production and trade. Both production and trade adjustments contribute to reducing welfare losses globally, with production adjustments making the larger contribution. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Compared to a light coat color, black absorbs more solar radiation which is a contributing factor to heat stress in cattle. To better adapt dairy cattle to rapidly warming climates, we aimed to lighten their coat color by genome editing. Results Using gRNA/Cas9-mediated editing, we introduced a three bp deletion in the pre-melanosomal protein 17 gene (PMEL) proposed as causative variant for the semi-dominant color dilution phenotype observed in Galloway and Highland cattle. Calves generated from cells with homozygous edits revealed a strong color dilution effect. Instead of the characteristic black and white markings of control calves generated from unedited cells, the edited calves displayed a novel grey and white coat pattern. Conclusion This, for the first time, verified the causative nature of the PMEL mutation for diluting the black coat color in cattle. Although only one of the calves was healthy at birth and later succumbed to a naval infection, the study showed the feasibility of generating such edited animals with the possibility to dissect the effects of the introgressed edit and other interfering allelic variants that might exist in individual cattle and accurately determine the impact of only the three bp change.","[Laible, G.; Cole, S-A; Brophy, B.; Wei, J.; Leath, S.; Wells, D.

The review is conducted to assess existing or proposed actions for dealing with impacts of drought, heat waves, sea-level rise, and pluvial and fluvial flooding. It includes over 30 measures related to structural, services, technological, informational and ecosystem-based approaches. The main findings demonstrate that CBA of adaptation measures across urban environments must contend with numerous long-term socioeconomic and climate change uncertainties. Subsequently, this has led to inconsistencies in valuation frameworks related to, for example, planning horizons, discount rates, non-market considerations and future scenarios. Results also indicate a clear gap in the literature on the economic valuation of adaptation measures in the Global South. Furthermore, few studies integrate equity dimensions while planning for adaptation. Extensions of CBA to account for key uncertainties will help policy makers to allocate (often scarce) resources more efficiently and limit the likelihood of maladaptation. Further inclusion of the magnitude and distributional effects of non-market impacts and greater civil society engagement in policy dialogues will also be vital for promoting just and equitable measures that balance adaptation alongside other policy goals such as mitigation, economic development, health and well-being.","[Markanday, Ambika; Galarraga, Ibon; Markandya, Anil] Univ Basque Country, BC3, Parque Cientif, E-48940 Leioa, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Markanday, A (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, BC3, Parque Cientif, E-48940 Leioa, Spain.",ambika.markanday@bc3research.org; ibon.galarraga@bc3research.rg; anil.markandya@bc3research.org,,"Markanday, Ambika/0000-0001-6048-6258",Horizon 2020 RESIN project (EC-H2020) [653522]; Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through the BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation [MDM-2017-0714],Horizon 2020 RESIN project (EC-H2020); Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program(Basque Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through the BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation,"The authors are grateful for support received from the Horizon 2020 RESIN project (EC-H2020, grant agreement No. 653522).

However, there are recognized overlaps and tensions between mitigation, adaptation and development, and between top-down and community-based approaches to adaptation. This paper explores the approaches used to develop Local Adaptation Plans of Action (LAPAs) by three different programmes in the forest sector of Nepal. The analysis of information drawn from 37 interviews, with government, non-government and community representatives at national, district and local levels, shows that although the LAPAs in Nepal are prepared with limited external and scientific contribution, they are rich with local information. However, the limited knowledge and capacity of local people in relation to specific climate change impacts and potential solutions mean the plans bear little difference to regular development activities. Nearly all the activities identified contributed to adaptation and mitigation, as well as economic development, within a context of environmental sustainability, but appeared not to address the social equity and justice aspects of social sustainability. Moreover, this article argues that the community has greater confidence in plans prepared when donor funding is channelled through existing government mechanisms than through more directly donor funded approaches. It may continue to be necessary to keep adaptation plans separate from development plans until there is a greater understanding of the means to and need for adaptation as part of mainstream development planning.","[Silwal, Pratigya; Roberts, Lin; Rennie, Hamish G.] Lincoln Univ, Dept Environm Management, POB 85084, Christchurch 7647, New Zealand; [Lexer, Manfred J.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Waldbau WALDBAU, Vienna, Austria","Lincoln University - New Zealand; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Roberts, L (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Dept Environm Management, POB 85084, Christchurch 7647, New Zealand.",lin.roberts@lincoln.ac.nz,"Rennie, Hamish G./AAV-8821-2020","Rennie, Hamish G./0000-0002-9247-6625",,,,,56,6,6,3,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Utilising a framework incorporating push-pull tourist motivations and the theory of leisure substitutability, this study sought to explore how winter tourists in Australia will adapt to changes in snow cover in Australia's alpine regions under future climate change scenarios. The results of a questionnaire completed by 231 respondents indicated that tourist motivations were related to behavioural adaptation, and that there is a general preference among the current winter market for spatial substitution in the event of poor snow. Those motivated by recreation specialisation or snow-related attributes were likely to opt for spatial substitution, while tourists motivated by self-expression and apres ski activities displayed resilience to poor snow conditions. The results demonstrate a clear division between leisure-driven tourists who valued participation in sport, and experience-driven tourists, who displayed higher resilience to reduced snow under projected climate change scenarios. These results have practical implications for winter tourism destinations, both in terms of targeting experience-driven tourists in the case of reduced snow as well as the longer term sustainability and viability of winter tourism destinations.","[Cocolas, Nicole; Walters, Gabrielle; Ruhanen, Lisa] Univ Queensland, Sch Business, Tourism Cluster, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Cocolas, N (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Business, Tourism Cluster, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",n.cocolas@business.uq.edu.au,,"WALTERS, Gabby/0000-0003-1653-5395",,,,,67,39,40,12,151,CHANNEL VIEW PUBLICATIONS,CLEVEDON,"FRANKFURT LODGE, CLEVEDON HALL, VICTORIA ROAD, CLEVEDON, BS21 7HH, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

To develop this argument we use a qualitative case study from Cape Town, South Africa of a local government intervention in an informal settlement suffering from annual flooding. The intervention took the form of gravel platforms raising the ground on which residential dwellings were located. We argue that the meaning and purpose of this intervention have been shaped by multiple social agendas promoted by various actors, producing a contested result and arguably impacting on the potential of the intervention to serve as a pathway to increased adaptive capacity.

The framework is applied to an arid zone in Iran and consists of the three models: downscaling, rainfall-runoff and reservoir optimisation models. LARS-WG is tested in 99% confidence level before to using it as downscaling model. Seven artificial neural network models are proposed, examined and compared with IHACRES to find proper rainfall-runoff model for arid zone. Current and adapted reservoir rule curves are derived by dynamic programming optimisation. The results demonstrate capability of proposed framework in assessment of adaptation and show that global warming negatively influences proposed index (water supply index) in normal and wet years, but has positive influence for dry years. It also improves reservoir reliability, but it cannot restore current reliability.","[Banihabib, Mohammad Ebrahim; Hasani, Khadijeh; Bavani, Ali Reza Massah] Univ Tehran, Univ Coll Abureyhan, Dept Irrigat & Drainage Engn, POB 3391653755, Tehran, Iran; [Asgari, Kamran] Islamic Azad Univ, Khorasgan Isfahan Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Esfahan, Iran",University of Tehran; Islamic Azad University,"Banihabib, ME (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Univ Coll Abureyhan, Dept Irrigat & Drainage Engn, POB 3391653755, Tehran, Iran.",banihabib@ut.ac.ir; hasani.nasim@gmail.com; armassah@ut.ac.ir; kamran.asgari@gmail.com,,"Massah Bavani, Ali Reza/0000-0002-5433-1791; Asgari, Kamran/0000-0001-8380-6349",,,,,46,4,4,2,5,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",1758-2083,1758-2091,,INT J GLOBAL WARM,Int.

Both acetylcholine and catecholamine hormonal signals can trigger sweating independently of one another; differences in sweat output and lactate concentrations are compared. The primary triggers for sweating, exercise and heat are also compared, with exercise-induced sweating being further examined with respect to the exercise intensity.

The hydrological scenarios were developed from the literature on climate change projections. This paper recommends adaptations for community members, service providers, and the municipality based on the impact assessment. Chorkor and Shiabu are vulnerable to an increase in rainfall because of the lack of adequate solid waste management and hydrological sound drains. Shiabu's topography and the indiscriminate sand mining along its beach make it vulnerable to an increase in sea level. Looking beyond Chorkor and Shiabu's community boundaries, the urban water utility which supplies water vendors in both communities may be severely impacted by a decrease in rainfall, which would lead to water scarcity and a shortage in hydroelectricity. Regardless of which climate change scenario emerges, many of the recommended adaptations are good water management practice, for example, increasing the number of household connections and reducing non-revenue water. Putting climate change high on the agenda has the potential to generate additional funding to help address Chorkor and Shiabu's water and sanitation problems, and climate-proof services for the future.

I draw upon interviews about house and contents insurance, with householders in the flammable landscapes of south-eastern Tasmania, Australia. The participants identify these landscapes as resilient and permanent and thus ultimately unaffected by fire. In understanding bush-living as co-constituted with fire and not purely threatened by fire, they experience a strong sense of continuance in these places. In this context, the promise of insurance emerges as contingent, and even if an up-to-date policy is present, insurance moves in and out of focus, is present and becomes absent as various human and non-human actants exert agency. Drawing on critical landscape studies in exploring these spatial contingencies, I observe insuring as landscaping practice. As well as contributing to critical insurance studies and financialisation of everyday life research, I provide a signpost for rethinking the role of insurance in disaster management and climate adaptation.","[Booth, Kate] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Booth, K (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Geog & Spatial Sci, Sch Technol Environm & Design, Private Bag 78, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Kate.Booth@utas.edu.au,"Booth, Kate/J-7622-2014","Booth, Kate/0000-0002-3102-6356",,,,,65,3,3,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2514-8486,2514-8494,,ENVIRON PLAN E-NAT,Environ.

Climate model projections exhibit a large spread in the magnitude and pattern of tropical Pacific warming in response to greenhouse-gas forcing. Here, we show that part of this spread can be explained by model biases in the simulation of interannual variability, namely the El Nio/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. We show that models that exhibit strong ENSO nonlinearities simulate a more accurate balance of ENSO feedbacks, and their projected tropical Pacific sea surface temperature warming pattern is closely linked to their projected ENSO response. Within this group, models with ENSO nonlinearity close to observed project stronger warming of the cold tongue, whereas models with stronger than observed ENSO nonlinearity project a more uniform warming of the tropical Pacific. These differences are also manifest in the projected changes of precipitation patterns, thereby highlighting that ENSO simulation biases may lead to potentially biased projections in long-term precipitation trends, with great significance for regional climate adaptation strategies.","[Karamperidou, Christina; Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, 2525 Correa Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Conroy, Jessica L.] Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, Urbana, IL USA; [Conroy, Jessica L.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Karamperidou, C (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, 2525 Correa Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",ckaramp@hawaii.edu,,"Karamperidou, Christina/0000-0001-9304-9601","U.S. National Science Foundation [OCN-1304910, AGS-1602097]; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1602097] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),The authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. S.-T.

In this respect, research on psychological distance shows that the fact of perceiving an event as concrete leads individuals to adapt to this environmental issue. The first aim of this research study is to identify the different types of environmental coping as regards climate change. The second objective is to study the relations between psychological distance relative to climate change and environmental coping strategies via a quasi-experimental protocol. In order to do this, 345 participants were assigned to a group where climate change was presented as more or less distant from a spatial, temporal, social or hypothetical point of view. On the one hand, the results enable the identification of two second-order factors regarding coping strategies in relation to climate change: Strategies centered on accepting climate change and those centered on minimizing its gravity. On the other hand, covariance analyses and path analyses show that, in general, a small psychological distance in relation to climate change is likely to be associated with more strategies centered on accepting climate change and fewer strategies focused on minimizing its gravity. This study leads us to ponder the pertinence of considering the psychological distance model, notably during awareness-raising campaigns.","[Guillard, Mary; Fleury-Bahi, Ghozlane; Navarro, Oscar] Univ Nantes, Univ Angers, Fac Psychol, Lab Psychol Pays Loire LPPL,EA 4638, F-44000 Nantes, France",Nantes Universite; Universite d'Angers,"Guillard, M (corresponding author), Univ Nantes, Univ Angers, Fac Psychol, Lab Psychol Pays Loire LPPL,EA 4638, F-44000 Nantes, France.",consultante.maryguillard@gmail.com; ghozlane.fleury@univ-nantes.fr; oscar.navarro@univ-nantes.fr,"Navarro, Oscar/AEM-0309-2022; Navarro, Oscar/S-2008-2017","Navarro, Oscar/0000-0002-4225-1962",,,,,60,5,5,3,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2021,13,2,,,,,,,992,10.3390/su13020992,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13020992,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PY4YP,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000612052000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the effects of changes in climate on the growth and yield of maize in the two seasons are poorly understood. Forty-six cultivars of maize with different requirements for growing degree days (GDD), categorized as high (H), medium (M) or low (L), and three cultivar combinations for two seasons as LH (using JD27 and DMY1 from category L in the first season; and YD629 and XD22 from category H in the second season), MM (using JX1 and LC3 from category M in the first season; and ZD958 and JX1 from category M in the second season) and HL (using CD30 and QY9 from category H in the first season; and XK10 and DMY3 from category L in the second season) were tested to examine the eco-physiological determinants of maize yield from 2015 to 2017. The correlations between the combinations of cultivars and grain yield were examined. The combination LH produced the highest annual grain yield and total biomass, regardless of the year. It was followed, in decreasing order, by MM and HL. Higher grain yield and biomass in LH were mainly due to the greater grain yield and biomass in the second season, which were influenced mainly by the lengths of the pre- and post-silking periods and the rate of plant growth (PGR). Temperature was the primary factor that influenced dry matter accumulation. In the first season, low temperatures during pre-silking decreased both the duration and PGR in LH, whereas high temperatures during postsilking decreased the PGR in MM and HL, resulting in no significant differences in biomass being observed among the three combinations. In the second season, high temperatures decreased both the PGR and pre- and post-silking duration in MM and HL, and consequently, the biomass of those two combinations were lower than that in LH. Moreover, because of lower GDD and radiation in the first season and higher grain yield in the second season, production efficiency of temperature and radiation (R-a) was the highest in LH. More importantly, differences in temperature and radiation in the two seasons significantly affected the rate and duration of growth in maize, and thereby affecting both dry matter and grain yield. Our study indicated that the combination of LH is the best for optimizing the double-maize system under changing climatic conditions in the North China Plain.","[Wang Dan; Zhan Ming; Cao Cou-gui; Xia Fei] Huazhong Agr Univ, Key Lab Crop Physiol Ecol & Cultivat, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Wang Dan; Zhou Bao-yuan; Ma Wei; Zhao Ming] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Key Lab Crop Physiol & Ecol, Inst Crop Sci, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang Dan] Tongliao Acad Agr Sci, Inst Maize Sci, Tongliao 028042, Peoples R China; [Li Guo-rui] Inner Mongolia Univ Nationalities, Coll Life Sci, Tongliao 028000, Peoples R China; [Meng Qing-feng] China Agr Univ, Coll Agron & Biotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Huazhong Agricultural University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Crop Sciences, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities; China Agricultural University","Wang, D (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Key Lab Crop Physiol Ecol & Cultivat, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;Wang, D; Ma, W; Zhao, M (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Key Lab Crop Physiol & Ecol, Inst Crop Sci, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",wangdansyau@126.com; weiwei_8200@126.com; zhaomingcau@163.com,"Zhou, Baoyuan/HDM-1095-2022","Zhou, Baoyuan/0000-0003-0979-4460; Cao, Cougui/0000-0002-4310-7129; Meng, Qingfeng/0000-0003-0047-3089","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0300207, 2017YFD0300305]",National Key Research and Development Program of China,This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0300207 and 2017YFD0300305).,,58,4,7,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2095-3119,,,J INTEGR AGR,J.

Nearly all pathways that hold global warming well below 2 degrees C involve carbon removal (IPCC, 2015). In addition, solar geoengineering is being considered as a potential tool to offset warming, especially to limit temperature until negative emissions technologies are sufficiently matured (MacMartin et al., 2018). Despite this, there has been a reluctance to embrace carbon removal and solar geoengineering, partly due to the perception that these technologies represent what is widely termed a moral hazard: that geoengineering will prevent people from developing the will to change their personal consumption and push for changes in infrastructure (Robock et al., 2010), erode political will for emissions cuts (Keith, 2007), or otherwise stimulate increased carbon emissions at the social-system level of analysis (Bunzl, 2008). These debates over carbon removal and geoengineering echo earlier ones over climate adaptation. We argue that debates over moral hazard in many areas of climate policy are un-helpful and misleading. We also propose an alternative framework for dealing with the tradeoffs that motivate the appeal to moral hazard, which we call risk-response feedback.","[Jebari, Joseph; Taiwo, Olufemi O.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Philosophy, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Andrews, Talbot M.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Polit Sci, Storrs, CT USA; [Aquila, Valentina] Amer Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Beckage, Brian] Univ Vermont, Dept Plant Biol, Burlington, VT USA; [Beckage, Brian] Univ Vermont, Dept Comp Sci, Burlington, VT USA; [Belaia, Mariia] Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Clifford, Maggie] Amer Univ, Sch Commun, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Fuhrman, Jay] Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Keller, David P.] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Kiel, Germany; [Mach, Katharine J.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Mach, Katharine J.] Univ Miami, Leonard & Jayne Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Morrow, David R.] Amer Univ, Forum Climate Engn Assessment, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Raimi, Kaitlin T.] Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Visioni, Daniele] Cornell Univ, Sibley Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Nicholson, Simon] Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Trisos, Christopher H.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Trisos, Christopher H.] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Stat Environm Ecol & Conservat, Cape Town, South Africa",Georgetown University; University of Connecticut; American University; University of Vermont; University of Vermont; Harvard University; American University; University of Virginia; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Miami; University of Miami; American University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Cornell University; American University; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Jebari, J (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Philosophy, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",Jdj48@georgetown.edu,"Keller, David P./F-4864-2013; Visioni, Daniele/O-7824-2016","Keller, David P./0000-0002-7546-4614; Visioni, Daniele/0000-0002-7342-2189",,,,,29,11,11,2,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Mathematical models have the potential to estimate changes in hydrological processes under changing climatic or land use conditions. These models, indeed, need careful calibration and testing before being applied in decision making. The aim of this study was to compare the capability of five different hydrological models to predict the runoff and the soil water balance elements of a small catchment in Norway. The models were harmonised and calibrated against the same data set. In overall, a good agreement between the measured and simulated runoff was obtained for the different models when integrating the results over a week or longer periods. Model simulations indicate that forest appears to be very important for the water balance in the catchment, and that there is a lack of information on land use specific water balance elements. We concluded that joint application of hydrological models serves as a good background for ensemble modelling of water transport processes within a catchment and can highlight the uncertainty of models forecast.","[Farkas, Csilla; Kvaerno, Sigrun H.; Engebretsen, Alexander; Barneveld, Robert; Deelstra, Johannes] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, NIBIO, Frederik A Dahls Vei 20, N-1430 As, Norway",Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research,"Farkas, C (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, NIBIO, Frederik A Dahls Vei 20, N-1430 As, Norway.",csilla.farkas@nibio.no,,"Barneveld, Robert/0000-0002-0977-4403; Farkas, Csilla/0000-0002-6848-1790",,,,,43,7,7,0,30,"VEDA, SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES",BRATISLAVA,"DUBRAVSKA CESTA 9, 842 34 BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0042-790X,1338-4333,,J HYDROL HYDROMECH,J.

Contentious policy initiatives are hard to implement when knowledge bases are divergent and incomplete, when short-term interests conflict with long-term benefits, and when problems are construed or framed in very different ways. These features of wicked problems have been central in Australian debates about initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to address the likely impacts of climate change. Given the closely interconnected nature of social, technical, legal-political, economic, and natural-resource issues, the political challenges of managing adaptive change are numerous. A strategic adaptation framework is necessary to complement ongoing mitigation efforts directed at greenhouse gas reduction. Strategic innovation requires pluralistic and adaptive processes, such as multistakeholder forums, consideration of scenario analyses, and the use of boundary organizations. In light of the highly contested nature of the issues, the multiple bases of knowledge and interests, and the provisional nature of adaptation choices, there are major policy governance challenges facing the Australian government and stakeholders in grappling with climate adaptation.","Univ Queensland, Social Sci Res Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Head, BW (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Social Sci Res Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",brian.head@uq.edu.au,"Head, Brian/B-9918-2016","Head, Brian/0000-0002-9915-0628",,,,,100,95,96,1,88,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-774X,1472-3425,,ENVIRON PLANN C,Environ.

Building on and comparing case studies set in Denmark into three emerging professional proto-jurisdictions-of water-related climate adaptation, lifestyle disease prevention, and innovation management-this article identifies three key modes of interprofessional boundary work important for such projects.

In Europe, however, forests are highly fragmented and located close to human populations. This means that maintaining forest sustainability implies not only increasing ecosystem adaptation but also developing social adaptation. Hence, there is a need to understand the current priorities and management goals of forestry stakeholders, as well as their capacity to achieve functional and sustainable FSES in the future. The present study uses an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate stakeholders' capacity to deal with climate change and top-down policies in different FSESs. We selected five FSESs in France that exhibit a range of climatic threats and socio-economic characteristics to estimate their adaptive capacity and transformative potential. The estimation is based on an assessment of different types of capital (i.e. natural, social, resources, governance) that involves evaluating 70 indicators through more than 70 semi-structured interviews with local stakeholders. Our results highlight that forest management in France, and more broadly in Europe, is mainly based on technical approaches, which build stakeholders' confidence in their capacity to maintain the status quo. We observe asymmetry in capital distribution in some FSES, mainly through the maximization of the resources capital, which can constraint FSESs in a robustness trap. To develop adaptive capacity for small perturbations as well as transformability, forestry stakeholders should be encouraged to compromises. More balanced capital distribution, with decreased economic benefits, along with new technical approaches and changes to the landscape composition could be necessary to ensure the long-term adaptability of FSES to climate change.","[Sansilvestri, Roxane; Frascaria-Lacoste, Nathalie; Fernandez-Manjarres, Juan] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, Lab Ecol Systemat Evolut, AgroParisTech,UMR 8079,CNRS, Orsay, France; [Cuccarollo, Marlene] Univ Pantheon Sorbonne, Geog Dept, Paris, France; [Benito-Garzon, Marta] Univ Bordeaux, INRA, UMR 1202, Pessac, France; [Sansilvestri, Roxane] Univ Paris Sud, Lab ESE, Bat 360,Campus Orsay Vallee, F-91405 Orsay, France",AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Sansilvestri, R (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, Lab Ecol Systemat Evolut, AgroParisTech,UMR 8079,CNRS, Orsay, France.;Sansilvestri, R (corresponding author), Univ Paris Sud, Lab ESE, Bat 360,Campus Orsay Vallee, F-91405 Orsay, France.",roxysan@orange.fr,,,,,,,67,5,5,4,28,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

This study explores how one village on Emau, an island offshore of capital island Efate, has developed several overlapping strategies to manage climate change impacts, including drought and sea level rise. Informants reveal their perceptions of changing environmental baselines and how socio-economic processes, including population growth, cultural loss, and limited access to cash incomes, have shaped the community's response. Informants describe four climate adaptation strategies: 1) expanding access to cash income through seasonal or urban labor migration; 2) leveraging international expertise and funding to meet their goals; 3) developing hybrid forms of traditional practices and contemporary ideology to preserve environmental knowledge; and 4) performing physical and emotional labor to preserve and remain on their land. These strategies span oceans and cross international borders, refuting narratives of islands' being `isolated' from the rest of the world and passive 'victims' of climate change. Contextualizing perceptions of and responses to environmental change provides critical nuance to the resilience/vulnerability framework, which alone obscures ongoing political, social and economic processes on islands.","[Ruehr, Sophie] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Ruehr, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sophie_ruehr@berkeley.edu,,,Yale University's Parker Huang Research Fellowship,Yale University's Parker Huang Research Fellowship,"This work was funded by Yale University's Parker Huang Research Fellowship.

Therefore, aggregate estimates of the average effect of warming may be insufficient to model climate change vulnerability. In this study, I propose a quantile model for the distributional effect of climate change. I estimate inter-quantile regressions of land value on climate using agricultural census data for 464,277 commercial farms in Brazil. I find that the effects of climate change in Brazilian agriculture vary significantly by climate, land quality, and irrigation choice. A 1 degrees C of warming is more detrimental to farms in warm climates, those with high-quality land, and those using irrigation. A 10 0-mm decrease in annual precipitation is more damaging to farms in dry climates, those with low-quality land, and those using irrigation. The heterogeneity in climate change effects is particularly large within the subset of farms in the warmest or the driest climates, as the most vulnerable farms appear to be those that have reached their limits for climate adaptation.

As a mega-event with a significant reliance on a specific range of weather conditions for outdoor competitions, the OWG have developed several technologies and strategies to manage weather risk. Can these climatic adaptations cope with future climate change? Based on an analysis of two key climate indicators (probability of a minimum temperature of <= 0 degrees C, and probability of a snow depth of >= 30 centimetres with advanced snowmaking capacity), this paper examines how projected changes to climate will impact the ability of the 19 previous host cities/regions to provide suitable conditions for outdoor competitions in the future. The results indicate that while the 19 former OWG hosts all have a suitable climate in the 1981-2010 period, only 11 or 10 (low-high-emission scenarios) remain climatically suitable in the 2050s, with as few as 6 in the high-emission scenario of the 2080s. The analysis reveals that climate change has important implications for the future geography of OWG host cities/regions as well as broader implications for participation in winter sport.","[Scott, D.; Rutty, M.; Johnson, P.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Steiger, R.] Management Ctr Innsbruck, Tourism Business Studies, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Waterloo,"Scott, D (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",daniel.scott@uwaterloo.ca,"Rutty, Michelle/GPX-7857-2022; Scott, Daniel/AAB-6190-2020; Steiger, Robert/D-4796-2019","Scott, Daniel/0000-0001-7825-9301; Steiger, Robert/0000-0002-1752-6450; Johnson, Peter/0000-0003-4572-2915; Rutty, Michelle/0000-0002-4567-7766",,,,,48,41,43,6,76,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1368-3500,1747-7603,,CURR ISSUES TOUR,Curr.

Indonesia ranks among the world's top CO2 emitters(2), affirming its relevance to the global climate change policy arena, yet the dynamics of climate change engagement in Indonesia may differ from developed countries from which much research on this issue derives(3). We surveyed 6,310 households in two Indonesian regions to investigate patterns in four steps of engagement: observation, risk perception, reactive action (in response to present climate change) and proactive action (in anticipation of future climate change). We show that 89.5% of households exhibited a pattern whereby taking each of these steps in sequence implied taking all steps that precede it. Exceptions occurred in urban areas, where households were more likely to take action without having observed climate change or perceiving risks. In rural areas, households were more likely to observe climate change without taking action. These variations suggest a potentially nonlinear relationship between steps of engagement. We distinguish three types of household requiring adaptation support, and stress that Indonesian climate policy should shift emphasis from raising awareness to identifying broader institutional structures and processes to facilitate household engagement.","[Bohensky, Erin L.; Smajgl, Alex] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, ATSIP, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Brewer, Tom] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); James Cook University,"Bohensky, EL (corresponding author), CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, ATSIP, James Cook Univ Douglas Campus, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",erin.bohensky@csiro.au,"Smajgl, Alexander/G-5462-2010; Bohensky, Erin/C-3636-2011; Bohensky, Erin/HOC-2835-2023","Smajgl, Alexander/0000-0003-1818-0698; Bohensky, Erin/0000-0002-4159-5325; ",AusAID; CSIRO; PROFOR/World Bank,AusAID(Australian Aid (AusAID)); CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); PROFOR/World Bank,"This research was undertaken as part of a project funded by AusAID, CSIRO and PROFOR/World Bank.

The lake has shrunk in size in recent years, resulting in significant hydrological, ecological and economic consequences. It remains unknown whether the shrinkage is a trend or a regime shift, which is of high importance for policymakers as it may lead to different decisions. This study constructed a four-decade record of the lake area using multi-temporal satellite images and hydrological data. The Mann-Kendall analysis revealed a decreasing trend of Poyang Lake but it was statistically insignificant. The Rodionov sequential approach disclosed an abrupt change of the lake in 2006, implying a regime shift. Basically, the lake change was a synthetic result of precipitation, evapotranspiration and outflow discharge. However, precipitation and outflow did not show any significant trend or abrupt change, and evapotranspiration had an increasing trend in addition to an abrupt change in 1998. The trigger for the recent lake declines was principally ascribed to a weakened blocking effect of the Yangtze River. The findings provide an example of hydrologic non-stationarity and are valuable for effective promotion of climate adaptation and water resource management.","[Liu, Yuanbo; Wu, Guiping; Zhao, Xiaosong] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Liu, YB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, 73 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",ybliu@niglas.ac.cn,,,973 Program of the National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB417003]; Key Program of Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [NIGLAS2012135001]; Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) 100-Talents Project,973 Program of the National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Key Program of Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) 100-Talents Project,"This work was supported by the 973 Program of the National Basic Research Program of China (2012CB417003), a Key Program of Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NIGLAS2012135001) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) 100-Talents Project.

Many share common characteristics of small size, high population density, limited land resources, vulnerability to natural hazards, threatened biodiversity, high dependence on tourism, and limited funds and human resources. The suggestions put forward for a research agenda for the SIDS include a comprehensive assessment of the SIDS as a group, a focused attention on oceans, increased development on renewable energy, inclusion of climate adaptation under natural disaster reduction, a strategy of 'save some islands rather than not to have any' for some SIDS, and large-scale modular mangrove planting for coastal protection and adaptation to sea-level rise.

Although different sources of uncertainty in projected crop yields have been quantified in climate change impact assessments, uncertainty in simulating the crop adaptation to future climate has not been fully assessed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the uncertainty in simulating maize adaptation to future climate change with two adaptation options (adjusting planting date and shifting cultivars) at four contrasting sites across China's Maize Belt.METHODS: Maize yield with adaptation was simulated using three crop models (APSIM, DSSAT-CERES, and STICS) driven by 22 global climate models (GCMs) under four emission scenarios of future societal development pathway (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) during two periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that late planting had a greater potential to cope with climate change at most study sites. However, all sites required new cultivars with increased thermal time requirements. Under optimum management options at the four study sites, rainfed maize yields were likely to increase by 1.9%-68.3% compared with yields obtained without adaptation. For the adaptation simulation using adjusted planting date alone, GCM was the major source of uncertainty, accounting for 22.9%-36.7% of the total uncertainty at all sites except a high-altitude site where changing planting time was the major source of uncertainty (32.4%). For the adaptation simulation using shifting cultivar alone, crop model was the dominant source of uncertainty, ac-counting for 24.0%-38.0% of the total uncertainty at all sites except a high-latitude site where shifting cultivar was the major source of uncertainty (34.0%). These findings demonstrated that adaptation options have great potential for increasing maize yields, and the major source of uncertainty depends on study sites and adaptation type used.SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study advance the understanding of the dominant sources of uncertainty in crop yield under different climate adaptations, thereby improving our confidence in assessments of future climate impact on maize yields determined by different adaptation strategies.","[Huang, Mingxia; Wang, Jing; Pan, Xuebiao] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Huang, Mingxia; Wang, Bin; Liu, De Li; Li, Siyi] Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia; [Wang, Bin; Yu, Qiang] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess Pl, Shaanxi 712100, Peoples R China; [Liu, De Li] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Feng, Puyu] China Agr Univ, Coll Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Li, Siyi] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Sch Life Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Jiang, Tengcong] Northwest A&F Univ, Key Lab Agr Soil, Water Engn Arid Area Minist Educ, Shaanxi 712100, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; NSW Department of Primary Industries; Northwest A&F University - China; University of New South Wales Sydney; China Agricultural University; University of Technology Sydney; Northwest A&F University - China,"Wang, J (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.;Wang, B (corresponding author), Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia.;Wang, B (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess Pl, Shaanxi 712100, Peoples R China.",wangj@cau.edu.cn; bin.a.wang@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Wang, Jing/AFK-1683-2022; Wang, Bin/AFI-6568-2022","Wang, Bin/0000-0002-6422-5802; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA28060200]; National Science Foundation of China [41901015]; Chinese Scholarship Council,Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA28060200] and National Sci-ence Foundation of China (41901015) .

The impacts of TC-caused blackouts may worsen in the future as TCs and heatwaves intensify. Here we couple TC and heatwave projections and power outage and recovery process analysis to investigate how TC-blackout-heatwave compound hazard risk may vary in a changing climate, with Harris County, Texas as an example. We find that, under the high-emissions scenario RCP8.5, long-duration heatwaves following strong TCs may increase sharply. The expected percentage of Harris residents experiencing at least one longer-than-5-day TC-blackout-heatwave compound hazard in a 20-year period could increase dramatically by a factor of 23 (from 0.8% to 18.2%) over the 21(st) century. We also reveal that a moderate enhancement of the power distribution network can significantly mitigate the compound hazard risk. Thus, climate adaptation actions, such as strategically undergrounding distribution network and developing distributed energy sources, are urgently needed to improve coastal power system resilience. The study found that long-duration heatwaves are much more likely to follow power-damaging tropical cyclones in the future RCP8.5 climate, with the impact of longer-than-5-day tropical cyclone-blackout-heatwave compound hazard increasing by a factor of 23 over the 21st century.","[Feng, Kairui; Lin, Ning] Princeton Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ouyang, Min] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Artificial Intelligence & Automat, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Princeton University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Lin, N (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",nlin@princeton.edu,"feng, kairui/R-7237-2017; Ouyang, Min/J-3214-2013","feng, kairui/0000-0001-8978-2480; Lin, Ning/0000-0002-5571-1606; Ouyang, Min/0000-0002-3190-4390","U.S. National Science Foundation as part of the Megalopolitan Coastal Transformation Hub [1652448, 2103754]; C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute (C3.ai DTI Research Award); National Natural Science Foundation of China [72074089, 51938004, 71821001]",U.S. National Science Foundation as part of the Megalopolitan Coastal Transformation Hub; C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute (C3.ai DTI Research Award); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"K.F. and N.L. are supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (1652448 and 2103754 as part of the Megalopolitan Coastal Transformation Hub) and C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute (C3.ai DTI Research Award).

One major view is that, while resilience originally was a descriptive concept denoting some adaptive property of ecosystems, subsequent applications to social contexts distorted its meaning and purpose by framing it as a transformative and normative quality. This article advances an alternative philosophical account based on the scrutiny of C.S. Holling's original work on resilience. We show that resilience had a central role among Holling's proposals for reforming environmental science and management, and that Holling framed resilience as an ecosystem's capacity of absorbing change and exploiting it for adapting or evolving, but also as the social ability of maintaining and opportunistically exploiting that natural capacity. Resilience therefore appears as a transformative social-ecological property that is normative in three ways: as an intrinsic ecological value, as a virtue of organizations or management styles, and as a virtuous understanding of human-nature relations. This interpretation accounts for the practical relevance of resilience, clarifies the relations between resilience and related terms, and is a firm ground for further normative work on resilience.","[Canizares, Jose Carlos; Copeland, Samantha Marie; Doorn, Neelke] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Values Technol & Innovat, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Canizares, JC (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Values Technol & Innovat, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",j.c.canizaresgaztelu@tudelft.nl; S.M.Copeland@tudelft.nl; N.Doorn@tudelft.nl,,"Copeland, Samantha/0000-0002-6946-7165; Doorn, Neelke/0000-0002-1090-579X; Canizares Gaztelu, Jose Carlos/0000-0003-2572-813X",Dutch National Research Council NWO [VI.Vidi.195.119],Dutch National Research Council NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This work has been supported by a grant from the Dutch National Research Council NWO (grant no.

We consider the full lifecycle of the vehicles, including manufacture and operation. We analyze battery electric vehicles (BEVs) powered by standalone electricity generation using woody biomass, with and without CCS, and with integration of wind electricity. We analyze internal combustion vehicles (ICVs) powered by fossil gasoline and by biomethanol derived from woody biomass, with and without carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Our system boundaries include all fossil and biogenic emissions from technical systems, and the avoided decay emissions from harvest residue left in the forest. We find that the pathways using electricity to power BEVs have strongly lower climate impacts, compared to the liquid-fueled ICV pathways using biomethanol and gasoline. The pathways using bioelectricity with CCS result in negative emissions leading to global cooling. The pathways using gasoline and biomethanol have substantial climate impact, even with CCS. Regardless of energy pathway, smaller cars have consistently lower climate impact than larger cars.

Climate change is exacerbating these disasters and the multi-faceted causal contributing factors, including land loss, livelihood shifts, and disintegration of social networks. Familiar with ongoing disruptive displacements, coastal Louisiana residents are now increasingly compelled to consider permanent relocation as a form of climate adaptation. This paper elicits and analyzes coastal Louisiana residents' perceptions of socio-environmental changes as they pertain to relocation as adaptation and the precariousness of place, both biophysically and culturally. It investigates how these external mechanisms affect relocation decisions, and empirically expand on how these decision-making processes are affecting residents internally as well. Research methods include semi-structured interviews with coastal Louisiana residents, participant observation, and document analysis. The paper integrates literature on environmental migration, including climate-driven; regional studies on Louisiana, and disasters, with empirical, interview-based research. It is guided by theoretical insights from the construct solastalgia, the feeling of distress associated with environmental change close to one's home. The findings suggest that residents' migration decisions are always context-dependent and location-specific, contributing to a broader understanding of coastal residents' experiences of staying or going.","[Simms, Jessica R.

Previous studies have revealed that in Osaka, southwestern Japan, L. valentiana reproduces from November to April. In the present study, in order to clarify the climatic adaptations of L. valentiana in Japan, we examined the life cycle of this slug in Sapporo, northern Japan. In the Sapporo population, the ratio of gonad weight to body weight reached a maximum in September. Most slugs had mature sperm from late August to April and large oocytes from September to April. Thus, the Sapporo population of L. valentiana commenced reproduction two months earlier than the Osaka population. We also examined the effect of various photoperiodic conditions on growth and reproductive maturation in both the Osaka and Sapporo populations. The effect of photoperiod on growth was different in the two populations. In both populations, however, reproductive maturation was induced by short days of photophase 14 h or less, and there was no obvious difference between the two populations, even though reproductive maturation in the wild commences in different seasons. This indicates the possibility that L. valentiana adapts to climatically different regions without changes in its critical daylength in photoperiodic response.","[Udaka, Hiroko; Numata, Hideharu] Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol & Geosci, Osaka 5588585, Japan",Osaka Metropolitan University,"Udaka, H (corresponding author), Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol & Geosci, Osaka 5588585, Japan.",udaka@sci.osaka-cu.ac.jp,,"Numata, Hideharu/0000-0003-3786-0701",,,,,28,3,3,0,10,ZOOLOGICAL SOC JAPAN,TOKYO,"TOSHIN-BUILDING, HONGO 2-27-2, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",0289-0003,,,ZOOL SCI,Zool.

The Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 2016 with the objective of strengthening the global response to climate change by keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees C. The agreement requires all Parties to submit their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is an important strategy for mitigating climate change, particularly in developing countries with large forests. Extensive tropical forest loss and degradation have increased awareness at the international level of the need to undertake large-scale ecological restoration, highlighting the need to identify cases in which restoration strategies can contribute to mitigation and adaptation. Here we consider Brazil as a case study to evaluate the benefits and challenges of implementing large-scale restoration programs in developing countries. The Brazilian NDC included the target of restoring and reforesting 12 million hectares of forests for multiple uses by 2030. Restoration of native vegetation is one of the foundations of sustainable rural development in Brazil and should consider multiple purposes, from biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation to social and economic development. However, ecological restoration still presents substantial challenges for tropical and mega-diverse countries, including the need to develop plans that are technically and financially feasible, as well as public policies and monitoring instruments that can assess effectiveness. The planning, execution, and monitoring of restoration efforts strongly depend on the context and the diagnosis of the area with respect to reference ecosystems (e.g., forests, savannas, grasslands, wetlands). In addition, poor integration of climate change policies at the national and subnational levels and with other sectorial policies constrains the large-scale implementation of restoration programs. The case of Brazil shows that slowing deforestation is possible; however, this analysis highlights the need for increased national commitment and international support for actions that require large-scale transformations of the forest sector regarding ecosystem restoration efforts. Scaling up the ambitions and actions of the Paris Agreement implies the need for a global framework that recognizes landscape restoration as a cost-effective nature-based solution and that supports countries in addressing their remaining needs, challenges, and barriers.","[Bustamante, Mercedes M.

This establishment is quite important because rural farmers are most vulnerable to impacts of CC. Therefore, there is a need to establish the actual knowledge on this aspect in order to meet the urgency for action on CC by using the endowed environmental resources. This knowledge will assist policy makers and CC practitioners. Design/methodology/approach This study employed systematic and simple random sampling procedures in selecting the districts and villages as study sites. It used both quantitative and qualitative data sets derived from climatic records, questionnaires survey, interviews and discussion. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope, and theme content were used for data analyses. Findings The results exhibited that most farmers have been greatly adapting to CC through numerous and well-known practices. However, there has been adoption of other new practices mainly influenced by new knowledge from extension services, environmental endowments and temporal environmental change. Although there has been varied perceptions on CC, the results indicate that most farmers (>70%) are aware of the changing climate and their knowledge corresponds to meteorological data. Originality/value Most farmers perceived that prolonged drought and erratic rains are the main indicators of CC. These indicators were the base of copping and adaptation mechanisms. Despite this, there is a need for all climate practitioners to join hands in improving the existing adaptation practices that can limit climate impacts in local areas.","[Mkonda, Msafiri Yusuph] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Coll Nat & Appl Sci, Morogoro, Tanzania",Sokoine University of Agriculture,"Mkonda, MY (corresponding author), Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Coll Nat & Appl Sci, Morogoro, Tanzania.",msamkonda81@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,57,1,1,3,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1477-7835,1758-6119,,MANAG ENVIRON QUAL,Manag.

Declining trends in the mortality impacts are found in spite of rising temperature trends. The finding remains unchanged if possible confounding effects of within-season acclimatization to heat and the mortality displacement effect are taken into account. Recent positive socioeconomic development, following the collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, and better public awareness of heat-related risks are likely the primary causes of the declining vulnerability. The results suggest that climate change may have relatively little influence on heat-related deaths, since changes in other factors that affect vulnerability of the population are dominant instead of temperature trends. It is essential to better understand the observed nonstationarity of the temperature-mortality relationship and the role of adaptation and its limits, both physiological and technological, and to address associated uncertainties in studies dealing with climate change projections of temperature-related mortality.","[Kysely, Jan; Plavcova, Eva] AS CR, Inst Atmospher Phys, Prague 14131 4, Czech Republic; [Plavcova, Eva] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Kysely, J (corresponding author), AS CR, Inst Atmospher Phys, Bocni 2 1401, Prague 14131 4, Czech Republic.",kysely@ufa.cas.cz,"Kysely, Jan/A-6982-2012; Plavcova, Eva Pejchova/H-6308-2014","Kysely, Jan/0000-0002-6371-6597","Czech Science Foundation [205/07/J044, P209/11/1985];  [205/07/1254]",Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); ,"The study was supported by the Czech Science Foundation under project 205/07/J044 and, during revisions, P209/11/1985.

We aim to identify under what conditions physical and economic tipping points for ski resorts may occur under changing climate in six Swiss ski resorts representing low, medium, and high elevation in the Alps. We use exploratory modeling (EMA) to assess climate change impacts on ski resorts under a range of futures adaptation options: (1) snowmaking and (2) diversifying the ski resorts' activities throughout the year. High-resolution climate projections (CH2018) were used to represent climate uncertainty. To improve the coverage of the uncertainty space and account for the climate models' intra-annual variability, we produced new climate realizations using resampling techniques. We demonstrate the importance of five factors, namely climate scenarios (RCPs), intra-annual climate variability, snow processes model, and two adaptation options, in ski resorts survival under a wide range of future scenarios. In six ski resorts, strong but highly variable decreases in the future number of days with good snow conditions for skiing (GSD) are projected. However, despite the different characteristics of the resorts, responses are similar and a shrunk of up to 31, 50, and 62 days in skiing season (Dec-April) is projected for the near-future (2020-2050), mid-future (2050-2080), and far-future (2070-2100), respectively. Similarly, in all cases, the number of days with good conditions for snowmaking (GDSM) will reduce up to 30, 50, and 74 days in the skiing season in the near-, mid-, and far-future horizons, respectively. We indicate that all ski resorts will face a reduction of up to 13%, 33%, and 51% of their reference period (1981-2010) revenue from winter skiing activities in the near-, mid-, and far-future horizons. Based on the outcomes of the EMA, we identify Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) and determine the adaptation options that ski resorts could implement to avoid tipping points in the future. We highlight the advantages of adaptive planning in a first of its kind application of DMDU techniques to winter tourism. We specify the possible adaptation options ranging from low revenue diversification and moderate snowmaking to high revenue diversification and large snowmaking and demonstrate when an adaptation action fails and a change to a new plan is needed. By the end of the century, we show that only ski resorts with ski lines above 1800-2000 m elevation will survive regardless of the climate scenarios.

Through six case studies, the chapter develops an understanding of the characteristics that shape each of the communities. By exploring the climate change hazards each of the case studies are experiencing now and forecast into the future, the physical and ecological profile and the human development condition, a view of the climate impacts for each is shaped. The six case study areas include towns that are large enough to be a regional centre, down to much less organised and resourced communities that are at a more subsistence level of development. The case studies include communities that range from tropical storm areas to more temperate climatic areas. Adaptation strategies for each case study are observed, drawing out the similarities and the differences. Insights and lessons learnt show that the bottom-up inclusion of all communities in shaping the adaptation approach is crucial, together with alignment of policy between governments from national to local. Also crucial is the resourcing of local councils which sit on the front line of many adaptation initiatives. The role of universities and other research organisations to provide data, skills training and a toolbox of methodologies to those in the front line leadership roles. An important insight is the collaborative opportunity for universities, communities and agencies to draw out the innovative adaptation strategies that can inform other coastal communities from the smallest village to the largest city.","[Doust, Ken; Swan, Andrew] Southern Cross Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Lismore, NSW, Australia; [Zhang, Ting-Ting] Aalborg Univ, Dept Planning, Aalborg, Denmark; [Sultana, Nahid] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Braneon, Christian] Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY USA; [Luetz, Johannes] Christian Heritage Coll, Carindale, Qld, Australia; [Casset, Laura] Andrews & Newnam Inc LAN, Lockwood, Austin, TX USA; [Fatoric, Sandra] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands; [Swan, Andrew] AJSwan Consulting Australia, Ballina, Australia; [Braneon, Christian] SciSpace LLC, Bethesda, MD USA; [Doust, Ken] Windana Res Pty Ltd, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wejs, Anja] Regionshuset Viborg, Viborg, Denmark",Southern Cross University; Aalborg University; University of New South Wales Sydney; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Delft University of Technology,"Doust, K (corresponding author), Southern Cross Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Lismore, NSW, Australia.",ken.doust@scu.edu.au,"Luetz, Johannes M./AAH-5131-2019","Luetz, Johannes M./0000-0002-9017-4471; Doust, Ken/0000-0002-0686-1659; Fatoric, Sandra/0000-0002-3712-0749; Wejs, Anja/0000-0002-6723-646X; Sultana, Nahid/0000-0001-5011-7213",,,,,21,2,2,2,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,OCT 15,2021,212,,,,,,,,105790,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105790,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105790,,JUL 2021,8,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Oceanography; Water Resources,WB5JF,,Green Published,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000703607300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

So what are the impacts of migration on the adaptive capacities and vulnerabilities of the origin and host communities, as well as of the migrants themselves? The objective of this conceptual and methodological paper is to identify possible different options for research into the consequences of migration for adaptation. The first section reviews how the migration-adaptation nexus has been addressed in the literature, confirming the potential of human mobility to build resilience and to increase adaptive capacities within complex and potentially maladaptive processes. The next section explores the potential impacts of migration that need to be studied, from three main vantage points: the migrants themselves, the community of origin, and the community of destination. A final section weighs the possible approaches and suggests solutions that may exist to advance empirical study of the migration-adaptation area nexus, so that it can address not just the causes, but also the consequences of migration in the context of environmental changes.","[Gemenne, Francois; Blocher, Julia] Univ Liege, Hugo Observ, Dept Geog, Liege, Belgium; [Gemenne, Francois] Univ Versailles CEARC UVSQ, Versailles, France; [Gemenne, Francois; Blocher, Julia] Sci Po Paris, 27 Rue St Guillaume, F-75007 Paris, France; [Blocher, Julia] UN, Univ Off, 2 United Nations Plaza, New York, NY 10016 USA",University of Liege; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Gemenne, F (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Hugo Observ, Dept Geog, Liege, Belgium.;Gemenne, F (corresponding author), Univ Versailles CEARC UVSQ, Versailles, France.;Gemenne, F (corresponding author), Sci Po Paris, 27 Rue St Guillaume, F-75007 Paris, France.",f.gemenne@ulg.ac.be; julia.blocher@sciencespo.fr,,,"European Union-financed Migration, Environment and Climate Change: Evidence for Policy (MECLEP) project","European Union-financed Migration, Environment and Climate Change: Evidence for Policy (MECLEP) project","This research was supported by the European Union-financed Migration, Environment and Climate Change: Evidence for Policy (MECLEP) project.

Environmental quality is characterized by meteorological data, soil and agronomic management, whereas genotypic sensitivity is embodied by combinations of physiological traits that determine the crop capture and partitioning of environmental resources over time. This paper illustrates how environmental quality and genotype responses can be studied by a combination of crop simulation and statistical modelling. We characterized the genotype by environment interaction for grain yield of a wheat population segregating for flowering time by simulating it using the the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) cropping systems model. For sites in the NE Australian wheat-belt, we used meteorological information as integrated by APSIM to classify years according to water, heat and frost stress. Results highlight that the frequency of years with more severe water and temperature stress has largely increased in recent years. Consequently, it is likely that future varieties will need to cope with more stressful conditions than in the past, making it important to select for flowering habits contributing to temperature and water-stress adaptation. Conditional on year types, we fitted yield response surfaces as functions of genotype, latitude and longitude to virtual multi-environment trials. Response surfaces were fitted by two-dimensional P-splines in a mixed-model framework to predict yield at high spatial resolution. Predicted yields demonstrated how relative genotype performance changed with location and year type and how genotype by environment interactions can be dissected. Predicted response surfaces for yield can be used for performance recommendations, quantification of yield stability and environmental characterization.","[Bustos-Korts, Daniela; Boer, Martin P.; van Eeuwijk, Fred A.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Biometris, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Chenu, Karine; Chapman, Scott] Univ Queensland, Queensland Alliance Agr & Food Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Zheng, Bangyou] CSIRO Agr & Food, Brisbane, Qld 4067, Australia; [Chapman, Scott] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4343, Australia",Wageningen University & Research; University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Queensland,"Bustos-Korts, D (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Biometris, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",daniela.bustoskorts@wur.nl,"Bustos-Korts, Daniela/O-7808-2015; Chapman, Scott/B-9673-2008; Chenu, Karine/A-8967-2009","Bustos-Korts, Daniela/0000-0003-3827-6726; Chapman, Scott/0000-0003-4732-8452; Chenu, Karine/0000-0001-7273-2057; Boer, Martin P./0000-0002-1879-4588",Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) of Australia; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) of Australia(Grains R&D Corp); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,The authors thank the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) of Australia and the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for the funding for this work.,,76,3,3,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",,2517-5025,,IN SILICO PLANTS,In Silico Plants,,2021,3,2,,,,,,,diab018,10.1093/insilicoplants/diab018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/insilicoplants/diab018,,,23,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Mathematical & Computational Biology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture; Plant Sciences; Mathematical & Computational Biology,YK6AN,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000745293200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study adds to existing literature by investigating the impacts of herders' climate change perceptions on adaptive strategies and distinguishing between the short-run and long-run effects. We use double-hurdle models and an unbalanced panel dataset of 1514 household observations collected from the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet for the period of 2016-2018. We find that perceptions of long-term temperature and rainfall changes lead farmers to adopt various adaptive strategies, whereas perceptions of short-term weather hazards mainly trigger production management strategies such as forage supplementation and herd destocking, without affecting long-term strategic planning such as engaging in non-agricultural jobs to diversify income sources. The findings that livestock farmers tend to adopt temporary strategies under short-term perceptions while seeking more resilient adaptations under long-term perceptions are robust, based on alternative measures for adaptation intensity and under different production scales. An understanding of these strategies provides a means of influencing the adaptive responses of vulnerable groups.","[Yang, Sansi; Yu, Le; Leng, Ganxiao; Qiu, Huanguang] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Qiu, HG (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",hgqiu@ruc.edu.cn,"Yu, Le/C-3701-2008; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; YANG, SANSI/L-8676-2018","Yu, Le/0000-0003-3115-2042; YANG, SANSI/0000-0002-7482-5246","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673290, 51711520318, 71861147002, 71803189]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71673290; No. 51711520318; No. 71861147002; No.71803189).,,71,2,2,10,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In 2009, the Australian government conducted its own assessment of climate change risks to the Australian coast. In South Australia, there has been progress in actions to address issues for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Of particular note are the South Australian policies on coast protection and new coastal development (1991), and coastal erosion, flooding and sea-level rise (1992). These state policies remain in place despite recent debate in the literature over global and regional rates and potential impacts of sea-level rise, which show sea-level rise is tracking at the upper end of projections. An increasing coastal population and a growing amount of coastal property and related infrastructure deemed at risk', is also creating pressure to review coastal policies nationwide. This paper presents an assessment of the vulnerability of the South Australian coast to the impacts of climate change from a biophysical perspective and incorporates primary research conducted into the public perceptions of risk, using data from sea change communities in regional South Australia. It investigates the social implications of, and potential for, adaptation beyond the existing policy framework. This paper argues that research into climate change-risk perceptions can offer insight into the development of more suitable adaptation policy at local and regional scales by considering the attitudes and perceptions of multiple and varied groups of coastal stakeholders. The paper concludes that perceptions of risk and opportunities for adaptation play an important role in the assessment of vulnerability, and are an important tool for informing policy decisions.","[Button, Christopher; Harvey, Nick] Univ Adelaide, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Button, C (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",christopher.button@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,38,5,5,0,47,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0372-1426,2204-0293,,T ROY SOC SOUTH AUST,Trans.

Global environmental change caused by the anthropogenic practices poses a threat to human life as well as biodiversity, and it is perpetuated by the lack of awareness of environmental sustainability. To spread awareness where it is lacking, it is important to determine which generation is more concerned about global environmental change. This study analysed the Knowledges, Attitudes and Practices of Gen X and Gen Z to determine which one is more concerned about global environmental change. There were no significant differences seen between the two generations in their respective levels of green knowledgeand their level of concern for climate change and environmental problems. There was, however, a significant difference in the peer discussions on global warming of the two cohorts; the results revealed that discussions are more common in the Gen X cohort. Investigating environmental perceptions in light of generational cohorts is of importance to environmental groups seeking to communicate with different generational cohorts to push the climate change movement forward, strategise better for climate adaptation plans and for policy makers to better advocate for climate action.","[Kgomo, Thapelo Josias; Modley, Lee-Ann Sade] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Kgomo, Thapelo Josias; Modley, Lee-Ann Sade] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Geog Environm Management & Energy Studies, Akad St,Kingsway Campus, Auckland Pk, South Africa",University of Johannesburg; University of Johannesburg,"Modley, LAS (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Fac Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.",lee-annm@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,77,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0373-6245,2151-2418,,S AFR GEOGR J,S.

The development of climate resilient agriculture (CRA) is critical to address or slow climate change and is also helpful to improve agricultural quality and efficiency. Based on a review of previous studies and a deep understanding of CRA goals, this paper introduced a comprehensive assessment framework to evaluate CRA. This assessment framework combined four dimensions, i.e., agricultural productivity, farmer income, climate adaptability, and the green development level, and has 71 evaluation indicators. The highlights of this framework are to analyze the impacts of climate change on agricultural development and to stress the synergy of mitigation and adaptation strategies. All indicators represent various factors related to the development of CRA and have been used in previous studies. Therefore, the comprehensive assessment framework can be used as an evaluation tool for analyzing the changes in agroecosystem resilience under climate change, which is also helpful to implement scientific management to ensure sustainable agricultural development and food security.","[Zong, Xuezheng; Liu, Xiaojie; Yin, Yunhe] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zong, Xuezheng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Chen, Gang] Minist Ecol & Environm, Environm Dev Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Yin, YH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yinyh@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,"Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [41831174]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA28130500, XDA20020202]",Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This study was supported by the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (41831174) and Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA28130500, XDA20020202).",,65,2,2,12,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.
