Power companies in places like California are enacting public safety power shutoffs (PSPS), a type of indirect climate adaptation policy, to reduce the risk of wildfires during periods of favorable wildfire conditions. While PSPS may reduce the risk of wildfires, it may also impact health and normal daily activities - e. g., inability to use certain home medical equipment or use a fan during a heat wave to being unable to attend school or perform work. Little is known about how Californians view PSPS, and how personal wildfire experience and existing vulnerabilities may relate to those views. In December 2020, a representative sample of 1,108 Californians was surveyed online and by phone to address this gap. Moderate levels of support for PSPS were observed. More personal wildfire experiences in terms of health, hazard exposures, and hazard outcomes were positively related to wildfire risk appraisal and hazard worries, which in turn was associated with more support for PSPS. However, worry about possible negative impacts from PSPS was negatively related to support for PSPS. Improved communications may provide targeted information to households that are the most exposed or vulnerable to wildfires and their impacts, as well as on ways exposure can be reduced. Climate adaptation policies informed by understanding the climate hazard and climate solutions risks the public faces may reduce unintended consequences, while also allowing for more rapid adaptation to climate change.","[Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle] Dept Earth Syst Sci, 473 Via Ortega,Room 160, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle] Woods Inst Environm, 473 Via Ortega,Room 160, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Wong-Parodi, G (corresponding author), Dept Earth Syst Sci, 473 Via Ortega,Room 160, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Wong-Parodi, G (corresponding author), Woods Inst Environm, 473 Via Ortega,Room 160, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",gwongpar@stanford.edu,,"Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle/0000-0001-5207-7489",,,,,105,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

Due to its characteristics, Spain is among the most vulnerable countries to climate change in the European Union (EU). Thus, spatial planning is considered one of the main instruments available to manage sustainable adaptation to climate change. This article presents an assessment framework for exploring climate change impacts using participatory geographic information systems (PGISs)-multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) spatial planning with the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE) in sustainable land-use adaptation. Assessment planning applies to any agroforestry system at a regional level for a municipality with higher vulnerability. An indicator-based model with five categorical values was developed to assess twelve possible impacts from climate change and the main threats of climate change to water sources, agriculture, soil, and land management. This model is available to manage sustainable land-use adaptation priorities for climate change in a spatial context. The model discusses the likelihood of implementing and adopting strategies for climate change adaptation as assessed by a sensitivity analysis and a professional online survey. Among the five strategies, scenario A (suitability map) accounts for 8.84% of the priority areas (v) and 2.13% of the hot spots (i) and was the scenario most supported by professionals, while scenario D (priority to socioeconomic) accounts for 3.07% of the priority areas and 10.12% of the hotspots, and the lowest number of professionals supported this scenario. The results summarize foreseeable problems derived from climate change effects that require urgent adaptation activities through spatial land assessment planning. Thus, this study provides some recommendations and limitations from which decision-makers can select the most suitable arrangement for an agroforestry system to make it climate-resilient, and the study is applicable to similar geographical and spatial locations.","[Jeong, Jin Su] Univ Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn & Diseno Ind, Dept Ingn Mecan Quim & Diserio Ind, Ronda Valencia 3, Madrid 28012, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Jeong, JS (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn & Diseno Ind, Dept Ingn Mecan Quim & Diserio Ind, Ronda Valencia 3, Madrid 28012, Spain.",jinsu.jeong@upm.es,"Jeong, Jin Su/L-4968-2014","Jeong, Jin Su/0000-0003-1370-0623","Juan de la Cierva-Formacion Program of Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Spain [JDC-2015]","Juan de la Cierva-Formacion Program of Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Spain","This research is supported by the Juan de la Cierva-Formacion Program of Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Spain (ref.

With drought, for instance, it is common to encounter such non-stationary data sets (time series). The objectives of this work are to formulate a rational data-driven approach that can consider non-stationary and time series on multiple random variables that can have generalized underlying probability distributions and dependence structures. 'the methodology proposed seeks to divide up the data into non-overlapping segments, each of which is treated as stationary with some underlying probability and dependence structure, while the long time series yields multiple such segments that are mutually independent. The Greedy Copula Segmentation (GCS) algorithm developed employs bast-fit probability distributions and copula functions after data-driven time series segmentation. Validation of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using a benchmark problem as well as a single-site realistic drought example. The proposed GCS . approach has potential use in climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) for any climate-related hazards involving non-stationary time series data.","[Heo, Taemin; Manuel, Lance] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 301 E Dean Keeton St C1700, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Heo, T (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 301 E Dean Keeton St C1700, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",taemin@utexas.edu; lmanuel@mail.utexas.edu,,,National Science Foundation [CMMI-1663044],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CMMI-1663044.

The literature discusses a range of adaptation approaches, including managing for resistance, resilience, and transformation; but many strategies have not yet been widely tested. This study employed in-depth interviews and scenario-based focus groups in the Upper Gunnison Basin in Colorado to learn how public land managers envision future ecosystem change, and how they plan to utilize different management approaches in the context of climate adaptation. While many managers evoked the past in thinking about projected climate impacts and potential responses, most managers in this study acknowledged and even embraced (if reluctantly) that many ecosystems will experience regime shifts in the face of climate change. However, accepting that future ecosystems will be different from past ecosystems led managers in different directions regarding how to respond and the appropriate role of management intervention. Some felt management actions should assist and even guide ecosystems toward future conditions. Others were less confident in projections and argued against transformation. Finally, some suggested that resilience could provide a middle path, allowing managers to help ecosystems adapt to change without predicting future ecosystem states. Scalar challenges and institutional constraints also influenced how managers thought about adaptation. Lack of institutional capacity was believed to constrain adaptation at larger scales. Resistance, in particular, was considered impractical at almost any scale due to institutional constraints. Managers negotiated scalar challenges and institutional constraints by nesting different approaches both spatially and temporally.","[Clifford, Katherine R.; Burkardt, Nina] USGS Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Social & Econ Anal Branch, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Clifford, Katherine R.; Travis, William R.; Rangwala, Imtiaz] Univ Colorado, Western Water Assessment, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Clifford, Katherine R.; Travis, William R.; Rangwala, Imtiaz] North Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Yung, Laurie; Wyborn, Carina] Univ Montana, Dept Soc & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Travis, William R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Rondeau, Renee] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Neely, Betsy] Nature Conservancy, Colorado Chapter, Boulder, CO USA; [Wyborn, Carina] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Inst Water Futures, Canberra, ACT, Australia",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Colorado State University; Nature Conservancy; Australian National University,"Clifford, KR (corresponding author), USGS Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Social & Econ Anal Branch, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.;Clifford, KR (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Western Water Assessment, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Clifford, KR (corresponding author), North Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",Katie.clifford@colorado.edu,"Wyborn, Carina/AAU-4818-2021","Travis, William/0000-0002-9197-1317; Clifford, Katherine/0000-0002-1385-8765; Wyborn, Carina/0000-0002-4314-347X",USGS North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center; USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station; NOAA's Western Water Assessment,USGS North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center; USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); NOAA's Western Water Assessment,"USGS North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center, USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station, and NOAA's Western Water Assessment.",,78,7,7,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

This paper provides a place-based analysis of constraints and opportunities for adaptation to climate change, with a specific focus on water use, in two districts in southeast Kazakhstan. Data were collected by 2 multi-stakeholder participatory workshops, 21 semi-structured in-depth interviews, and secondary statistical data. The present-day agricultural system is characterised by enduring Soviet-era management structures, but without state inputs that previously sustained agricultural productivity. Low margins of profitability on many privatised farms mean that attempts to implement integrated water management have produced water users associations unable to maintain and upgrade a deteriorating irrigation infrastructure. Although actors engage in tactical adaptation measures, necessary structural adaptation of the irrigation system remains difficult without significant public or private investments. Market-based water management models have been translated ambiguously to this region, which fails to encourage efficient water use and hinders adaptation to water stress. In addition, a mutual interdependence of informal networks and formal institutions characterises both state governance and everyday life in Kazakhstan. Such interdependence simultaneously facilitates operational and tactical adaptation, but hinders structural adaptation, as informal networks exist as a parallel system that achieves substantive outcomes while perpetuating the inertia and incapacity of the state bureaucracy. This article has relevance for critical understanding of integrated water management in practice and adaptation to climate change in post-Soviet institutional settings more broadly.","[Barrett, Tristam; Feola, Giuseppe] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6AB, Whiteknights, England; [Barrett, Tristam] Max Planck Inst Social Anthropol, Halle, Germany; [Khusnitdinova, Marina; Krylova, Viktoria] Kazakh Inst Geog, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",University of Reading; Max Planck Society; Institute of Geography of the Republic of Kazakhstan,"Feola, G (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6AB, Whiteknights, England.",g.feola@reading.ac.uk,,"Krylova, Viktoriya/0000-0002-7811-5161; Feola, Giuseppe/0000-0003-1069-503X",United Kingdom's Newton Fund Institutional Links Programme [172722855]; The British Council [172722855] Funding Source: researchfish,United Kingdom's Newton Fund Institutional Links Programme; The British Council,"The project Climate Change, Water Resources and Food Security in Kazakhstan was funded by the United Kingdom's Newton Fund Institutional Links Programme (grant number 172722855).

Yet, climate change knowledge often travels uncomfortably across scales and needs constant re-interpretation as it is applied in different spatial contexts. This requires the examination of how scientific and local knowledge about climate change travel across social systems and shape local meanings and adaptive actions on climate change. Using an interpretive social science analysis of environmental change, this study investigates development planning as a key boundary object for handling both kinds of knowledge and explores experiential knowledge of climate change held by planning officers from the coastal landscape of the island province of Bohol, Philippines. Drawing upon face-to-face interviews, mental maps, and planning documents review, main results first characterise three experiential ways of knowing about climate change across spaces of lived experiences and spaces of maps and plans. Then, we show how planners engage with climate change adaptation by combining national, techno-scientific and local, on-the-ground ways of knowing, offering a venue in which experiential knowledge on climate change is used for building planning significance and making more grounded accounts of adaptation moving forward in planning policy and practice.","[Dujardin, Sebastien; Dendoncker, Nicolas] Univ Namur, Dept Geog, Namur, Belgium; [Hermesse, Julie] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Anal Change Contemporary & Hist Soc, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",University of Namur; Universite Catholique Louvain; Institute for the Analysis of Change in Contemporary & Historical Societies (IACS),"Dujardin, S (corresponding author), Univ Namur, Dept Geog, Namur, Belgium.",sebastien.dujardin@unamur.be,,"Dendoncker, Nicolas/0000-0001-9129-9025; Hermesse, Julie/0000-0001-6415-5480",Fund for Research Training in Industry and Agriculture (FRIA) from the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FNRS),Fund for Research Training in Industry and Agriculture (FRIA) from the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FNRS)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),"This research was supported by the Fund for Research Training in Industry and Agriculture (FRIA) from the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FNRS).

It encompasses the actions of a wide range of actors, including local governments close to people and their activities affected by climate change. Functioning ICM also offers opportunities for reducing risks and building resilience. This article applied a modified capitals approach framework (CAF), consisting of five capitals, to assess the status of county government capacity to respond to climate change within the context of coastal governance in three county governments in Kenya. The baseline was defined in terms of governance relating to the implementation of the interrelated policy systems of ICM and coastal climate change adaptation (CCA). The CAF framework provided a systematic approach to building a governance baseline against which to assess the progress of county governments in responding to climate change. It identified gaps in human capacity, financial resource allocation to adaptation and access to climate change information.

The City of Prince George, in British Columbia, Canada, has been adjusting to impacts for years and there is a high level of local awareness of climate change. The purpose of this study was to collaborate with City staff and other organizations to undertake action-oriented research with the goal of creating a local adaptation strategy. Steps taken toward this goal included: producing downscaled climate scenarios; facilitating a workshop with local practitioners to prioritize impacts; gathering public feedback regarding impacts; and triangulating sources of information to determine community adaptation priorities. Changes to forests and increased flooding are the top local adaptation priorities, and impacts related to transportation, severe weather and water supply are high priorities. Other impacts, such as health effects and agricultural changes, are also important but did not rank highly using a risk framework focused on negative physical effects. Local impacts, actions the City is undertaking to address them and suggestions for implementing adaptation measures are summarized. The process of creating an adaptation strategy has proven highly valuable in Prince George and has precipitated further engagement and action. Due to the low profile of adaptation and limited resources in many communities, researchers and practitioners must capitalize on opportunities to incorporate adaptation into existing plans and processes. Lessons from the Prince George experience can be applied to other communities as they strive to effectively adapt to climate change.","[Picketts, Ian M.] Univ Northern British Columbia BC, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Curry, John] Univ No British Columbia, Sch Environm Planning, Prince George, BC V2L 5P2, Canada; [Dery, Stephen J.] Univ No British Columbia, Environm Sci & Engn Program, Prince George, BC V2L 5P2, Canada; [Cohen, Stewart J.] Environm Canada, Adaptat & Impacts Res Sect, Vancouver, BC V6C 3S5, Canada; [Cohen, Stewart J.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6C 3S5, Canada",University of Northern British Columbia; University of Northern British Columbia; Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of British Columbia,"Picketts, IM (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia BC, 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.",picketts@unbc.ca,,,Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions graduate fellowship; Natural Resources Canada Regional Adaptation Collaborative,Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions graduate fellowship; Natural Resources Canada Regional Adaptation Collaborative(Natural Resources Canada),"A great number of people and organizations have been invaluable in this project.

Based on the integration of adaptation theory and the existing literature on the use of ICTs in development, we present an analytical model for conceptualizing the contribution of existing ICTs to adaptation, and a framework for evaluating ICT success. We apply the framework to four case studies of ICTs in use for early warning systems and managing extreme events in the Latin American and the Caribbean countries. We propose that existing ICTs can support adaptation through enabling access to critical information for decision-making, coordinating actors and building social capital. ICTs also allow actors to communicate and disseminate their decision experience, thus enhancing opportunities for collective learning and continual improvements in adaptation processes. In this way, ICTs can both communicate the current and potential impacts of climate change, as well as engage populations in the development of viable adaptation strategies.","[Eakin, Hallie] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Wightman, Pedro M.] Univ Norte, Dept Ingn Sistemas, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Hsu, David] Univ Penn, Sch Design, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gil Ramon, Vladimir R.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Maestria Desarrollo Ambiental, Lima, Peru; [Gil Ramon, Vladimir R.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Ciencias Sociales, Lima, Peru; [Gil Ramon, Vladimir R.] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst Ctr Environm Sustainabil, New York, NY USA; [Fuentes-Contreras, Eduardo] Univ Talca, Fac Ciencias Agr, Dept Prod Agr, Talca, Chile; [Fuentes-Contreras, Eduardo] Univ Talca, Fac Ciencias Agr, Millennium Nucleus Ctr Mol Ecol & Evolutionary Ap, Talca, Chile; [Cox, Megan P.] Caribbean Inst Meteorol & Hydrol, Bridgetown, Barbados; [Hyman, Tracy-Ann N.] Univ W Indies, Climate Studies Grp, Mona, Jamaica; [Pacas, Carlos] Univ Don Bosco, Inst Invest Energia, San Salvador, El Salvador; [Borraz, Fernando] Banco Cent Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Borraz, Fernando] Univ Republica, Dept Econ, Fac Ciencias Soci, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Gonzalez-Brambila, Claudia] Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Barido, Diego Ponce de Leon; Kammen, Daniel M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kammen, Daniel M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Barido, Diego Ponce de Leon; Kammen, Daniel M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Renewable & Appropriate Energy Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Universidad del Norte Colombia; University of Pennsylvania; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru; Columbia University; Universidad de Talca; Universidad de Talca; University West Indies Mona Jamaica; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley","Eakin, H (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",hallie.eakin@asu.edu,"Wightman, Pedro/M-9795-2018; Fuentes-Contreras, Eduardo/A-7595-2008","Wightman, Pedro/0000-0002-7641-2090; Fuentes-Contreras, Eduardo/0000-0003-3567-3830; Eakin, Hallie/0000-0001-8253-1320; Gonzalez Brambila, Claudia/0000-0001-7633-5091; Gil Ramon, Vladimir Roberto/0000-0002-8477-2280; Hsu, David/0000-0003-1108-9656",United States Fulbright Nexus Scholars Program,United States Fulbright Nexus Scholars Program,"This article is the result of an international collaboration funded by the United States Fulbright Nexus Scholars Program, 2012-2013.",,70,16,16,0,60,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Most scholarly work has identified resource constraints as being the most significant determinants of adaptation. However, empirical research on adaptation has so far mostly not addressed the importance of measurable and alterable psychological factors in determining adaptation. Drawing from the literature in psychology and behavioural economics, we develop a socio-cognitive Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPACC). MPPACC separates out the psychological steps to taking action in response to perception, and allows one to see where the most important bottlenecks occur-including risk perception and perceived adaptive capacity, a factor largely neglected in previous climate change research. We then examine two case studies-one from urban Germany and one from rural Zimbabwe-to explore the validity of MPPACC to explaining adaptation. In the German study, we find that MPPACC provides better statistical power than traditional socio-economic models. In the Zimbabwean case study, we find a qualitative match between MPPACC and adaptive behaviour. Finally, we discuss the important implications of our findings both on vulnerability and adaptation assessments, and on efforts to promote adaptation through outside intervention.

The paper is based on a qualitative case study on watershed development interventions conducted in two villages in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. The research showed that resource management, adaptation, and food security institutions in Ethiopia are a result of struggles between containment strategies of the Ethiopian state and counter containment strategies of local communities. While the state's containment institutions allowed it to mobilize a large number of rural residents for its resource management interventions, the counter containment strategies from local communities limited the potential contribution of the interventions for adaptation and food security endeavors of the state. From an institutional diagnostic perspective two conclusions are made, one empirical and another theoretical. The empirical part of the paper concludes that the Ethiopian state is using institutions to contain its population towards state-driven development pathways, which is essential to understand watershed development and state-led natural resource management interventions. The theoretical portion concludes that although institutions are often portrayed as static elements of social life, in fact they are also dynamic, socially produced, and could be coopted by powerful actors.","[Gebreyes, Million] Univ Bonn, Inst Geog, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Gebreyes, M (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Geog, Bonn, Germany.",milliongeb@gmail.com,,,German Academic Exchange Program (DAAD); Bayreuth International Graduate School of African Studies (BIGSAS),German Academic Exchange Program (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Bayreuth International Graduate School of African Studies (BIGSAS),This paper is extracted from my PhD dissertation and modified to suite the special issue.

It assessed changes in future climate (2031-2055) relative to the baseline period (1992-2016) and their impacts on the yields of 3 staple food crops (maize, rice and cassava). Robustness of the identified adaptation options adopted by local farmers was examined with a view to evaluating the opportunities of integrating indigenous adaptation options for climate-smart agriculture (CSA). A regional climate-crop modeling system (RegCM-DSSAT) and structured questionnaire were used for the study. A warmer and wetter future climate was projected with higher frequency of occurrence of false start of rainfall. Results also suggested future rise in the yield of cassava (8.2%) but declines in maize (- 9.2%) and rice (- 3.6%). Use of organic fertilizer, irrigation or fadama farming system and change in planting dates were ranked highly efficient indigenous adaptation strategies for improved crop yields. Model simulations projected 3.9% increase in cassava yield when irrigation farming system was adopted. This approach was found to offset the negative impact of future warming on the yields of maize and rice and increased their yields by 6.53% and 1.31%, respectively. Combined use of fertilizer and change in planting date was found to significantly enhance yields of maize (27.53%) and rice (21.49%). The paper concludes that integrated approach to indigenous climate change adaptation strategies, as required in CSA, could significantly reduce negative effects of future warming on food crop yields.","[Olajire, Mudasiru A.; Aderanti, A.] Osun State Coll Educ, Sch Sci, Dept Phys, Ila Orangun, Nigeria; [Matthew, Olaniran J.] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Inst Ecol & Environm Studies, Ife, Nigeria; [Omotara, Opeyemi A.] Osun State Coll Educ, Sch Vocat & Tech Educ, Dept Agr, Ila Orangun, Nigeria",Obafemi Awolowo University,"Olajire, MA (corresponding author), Osun State Coll Educ, Sch Sci, Dept Phys, Ila Orangun, Nigeria.",abefematt@yahoo.com,,,,,,,72,3,3,2,18,SPRINGER INDIA,NEW DELHI,"7TH FLOOR, VIJAYA BUILDING, 17, BARAKHAMBA ROAD, NEW DELHI, 110 001, INDIA",2249-720X,2249-7218,,AGR RES,Agric.

Adaptation studies commonly rely on agricultural systems models to integrate multiple components of production systems such as crops, weather, soil and farmers' management decisions. Previous adaptation studies have mostly focused on isolated monocultures. However, in many agricultural regions worldwide, multi-crop rotations better represent local production systems. It is unclear how adaptation interventions influence crops grown in sequences. We develop a catchment-scale assessment to investigate the effects of tactical adaptations (choice of genotype and sowing date) on yield and underlying crop-soil factors of rotations. Based on locally surveyed data, a silage-maize followed by catch-crop-wheat rotation was simulated with the APSIM model for the RCP 8.5 emission scenario, two time periods (1985-2004 and 2080-2100) and six climate models across the Kaituna catchment in New Zealand. Results showed that direction and magnitude of climate change impacts, and the response to adaptation, varied spatially and were affected by rotation carryover effects due to agronomical (e.g. timing of sowing and harvesting) and soil (e.g. residual nitrogen, N) aspects. For example, by adapting maize to early-sowing dates under a warmer climate, there was an advance in catch crop establishment which enhanced residual soil N uptake. This dynamics, however, differed with local environment and choice of short-or long-cycle maize genotypes. Adaptation was insufficient to neutralize rotation yield losses in lowlands but consistently enhanced yield gains in highlands, where other constraints limited arable cropping. The positive responses to adaptation were mainly due to increases in solar radiation interception across the entire growth season. These results provide deeper insights on the dynamics of climate change impacts for crop rotation systems. Such knowledge can be used to develop improved regional impact assessments for situations where multi-crop rotations better represent predominant agricultural systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Not only do these effects pose risks to children's health, safety and survival in the near term, their younger age means they will be exposed to the increasing consequences into the future and for a greater proportion of their lives. As such, children are often presented in climate change debates, research and practice as being especially vulnerable and in particular need of support. However, this can lead to the portrayal of children as passive victims. This paper provides an overview of adaptation research and practice literature concerning children and young people, with a particular focus on whether and how child-centred responses to climate change can contribute to building the resilience of households and communities.

This article concludes that the Organic Act and park-specific enabling acts, as interpreted by the courts, grant the Park Service wide discretion to pursue management options for adaptation to climate change impacts on national park resources. It also concludes that the Organic Act, properly understood, does impose some necessary constraints on agency decision-making, constraints that prevent inappropriate development projects and that require thoughtful decision-making to minimize the risk of unintended management consequences. Overall, the Organic Act will remain relevant into the next century.","[Biber, Eric] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Law, Boalt Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Esposito, Elisabeth Long] Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck LLP, Santa Barbara, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Biber, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Law, Boalt Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,110,1,2,3,13,"UNIV NEW MEXICO, SCH LAW",ALBUQUERQUE,"MSC11-6070, 1 UNIVERSITY NEW MEXICO, ALBUQUERQUE, NM 87131 USA",0028-0739,,,NAT RESOUR J,Nat.

An array of autonomous riparian zone (RZ) management adaptations have emerged in Australia that have captivated the international community but have yet to be effectively delivered. This paper reviews government policies, governance structures, the application of market-based instruments and voluntary measures to ask why Australia has not achieved more. We find promise in: the resurgence of application of indigenous knowledge and engagement in management; understanding of the catalytic roles of women, means of better engaging individuals, strengthening of social networks and fostering leadership in rural communities; transferring of urban resources to their rural hinterlands; better engaging communities through campaigns, businesses and political leaders; and strategic research programmes. These findings have application in other difficult hydrologies. We contend that government and market-based programmes are underpinned by voluntary and cultural institutions, and that these require strengthening through fostering of an ethic to conserve RZs as the core element of the biophysical and human landscape. It calls for stakeholders to adopt a common vision for conservation of RZs that can sustain implementation through institutional changes.","[Pittock, Jamie] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Marshall, Nadine] James Cook Univ, CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Capon, Tim] Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Nat Resources, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Parsons, Meg] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Robertson, Alistar I.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6008, Australia; [Casaril, Carolina] CSIRO, Black Mt Labs, Canberra, ACT 2602, Australia",Australian National University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); James Cook University; University of Sydney; University of Auckland; University of Western Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Pittock, J (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",Jamie.Pittock@anu.edu.au,"Pittock, Jamie/N-1541-2018; Capon, Tim R/J-5911-2013; Marshall, Nadine/D-9339-2011; Parsons, Meg/C-2405-2019","Pittock, Jamie/0000-0001-6293-996X; Capon, Tim R/0000-0002-5443-6710; Marshall, Nadine/0000-0003-4463-3558; Robertson, Alistar/0000-0003-2445-3293; Parsons, Meg/0000-0001-8721-659X",Australian National Climate Change Adaption Research Facility; UNESCO Chair in Transboundary Water Economics and Water Governance; Australian Research Council,Australian National Climate Change Adaption Research Facility; UNESCO Chair in Transboundary Water Economics and Water Governance; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This paper was an output of a workshop, 'Riparian ecosystems and climate change', in June 2011 funded by the Australian National Climate Change Adaption Research Facility.

However, incomplete data on varietal release and adoption is often the reality in many countries hindering informed decision-making on breeding and varietal dissemination strategies to effectively adapt to climate change. In taking the example of potatoes in India, we analyze the extent to which the potato sector is resilient to climate change. We do so by comparing state-level climate change projections with adoption of high resistant and tolerant potato varieties to major abiotic and biotic stresses. Release and adoption data was collected in 2016 in six expert elicitation workshops conducted with 130 experts from the potato value chain in Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. We found that from the total of 81 releases, 45 improved varieties are adopted in India and that in each state high resistant and tolerant varieties are cultivated providing some degree of varietal resilience. Early maturity has been the most important and heat tolerance is the least important trait. Comparing climate projections with adoption rates of high resistant and tolerant varieties, we found that Gujarat is relatively most resilient. In other states we found some mismatches between climate projections and adopted specific varietal traits. Our results allow policy-makers and breeders to better prioritize investments into breeding for specific traits and dissemination strategies.","[Pradel, Willy; Hareau, Guy] Int Potato Ctr, Social & Nutr Sci Div, Lima 15024 12, Peru; [Gatto, Marcel] Int Potato Ctr, Social & Nutr Sci Div, Pham Dong St, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Pandey, S.

Less understood is how changing beliefs shape the adaptive capacity of communities responding to climate change. In the last century sub-Saharan Africa has experienced a transformation in beliefs. Since 1900 Christians have increased 70-fold while in rural areas Traditional Beliefs and associated Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) continue to influence the lived practices of vulnerable rural communities. Using two case studies of rural communities in Malawi (Bolero) and Zambia (Monze) we explore how Christianity and Traditional beliefs (and associated TEK) co-exist and assess if, and how, holding multiple belief systems affects climate-sensitive livelihood practices of food production. In Bolero we observed a lack of tensions between belief systems with Traditional leaders and elders noting the flexibility of adhering to both belief systems. In Monze however, basing livelihood decisions on the practice of rain-rituals resulted in strong tensions. In both communities elders noted their concern of how changing beliefs affect adherence to TEK management practices. We find that culture and beliefs play an important role in adaptive capacity but are not static. In the context of changing beliefs, adaptive capacity will be influenced by how different belief systems co-exist and how epistemological and intergenerational frictions are negotiated. As climate services become the focus of research and government interventions in vulnerable regions, avoiding culturally and economically expensive mal-adaptation will require giving attention to the complexity and dynamism of changing religious landscapes.","[Murphy, Conor] Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Geog, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Tembo, Mavuto] Mzuzu Univ, Dept Land Management, Mzuzu, Malawi; [Phiri, Adrian; Yerokun, Olusegun] Mulungushi Univ, Sch Agr & Nat Resources, Kabwe, Zambia; [Grummell, Bernie] Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Adult & Community Educ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",Maynooth University; Maynooth University,"Murphy, C (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Geog, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",conor.murphy@nuim.ie,,"Murphy, Conor/0000-0003-4891-2650",Irish Aid,Irish Aid(CGIAR),"This work was undertaken as part of the project 'Transformative Engagement Network (TEN)', funded under the Programme of Strategic Co-operation between Irish Aid and Higher Education and Research Institutes.

Farmers are particularly vulnerable to such adverse effects given their limited adaptive capacity. In this regard, this study examines the local adaptation experiences and practices of farmers in a second-class farming municipality. It is then based on the assumption that a lay understanding of how farmers perceive and adapt to climate change can be used to provide implications for enhancing their adaptive capacity. Using a combination of qualitative data from key informant interviews and focus group discussion and secondary data from government agencies, this paper reveals that farmers perceive serious health and livelihood risks despite having limited knowledge of how climate change occurs. They recognize that changes in climate conditions have caused considerable effects to temperature and rainfall which, in turn, have posed serious challenge to water supply. Their farming activities are also at risk from interrelated impacts such as damage to crops, pest infestation, and decrease in rice yield. Hence, they consistently employ common adaptation measures as direct responses to climate variability such as the planting of new crop varieties, use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, use of technology in farming, and diversification of household income. However, the lack of financial resources hinders them from utilizing new adaptation techniques and technologies, which they perceive to be more appropriate and beneficial. These results suggest a more conscious effort of transforming coping strategies to short-term climate variability into adaptation measures to long-term climate changes.","[Penalba, Ericson H.] Bulacan State Univ, Meneses Campus, Bulakan, Bulacan, Philippines",Bulacan State University,"Penalba, EH (corresponding author), Bulacan State Univ, Meneses Campus, Bulakan, Bulacan, Philippines.",ericson.penalba@bulsu.edu.ph,"Peñalba, Ericson/AAL-6731-2020","Peñalba, Ericson/0000-0001-5834-4859",,,,,51,0,0,2,16,"BRANDON UNIV, RURAL DEV DEPT",BRANDON,"270 18TH ST, BRANDON, MB R7A 6A9, CANADA",1712-8277,,,J RURAL COMMUNITY D,J.

Because the magnitude of climate change is highly uncertain, the robustness (i.e., ability to perform satisfactorily over a wide range of possible climate conditions) should be evaluated for water resource systems. However, for climateinformed robustness-based methods, the effects of climate model credibility on water resource system robustness have rarely been explored, and are important for the development of climate change adaptation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of general circulation model (GCM) credibility for projecting of future climate forcing on water resource system robustness. By stepwise culling of GCM with the lowest credibility, we reduced the number of GCMs from 13 to the three with the highest credibility in order to calculate robustness. In general, 176 numerical modelling experiments were designed using 11 operations of culling GCMs according to credibility, developing two reservoir operation models, and assuming two probability distribution functions (PDFs) under four time periods. The third largest power plant in the world (i.e., the Xiluodu Reservoir (XLD)) was selected as a case study. Results showed that excluding GCMs with lower credibility resulted in higher robustness for XLD because GCMs with higher credibility used to calculate robustness tended to be located in the acceptable subregion of the climate change space. The results of this study demonstrated the significance of GCM credibility on water resource system robustness and decision making. Ignorance regarding GCM credibility may lead to over- or under-estimation of water resource system robustness, leading to biased climate change adaptation decisions. Additionally, the number of GCMs should be large enough to prevent almost all GCMs from being located in a single subregion of the climate change space to account for uncertainty in projected future climate forcing.","[Zhang, Ruikang; Cheng, Lei; Liu, Pan; Huang, Kangdi; Gong, Yu; Qin, Shujing; Liu, Dedi] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ruikang; Cheng, Lei; Liu, Pan; Huang, Kangdi; Gong, Yu; Qin, Shujing; Liu, Dedi] Hubei Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Water Resources, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ruikang; Cheng, Lei; Liu, Pan; Huang, Kangdi; Gong, Yu; Qin, Shujing; Liu, Dedi] Wuhan Univ, Hubei Prov Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Con, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Cheng, L (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.;Cheng, L (corresponding author), Hubei Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Water Resources, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.;Cheng, L (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Hubei Prov Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Con, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",lei.cheng@whu.edu.cn,"liu, pan/HIR-9103-2022; Cheng, Lei/AAD-8855-2022; qin, Shujing/HMV-5511-2023","Cheng, Lei/0000-0002-5298-9573; ","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC0407202]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51961145104, 41890822, 51879193]; Overseas Expertise Introduction Project for Discipline Innovation (111 Project) - Ministry of Education and Affairs P.

An assessment of the stakeholder engagement process within the CLIMSAVE project, including evaluations by participating stakeholders, is used to illustrate the STIR approach, highlighting its value for improving stakeholder involvement within two case studies of a highly complex climate change adaptation project. In comparison to other approaches, STIR directly addresses major stakeholder engagement challenges and simultaneously covers new ground to provide an encompassing and structured approach for integrating stakeholder engagement in research.

Previous studies, however, have been limited to aesthetic change, and it remains unclear how much the aesthetic change would affect human welfare. To address this issue and gain insights into climate change adaptation policies, we conducted a choice experiment survey using digitally manipulated images based on climate change scenarios and natural scientific knowledge in a mountainous national park in Japan. We uncovered that park visitors appreciate the alpine landscapes that include snow patches on mountains and some types of alpine flowers by analyzing the data from 445 respondents. Conversely, both the invasion of alpine vegetation by dwarf bamboo and the disappearance of snow patches due to climate change substantially deteriorated the perceived aesthetic benefits from alpine landscapes. The economic loss caused by climate-induced landscape degradation was estimated at more than 100 USD per visitor, at maximum; the disappearance of snow patches and invasion by dwarf bamboo reduced the benefits by approximately 13 USD and 101 USD, respectively. Our findings suggest that sustaining the aesthetic value of alpine landscapes in national parks via climate change adaptation has potentially significant economic benefits. By supposing that the mountain national park attracts 70,000 visitors in summer, climate change would cause as a minimum of eight million USD economic loss at the park without appropriate measures annually. Our findings highlight the importance of climate change measures by considering climate change impacts on social benefits associated with alpine landscapes.","[Mameno, Kota] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Dept Resource & Environm Econ, 468-1 Aramaki Azaaoba, Aoba Sendai, Miyagi 9808572, Japan; [Kubo, Takahiro; Oguma, Hiroyuki] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Biodivers Div, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kubo, Takahiro] Univ Kent, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Kubo, Takahiro] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Amagai, Yukihiro] Shiretoko Nat Fdn, Shari, Hokkaido, Japan; [Shoji, Yasushi] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",Tohoku University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of Kent; University of Oxford; Hokkaido University,"Mameno, K (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Dept Resource & Environm Econ, 468-1 Aramaki Azaaoba, Aoba Sendai, Miyagi 9808572, Japan.",kota.mameno@gmail.com,"Kubo, Takahiro/E-1243-2012; Mameno, Kota/AAF-2197-2020; Shoji, Yasushi/B-7756-2012; Shoji, Yasushi/ABC-9052-2021","Kubo, Takahiro/0000-0002-4832-5539; Mameno, Kota/0000-0001-8866-7421; Shoji, Yasushi/0000-0002-4363-3890; Shoji, Yasushi/0000-0002-4363-3890","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19H04337, 16K00697]; Ministry of the Environment, Japan; SOMPO Environment Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19H04337, 16K00697] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); SOMPO Environment Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Nos. 19H04337, 16K00697, and Overseas Research Fellowships); Ministry of the Environment, Japan (the Environmental Economics and Policy Study); and the SOMPO Environment Foundation (Grant Program for Doctoral Course Students).",,71,7,8,15,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

We present a framework to guide the implementation of science-action partnerships based on a real-world case study of a partnership between a local municipality and an academic institution to bridge the science-action gap in the eThekwini Municipal Area, South Africa. This partnership aims to inform the implementation of sustainable land-use planning, biodiversity conservation, environmental management, and climate change adaptation practice and contributes to the development of human capacity in these areas of expertise. Using a transdisciplinary approach, implementation-driven research is being conducted to develop several decision-making products to better inform land-use planning and management. Lessons learned through this partnership are synthesized and presented as a framework of enabling actions operating at different levels, from the individual to the interorganizational. Enabling actions include putting in place enabling organizational preconditions, assembling a functional well-structured team, and actively building interpersonal and individual collaborative capacity. Lessons learned in the case study emphasize the importance of building collaborative capacity and social capital, and paying attention to the process of transdisciplinary research to achieve more tangible science, management, and policy objectives in science-action partnerships. By documenting and reflecting on the process, this case study provides conceptual and practical guidance on bridging the science-action gap through partnerships.","[Cockburn, Jessica; Rouget, Mathieu; Musakwa, Walter; Mutanga, Onisimo; Odindi, John; Odindo, Alfred; Proches, Serban; Wale, Edilegnaw] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Durban, South Africa; [Cockburn, Jessica] Rhodes Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Grahamstown, South Africa; [Slotow, Rob; Roberts, Debra; Boon, Richard; Douwes, Errol; O'Donoghue, Sean; Downs, Colleen T.; Mukherjee, Shomen; Mwabvu, Tarombera; Ramdhani, Syd; Ray-Mukherjee, Jayanti; Sershen; Schoeman, M.

In this paper, we describe the approach, methods, and results of a multi-partner pilot project that was used to assess vulnerabilities of natural and built systems to climate change and develop adaptation options for inclusion in a climate change adaptation strategy for the Lake Simcoe Watershed in Ontario, Canada. The multi-method approach, which included workshops, face-to-face meetings, and an iterative Policy Delphi survey, proved to be efficient and effective in helping identify and understand multi-sector climate change vulnerabilities in the watershed, and in bringing climate change experts and decision-makers together to work on a proactive, science-based policy outcome. Challenges experienced during the adaptation planning process included short project timelines, limited financial resources, and a lack of expertise to address regional vulnerabilities in some sectors. However, the non-linear, iterative nature of the approach provided the capacity required to respond to some of these capacity issues during the pilot project. Overall, the process demonstrated the importance of engaging appropriate expertise and adopting a flexible and stakeholder-enabling adaptation framework. Perspectives for strengthening links among the scientific and policy-making communities are highlighted, and practical lessons learned are provided to help other decision-makers begin and amplify the process of integrating climate change into public policy and planning initiatives.

Inuit across the Circumpolar North have called for public health monitoring and response systems that integrate environmental and human health data, and provide localized information to support place-based adaptation strategies. The goal of this research was to qualitatively characterize how Inuit in Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Labrador, Canada, identify, interpret, and use environmental and climatic observations to make decisions that will protect and promote their health and wellbeing in the context of climate change. Inuit community research leads conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with Rigolet Inuit to identify and contextualize environmental and climatic observations that were important for monitoring. Under the direction of community research leads, qualitative data from interviews were analyzed by the core research team using constant-comparative thematic analysis methods to ensure emergent findings were grounded in the voices and perspectives of Rigolet Inuit. Rigolet Inuit considered all climatic and environmental observations to be connected and emphasized the importance of collective, intergenerational knowledge in understanding and adapting to current and future climate change. The ways that Rigolet Inuit interpreted and used these observations for making decisions depended on perceived relevance and importance of observations, trustworthiness of information, and personal thresholds for risks. Knowledge shared by Rigolet Inuit demonstrated the nuanced, relational nature of how climatic and environmental observations are identified, interpreted, and used in decision-making for place-based climate change adaptation. It is important to prioritize these place-based and locally validated ways of knowing and learning about the land in the development of integrated monitoring systems to inform adaptation strategies that are based on a community's existing resilience and creativity, and premised on relationships among people and places. In so doing, we can identify entry points for improving the ways in which monitoring systems function to link environment and health data, and inform robust, evidence-based adaptation strategies and policies.","[Sawatzky, Alexandra; Jones-Bitton, Andria; Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Sawatzky, Alexandra; Cunsolo, Ashlee] Labrador Inst Mem Univ, Sch Arctic & Subarctic Studies, 219 Hamilton River Rd,POB 490,Stn B, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF A0P 1E0, Canada; [Shiwak, Inez] Torngat Wildlife Plants & Fisheries Secretariat, 217 Hamilton River Rd, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF A0P 1E0, Canada; [Flowers, Charlie; Gillis, Dan] Univ Guelph, Sch Comp Sci, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Middleton, Jacqueline; Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada; [Wood, Michele] Nunatsiavut Govt, Dept Hlth & Social Dev, 218 Kelland Dr,POB 496,Stn C, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF A0P 1C0, Canada; [Government, Rigolet Inuit Community] Rigolet Inuit Community Govt, POB 69, Rigolet, NF A0P 1C0, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Guelph; University of Alberta,"Sawatzky, A; Harper, SL (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.;Sawatzky, A; Cunsolo, A (corresponding author), Labrador Inst Mem Univ, Sch Arctic & Subarctic Studies, 219 Hamilton River Rd,POB 490,Stn B, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF A0P 1E0, Canada.;Harper, SL (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.",asawatzky@mun.ca; ashlee.cunsolo@mun.ca; sherilee.harper@ualberta.ca,"Harper, Sherilee/L-4996-2013","Harper, Sherilee/0000-0001-7298-8765",Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch; Northern Scientific Training Program; POLAR Knowledge Canada,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch; Northern Scientific Training Program; POLAR Knowledge Canada,"Sincerest thanks to the community of Rigolet and the many other people involved in this research for sharing their stories, wisdom, and hospitality.

Based on the premises that poor people are the population most vulnerable to climate change and that conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems are adaptive to climate change, our indicator uses three parameters: (1) poverty, (2) proportion of natural-vegetation cover, and (3) exposure to climate change. Thus, we searched for Brazilian municipalities that simultaneously belonged to the quartile of municipalities with the highest percentage of poverty, the quartile with the highest percentage of natural-vegetation cover, and the quartile with the highest exposure indices in two global climate models (Eta-HadGEM, Eta-Miroc). We found 398 (7.1%) EbA hotspots among 5565 Brazilian municipalities, which comprise 36% of the total area of native remnants in the country and are home to 22% of the poor people in Brazil. In their majority, these municipalities cover significant portions of the Amazon, Cerrado, Caatinga, and Atlantic forest, and indeed, these regions are recognised as some of the most vulnerable to climate change in the world. Considering the relevance of these biomes for the global water and nutrient cycle (Amazon), global food security (Cerrado), vulnerability to desertification (Caatinga), and biodiversity (all) we discuss the adaptive strategies in place, the need to bring them to scale, and existing policy gaps. Finally, in an effort to guide international and national investment and policies, we discuss how the approach described here can be applied to societies inhabiting tropical forests, savannas, and semiarid zones in other parts of the world. In particular, we propose that the indicator developed here is a simple and fast way to achieve early detection of priority municipalities for deployment of EbA action and policies, particularly in tropical developing countries.","[Kasecker, Thais Pacheco] Conservat Int Brasil, Rio Branco Ave,131-8 Floor, BR-20040006 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Kasecker, Thais Pacheco; Scarano, Fabio Rubio] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, IB, CCS, BR-21941970 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Ramos-Neto, Mario Barroso] Nature Conservancy, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Cardoso da Silva, Jose Maria] Univ Miami, Miami, FL USA; [Scarano, Fabio Rubio] Fundacao Brasileira Desenvolvimento Sustentavel, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Nature Conservancy; University of Miami,"Kasecker, TP (corresponding author), Conservat Int Brasil, Rio Branco Ave,131-8 Floor, BR-20040006 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;Kasecker, TP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, IB, CCS, BR-21941970 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",tkasecker@conservation.org; mario.barroso@tnc.org; jcsilva@miami.edu; fscarano@fbds.org.br,"Scarano, Fabio Rubio/F-6620-2012; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Scarano, Fabio Rubio/0000-0003-3355-9882; ","Brazilian Platform of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (CNPq, Biota-Fapesp, FBDS); University of Miami; Swift Action Fund","Brazilian Platform of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (CNPq, Biota-Fapesp, FBDS); University of Miami; Swift Action Fund","FRS is supported by the Brazilian Platform of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (CNPq, Biota-Fapesp, FBDS).

The cross-sectional data were collected from 302 smallholder potato farmers in East Java, Indonesia, analyzed by a multivariate probit model to estimate the determinants. An ordered probit model was subsequently employed to understand the intensity factors. The findings indicated that the significant factors that affect farmers' choice of on-farm adaptations were the farmers' education, their participation in farmers' groups, agricultural-related infrastructure, and agriculture output prices. Meanwhile, the off-farm adaptations were significantly affected by the farmers' education, employed family members, agriculture-related infrastructure, and livestock ownership. The ordered probit model also suggested that participation in farmers groups and agricultural-related infrastructure were the most significant factors that encouraged adaptation. Therefore, adaptation planning should consider these factors to optimally improve farmers' adaptation capacity.","[Purwanti, Tina Sri] Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Trop Agr & Int Cooperat, Pingtung 912, Taiwan; [Syafrial, Syafrial] Brawijaya Univ, Dept Socioecon, Fac Agr, Malang 65145, Indonesia; [Huang, Wen-Chi] Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agribusiness Management, Pingtung 912, Taiwan; [Saeri, Mohammad] Indonesian Agcy Agr Res & Dev, Assessment Inst Agr Technol East Java, Minist Agr, Malang 65152, Indonesia",National Pingtung University Science & Technology; Brawijaya University; National Pingtung University Science & Technology; Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research & Development,"Syafrial, S (corresponding author), Brawijaya Univ, Dept Socioecon, Fac Agr, Malang 65145, Indonesia.;Huang, WC (corresponding author), Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agribusiness Management, Pingtung 912, Taiwan.",p10822008@g4e.npust.edu.tw; syafrial.fp@ub.ac.id; wenchi@mail.npust.edu.tw; saeri@pertanian.go.id,"Purwanti, Tina Sri/HIR-8075-2022; Huang, Wen-Chi/B-4136-2014","Huang, Wen-Chi/0000-0003-4427-9325",,,,,53,4,4,5,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,JAN,2022,13,1,,,,,,,113,10.3390/atmos13010113,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13010113,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,ZB7SI,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000757037100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods This current research was conducted by means of a number of treatments with various material compositions and thickness of organic mulch sheet. Several tests were administered such as chemical analyses on organic mulch sheet, tensile strength, and Vilensky test. Result Various compositions of materials resulted in various chemical analyses of organic mulch sheet. Organic mulch with the strongest tensile strength was during the treatment of 60% water hyacinth, 20% rice straw, and 20% banana pseudostem, reaching 3.28 N/m(2). The highest sunlight intensity of mulch composition was during the treatment of M4 (50% water hyacinth, 40% rice straw, and 10% banana pseudostem) with no hole and absorbing. Conclusion The result showed that water hyacinth, rice straw, and banana pseudostem could be used as the materials for organic mulch sheets. They could add organic matters into the soil, have endurance and strength to apply as mulch in crop cultivation, as well as help plants adapt to climate change.","[Iriany, Aniek] Univ Muhammadiyah Malang, Fac Agr & Anim Husb, Dept Agrotechnol, Malang, Indonesia; [Chanan, Mochammad] Univ Muhammadiyah Malang, Fac Agr & Anim Husb, Dept Forestry, Malang, Indonesia; [Djoyowasito, Gunomo] Brawijya Univ Malang, Fac Agr Technol, Dept Agr Engn, Malang, Indonesia",Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang; Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang,"Iriany, A (corresponding author), Univ Muhammadiyah Malang, Fac Agr & Anim Husb, Dept Agrotechnol, Malang, Indonesia.",aniek55@yahoo.co.id,"Chanan, Mochamad/AAE-2696-2021; Iriany, Aniek/AAE-3846-2021","Chanan, Mochamad/0000-0002-5105-0919; iriany, aniek/0000-0001-6735-7440",DIKTI (Directorate of High Education),DIKTI (Directorate of High Education),The authors would like to thank University of Muhammadiyah Malang (UMM) for providing necessary facilities to carry out this research.

The contaminated sites, specifically those located by coastal and equatorial regions, are at great risk in facing the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events, since they are not designed considering those in mind. The climate change impacts that specifically affect site remediation may include sea-level rise, extreme temperatures, extreme precipitation, extreme wind, and wildfires. While the efforts toward incorporating sustainability in terms of the assessment of net environmental, economic, and social impacts and benefits in remediation design and implementation is increasing, the remediation approach must incorporate climate change resilience into planning, design, execution, operation, and maintenance of the remediation strategy. There are a few frameworks published in literature that address the incorporation of resiliency and climate change adaptation in contaminated site remediation design. This study presents an overview of some of these frameworks in the context of the United States and its current status quo regarding the environmental remediation to aid in resilient design of remediation strategies for the cleanup of contaminated sites. Further, a new quantitative approach to decision-making involving quantitative life cycle sustainability assessment and quantification of uncertainty in evaluating the feasibility of climate change adaptation measures for site-specific remedial designs is discussed. A few case studies demonstrating the current practice of resiliency in remediation design are discussed. Finally, challenges to assess and implement sustainable and resilient remediation are discussed.

This paper analyzes adaptation governance in two Canadian provinces, with a focus on three key elements: actor roles, actor relations, and policy instruments. Drawing on a comprehensive document analysis and 81 interviews, we argue that network governance has been fruitful in coordinating policy ideas and motivating actors across sectors and scales, but has also served as a barrier to effective implementation of adaptation policies.

Shezidao is located at the confluence of the Keelung and Tamsui rivers in the heart of Taiwan's capital city, Taipei. Since floods are common in Shezidao, dwellers have attempted to mitigate the risks with improvised structures that fall short of a comprehensive solution. This article suggests the issue of informal settlement on a flood plain must be solved through managed, rather than haphazard, retreat. The article further suggests aligning the central and local governments' public objectives and connecting social housing policy for the potential relocation of informal settlers as main strategies to provide solutions to the communities at risk. As climate change continues unabated, adaptation measures should be planned to mitigate future disaster risks that might occur in urban informal settlements.","[Huang, Ju-Ching] Georgetown Univ, Georgetown Law Ctr, Washington, DC 20001 USA",Georgetown University,"Huang, JC (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Georgetown Law Ctr, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",jh1759@georgetown.edu,"Huang, Ju-Ching/GZB-0194-2022","Huang, Ju-Ching/0000-0001-7577-1641",,,,,27,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

Using the model of private proactive adaptation to climate change (MPPACC) as a basic framework for the study, the research investigated the effects of cognitive factors on maladaptation in farmers' incremental adaptation to water scarcity as a climate risk. Data were collected during face-to-face interviews with 250 farmers of irrigated lands in Khuzestan province, Iran. The structural equation modeling results showed that the research model predicted 49% of the variance in adaptive behavior and 24% of the variance in maladaptation. These results provide strong empirical evidence for the hypothesis that maladaptation has an important and negative effect on determining adaptive behaviors (beta =-.33). Moreover, perceived susceptibility (beta =-.42, beta = .38), perceived cost (beta =-.21, beta =-.32), and perceived self-efficacy (beta = .31, beta =-.29) directly affected both adaptive behavior and maladaptation. This study contributes to the literature by: i) adding to the limited number of studies on the MPPACC; ii) confirming the efficiency of this model in the water scarcity context, as the MPPACC can be used to understand behavior of people faced with an environmental threat; and iii) improving knowledge regarding the impact of belief in climate change on the constructs of the MPPACC.","[Zobeidi, Tahereh; Yaghoubi, Jafar] Univ Zanjan, Dept Agr Extens Commun & Rural Dev, Zanjan, Iran; [Yazdanpanah, Masoud] Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Khuzestan, Iran",University Zanjan,"Yaghoubi, J (corresponding author), Univ Zanjan, Dept Agr Extens Commun & Rural Dev, Zanjan, Iran.",t.zobeidi@znu.ac.ir; yaghobi@znu.ac.ir; yazdanm@asnrukh.ac.ir,"Yaghoubi, Jafar/W-9445-2018; Yazdanpanah, Masoud/V-5353-2018","Yaghoubi, Jafar/0000-0002-2849-9590; Yazdanpanah, Masoud/0000-0001-8610-0173; Zobeidi, Tahereh/0000-0001-6909-4269",,,,,109,12,12,11,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-3774,1873-2283,,AGR WATER MANAGE,Agric.

However, context-specific information about why particular adaptation strategies are adopted remains limited. This study examined the factors that facilitate the choice of farm-level adaptation strategies to climate change (CC) using data collected from 269 African indigenous vegetable (AIV) farmers in Kenya. A multivariate probit (MVP) regression model was used to evaluate the determinants of adaptation choices. The most frequently adopted strategies considered for analysis were manure application, increased pesticide use, crop rotation, irrigation, change of planting dates and terracing. The results reveal that land ownership, group membership, access to extension services and education level were some of the key drivers of adoption. This implies that policies and programmes that are designed to build the ability of smallholder AIV farmers to adapt to climate change should focus on organising farmers into groups, disseminating timely weather information, improving land tenure security, increasing off-farm employment and providing greater access to extension services.(c) 2023 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Using vulnerability assessments as well as adaptation practices that support mitigation, MPOs are beginning to integrate climate change planning into the long range planning process. Evaluating the state-of-the-practice of adaptation planning and adaptation in support of mitigation is useful in that it helps identify gaps and areas of improvement. Therefore, this research investigates the state-of-the-practice of MPO adaptation planning using the Mid-Atlantic region as a case study. Surveys, administered in 2012 and 2014, are used to identify the level of progress of MPOs with regard to climate change adaptation practices as well as barriers before and after Hurricane Sandy. A cross-sectional analysis using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) maps the results of the surveys and spatially compares regional trends. The results of the case study suggest growing interest in adaptation efforts such as floodplain area designations and efforts to enhance coordination and collaboration as transportation jurisdictions respond to the potential climate change impacts. In addition, MPOs with dense, smaller geographic areas prioritize inter-jurisdictional collaboration as high, suggesting that they are more reliant on other agencies to maintain inter-connectivity of transportation networks and further implement adaptation planning practices.

An analysis of the Brazilian National Adaptation Plan (NAP) was also made, taking it as a case study to verify if guidance exists to combat inequalities and climate change impact at once. The literature analysis has shown that studies on climate justice in Latin America are still scarce and present, mainly, a critical theory conception pointing towards capitalism and colonialism as the cause of climate problems, as well as the need for equitable distribution in terms of climate change. With the analysis of the Brazilian NAP, it was observed that the climate justice discourse has not yet been systematically incorporated.","[Campello Torres, Pedro Henrique] Univ Sao Paulo, Energy & Environm Inst IEE, Butanta, Brazil; [Leonel, Ana Lia] Fed Univ ABC UFABC, Program Planning & Terr Management PGT, LaPlan, Sao Bernardo Do Campo, Brazil; [de Araujo, Gabriel Pires] Univ Sao Paulo, IEE, Environm Sci Grad Program PROCAM, Butanta, Brazil; [Jacobi, Pedro Roberto] Univ Sao Paulo, IEE, Grad Program Environm Sci PROCAM, Butanta, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Torres, PHC (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Av Prof Luciano Gualberto 1289, BR-05508010 Butanta, Brazil.",pedrotorres@usp.br,"Torres, Pedro Henrique Campello/AAS-7895-2021; de Araújo, Gabriel Pires/AAO-8910-2021; Jacobi, Pedro Roberto/C-3415-2012","Torres, Pedro Henrique Campello/0000-0002-0468-4329; de Araújo, Gabriel Pires/0000-0002-2515-4706; Jacobi, Pedro Roberto/0000-0001-6143-3019; Leonel, Ana Lia/0000-0003-4914-143X","Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP [2018/06685-9, 2019/05644-0, 2019/18462-7, 2018/02464-8, 2015/03804-9]",Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"This research was funded by The Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP.

These effects expand across countries and industries through disruptions in supply chains. In this study, a method of identifying high-risk processes in the supply chain due to climate-related disasters is developed, along with climate-related disaster risk factors (CDRF) for each country and each type of climate-related disaster. As a case study, the automotive supply chains of the USA, China, Japan, and Germany were assessed using a multi-regional input-output table. The results show that, in the USA, Japanese, and German automotive industries, the climaterelated disaster risk to workers outside the country is higher than that to workers within the country. However, the economic climate-related disaster risk is higher in the home country. In China's automotive industry, the risks to both workers and the economy were higher for the home country because the high level of involvement within the country.

The findings of in-depth analysis of these interviews have implications for climate change adaptation as a whole. They suggest that government policies to implement a broader range of adaptation measures might be hampered by institutional cultures formed when structural, engineered approaches were the norm. Political decentralisation and the fashion for public consultation exacerbate this effect, leaving decision-makers more responsive to the influence of those directly affected by natural hazards than they are to the needs of the wider population or to policy pronouncements by government.

For that reason, some have recently advocated using labor migration policy as a tool for climate adaptation. This paper engages with the normative question of whether, and under what conditions, states may permissibly use labor migration policy as a tool for climate adaptation. I argue that states may use labor migration policy as a tool for climate adaptation and may even have a duty to do so, subject to two moral constraints. First, states must also provide acceptable alternative options for adaptation so that the vulnerable are not forced to sacrifice their morally important interests in being able to remain where they are. Second, states may not impose restrictive terms on labor migrants to make accepting greater numbers less costly for themselves because doing so unfairly shifts the costs of adaptation onto the most vulnerable.","[Draper, Jamie] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Polit, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Draper, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Polit, Oxford, England.",jamie.draper@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,,"Draper, Jamie/0000-0003-0177-3382",,,,,97,2,2,6,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

This paper proposes a framework for modeling climate impacts and adaptation that clarifies the relevant research issues and provides a template for making improvements. We identify five desirable characteristics of an ideal integrated assessment modeling platform, which we elaborate into a conceptual model that distinguishes three different classes of adaptation-related activities. Based on these elements we specify an impacts- and adaptation-centric IAM, whose optimality conditions are used to highlight the types of functional relationships necessary for realistic representations of adaptation-related decisions, the specific mechanisms by which these responses can be incorporated into IAMs, and the ways in which the inclusion of adaptation is likely to affect the simulations' results.","[Wing, Ian Sue] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Fisher-Vanden, Karen] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Boston University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Fisher-Vanden, K (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",isw@bu.edu; kaf26@psu.edu,,,"Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Earth Sciences [1038907] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Earth Sciences [1038818, 1038614] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Earth Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Earth Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),,,17,11,11,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

To avert the problem soil and water conservation practices (SWCPs) were exhaustively implemented by governmental and non-governmental organizations based on the integrated watershed management approach. Although many studies have been conducted in the wet highlands of Ethiopia to assess the role of SWCPs on soil physical and chemical properties, carbon stock and grain yield, studies in the dry highlands of northeast Ethiopia are limited. Thus, this research is aimed to (i) investigate the impacts of SWCPs on soil physical and chemical properties, (ii) quantify the carbon stock trapped by the SWCPs, (iii) assess barley grain yield and (iv) evaluate farmers' perception on climate change adaptive strategies. Field experiment, observation, socio-economic survey were conducted for data collection. SPSS was used for data analysis. The result shows that soil and water conservation practices positively influenced the physico-chemical properties of the soil and barley grain yield. The quality of soil physico-chemical properties and barley grain yield in the treated farms/fields were better than the untreated farms. Similarly, the quality of soil physico-chemical properties and barley grain yield were found to be high in farms with lower slope gradients than the higher slope gradients. Almost all of the interviewed households (93%) perceived the existence of climate change in the area; and recurrent drought, pest and disease were among the events. About 65% of the households perceived that the implemented strategies (SWCPs, infrastructure, credit & saving, and capacity building) were helpful to adapt climate related shocks. Therefore, it can be concluded that integrated watershed management as a holistic approach, and SWCPs as specific technologies have meaningful roles in terms of minimizing land degradation, improving soil quality, increasing barley yield, and reducing climate change.","[Mekonnen, Mulatie] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Geospatial Data & Technol Ctr, Dept Nat Resource Management, POB 1188, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Abeje, Tadissual] Org Rehabil & Dev Amhara ORDA, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Addisu, Solomon] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Nat Resource Management, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia",Bahir Dar University; Bahir Dar University,"Mekonnen, M (corresponding author), Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Geospatial Data & Technol Ctr, Dept Nat Resource Management, POB 1188, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.",mulatiemekonneng@gmail.com,"Legesse, Solomon/AAL-7905-2021","Addisu, Solomon/0000-0002-2555-4478; /0000-0003-1903-7981",,,,,49,4,4,2,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-521X,1873-2267,,AGR SYST,Agric.

Here, shrimp farming is predominantly traditional, which is more vulnerable to climate change. Lack of understanding exists regarding the adaptation measures of local shrimp farmers in response to emerging impacts of changing climatic variables. This study provides the perceptions and adaptations of shrimp farmers in changing climatic context. A systematic random sampling method was employed to conduct a total of 240 questionnaire surveys and 60 key informant interviews from six sub-districts (Upazila) of southwest coastal Bangladesh to collect primary data. Changes in climate variables largely affect the shrimp yield by increasing frequency of shrimp disease, causing physical damage to farm structure and deteriorating quality of water. Shrimp farmers try to adapt to those changes in various ways, including increasing pond depth, exchanging tidal water, providing shade using aquatic plants, strengthening earthen dike and netting and fencing around the dike. Shrimp mixed cultivation is the most popular form of shrimp farming in the study area. More emphasis on implementing polyculture shrimp farming is necessary to improve climate change adaptation and to promote sustainability of this aquaculture practice in southwest coastal Bangladesh.","[Islam, Md.

The trade-offs are conceptualised in a choice experiment in terms of six attributes: the extent of beach nourishment, dyke heightening, cliff protection, access to dunes, realignment of dykes and dunes, and cost in terms of a coastal protection levy. The attributes were selected and designed in close cooperation, among others, with governmental decision-makers. Accounting for preference heterogeneity, we identified three latent groups among the participants of a nationwide online survey in Germany. Respondents who prefer extensive changes, respondents who are willing to pay only for an increase in dyke height, and respondents who are unwilling to cover additional expenses for adaptation. The aggregated welfare measures indicate that an adaptation scenario Recreation ranks highest followed by Safety and Nature.

To this end, it analyses the way various actors have sought to promote and challenge the legitimacy often multi-lateral international and national climate change adaptation funds in the Asia-Pacific region. The study shows that adaptation funds draw on multiple sources of legitimacy, including: ethical or justice arguments; participation and deliberation; transparency; accountability; coherence; and effectiveness. Efforts to strengthen one source of legitimacy can have an impact on other sources, with evidence of both synergies and trade-offs. International and national adaptation funds are primarily legitimised to state actors, even though funds and projects are justified in terms of assisting vulnerable groups and communities. International financing has helped legitimise adaptation as an important development and policy objective. An adaptation financing architecture that is more multi-level, if not yet polycentric, has emerged alongside new legitimacy challenges; but at the same time, providing opportunities for improving outcomes on the ground if greater attention is given to access by vulnerable groups and communities.","[Lebel, Louis; Kallayanamitra, Chalisa] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Social Sci, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Salamanca, Albert] Stockholm Environm Inst, Asia Ctr, 15th Floor,Witthyakit Bldg,254 Chulalongkorn Univ, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Chiang Mai University; Chulalongkorn University,"Lebel, L (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Social Sci, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.",llebel@loxinfo.co.th; a.salamanca@sei-international.org; chalisa@sea-user.org,"Salamanca, Albert/AAV-5063-2021; Salamanca, Albert/B-2850-2015","Salamanca, Albert/0000-0002-9725-3105",Adaptation Knowledge Platform,Adaptation Knowledge Platform,The initial work on this paper was supported by the Adaptation Knowledge Platform.

This study uses primary data collected from a cross section of crop farmers in northern Ghana and a simultaneous equation systems approach to examine the links between contract farming and adoption of climate change coping and adaptation strategies. The major coping and adaptation strategies used by farmers include spraying of farms with chemicals, row planting, mixed farming, mixed cropping and crop rotation. Econometric results confirm that contract farming enhances the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies, but there is also a feedback effect on contract farming, such that farmers adopting more adaptation strategies have higher probabilities to get contract offer. This makes contract farming a viable policy instrument to consider in climate change adaptation. Furthermore, land ownership and extension services exert significant positive influence on adoption. As much as possible, coping and adaptation strategies should effectively be communicated to crop farmers. Policy-wise, development actors and successive governments in Ghana should encourage and facilitate contract or group farming, as was in the case of the National Block Farming, led by Ghana's Ministry of Food and Agriculture.","[Azumah, Shaibu Baanni] Feed Future USAID Ghana Agr Technol Transfer Proj, IFDC Ghana, POB ER 542, Tamale, Ghana; [Donkoh, Samuel A.; Ansah, Isaac Gershon K.] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, POB TL 1882, Tamale, Ghana",United States Agency for International Development (USAID); University for Development Studies,"Ansah, IGK (corresponding author), Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, POB TL 1882, Tamale, Ghana.",agershon@uds.edu.gh,"Ansah, Isaac Gershon Kodwo/O-6614-2015","Ansah, Isaac Gershon Kodwo/0000-0001-5071-6224; BAANNI AZUMAH, SHAIBU/0000-0001-9046-5079",GSSP of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),GSSP of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)(CGIAR),"The study was supported financially by the GSSP of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) through its Scholarship program for Master's level research.

As climate impacts are often locally specific, it is imperative that large-scale initiatives to support smallholder farmers consider local priorities and integrate lessons from successful autonomous adaptation efforts. This article explores how large-scale programmes for smallholder adaptation to climate change might link effectively with community-led adaptation initiatives. Drawing on experiences in Bangladesh, Mozambique, Uganda and India, this article identifies key success factors and barriers for considering local priorities, capacities and lessons in large-scale adaptation programmes. It highlights the key roles of extension services and farmers' organizations as mechanisms for linking between national-level and community-level adaptation, and a range of other success factors which include participative and locally driven vulnerability assessments, tailoring of adaptation technologies to local contexts, mapping local institutions and working in partnership across institutions. Barriers include weak governance, gaps in the regulatory and policy environment, high opportunity costs, low literacy and underdeveloped markets. The article concludes that mainstreaming climate adaptation into large-scale agricultural initiatives requires not only integration of lessons from community-based adaptation, but also the building of inclusive governance to ensure smallholders can engage with those policies and processes affecting their vulnerability.","[Wright, Helena] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England; [Vermeulen, Sonja] Univ Copenhagen, Coordinating Unit, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Laganda, Gernot] Int Fund Agr Dev, Rome, Italy; [Olupot, Max] African Forum Agr Advisory Serv, Kampala, Uganda; [Ampaire, Edidah] IITA, Kampala, Uganda; [Jat, M.

Methods for evaluating effectiveness of adaptation options are usually based on, fundamentally different but complementary, hazards and vulnerability assessment based approaches. In this paper, we describe a framework to integrate these approaches for improved climate change adaptation policy making. We further review assessment approaches and corresponding criteria used for evaluation of planned adaptation options in the water sector. A synthesis of methods for evaluation reveals four main categories: (i) natural sciences based, (ii) social sciences based, (iii) overlapping and (iv) trans-disciplinary. Criteria from reviewed studies are classified using a scale vis-a-vis theme based classification, and unified into a criteria set covering important adaptation requirements while allowing case-specific modification. We find that important criteria, such as temporal scope of adaptation and implementability, have not been explicitly considered in scientific literature. The type of adaptation has an important bearing on evaluation and should be effectively modelled to make an informed decision regarding performance. Moreover, we suggest that it is important to explicitly consider influence of future changes in non-climatic factors along with climatic changes for a more robust analysis.","[Bhave, Ajay Gajanan; Mishra, Ashok; Raghuwanshi, Narendra Singh] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Agr & Food Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Bhave, AG (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Agr & Food Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",ajaybhave84@gmail.com,"Raghuwanshi, Narendra/E-7321-2016","Bhave, Ajay/0000-0001-5896-8661","HighNoon project - European Commission [7, 227087]",HighNoon project - European Commission(European Commission),"This work has been supported by the HighNoon project, funded by the European Commission Framework Programme 7 under Grant No. 227087.",,55,6,6,0,30,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1366-7017,1996-9759,,WATER POLICY,Water Policy,,2014,16,5,,,,,959,972,,10.2166/wp.2014.097,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wp.2014.097,,,14,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,CA6MU,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000349029200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper applies qualitative document analysis, content analysis, and expert interviews to examine the degree of coherence between climate-sensitive sector policies in framing climate change adaptation and the adaptation goals outlined in the national development plan and national climate change policies in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG), Grenada, and Saint Lucia. The results indicate that adaptation is not fully integrated into the water, agriculture, coastal zone, and forestry policies. For example, while adaptation was explicitly addressed in Saint Lucia's water policy, it was not explicitly addressed in SVG's and Grenada's water policy. The results show that Saint Lucia has the highest coherence score (93.52) while St. Vincent and the Grenadines has the lowest (91.12). The optimal coherence score that can be possibly obtained is 147, which indicates partial coherence in adaptation mainstreaming in sectoral policies. Expert interviews highlighted problems such as institutional arrangements, a silo approach, funding mechanisms, and policy implementation. Using the knowledge provided by the experts, a seven-step process is proposed to practically achieve policy coherence and operationalize the policies.","[Lewis, Clint T.; Su, Ming-Chien] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien 97401, Taiwan",National Dong Hwa University,"Lewis, CT (corresponding author), Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien 97401, Taiwan.",clintlewis784@gmail.com; mcsu@gms.ndhu.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan [MOST 109-2621-M-259-002 -]","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This research was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan.

While a well-functioning international trade system can support the adaptation to climate change-related challenges, trade policies as such are imperfect instruments to induce less emissions globally.

Although a consensus exists that our climate will change to a hitherto unknown extent, the anticipation of local and regional consequences has reached its limits. The primary reason for this is the unknown interference of social development and natural processes. This paper suggests a practical typology of (non-)knowledge and distinguishes between two main strategies of how to deal with unknown developments: anticipation and resilience. In a case study on the extreme Elbe flood in 2002, local adaptation strategies and lessons learned are investigated against the background of the previously introduced concepts of the unknown and adaptation strategies. The empirical findings show a gap between the local activities during and after the flood event and the scientific concepts of resilient adaptation strategies. Local actions mainly rely on anticipation and strong expectations. Resilient features are hard to detect and mostly come into conflict with the realized local adaptation strategy.","[Kuhlicke, Christian] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Helmholtz Zentrum Umweltforsch GmbH, Dept Stadt & Umweltsoziol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Kruse, Sylvia] Eidg Forsch Anstalt Wald Schnee & Landschaft, Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Kuhlicke, C (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Helmholtz Zentrum Umweltforsch GmbH, Dept Stadt & Umweltsoziol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",christian.kuhlicke@ufz.de; sylvia.kruse@wsl.ch,"Kuhlicke, Christian/O-8397-2016; Kruse, Sylvia/E-7096-2014","Kuhlicke, Christian/0000-0002-1193-228X; ",,,,,43,16,16,1,11,OEKOM VERLAG,MUNICH,"WALTHERSTR 29, MUNICH, 80337, GERMANY",0940-5550,,,GAIA,GAIA,,2009,18,3,,,,,247,254,,10.14512/gaia.18.3.11,http://dx.doi.org/10.14512/gaia.18.3.11,,,8,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,501WW,,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000270415600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, individual socio-cognitive constraints related to risk perceptions and perceived capacity may hamper their action. Climate change visualization could help planning and management overcome such constraints by offering accessible information to increase individual adaptive capacity. Such visualization would require that information be perceived as legitimate and credible by emphasizing the diversity of impacts and alternative options, and simultaneously as salient by highlighting context -specific risks and measures. Based on focus group interviews and test sessions, we analysed how homeowners made sense of and discussed a specific interactive planning support tool - VisAdapt (TM) - integrating climate scenarios, local risk maps, and adaptation measures for various house types. The tool combines precise and general depictions in visualizing climate change to support adaptation among Nordic homeowners. Results reveal that the tool spurred reflection on concrete local risks and various adaptation actions. The tool was less successful in providing a framework for assessing the magnitude of anticipated changes, making these appear as generally small. Visualization aspects that are important for spurring reflection on adaptive action are specifying various climate parameters, relating climate impacts to established practices for managing weather risks, and emphasizing diverse concrete short- and long-term measures.

Although disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) are tightly linked and comprising virtually identical practices in vulnerable countries in Southern Africa, research has identified parallel governance structures across the region. This study applied comparative case study research, based on 27 semi-structured interviews, to investigate the reasons for and effects of such parallel structures for DRR and CCA in Botswana, Mozambique, the Seychelles, Tanzania and Zambia. It revealed overwhelmingly negative effects in terms of unclear mandates and leadership, uncoordinated efforts, duplication of efforts, suboptimal use of resources and competition over resources and control. The study identified both external reasons for the parallel structures, in terms of global or international initiatives or incentives, and internal reasons, with regard to the history and quality of the governance structures. Although the identified negative effects are common to a range of complex nexuses, there is a clear distinction with the DRR-CCA nexus comprising virtually indistinguishable practices in Southern Africa. There is, as such, no practical reason for keeping them apart. The parallel structures for DRR and CCA are instead the result of pervasive institutionalisation across the region, driven by coercive, mimetic and normative pressures coming from both within and abroad. Although much point to the difficulties of changing the studied institutional arrangements, these parallel structures for DRR and CCA must be addressed if the populations in Southern Africa are to enjoy safety and sustainable development.","[Becker, Per; Hagelsteen, Magnus; Abrahamsson, Marcus] Lund Univ, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, Fac Engn, Lund, Sweden; [Becker, Per] North West Univ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa",Lund University; North West University - South Africa,"Becker, P (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, Fac Engn, Lund, Sweden.;Becker, P (corresponding author), North West Univ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",per.becker@risk.lth.se,,"Abrahamsson, Marcus/0000-0003-1222-8806; Becker, Per/0000-0001-9379-9461; Hagelsteen, Magnus/0000-0003-0913-047X",,,,,55,1,1,0,3,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

To analyze the implementation process and possible reasons for the implementation gap, we take a closer look at how the integration of adaptation goals into various sectoral policies-often called mainstreaming-has been handled on different administrative levels in Switzerland. Going beyond traditional compilations of barriers to climate change adaptation, we analyze the use of six different mainstreaming strategies across cases and levels and the reasons for their success or lack thereof. We find that different actors at all administrative levels have successfully employed programmatic mainstreaming in combination with inter-organizational mainstreaming to foster horizontal cooperation. We call this strategy cooperative mainstreaming. Some pioneers even managed to channel their successes into advances in regulatory mainstreaming. However, the lack of systematic regulatory and directed mainstreaming on the national and cantonal levels largely limits adaptation actions on lower levels to those cases where the major impetus derives from extreme events or proactive individuals on the ground. We conclude that the adaptation implementation gap in Switzerland largely stems from the lack of political commitment to promoting local adaptation at the national and cantonal levels.","[Braunschweiger, Dominik; Puetz, Marco] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Econ & Social Sci, Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Braunschweiger, D (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",dominik.braunschweiger@wsl.ch,"Pütz, Marco/B-8389-2016","Pütz, Marco/0000-0001-7868-6864","Federal Office for the Environment [16.0144, PJ/Q074-1254]",Federal Office for the Environment,"Federal Office for the Environment, Grant/Award Number: 16.0144.PJ/Q074-1254",,48,8,8,2,17,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

Design/methodology/approach - A set of questionnaires was developed based on the individual adaptive capacity framework on social adaptation to climate change developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Based on multi-stage simple random sampling, a total of 300 registered fishermen in the East Coast Region of Peninsular Malaysia were chosen as the respondents. Findings - The fishermen surveyed had a high level of adaptation with regards to two aspects: first, environmental awareness, attitudes and beliefs; and second, local environmental knowledge. In contrast, they showed a low level of adaptation with regards to three aspects: attachment to place; formal and informal networks; and attachment to occupation. In addition, the fishermen had a moderate level of adaptation in relation to ten other aspects. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this study reflect social adaptation towards climate change among registered fishermen in the East Coast Region of Malaysia and results might be different if registered fishermen from other regions are included. Practical implications - The study demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the fishermen's adaptations to climate change. Such strengths and weaknesses have resulted in a number of suggestions and recommendations, which may work as tools by which to generate well-planned and systematic adaptation options for dealing with the threatening impacts of climate change. Originality/value - Previous studies, both local and international, have consistently provided comprehensive explanatory reviews regarding climate change impacts on fishermen's activities. However, the common constraint of these studies is that aspects of adaptation are not under their radar; therefore, this study aims to fill this gap.","[Shaffril, Hayrol Azril Mohamed; Abu Samah, Bahaman; D'Silva, Jeffrey Lawrence; Yassin, Sulaiman Md] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Social Sci Studies, Serdang, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Shaffril, HAM (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Social Sci Studies, Serdang, Malaysia.",hayrol82@gmail.com,"D'SILVA, JEFFREY LAWRENCE/AAS-8086-2021; D'Silva, Jeffrey Lawrence/CAC-8306-2022; Shaffril, Hayrol Azril Mohamed/I-2463-2019","D'Silva, Jeffrey Lawrence/0000-0002-5673-8712; ",,,,,28,32,33,1,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

However, the level of preparation of the country and its society for climate change in the second decade of the 21st century can be evaluated as low. The Municipal Adaptation Plans (MAPs) created in 2017-2019 became a subject of research studies whose main goal was to determine the typology of adaptation actions to be undertaken as part of MAPs in the 14 selected Polish cities in various geographical regions. Moreover, the type and scope of intended actions were analysed according to the planned amount of expenditure and from the perspective of sectors. The tasks accepted for implementation up to 2030 mainly relate to modernisation and development of transport systems and to actions connected with physical infrastructure. A large number of tasks and even a bigger scale of financial sources planned in the analysed MAPs for mitigation actions show that Polish cities are at an initial stage of actions for climate protection. The typology of adaptation actions which the work proposes may be helpful in research carried out in countries of a similar level of preparation for adaptation to climate change.","[Kalbarczyk, Eliza] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Human Geog & Planning, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Kalbarczyk, Robert] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Architecture, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland",Adam Mickiewicz University; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences,"Kalbarczyk, R (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Architecture, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland.",ekalb@amu.edu.pl; robert.kalbarczyk@upwr.edu.pl,"Kalbarczyk, Robert/A-5099-2017; Kalbarczyk, Eliza/ACD-9103-2022","Kalbarczyk, Robert/0000-0002-0564-8653; Kalbarczyk, Eliza/0000-0002-4871-2483",,,,,46,6,6,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,OCT,2020,9,10,,,,,,,351,10.3390/land9100351,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land9100351,,,18,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ON7WL,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000586906000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The region is considered one of the more environmentally vulnerable areas in the world due to recurrent natural hazards that can be exacerbated by future climate change. The dependence of the population on natural resources based livelihoods makes the region particularly vulnerable to adverse climate change impacts. Labour migration can help household adaptation, particularly when it incurs significant cash investment. The paper analyses the determinants of household adaptation, including migration, in three sectors, namely, agriculture, livestock, and water. It shows that household adaptation to the negative effects of climate change was very poor in the region, with less than a third of the households undertaking adaptation measures. While labour migration showed a positive influence on household adaptation, it was statistically significant only in agriculture. Nevertheless, migration influenced household adaptation indirectly through livelihood diversification, access to services provide of external stakeholders, and changes in household composition. The study identified location, access to climate information, and services provided by external stakeholders as important factors in household adaptation to climate change.","[Maharjan, Amina; Tuladhar, Sabarnee; Hussain, Abid; Mishra, Arabinda] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Bhadwal, Suruchi] Energy & Resources Inst TERI, New Delhi, India; [Ishaq, Sultan; Ahmad, Bashir] Pakistan Agr Res Council PARC, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Saeed, Basharat Ahmed] Leadership Environm & Dev LEAD, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Sachdeva, Ishani] Ctr Ecol Dev & Res CEDAR, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Ferdous, Jannatul; Hassan, S.

Cryospheric and hydrological changes in combination with socio-economic development are threatening downstream water security triggering the need for effective adaptation responses. Here, we present a global systematic review (83 peer-reviewed articles) that assesses different water-related stressors and the adaptation responses to manage water stress in major glaciated mountain regions. Globally, agriculture (42%), tourism (12%), hydropower (8%) and health and safety (4%) are among the main sectors affected by hydrological and cryospheric changes . A broad set of adaptation measures has already been implemented in the world's mountain regions. We find that globally the most commonly used adaptation practices correspond to the improvement of water storage infrastructure (13%), green infrastructure (9.5%), agricultural practices (17%), water governance and policies (21%), disaster risk reduction (9.5%) and economic diversification (10%). Successful implementation of adaptation measures is limited by reduced stakeholder capacities, collaboration and financial resources, and policies and development. To overcome these limitations, funding for climate change adaptation and development programmes in mountains and trust-building measures such as shared stakeholder activities need to be strengthened. Local awareness raising of both, the adverse effects of climate change and potentially positive implications of specific adaptation measures can help to support successful adaptation.","[Aggarwal, Anubha] Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Delhi, India; [Frey, Holger; McDowell, Graham; Drenkhan, Fabian] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [McDowell, Graham] Univ Calgary, Canadian Mt Assessment, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Drenkhan, Fabian] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England; [Drenkhan, Fabian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Humanidades, Lima, Peru; [Nusser, Marcus] Heidelberg Univ, South Asia Inst, Dept Geog, Heidelberg, Germany; [Racoviteanu, Adina] Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Hoelzle, Martin] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Fribourg, Switzerland",Delhi Technological University; University of Zurich; University of Calgary; Imperial College London; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Aberystwyth University; University of Fribourg,"Frey, H (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.;Aggarwal, A (corresponding author), Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110042, India.",agrawal.anubha@gmail.com; holger.frey@geo.uzh.ch,"Nüsser, Marcus/N-2393-2015; Aggarwal, Anubha/AAB-9815-2021","Nüsser, Marcus/0000-0002-8626-8336; Frey, Holger/0000-0003-0705-3570; Drenkhan, Fabian/0000-0002-9443-9596; Racoviteanu, Adina/0000-0003-4954-1871; Hoelzle, Martin/0000-0002-3591-4377; McDowell, Graham/0000-0003-2302-2598; Aggarwal, Anubha/0000-0001-6239-7478",Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); DST [EA-14/2019]; European Union [663830]; Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship program of the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); DST(Department of Science & Technology (India)); European Union(European Commission); Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship program of the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,"This study has been supported by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) within the mentoring programme of SDCs contributions to the 6th Assessment Cycle of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Insights into a two-year long educational programme in North Tyrol (Austria) and South Tyrol (Italy),CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Adaptation; Climate change education; Capacity building; Adolescents,CHANGE ADAPTATION; YOUNG-PEOPLE; KNOWLEDGE; TYPOLOGY; CHILDREN,"Adapting to anthropogenic climate change requires informed citizens capable of managing personal and societal risks. This study explores the contribution of climate change education (CCE) to build adolescents' cognitive adaptive capacity. As defined by Grothmann and Patt's (2005) Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPACC), cognitive dimensions of adaptive capacity correspond to climate change risk perception and adaptation appraisal as preconditions for individual adaptation actions. Their model has been operationalised to examine adolescents' cognitive adaptive capacity in a pre-test-post-test design, and the educational programme Generation F3-Fit for Future is presented as a quasi-experiment linking this concept with CCE. Because cognitive adaptive capacity is a complex and multifaceted concept, this contribution also studies the influence of CCE on knowledge and thinking skills, which are important dimensions as well. Overall, 173 upper-secondary school students aged between 16 and 18 years actively collaborated with 57 scientific and practical experts on climate change adaptation (CCA) in North and South Tyrol. Additionally, the programme included control groups. Over two school years, Generation F3-Fit for Future encouraged students to follow constructivist inquiry-based CCE, and they carried out their own research-oriented CCA projects. A mixed methods approach compared data from a multivariate multilevel mixed model collected by web-based questionnaires (N = 231) and qualitative data from problem-centred interviews (N = 47), which were analysed by documentary method. The results suggest a mismatch between quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data do not show any change in adolescents' risk perception and adaptation appraisal, but qualitative data reveal that intervention group students demonstrated increased levels of adaptation knowledge and elaborated critical as well as forward thinking skills.

The paper suggests that strong coordination of climate change adaptation and flood risk management should take place at city level, reflecting the place-based'' character of these policy sectors. However, adaptation cannot be addressed successfully at any single geographic scale or by any one category of actor. Effective collaboration across politico-administrative boundaries at multiple scales is required in order to address tensions between competing policy agendas and tackle socio-spatial inequality and vulnerability. We found that public officials at the city and regional state level encouraged some degree of citizen participation in planning and input into adaptation. However, despite emerging networks for city-level coordination and capacity to adapt to flood risks among local residents, there were limitations in how higher-level government and institutions supported the lower levels in vertical and horizontal coordination. In particular, services and investments within poor and vulnerable settlements were lacking. This undermined the capability of municipal staff for local engagement and for diverse groups of residents to become really effective partners with the government in coproducing services required to enhance resilience. More so, it limited opportunities to bring local actions to scale-beyond the city boundaries and toward transitional adaptation and transformation.","[Vedeld, Trond; Coly, Adrien; Ndour, Ndeye Mareme; Hellevik, Siri] Norwegian Inst Urban & Reg Res NIBR, Oslo, Norway",,"Vedeld, T (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Urban & Reg Res NIBR, Oslo, Norway.",trond.vedeld@nibr.no,,,,,,,61,34,34,2,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Uncertainty or sudden societal opposition might politically be employed to dismantle earlier made policies or investments and therefore threaten longterm adaptive capacity. This article highlights how successful long-term decision-making can be understood as a matter of puzzling over uncertainty and powering for getting things done, but above all requires sustainment of these decisions on the long term. For doing so the paper analyses the decision-making process of the Dutch Delta Committee in 2008, which firmly put the climate adaptation issue on the Dutch political agenda and subsequently sustained the issue on the policy agenda through the creation of a Delta Commissioner, a Delta Fund and a Delta Act. Our analysis illustrates how the crucial actors in and around the Second Delta Committee deployed strategies of puzzling, powering, and what we define as perpetuation to deal with the long-term policy issue of climate adaptation. The latter is especially important for policy issues that require a long-term continued effort by policy-makers, or will only manifest themselves on the long term. Then, it is not only important to create meaning and organize power now, but also to maintain and ensure that meaning and power for time to come. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Cities are among the leading experimenters developing I&M, but many other entities also view I&M as a tool for providing clarity and accountability about the goals and progress of adaptation. The current landscape of this work is scattered: I&M examples, frameworks, and guidance documents reflect motivations, contexts, and approaches as diverse as the field of adaptation itself. This study systematically surveys the growth industry of I&M, including a special focus on I&M approaches.developed for cities anywhere and by US cities in particular. We classify these I&M efforts into four domains: those developed in academia, by program sponsors, boundary organizations, and on-the-ground implementers. With attention to theory on (program) evaluation and on science-practice interaction, we reveal a broad range of I&M evaluation purposes and collaboration practices. We conclude that evaluation of adaptation progress and effectiveness - if it is to usefully inform the work of cities or other implementers - would benefit from greater attention to the best practices and guidance offered in the related, but largely still separate, fields of evaluation and science-practice interaction.

This paper focuses on Australia's horticulturally productive and culturally diverse Sunraysia region. Due to the high seasonal labour demands of horticulture, this region has a large population of temporary and permanent migrants. Many were farmers in their countries of origin. We bring together literature on climate change adaptation in agriculture, and migration and agriculture, to identify a common theme: experimentation. The former emphasises the need for experimentation in uncertain times, and the latter draws attention to the experimental food growing capacities of migrants. We argue that migrant farmers' desire to grow culturally important crops in their post-migration contexts, alongside their experience with diverse environmental conditions, constitute a poorly recognised adaptive resource. When migrants have access to farmland to demonstrate their agricultural capacities, migration can expand the suite of adaptive options available. This paper draws these experimental threads together, alongside empirical evidence gathered from qualitative research in the Sunraysia region. We conclude by describing an experimental, action-oriented project which seeks to explore what happens when migrant farmers are, quite literally, given the space to show the broader community what they know and what they can do.","[Klocker, Natascha; Spaven, Tess] Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Australian Ctr Cultural Environm Res, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Head, Lesley; Dun, Olivia] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Wollongong; University of Melbourne,"Klocker, N (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Australian Ctr Cultural Environm Res, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",natascha_klocker@uow.edu.au; lesley.head@unimelb.edu.au; olivia.dun@unimelb.edu.au; ts356@uowmail.edu.au,,"DUN, OLIVIA/0000-0002-3660-6827; Klocker, Natascha/0000-0001-7526-3292",Australian Research Council [DP140101165],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The research reported on in this paper was funded by an Australian Research Council grant (DP140101165) awarded to Lesley Head, Natascha Klocker, Gordon Waitt and Heather Goodall.

Planned community-based adaptation (CBA) therefore - often implemented by non-governmental organisations - seeks to engender social capital to strengthen the adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities in the Global South. CBA interventions typically seek to build social capital through the formation of community-based organisations, often led by the most vulnerable groups such as poor women, with the view that these groups will sustain and make efforts to strengthen community capacity to adapt to climate change. This paper presents the results of a research project that sought to understand the challenges of building social capital through group-based CBA interventions in the rural coastal communities of Bangladesh. Drawing on the accounts of four female-led community organisations and their respective com-munities, we argue that strengthening social capital was obstructed by embedded sociocultural norms and by the assumptions made by external organisations about how to create social capital. This study concludes that CBA needs to frame gender from an intersectional point of view, rather than a simplistic 'male-versus-female di-chotomy' to build community capacities through female-led collectives. It thus contributes to the theoretical and empirical literature on social capital, gender and community adaptation.","[Masud-All-Kamal, Md.; Hassan, S. M.

This has resulted in the introduction of numerous planned adaptation initiatives. Although there is literature on institutionally designed adaptation initiatives, not much coverage has been given to the effect of adaptation interventions on farm output in the region. This study investigated the effects of planned climate variability adaptation interventions on smallholder farmer output in the Bolgatanga and Garu and Tempani districts of the Upper East Region, Ghana. Emphasis was on smallholder crop farmers cultivating maize and millet due to the staple nature of both crops in the region. Using a mix of methods, the study sort data from 184 randomly sampled smallholder farmers of two initiatives in the region (i.e., Climate Change Adaptation in Northern Ghana Enhanced-CHANGE and Adaptation Learning Programme-ALP). Primary data were analysed using descriptive statistics (SPSS-v22) and thematic analytical techniques. The study found that farmers adopted and implemented adaptation interventions like improved seed varieties, soil and crop health interventions, village savings and loans associations, planting and land management and weather forecast information. The study concludes that, the average output of maize and millet among smallholder farmers increased more than significantly by 92.5% and 73.1% respectively after the adoption and implementation of planned climate adaptation interventions under the projects. The study recommended the design and diffusion of similar planned adaptation interventions among smallholder farmers in other communities in the Upper East region of Ghana on a case-by-case basis.","[Kangah, Henry; Agyenim, Joseph Boateng] Univ Cape Coast Ghana, Sch Dev Studies, Dept Integrated Dev Studies, POB CT 4170, Cantonments Accra, Ghana",,"Kangah, H (corresponding author), Univ Cape Coast Ghana, Sch Dev Studies, Dept Integrated Dev Studies, POB CT 4170, Cantonments Accra, Ghana.",henryk1979@gmail.com; jbagyenim@gmail.com,,,,,,,62,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1886,,,COGENT SOC SCI,Cogent Soc.

To tackle water shortage problems, water trading has been proved as an efficient and economical method. However, complexities and uncertainties in water trading system may result in its poor efficiency and improper management. To address these concerns, an inexact two-stage stochastic nonlinear programming (ITSNP) model is proposed for water resources management through water trading under uncertainty. The ITSNP model can reflect nonlinearity of the problems, incorporate uncertainties expressed as probability distributions and discrete intervals, and provide linkages between predefined policies and associated economic implications. The developed model is applied to a case study of water resources management of an agricultural system with and without water trading schemes. The obtained modeling solutions indicate that water resources management is more efficient with water trading than without water trading particularly during dry seasons. Moreover, it is found that water trading is a suitable method for adaptation to climate change impacts under water scarcity.","[Luo, B.; Maqsood, I.; Huang, G.

We compared young (5-15 years since latest grassland renewal) with old (>20 years since latest grassland renewal) permanent grassland soils in terms of carbon stock, carbon sequestration, drought tolerance and flood resistance. The research was carried out on marine clay soil at 10 dairy farms with young and old permanent grassland. As hypothesized, the carbon stock was larger in old grassland (62 Mg C ha(-1)) topsoil (0-10 cm) than in young grassland topsoil (51 Mg C ha(-1)). The carbon sequestration rate was greater in young (on average 3.0 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) compared with old grassland (1.6 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) and determined by initial carbon stock. Regarding potential drought tolerance, we found larger soil moisture and soil organic matter (SOM) contents in old compared with young grassland topsoils. As hypothesized, the old grassland soils were more resistant to heavy rainfall as measured by water infiltration rate and macroporosity (at 20 cm depth) in comparison with the young grassland soils. In contrast to our hypothesis we did not find a difference in rooting between young and old permanent grassland, probably due to large variability in root biomass and root tip density. We conclude that old grasslands at dairy farms on clay soil can contribute more to the ecosystem services climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation than young grasslands. This study shows that under real farm conditions on a clay topsoil, carbon stock increases with grassland age and even after 30 years carbon saturation has not been reached. Further study is warranted to determine by how much extending grassland age can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Highlights We studied the effect of young versus old grassland on a range of soil properties related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Old, more than young, grassland soils offer potential to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This finding gives farmers insight into the merits of extending grassland age on clay soils. Soil carbon stock determines carbon sequestration rate more than grassland age.","[Iepema, Goaitske] Univ Appl Sci Van Hall Larenstein, POB 1528, NL-8901 BV Leeuwarden, Netherlands; [Hoekstra, Nyncke J.; van Eekeren, Nick] Louis Bolk Inst, Bunnik, Netherlands; [de Goede, Ron; Brussaard, Lijbert] Wageningen Univ & Res, Soil Biol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bloem, Jaap] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Environm Res, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Iepema, G (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Van Hall Larenstein, POB 1528, NL-8901 BV Leeuwarden, Netherlands.",goaitske.iepema@hvhl.nl,"; Brussaard, Lijbert/A-1698-2014","van Eekeren, Nick/0000-0002-4026-3839; Brussaard, Lijbert/0000-0003-3870-1411; Bloem, Jaap/0000-0002-2737-6273; Iepema, Goaitske/0000-0003-0300-5109","province Fryslan; province Groningen; LTO Noord funds; Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food safety","province Fryslan; province Groningen; LTO Noord funds; Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food safety","The data collection for this research was part of the projects Graslandbeheer en biodiversiteit - Goud van oud grasland op de Noordelijke zeeklei funded by the provinces Fryslan and Groningen, and LTO Noord funds, and the project Slim Landgebruik performed by Wageningen University & Research, University of Applied Sciences Van Hall Larenstein and Louis Bolk Institute and funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food safety.",,79,0,0,4,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-0754,1365-2389,,EUR J SOIL SCI,Eur.

This is because credible adaptation policies in the sector require greatly enhanced multi-sectoral policy integration if they are to succeed. But this requirement may be beyond the capacity of many countries to deliver. This article explores the integration challenges faced by forest policy-making in Canada and the United States and uses the case of assisted tree migration to probe the reasons for the failure of institutions in both countries to develop and manage better vertical and horizontal integration in a climate change-related forest policy area. The article emphasizes the importance of previous rounds of policy-making or policy legacies, which serve to constrain contemporary policy options. It argues that due to the presence of many such legacies, forest policy development will continue to feature incremental adjustments through policy layering and policy drift, processes which limit the prospects for greater integration and better climate change adaptation in this sector.","[Wellstead, Adam] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Social Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Howlett, Michael] Simon Fraser Univ, Polit Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Howlett, Michael] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore",Michigan Technological University; Simon Fraser University; National University of Singapore,"Howlett, M (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Polit Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada.;Howlett, M (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore.",howlett@sfu.ca,"Howlett, Michael/W-7544-2019","Howlett, Michael/0000-0003-4689-740X",Canadian Council of Forest Ministers Climate Change Task Force,Canadian Council of Forest Ministers Climate Change Task Force,We would also like to acknowledge the support of the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers Climate Change Task Force which provided funding for one of the authors.,,65,8,8,4,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0282-7581,1651-1891,,SCAND J FOREST RES,Scand.

It leads to the use of wastewater in many countries. This study was aimed to determine the farmer's awareness about reusing wastewater in their risk perception and adaptation to climate change in district Faisalabad, Pakistan. Faisalabad has become an industrial hub and industrial discharge is becoming problematic for local community and environment. Usually, farmers depend on wastewater for agriculture purposes in many aspects. The present study was divided into two phases, in the first phase a questionnaire based study was conducted in urban and peri-urban areas while in the second phase, wastewater quality parameters were determined (pH, SS, TDS, BOD, COD, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc) and compared with Pakistan Environmental Quality Standards. Results indicated that farmers had a strong awareness (96.8%) about fertility value of wastewater for many aspects, but they were unaware (71.6%) about health hazard of untreated wastewater used for crop irrigation. In the current study correlation of Determining of Climate Change (DCC) with age and farming experience was highly significant with correlation values 0.48 and 0.40 respectively. Adaption Measures (AM) correlation values with age and farming experience were 0.49 and 0.75 respectively. Other variables livelihood Assets (LA) was also correlated with Determining of Climate Change (DCC) and Adaption Measures (AM) and all variables were found significant week to moderate correlation among all selected variables. Farmers (>70%) used different techniques to adapt to climate change like irrigation, seeds, fertilizer and crops. Industrial and sewage wastewater quality of Faisalabad showed higher values than PEQs, creating an alarming situation for local people's health and environment. High metal pollution index (<1000) showed the heavy effluent discharge from industries and putting pressure on groundwater resources as well. It is strongly recommended that water should be treated prior to reuse for irrigation. This study will help to ensure proper monitoring, develop and implementation of public policies for integrated and sustainable water management to minimize the health hazards in district Faisalabad.","[Sohail, Muhammad Tayyab; Liang Lizhi; Rizwanullah, Muhammad; Nasrullah, Muhammad; Yu Xiuyuan] Xiangtan Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Xiangtan 411105, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Xuan Lin] China Univ Geosci, Sch Publ Adm, Wuhan 430000, Peoples R China; [Manzoor, Zaira] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan 250000, Peoples R China; [Elis, Randriamihanta Jery] Cent South Univ, Dept Law, Changsha 410000, Peoples R China",Xiangtan University; China University of Geosciences; Shandong University; Central South University,"Sohail, MT (corresponding author), Xiangtan Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Xiangtan 411105, Hunan, Peoples R China.",tayyabsohail@yahoo.com; xuanlin19930522@163.com; 188793258@qq.com,"Sohail, Muhammad Tayyab/C-4219-2015","Sohail, Muhammad Tayyab/0000-0002-7308-0297",Xiangtan University Startup Research Grant [03KZ_KZ0806803],Xiangtan University Startup Research Grant,"The author would like to thanks to Editor, Reviewers and all coauthors for their contribution to make this article better for publication.

In such conditions, agriculture has turned into the most vulnerable sector. Agricultural producers have not been able to adapt to such variations of climatic conditions. Traditional irrigation approaches and agronomic operations are becoming unacceptable against the background of severe droughts or heavy rains. Moreover, intra-annual distribution of precipitation and air temperature has changed. Especially in agriculture, increased rainfall in spring and summer and decreased rainfall in autumn and winter has had a negative impact. In 2013, the Global Water Partnership initiated the Water, Climate, and Development Programme for Caucasus and Central Asia. In the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan, a project was implemented to study the possibility of agriculture adaptation to climate change within the framework of this programme. This article presents an analysis of long-term data received from 1960 to 2014 on air temperature and precipitation. As a result of these studies, it has been determined that we can forecast the current year's weather conditions if we find a similar year in recent years. For the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan, it has been established that we have a stable spring, when winter is cold with heavy precipitation, and we have a cold spring and summer with high precipitation, when we have a warm winter with low precipitation. Past experience has shown that the use of water for irrigation, taking into account climatic conditions, has a significant impact on reducing irrigation water and increasing crop yields.

More so, coastal governance encompasses not only the actions of the state (which includes local governments), but also of other actors such as communities, businesses and civil society organizations. Solutions to improving coastal governance include the implementation of Integrated Coastal Management which also serves as means to plan and achieve climate change adaptation. This paper proposes the establishment of a framework and methodology to assess local coastal governance based on a composite of hierarchical metrics formed by different forms of capital and associated factors and indicators. The application of this methodology resulted in the description of a baseline for local coastal governance. This baseline is useful for informing different functional levels within local government, e.g. technical, managerial and political. The baseline consisted of a comprehensive assessment of the different forms of capitals furthered categorized by factors and measured by indicators of local coastal governance. The capitals approach and method for measuring governance is potentially repeatable and can identify progress towards longer-term coastal management and climate adaptation goals as well as areas requiring improvements. Ultimately, it can be developed into a self-assessment tool to help local government to think reflexively about how they are managing the coast and the climate risks impacting on coastal assets and people.","[Celliers, Louis] Council Sci & Ind Res Nat Resources & Environm, POB 17001, ZA-4013 Congella, South Africa; [Rosendo, Sergio] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias Sociais & Humanas, Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci CICS NOVA, Ave Berna 26-C, P-1069061 Lisbon, Portugal; [Celliers, Louis; Costa, Maria Manez; Carmona, Maria] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Climate Serv Ctr Germany, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany; [Ojwang, Lenice; Obura, David] CORDIO East Africa, 9 Kibaki Flats,POB 10135, Mombasa 80101, Kenya",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung,"Celliers, L (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Climate Serv Ctr Germany, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany.",louis.celliers@hzg.de,"Costa, Maria Mánez/P-1225-2017; Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019; Celliers, Louis/AAP-7650-2021; Celliers, Louis/GRO-6282-2022","Costa, Maria Mánez/0000-0001-5415-0811; Celliers, Louis/0000-0001-5096-1713; Celliers, Louis/0000-0001-5096-1713; Rosendo, Sergio/0000-0002-3095-9824",Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association MASMA Programme [MASMA/OP/2013/01]; Department of Environmental Affairs in South Africa (Project on Oceans and Coastal Information Management System) [78643]; South African National Research Foundation [78643]; European Commission Marie Curie IRSES Grant [PIRSES-GA-2013-612-615]; European Union project entitled Enhancing Risk Management Partnerships for Catastrophic Natural Hazards in Europe (ENHANCE); Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union [308438],Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association MASMA Programme; Department of Environmental Affairs in South Africa (Project on Oceans and Coastal Information Management System); South African National Research Foundation(National Research Foundation - South Africa); European Commission Marie Curie IRSES Grant; European Union project entitled Enhancing Risk Management Partnerships for Catastrophic Natural Hazards in Europe (ENHANCE); Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union,"The authors would like to acknowledge the following hinders, institutions and individuals.

However, the empirical foundation for understanding how farm households choose multiple climate-smart practices is far from being established. In this paper, the effects of household, farm and climatic factors on farmers' decisions to use multiple adaptation practices are analysed. A survey of 921 farm households and 4312 farm plots combined with historical climate data in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia is explored using multivariate and random effect ordered probit econometric models. Results show agricultural production can be characterized by complementarities between adaptation practices. This result is important to designing packages of adaptation practices. The econometric results confirm that social capital, tenure security and climatic shocks are important determinants of the choice of the type and number of adaptation practices. The results suggest the need for carefully designing combinations of adaptation strategies based on agro-ecological conditions.","[Teklewold, Hailemariam; Mekonnen, Alemu] Ethiopian Dev Res Inst, Environm & Climate Res Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Mekonnen, Alemu] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Kohlin, Gunnar] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",Addis Ababa University; University of Gothenburg,"Teklewold, H (corresponding author), Ethiopian Dev Res Inst, Environm & Climate Res Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",hamtekbel@yahoo.com,"Kohlin, Gunnar/AAK-7797-2021","Kohlin, Gunnar/0000-0002-4387-7561",International Development Research Centre (IDRC) under the project Adaptation to Increase Resilience [107745-001],International Development Research Centre (IDRC) under the project Adaptation to Increase Resilience,This study was financed by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) under the project Adaptation to Increase Resilience to Climate Change in Ethiopian Agriculture [IDRC Project Number: 107745-001].,,31,39,39,4,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

We track the emergence of international adaptation law within the climate and non-climate regime, alongside increasingly dire extreme events and strident scientific consensus. Examining the growth in national and subnational laws for adaptation, we reflect on the role of framework legislation and legal mechanisms used in sectoral laws. Based on progress over the past decade, we outline how the role of law can be enhanced and accelerated in the decade ahead. We identify important trends in adaptation law and consider the potential for these innovations to drive future adaptation: the sheer growth in priority and volume of laws directed towards adaptation; the intersection of adaptation with other policy domains, especially disaster risk reduction; the need for improved architecture for funding adaptation; and the important role of strategic litigation. Largely absent from the past decade of adaptation law reform is evaluation of effectiveness, or examples of systemic reform that addresses underlying causes of vulnerability. With slow progress in implementing transformational adaptation law reform, we identify five design principles for adaptation laws. The design of laws must (1) be responsive to change; (2) address equity dimensions of climate change; (3) implement innovative solutions; (4) maximize co-benefits; and (5) establish processes for managing trade-offs.

SIDS have prioritised adaptation to climate change as it is widely accepted that some climate change is inevitable. Given the high cost of adaptation and the financial constraints faced by SIDS, many have pursued international adaptation financing to meet adaptation costs and ease domestic constraints. This paper analyses international adaptation financing commitments to SIDS across multiple regions between 2010 and 2014. It has three aims. First, it identifies trends in this financing from Members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to SIDS. Second, using a multivariate regression model, it identifies the determinants of this financing to SIDS, compared to other developing countries. Third, it elicits the perspectives of policy-makers in SIDS on their experience with international adaptation financing to date. This study finds that (1) the allocation of funding and donor commitments to SIDS is highly skewed, (2) whether a country is classified as a SIDS is a determinant of the amount of adaptation financing it can expect to receive-other determinants include population, per capita income, governance quality and vulnerability, depending on how it is conceptualised and measured, and (3) SIDS are dissatisfied with the current levels of international adaptation financing and their experience with accessing it. This paper concludes that, while international adaptation flows have not been sufficient, SIDS have not been disadvantaged in their access to such financing over the period, compared to other developing countries.","[Robinson, Stacy-ann] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 48 Linnaeus Way, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia; [Dornan, Matthew] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Dev Policy Ctr, 7 Liversidge St, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University,"Robinson, SA (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 48 Linnaeus Way, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",stacy-ann.robinson@anu.edu.au; matthew.dornan@anu.edu.au,"Robinson, Stacy-ann/R-2769-2019","Robinson, Stacy-ann/0000-0003-3163-8771",Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University (ANU); ANU Early Career Researcher Travel Scheme,Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade(Australian Government); Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University (ANU)(Australian National University); ANU Early Career Researcher Travel Scheme,"The authors acknowledge: the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University (ANU) and The ANU Early Career Researcher Travel Scheme for financial support for fieldwork; the Caribbean and Pacific interviewees; A/Prof Jamie Pittock, Profs Karen Edyvane and Ian White, Drs Tony Weir and Ian Fry, and the two anonymous reviewers for constructive feedback on earlier drafts; Drs Jonathan Pickering, Carola Betzold and Scott Hook, Prof Stephen Dovers, A/Prof Frank Jotzo and Mr George Carter for their inputs, insights and suggestions; and Daniel Ferris for proofreading.

Increasingly, researchers are also asked to provide policy advice through method-driven processes, rather than ad hoc. In this policy advice context, the paper focuses on a specific tension: strategic planning and developing policy-oriented projects. Until now, little is known about how non-university research organizations deal with this tension as regards providing policy advice in the spatial sciences. Therefore, the paper analyzes the strategy development of the Leibniz Institute of Ecological Urban and Regional Development (IOER) in Dresden. Both authors are affiliated to the IOER. Hence, the paper is written from an insider perspective based on scientific concepts such as strategic planning. The paper analyzes project examples that refer to climate change adaptation in cities and regions. It shows that challenges, aims and practices of policy advice are important components of IOER's explicit strategy. The project examples show that projects with the aim of policy advice are implemented in various forms and with significant diversity in terms of strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, the paper argues for the development of project portfolios at the strategic planning level of research organizations in order to consider challenges and aims of policy advice in the spatial sciences.","[Hutter, Gerard; Otto, Andreas] Leibniz Inst Okol Raumentwicklung IOR, Weberpl 1, D-01217 Dresden, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung,"Hutter, G (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Okol Raumentwicklung IOR, Weberpl 1, D-01217 Dresden, Germany.",g.hutter@ioer.de; a.otto@ioer.de,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0251-3625,2166-8604,,DISP,disP,,2017,53,4,,,,,42,54,,10.1080/02513625.2017.1414490,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02513625.2017.1414490,,,13,Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Public Administration,FT8TL,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000423426000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adaptation is sometimes described as climate-resilient development or development under a hostile climate. In support of this view, this paper estimates the combined cost of meeting and at the same time 'climate-proofing' the millennium development goals (MDGs) for Africa. Treating adaptation and development in an integrated way helps to better understand financing requirements analytically and, more importantly, to implement the requisite measures more effectively as part of an integrated development programme. We find that the external financing needed for 'climate-resilient' MDGs is about 40 per cent higher than the external financing for the MDGs alone - up to USD100 billion a year for the next decade, compared with USD72 billion a year for the MDGs alone. This estimate is indicative only and based on fairly cursory aggregate data. The next challenge would be to apply the integrated adaptation and development frameworks to concrete development strategies at the country level.","[Fankhauser, Samuel] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2E 2AE, England; [Fankhauser, Samuel] London Sch Econ, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2E 2AE, England; [Schmidt-Traub, Guido] Africa Progress Panel, Paris, France; [Schmidt-Traub, Guido] CDC Climate Asset Management, Paris, France",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Fankhauser, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, Houghton St, London WC2E 2AE, England.",s.fankhauser@lse.ac.uk,,"Fankhauser, Samuel/0000-0003-2100-7888",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,52,25,25,4,28,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

In Ghana, smallholder farmers in such agro-ecological zones are impacted by climate change due to their agro-based livelihoods, subsistence nature and extensive reliance on rain-fed agriculture. For such climate vulnerability hotspots, scholars and policymakers recommend varied strategies to help smallholder farmers adapt to climate change. Yet, how smallholder farmers value and prioritize these varied strategies is limited. This paper combines an ethnographic method with pairwise ranking as a participatory technique to capture smallholder farmers' prioritization of strategies to tackle climate change impacts in the Talensi district, a semiarid savannah agro-ecological zone in Ghana. Results showed that smallholder farmers prioritize and adapt on-farm and off-farm strategies to build their capacities against climate change impacts. However, some of the strategies prioritized by smallholder farmers such as illegal small-scale mining and burning and selling charcoal have maladaptive ramifications as they could exacerbate climate change impacts. The study calls for policy sensitivity to climate vulnerabilities of semiarid agro-ecological zones through the design and implementation of climate action plans that recognize smallholder farmers' adaptation priorities, understand lived experiences, and integrate indigenous knowledge to tackle climate change impacts.","[Mensah, Seth Opoku] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Akanpabadai, Timothy Amang-bey; Benamba, Chanimbe] Catholic Relief Serv, Tamale, Ghana; [Diko, Stephen Kofi] Univ Memphis, Dept City & Reg Planning, Memphis, TN USA; [Okyere, Seth Asare] Univ Arizona, Coll Architecture Planning & Landscape Architectu, Tucson, AZ USA",University of Technology Sydney; University of Memphis; University of Arizona,"Mensah, SO (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",seth.opokumensah@student.uts.edu.au; timothy.amang-beyakanpabadai@crs.org; skdiko@memphis.edu; sethrumsfel@gmail.com; benamba_chanimbe@wvi.org,,"Opoku Mensah, Seth/0000-0003-4899-4254; Diko, Stephen/0000-0003-1809-436X; Okyere, Seth Asare/0000-0001-9028-2491",,,,,125,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER INDIA,NEW DELHI,"7TH FLOOR, VIJAYA BUILDING, 17, BARAKHAMBA ROAD, NEW DELHI, 110 001, INDIA",0972-5792,2199-6873,,J SOCIAL EC DEV,J.

Given the transboundary nature of the Baltic Sea, its coastal states have much to gain from cooperation to tackle eutrophication and flood risks. Since eight out of nine coastal states are EU Member States, the EU is expected to steer their efforts. Indeed, EU legislation and the EU adaptation strategy, including one specifically for the Baltic Sea Region are in place to activate state actors. They cover crucial aspects for the management of the Baltic Sea, namely reducing eutrophication and managing flood risks. However, despite the holistic goals achieving good environmental status and reducing the adverse effects of flooding these Directives mainly prescribe assessments and the adoption of plans. It is left to the coastal states to design ambitious objectives and take measures or rather rely on exemptions. While all coastal states have strategies in place, progress in the achievement of these goals is not easy to measure. With regard to environmental protection, HELCOM fills this gap by providing additional steering and coordination through more stringent targets for nutrients, which address the impact of climate change on eutrophication. With regard to flood risks, the Council of the Baltic Sea States seems to have started to consider taking a similar role by developing a more concrete and coordinated flood risk strategy for the marine region.","[Keessen, Andrea] Univ Utrecht, Sch Law, Newtonlaan 231, NL-3584 BH Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Keessen, A (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Sch Law, Newtonlaan 231, NL-3584 BH Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.m.keessen@uu.nl,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

However, to date there has been no comprehensive empirical study to examine the extent to which climate change issues are integrated into state hazard mitigation plans (SHMPs). This study develops 18 indicators to examine the extent of climate change considerations in the 50 SHMPs. The results demonstrate that these SHMPs treat climate change issues in an uneven fashion, with large variations present among the 50 states. The overall plan quality for climate change considerations was sustained at an intermediate level with regard to climate change-related awareness, analysis, and actions. The findings confirm that climate change concepts and historic extreme events have been well recognized by the majority of SHMPs. Even though they are not specific to climate change, mitigation and adaptation strategies that can help reduce climate change risks have been adopted in these plans.

Several scientific terms and general concepts have been used to comprehend adaptation, including vulnerability, exposure, sensitivity, adaptability, and resilience. However, most of these concepts are often used in inconsistent ways and their relationship is to a large extent unclear. As a result, there is a lack of clear understanding of adaptation and its practical implementation in fields such as spatial planning, whose role in tackling climate change, especially through ecosystem approaches, is critical. This paper attempts to investigate the practical integration of adaptation in the context of spatial planning, specifically through Green Infrastructure (GI) planning. Applying a thematic analysis to 91 scientific and major policy documents, the main determinants of the critical concepts that relate to adaptation were identified, classified, and intertwined with key determinants of GI planning and design. The analysis led to the development of a methodological tool, named REAd GrIn. This model can be used to prepare and evaluate spatial plans and policies, which integrate the concepts of resilience, vulnerability, and adaptability to achieve adaptation through spatial planning.","[Salata, Konstantina-Dimitra; Yiannakou, Athena] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Engn, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Salata, KD (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Engn, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",salatadg@plandevel.auth.gr,,"Yiannakou, Athena/0000-0003-3674-1401",,,,,120,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2023,15,3,,,,,,,2693,10.3390/su15032693,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15032693,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8V1SW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000930419500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In western North America, diminished snowpack and river flows are causing relatively gradual, homogeneous (system-wide) changes in ecosystems and services. In addition, increased climate variability is also accelerating the incidence of abrupt and patchy disturbances such as fires, floods and droughts. This paper posits that two key variables often considered in landscape ecology-the rate of change and the degree of patchiness of change-can aid in developing climate change adaptation strategies. We use two examples from the borderland'' region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. In pinon-juniper woodland die-offs that occurred in the southwestern United States during the 2000s, ecosystem services suddenly crashed in some parts of the system while remaining unaffected in other locations. The precise timing and location of die-offs was uncertain. On the other hand, slower, homogeneous change, such as the expected declines in water supply to the Colorado River delta, will likely impact the entire ecosystem, with ecosystem services everywhere in the delta subject to alteration, and all users likely exposed. The rapidity and spatial heterogeneity of faster, patchy climate change exemplified by tree die-off suggests that decision-makers and local stakeholders would be wise to operate under a Rawlsian veil of ignorance,'' and implement adaptation strategies that allow ecosystem service users to equitably share the risk of sudden loss of ecosystem services before actual ecosystem changes occur. On the other hand, in the case of slower, homogeneous, system-wide impacts to ecosystem services as exemplified by the Colorado River delta, adaptation strategies can be implemented after the changes begin, but will require a fundamental rethinking of how ecosystems and services are used and valued. In sum, understanding how the rate of change and degree of patchiness of change will constrain adaptive options is a critical consideration in preparing for climate change.","[Lopez-Hoffman, Laura; Breshears, David D.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Lopez-Hoffman, Laura] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Breshears, David D.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Allen, Craig D.] US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Jemez Mt Field Stn, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA; [Miller, Marc L.] Univ Arizona, James E Rogers Coll Law, Tucson, AZ 85722 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Arizona,"Lopez-Hoffman, L (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",lauralh@email.arizona.edu,"Breshears, David D./B-9318-2009; Allen, Craig D./K-1121-2019; Breshears, David D/GSN-3920-2022","Breshears, David D./0000-0001-6601-0058; Allen, Craig D./0000-0002-8777-5989; Miller, Marc/0000-0002-5316-8515",DOE NICCR [DE-FCO2-O6ER64159]; B2 Philecology Foundation (Fort Worth TX); NSF Critical Zone Observatories [NSF EAR-0724958]; Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1039127] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,DOE NICCR(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); B2 Philecology Foundation (Fort Worth TX); NSF Critical Zone Observatories(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"The authors wish to thank W.

Sweden, often seen as progressive in climate change issues, has struggled in adopting a sufficient local climate adaptation organization. This article aimed to describe and analyze the climate adaptation organization in 13 Swedish municipalities from five perspectives: Problem framing, administrative and political agency, administrative and political structures, measures and solutions, and the role of learning. The mapping of these perspectives provides an opportunity to analyze barriers to local climate adaptation. Key policy documents have been studied including climate adaptation plans, crisis management plans, and regulatory documents, as well as documents from private consultants. This study showed that few municipalities have a formal organization for climate adaptation, clear structures, political support, and specific climate adaptation plans. At the same time, many of the municipalities are planning for transformation, due to a push from the county board, a lead agency in climate adaptation. There are also ample networks providing opportunities for learning among municipalities and regions. This study concluded that one key barrier is the lack of focus and prioritization in a majority of the municipalities, leaving the administrators, often planners, in a more activist position. The need for organizational mainstreaming and resources is emphasized.","[Kristianssen, Ann-Catrin] Orebro Univ, Sch Humanities Educ & Social Sci, Polit Sci, SE-70182 Orebro, Sweden; [Granberg, Mikael] Karlstad Univ, Ctr Societal Risk Res & Polit Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Granberg, Mikael] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Granberg, Mikael] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Orebro University; Karlstad University; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Uppsala University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Granberg, M (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Ctr Societal Risk Res & Polit Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.;Granberg, M (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.;Granberg, M (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",ann-catrin.kristianssen@oru.se; mikael.granberg@kau.se,"Granberg, Mikael/B-5399-2013","Granberg, Mikael/0000-0002-5356-4112",Lansforsakringsbolagens Forskningsfond [P2/14]; Swedish Civil Contingency Agency [MSB/2016-6855],Lansforsakringsbolagens Forskningsfond; Swedish Civil Contingency Agency,"This research was funded by Lansforsakringsbolagens Forskningsfond, grant number P2/14, and the research fund of the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency, grant numberMSB/2016-6855.",,60,3,3,5,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,APR,2021,9,4,,,,,,,52,10.3390/cli9040052,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9040052,,,17,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,RR2HF,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000642925400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many approaches and tools have been developed and used to measure climate resilience in cities. In this study, we explore if and how such tools can be or have been used to support decision-making for building urban climate resilience. We applied a deep analysis of 27 tools developed for measuring urban climate resilience and supplemented it with semi-structured interviews with experts who implemented such tools in over 100 cities around the world. Our analysis shows that only about one-third of these tools are designed to support implementing resilience actions while the rest mainly focus on sharing knowledge and raising awareness. We also observed a prevailing focus on evaluating coping and incremental adaptation capacities (as opposed to transformative capacities) against climate risks in such tools, which tends to trigger short-term fix rather than longterm solutions. Therefore, we argue that urban climate resilience measurement tools need to 1) support action implementation processes as much as assessing outcomes, and 2) consider the enabling environment for enhancing transformative capacities as much as coping and incremental adaptation capacities of cities. Finally, we explore challenges and opportunities of implementing resilience actions drawn from end-users' insights.","[Mehryar, Sara; Surminski, Swenja] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Sasson, Idan] Climate Policy Initiat, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Mehryar, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.",s.mehryar@lse.ac.uk,"Mehryar, Sara/GSE-2683-2022",,"Z Zurich Foundation, Switzerland; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; ESRC via the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy [ES/R009708/1]","Z Zurich Foundation, Switzerland; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; ESRC via the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy","This work was supported by the Z Zurich Foundation, Switzerland; the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment and the ESRC via the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy under Grant number: ES/R009708/1.",,76,11,11,16,60,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,JAN,2022,41,,,,,,,,101047,10.1016/j.uclim.2021.101047,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2021.101047,,DEC 2021,17,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,XS5ZF,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000732986000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, concise DRR and CCA definitions for policy integrate are yet to be provided. Drawing from the Environmental Policy Integration, this paper suggests definitions for the integration of CCA policy into DRR policy, further addressing the importance of its horizontal (inter-ministerial) and vertical (intra-ministerial) dimensions. The definitions were empirically examined in Zambia during the formulation and implementation of the DRR and CCA policies (at the horizontal dimension), and water management, agriculture and forestry policies (at the vertical dimension). Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and document review, and analysed within a policy integration cycle. Zambia is a good example of the increased understanding of the linkages of the two fields, and the role of governance in progressing the integration. Governance challenges and the historical burden have resulted in overlapping policy processes, as both policies incorporate the other field, and creates a threat of parallel national-level structures, thereby increasing potential inefficiencies in governance and policy implementation. The importance of developing a horizontal integration strategy prior to policy formulation processes to avoid the potential of inefficiencies became evident. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Reviewing current attempts to link these two fields, we suggest an urgent need for a holistic and dynamic systems approach, focusing on socio-ecological resilience as a primary objective for adaptation and risk reduction. Furthermore, we propose two mechanisms for transformative change in these fields: (1) the use of iterative risk management as a primary instrument for adaptive decision making, and (2) the establishment of 'boundary organizations' and institutional changes that increase the transfer of knowledge between not only science and policy, but also science, policy and practice. There is immediate demand for participatory scholarly research to address the needs and concerns of practitioners on the ground. As a framework for these concepts, we see a dynamic systems approach to socio-ecological resilience as a means to deal with the inherent uncertainty associated with climate change and hazard events.","[Collier, William M.; Jacobs, Kasey R.; Saxena, Alark; Baker-Gallegos, Julianne; Carroll, Matthew] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Yohe, Gary W.] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",Yale University; Wesleyan University,"Collier, WM (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",william.collier@yale.edu,,,,,,,85,14,15,0,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1747-7891,1878-0059,,ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK,Environ.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a comprehensive review of published papers on climate change impacts and adaptation. Findings - It has been documented that by 2050, the world will have to limit emissions of all greenhouse gases to the equivalent of 400 GT of carbon in order to stand a 75 per cent chance of avoiding more than 2 degrees C of warming. This is practically impossible because there are not enough resources and technology to achieve that target. Even if all of the emissions are stopped in next few years, it will take the next 40 years for the world to follow its current trend before full recovery. Thus, climate will continue to change, its impacts will continue to increase and Africa is placed as the most vulnerable continent. The only best solution is that the vulnerable population should be first in line for support to adapt to climate change impacts. In such instances adaptation policy should recognise and support a wide range of options for building resilient and sustainable livelihoods, enhancing opportunities available for adaptation, without ignoring the need to address the existing developmental challenges. Research limitations/implications - This paper relies on secondary source of information. Practical implications - The paper is a valuable input towards the preparation of adaptation policy in developing countries. Originality/value - This paper relied on review of secondary data (published articles) thus providing critical findings from a number of field studies.","Muhimbili Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Sci, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",Muhimbili University of Health & Allied Sciences,"Kaijage, HR (corresponding author), Muhimbili Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Sci, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.",hkaijage@muhas.ac.tz,,,,,,,17,3,4,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

It is increasingly recognised that in order to apply new knowledge about climate change in rural development practice a more institutional perspective is needed, but there is no clear consensus on what this implies. This article looks at agricultural extension as an example of a meso-level institution that is frequently assumed to be a major potential implementing partner in climate adaptation efforts, at the same time as it is also often portrayed as a worst-case example of the obstacles encountered in changing the focus of a path dependent bureaucracy. This article contrasts the perspectives of normative climate adaptation frameworks (exemplified by the 2011 World Resources Report) with what is known about prevailing extension trends and realities. It is suggested that long lists of recommended climate adaptation tasks and technologies may distract from an understanding of the institutional change processes underway within meso-level institutions, wherein the climate agenda would need to be merged with other agendas related to pluralistic, pragmatic, accountable, sustainable and market-oriented rural development.","Danish Inst Int Studies, DK-1401 Copenhagen K, Denmark",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies,"Christoplos, I (corresponding author), Danish Inst Int Studies, Strandgade 56, DK-1401 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",ich@diis.dk,,,,,,,41,6,6,1,5,ROYAL DANISH GEOGRAPHICAL SOC,COPENHAGEN K,"OSTER VOLDGADE 10, COPENHAGEN K, DK 1350, DENMARK",0016-7223,1903-2471,,GEOGR TIDSSKR-DEN,Geogr.

While evidenced-based research suggests means through which nations can adapt to climate change, there are tremendous barriers to this information reaching the most vulnerable populations: those who live in developing nations. An investigation of the factors contributing to these barriers identifies three broad phases in the lifecycle of information that have contributed to these unfavorable conditions: the reproduction and dissemination of information, the organization and storage of information, and the diffusion of information/knowledge. Each of these phases is described as well as potential solutions to improve the transfer of information and the effectiveness of developing nations to adapt to climate change conditions.","[Lund, Brady] Emporia State Univ, Lib & Informat Management, Emporia, KS 66801 USA",,"Lund, B (corresponding author), Emporia State Univ, Campus Box 4025,I Kellogg Circle, Emporia, KS 66801 USA.",Blund2@g.emporia.edu,"Lund, Brady/GLV-4793-2022","Lund, Brady/0000-0002-4819-8162",,,,,43,4,4,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0340-0352,1745-2651,,IFLA J-INT FED LIBR,IFLA J.-Int.

Information on the current status of each sector is a valuable point of reference in terms of accessing contribution to the implementation of future national adaptation efforts. A modified version of the National Adaptive Capacity (NAC) framework developed by the World Resources Institute was used to assess the three sectors of activity. This framework is structured around five functions: assessment, prioritisation, coordination, information management, and climate risk reduction; results of the assessment suggest that all three sectors are at the nascent stages of the climate change adaptation process. Currently there is no dedicated national policy guidance or legal support mechanism on adaptation in Ireland; hence there is no national financial commitment to support implementation of adaptation actions for any of the sectors assessed. Subjecting these three selected sectors of activity to such an assessment enables identification of existing actions that can potentially support current adaptation, as well as where issues such as knowledge gaps and lack of policy support hinder progress.

Hydro-economic modeling is a state-of-the art approach that can be used to guide the design and implementation of these policies in basins. A major gap in developments of hydro economic modeling to date has been the weak integration of physically-based representations of water sources and uses such as the interaction between ground and surface water resources, to inform complex basin scale policy choices. This paper presents an integrated hydro-economic modeling framework to address this gap with application to an important and complex river basin in Spain, the Jucar basin, for the assessment of a range of climate change scenarios and policy choices. Results indicate that in absence of adequate policies protecting water resources and natural ecosystems, water users will strategically deplete reservoirs, aquifers and river flows for short-term adaptation to climate change, disregarding the impacts on the environment and future human activities. These impacts can be addressed by implementing sustainable management policies. However, these policies could have disproportionate costs for some stakeholders groups, and their opposition may undermine attempts at sustainable policy. These tradeoffs among water policy choices are important guides to the design of policies aimed at basin wide adaptation to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In particular adaptation to climate change raises fundamental conceptual challenges concerning the interplay of societal and biophysical processes. The paper discusses some of these challenges and introduces a theoretical concept able to improve our understanding of the complex interactions between nature and society. The concept of 'societal relationships with nature', which originated in the so-called 'Frankfurt School' of critical theory, provides a dialectic approach towards these complex interactions able to deal with the societal causes of climate change as much as with the repercussions of global warming on societies, including the claim for balancing mitigation and adaptation needs. Basically, the goal of sustainable development has returned on the agenda in a new form: To what extent are societies in the 'North' and 'South' respectively able to deal with the vulnerabilities created or heightened by climate change? In this context, the spatial dimension of climate policy at and between the different spatial scales is becoming an ever more pressing problem, which is illustrated using the transformation of ecosystem services as a case study.","UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Gorg, C (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",christoph.goerg@ufz.de,"Görg, Christoph/K-2935-2017","Görg, Christoph/0000-0001-7031-1056",,,,,55,3,3,0,13,GESELLSCHAFT ERDKUNDE BERLIN,BERLIN,"ARNO-HOLZ-STR 14, BERLIN, 12165, GERMANY",0013-9998,,,ERDE,ERDE,,2011,142,4,,,SI,,411,428,,,,,,18,"Geography; Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Physical Geography; Geology,961VF,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000305496900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Investigations conducted as part of the study include an analysis of current literature addressing climate adaptation in relation to MOM practices, supplemented by a review of existing research projects and initiatives in this field. Three case studies involving different Norwegian building owner organizations were examined in order to investigate the current status of the application and extent of climate adaptation practices in relation to MOM. The study has revealed a significant gap between theory and practice when it comes to integrating MOM in relation to climate adaptation. The concept of climate adaptation is only addressed as a high-level strategic issue. The case studies thus emphasize the need for a structured process that can enable the incorporation of climate adaptation in current MOM practices. This proposes a generic and structured climate-adaptive MOM framework that will enable the incorporation of climate adaptation in into corporate MOM practices at different scales and organizational levels. Implementation of this flexible and transferable framework is expected to provide a basis for accruing further knowledge on climate adaptation. Further work with the framework should include the introduction of more tangible and tailored tools and processes, including checklists or scoring systems accompanied by relevant climate adaptation factors and plans.","[Grynning, Steinar; Gradeci, Klodian; Gaarder, Jorn Emil; Time, Berit] SINTEF Community, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Lohne, Jardar; Kvande, Tore] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Grynning, S (corresponding author), SINTEF Community, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",steinar.grynning@sintef.no; Klodian.Gradeci@sintef.no; jorn.gaarder@sintef.no; berit.time@sintef.no; jardar.lohne@ntnu.no; tore.kvande@ntnu.no,"Lohne, Jardar/HGA-4028-2022","Grynning, Steinar/0000-0002-7706-2774; Lohne, Jardar/0000-0002-2135-3468; Gradeci, Klodian/0000-0002-9837-3512; Kvande, Tore/0000-0003-0522-9974; Time, Berit/0000-0002-3506-6494",Research Council of Norway [237859],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),This research was funded by the Research Council of Norway and private industry partners under grant number 237859.,,90,7,7,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,JUN,2020,10,6,,,,,,,107,10.3390/buildings10060107,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings10060107,,,20,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,MO0NK,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000551233800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

It argues that landscape-level histories which include pollen evidence and archaeology can address this challenge and reveal local processes of climate adaptation. Here we focus on Ireland and Scotland and a fascinating rise in small-scale cereal cultivation on upland pastures during the Little Ice Age. Bayesian modeling is used to test the chronological resolution of field evidence and compare it with climate reconstructions. We can see that the cultivation emerged in late medieval times, when cattle were facing climate-related stresses, and increased in early modern times during the Little Ice Age's main phase. We suggest that it started in an indirect adaptation to climate change, supplementing supplies of food and fodder for pastoralists, but increased as rural populations and external market demands grew. There is a need for finer temporal resolution in pollen records and archaeology, as well as greater integration with socio-economic history, if we are to be more certain about changes in the relative significance of climate in pastoral land use.","[Costello, Eugene] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Hist, Cork, Ireland; [Costello, Eugene] Univ Coll Cork, Rad Humanities Lab, Cork, Ireland; [Costello, Eugene] Stockholm Univ, Dept Archaeol & Class Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kearney, Kevin; Gearey, Benjamin] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Human Environm, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork; University College Cork; Stockholm University; University College Cork,"Costello, E (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Sch Hist, Cork, Ireland.;Costello, E (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Rad Humanities Lab, Cork, Ireland.",ecostello@ucc.ie,,"Gearey, Benjamin/0000-0003-0323-4921",,,,,96,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0161-5440,1940-1906,,HIST METHOD,Hist.

A linear park has been recently created along the ephemeral Pedieos River in the urban area of Nicosia, Cyprus. Questionnaire surveys and micrometeorological measurements were conducted to explore people's perceptions and satisfaction regarding the services of the urban park. People's main reasons to visit the park were physical activity and exercise (67%), nature (13%), and cooling (4%). The micrometeorological measurements in and near the park revealed a relatively low cooling effect (0.5 degrees C) of the park. However, the majority of the visitors (84%) were satisfied or very satisfied with the cooling effect of the park. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds of individuals feeling very comfortable under a projected 3 degrees C future increase in temperature would be 0.34 times lower than the odds of feeling less comfortable. The discrepancies between the observed thermal comfort index and people's perceptions revealed that people in semi-arid environments are adapted to the hot climatic conditions; 63% of the park visitors did not feel uncomfortable at temperatures between 27 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Further research is needed to assess other key ecosystems services of this urban green river corridor, such as flood protection, air quality regulation, and biodiversity conservation, to contribute to integrated climate change adaptation planning.","[Giannakis, Elias; Bruggeman, Adriana; Zoumides, Christos; Eliades, Marinos] Cyprus Inst, Energy Environm & Water Res Ctr, 20 Konstantinou Kavafi St, CY-2121 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Poulou, Dimitra] Univ Athens, Fac Early Childhood Educ, 13 Navarinou St, Athens 10680, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Giannakis, E (corresponding author), Cyprus Inst, Energy Environm & Water Res Ctr, 20 Konstantinou Kavafi St, CY-2121 Nicosia, Cyprus.",e.giannakis@cyi.ac.cy; a.bruggeman@cyi.ac.cy; dimipoulou.1@gmail.com; c.zoumides@cyi.ac.cy; m.eliades@cyi.ac.cy,"Bruggeman, Adriana/J-6345-2013; Giannakis, Elias/AAU-5598-2020; Eliades, Marinos/L-5444-2019; Eliades, Marinos/HOF-0607-2023; Eliades, Marinos/K-4618-2019; Zoumides, Christos/M-9586-2018","Bruggeman, Adriana/0000-0002-6475-5221; Giannakis, Elias/0000-0002-1779-9811; Eliades, Marinos/0000-0002-0715-9511; Eliades, Marinos/0000-0002-0715-9511; Zoumides, Christos/0000-0003-0998-3878",European Union [612385],European Union(European Commission),This study has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no 612385 (BEWATER project).

Design/methodology/approach - The paper identifies three Australian LGs which are subjected to potential climate change-related hazards. Semi-structured interviews with staff officers of the selected LGs and supporting organizations have been conducted to collect and analyze primary data. Findings - The findings reveal that emerging challenges in governance of CCA and DRR integration include the political sensitiveness of climate change, uncertainty and standstill because of the vagueness by higher government levels, competing interests between LGs' departments and communication breakdowns because of scepticism and the use of jargon. Meanwhile, the findings reveal that emerging opportunities include the promotion of participation mechanisms in planning, the creation of partnerships with local stakeholders and the use of coordination organizations and platforms. Exploring these challenges and opportunities represents a key step to strengthen governance mechanisms at a local level. Research limitations/implications - The paper is based on a limited number (3) of Australian case studies with a limited number (15) of interviews. Further insights could be gained by analyzing more Australian LGs, involving a higher number of participants, and by using complementary research methods and data (survey and questionnaires) about experiences of other local stakeholders. Originality/value - The paper is one of the few exploring challenges and opportunities of Australian LGs in governance of CCA and DRR integration in Australia and discusses them in terms of the potential to strengthen governance mechanisms within Australian LGs.","[Forino, Giuseppe; Von Meding, Jason; Brewer, Graham John] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Forino, G (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.",g.forino@gmail.com,,"forino, giuseppe/0000-0001-6659-0742",University of Newcastle,University of Newcastle,The authors warmly thank all the interviewees for their time and availability in taking part into the research.

Using data from national and sub-national policy actors in Uganda (37 semi-structured interviews, 78 questionnaires), the study found that policy actors largely adhered to global gender discourses in proposing context-specific solutions to gender inequality. Our results show that although local actors identified local norms and culture as major barriers to gender equality, their proposed solutions did not address local gender norms, focussed on formal policy and did little to address underlying causes of gender inequalities. Based on the findings, we suggest that 'the local' should be reconstructed as a deliberative space where a wide variety of actors, including local feminist organisations, critically engage, assess and address local gender inequality patterns in agriculture and climate change adaptation processes.","[Acosta, Mariola; van Wessel, Margit; van Bommel, Severine; Feindt, Peter H.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Strateg Commun Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Acosta, Mariola] Int Inst Trop Agr, Kampala, Uganda; [Acosta, Mariola] Alliance Biovers Int & CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [van Bommel, Severine] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Australia; [Feindt, Peter H.] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr & Food Policy, Berlin, Germany",Wageningen University & Research; University of Queensland; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Acosta, M (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Strateg Commun Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Acosta, M (corresponding author), Int Inst Trop Agr, Kampala, Uganda.;Acosta, M (corresponding author), Alliance Biovers Int & CIAT, Cali, Colombia.",mariola.acosta@wur.nl,"; Feindt, Peter/C-4874-2015","van Wessel, Margit/0000-0002-3611-5817; Acosta, Mariola/0000-0003-4456-1283; van Bommel, Severine/0000-0002-7782-9162; Feindt, Peter/0000-0002-5978-5944",CGIAR,CGIAR(CGIAR),"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

However, a systematic review is still absent, though there are many studies about farmers' adaptations to climate change, and few studies discuss their potential impacts on climate change. This article analyses farmers' adaptation strategies and their heterogeneities across regions in China via a systemic literature review. Then we also discuss possible driving factors of these adaptations and their potential impacts on greenhouse gas emissions. We follow the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines to identify and screen publications. A total of 448 relevant records were identified from the Web of Science, Elsevier ScienceDirect, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). We include peer-reviewed publications focusing on farmers engaged in crop farming in China, with survey data and specific adoption ratio analysis of adaptations to climate change. After screening, 27 articles were finally analysed. Our results show that crop variety management, rescheduling farming, increasing production inputs, increasing irrigation, and crop structure management are prevalent strategies reported in the existing literature. However, sustainable adaptations such as improving farmland's ecological environment and agronomic water-saving irrigation gain less attention. Besides, farmers in northern China adapt to climate change more actively compared to their counterparts in southern China. Moreover, some adaptations with high adoption ratios, such as increased chemical inputs, might increase greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate climate change. Our findings have important implications for food security and sustainable agricultural development.","[Chen, Jiao; Zhong, Funing; Sun, Dingqiang] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Weigang 1, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Sun, DQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Weigang 1, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dqsun@njau.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71873067]; China-Europe Efficient Water Management Research Platform [2017YFE0118100]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Graduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYCX20_0611],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China-Europe Efficient Water Management Research Platform; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Graduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province,"The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 71873067), the China-Europe Efficient Water Management Research Platform (no. 2017YFE0118100), A project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), and the Graduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (no.

The article analyses how the government brings together climate change discourses with its struggle for new rights and resources for the country. The awareness of anthropogenic climate change has generated new parameters for law-making processes and emerging legal orders. The article develops a new concept of how to frame the cultural and social impacts of climate change from a Pacific Island perspective, in order to overcome shortcomings of the widely-employed notions of 'vulnerability' and 'resilience' as frames for adaptation to climate change in Oceania. By employing the notion of climate change as a 'travelling idea', combined with the 'anthropology of emerging legal orders', the research perspective presented here enables us to analyse emerging social and legal orders that evolve in face of climate change and particular global framings, which will be illustrated here by recent developments on the island state of Kiribati in the central Pacific. It combines the theoretical perspective of legal pluralism with aspects of the 'sociology of emergence' of de Sousa Santos and Rodriguez-Garavito, who shed light on bottom-up processes in justice building and on emerging rights in the Global South (2005). It will be argued that other regions, particularly the often migration-unfriendly Global North, can learn from the new concepts of belonging, migration and solidarity as empowering strategies that are developing in Oceania.","[Klepp, Silja] Univ Kiel, CAU, Inst Geog, Ludewig Meyn Str 14, D-24908 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Klepp, S (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, CAU, Inst Geog, Ludewig Meyn Str 14, D-24908 Kiel, Germany.",klepp@geographie.uni-kiel.de,,"Klepp, Silja/0000-0001-9837-362X",,,,,60,10,10,3,52,DUNCKER & HUMBLOT GMBH,BERLIN,"POSTFACH 410329, 12113 BERLIN, GERMANY",0038-0377,1865-5106,,SOCIOLOGUS,Sociologus,DEC,2018,68,2,,,,,149,170,,10.3790/soc.68.2.149,http://dx.doi.org/10.3790/soc.68.2.149,,,22,Anthropology; Sociology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Anthropology; Sociology,GV8WC,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000446430100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hence, a study was conducted to identify the strategies adopted by the cereal growers in Eastern Himalaya region of India and determine the factors affecting them. A total 120 farmers were surveyed from Senapati district in Manipur and East Sikkim district in Sikkim. The widely adopted strategies were the change in transplanting time and change in transplanting as well as harvesting time, which were autonomous, traditional, and taken in response to the scarcity of water. Tobit model has identified that the area under rice cultivation, support received from Village Science Centre, and decline in food availability positively influenced the farmers to adapt to climate change. Multinomial logit model revealed that the female farmers, area under rice cultivation, and decline in rice productivity positively influenced the adoption of the strategies, whereas number of cattle owned, irrigated area, and support from Agricultural Department revealed the negative influence. To sustain farming in hill agriculture, the study recommends the integration of the farmers' knowledge along with scientific measures.

We analyzed interviews and documents to create one representative seasonal calendar, which shows the multiple, overlapping factors affecting timber operations. Many loggers identified impacts from seasonal variability and restrictions related to transportation, environmental conditions, and recreation. Seasonal environmental challenges are intertwined with and inseparable from economic challenges. Spring break-up used to be the time for rest, but increasingly, loggers do not stop working because of financial pressures to continue logging.

Adaptation measures are required to ensure the long-term integrity and successful operation of the built environment. This study examines literature on climate adaptation measures for buildings through a scoping literature review. It is centered around the main journals in the field of climate adaptation of the built environment, then expanded to map the extent of scientific publications about climate adaptation in general. Studies that regard future climate scenarios have been of particular interest. The majority of the identified literature concerns climate change impacts on buildings in warm climates, with overheating being seen as the greatest challenge. Additionally, few empirical studies are found; most identified research is based on computer simulations or literature reviews. The volume of research on the consequences of climate change on buildings in cold regions is surprisingly small, considering the pecuniary stakes involved. The predictions of climate scenarios suggest regulatory/policy measures on climate adaptation should be taken as quickly as possible to avoid greater costs in the future. However, further research into future scenarios is also essential.","[Stagrum, Anna Eknes; Andenaes, Erlend; Kvande, Tore; Lohne, Jardar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Andenaes, E (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",annastagrum@gmail.com; erlend.andenas@ntnu.no; tore.kvande@ntnu.no; jardar.lohne@ntnu.no,"Lohne, Jardar/HGA-4028-2022","Lohne, Jardar/0000-0002-2135-3468; Kvande, Tore/0000-0003-0522-9974",Research Council of Norway [237859],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This research was funded by the Research Council of Norway, grant number 237859.",,78,19,19,16,44,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR 1,2020,12,5,,,,,,,1721,10.3390/su12051721,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12051721,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KY3KU,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000522470900021,View Full Record in Web of Science

While the costs of adaptation might be observable and immediate, the benefits are often uncertain. The limitations of traditional decision-making processes in the context of adaptation decisions are recognised, and so-called robust approaches are increasingly explored in the literature. Robust approaches select projects that meet their purpose across a variety of futures by integrating a wide range of climate scenarios, and are thus particularly suited for deep uncertainty. We review real option analysis, portfolio analysis, robust-decision making and no/low regret options as well as reduced decision-making time horizons, describing the underlying concepts and highlighting a number of applications. We discuss the limitations of robust decision-making processes to identify which ones may prove most promising as adaptation planning becomes increasingly critical; namely those that provide a compromise between a meaningful analysis and simple implementation. We introduce a simple framework identifying which method is suited for which application. We conclude that the 'robust decision making' method offers the most potential in adaptation appraisal as it can be applied with various degrees of complexity and to a wide range of options.

Drought and floods were the most commonly identified climate risks. Adaptation proposals simultaneously addressed local poverty and climate change challenges, and offered a wide range of approaches to render local development more resilient to current climate variability.

Through investigating climate change adaptation and mitigation implementation in Namibia, this study validates the existence of these co-benefits where integration is fully observed. It employed a meta-analysis and content analysis to link the observed variables to the most recognised co-benefits. The findings suggest that integration is an efficient way to generate co-benefits that contribute positively to the climate change project. Effective leadership support is one way of realising such integration, either via public-private partnership or energy policy. Namibian energy policy, it is suggested, through voluntary tools and incentives, should create key public-private partnerships and promote management.

Promoting green roofs is thus a key element in urban strategies to address climate change. How to actually promote green roofs, however, has so far proven elusive: attempts to link specific policy instruments to a more or less successful diffusion of green roofs have been few and far between. The present paper relies on institutional economics to advance the present understanding of the link between policy instruments and green roofs. It argues that different green roofs are confronted with different social dilemmas, and thus require different policy instruments. Specifically, small green roofs face a free-rider problem, which is best addressed through regulations and incentives. Large green roofs face instead a collective action problem, which is best addressed through communications and network-building. This perspective is tested empirically through a comparative analysis of 18 global cities on the forefront in the promotion of green roofs. The policy instruments observed in these cities match with the theoretical expectations laid down in the paper. Implications emerge for both policy and research.","[Roggero, Matteo] Humboldt Univ, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Roggero, M (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",matteo.mancini.roggero@gmail.com,,,,,,,55,5,5,12,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

In many pastoral communities in Africa, traditional weather and climate forecasting remains the most accessible and affordable source of weather and climate information. In this study, we used individual interviews and focused group discussions to systematically document indigenous weather and climate forecasting knowledge among Afar pastoralists, with the aim of making such information available, and enhance use of this knowledge in climate change adaptation and explore synergies with modern weather forecasting system. The Afar pastoralists traditionally predict weather and climate variation through the observation of diverse bio-physical entities including livestock, insects, birds, trees and wildlife. No single indicator is taken at face value; weather forecasting is undertaken in a dynamic process where information collected from different sources, including weather information from the modern weather forecasting system, is triangulated to make the safest livelihood decisions. Before any forecasting information is used, it is evaluated through three traditional institutions that collect, share and analyse the information. These institutions include (1) the Edo or range scouting where traditional rangeland scouts are sent on a mission to assess weather and other spatially and temporally variable attributes on rangelands; (2) the Dagu, a traditional secured and reputable network, where weather information is shared among users; and (3) the Adda or the traditional Afar governance system, which analyses traditional weather information before community decisions are made. This first-time systematic documentation of indigenous weather and climate forecasting knowledge among the Afar communities demonstrated the dynamic process of indigenous weather and climate knowledge production, analysis and communication. This shows the value of indigenous knowledge in contemporary pastoral communities, while highlighting synergies with the modern weather and climate knowledge system for co-production of knowledge that serves the objectives of local people.","[Balehegn, Mulubrhan] Mekelle Univ, Dept Anim Rangeland & Wildlife Sci, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Balehey, Selam] Mekelle Univ, Inst Environm Gender & Dev, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Fu, Chao; Liang, Wu] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, UNEP IEMP, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Mekelle University; Mekelle University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Balehegn, M (corresponding author), Mekelle Univ, Dept Anim Rangeland & Wildlife Sci, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",mulubrhan.balehegn@mu.edu.et,"Fu, Chao/HKW-2399-2023; Gebremikael, Mulubrhan Balehegn/W-2661-2017","Fu, Chao/0000-0001-6869-2400; Gebremikael, Mulubrhan Balehegn/0000-0001-6832-8369","Local and Indigenous Knowledge Systems (LInKS) project at the Climate Frontlines Program of UNESCO [4500340760-A1]; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI); Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41401068, 41661144022]",Local and Indigenous Knowledge Systems (LInKS) project at the Climate Frontlines Program of UNESCO; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI); Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was funded by the Local and Indigenous Knowledge Systems (LInKS) project at the Climate Frontlines Program of UNESCO (Contract No. 4500340760-A1).

Since wetlands play an important role in the sustainability of arid regions, climate change adaptation measures are required to conserve wetlands. However, how can we determine the regions that need increased adaptation measures? This paper aims to respond to this question and determine the regions that were highly degraded after climate change to consider them as high priority for adaptation measures. To reach this goal, degradation in the main factors that affect the functions of the Hamoun wetlands was detected in two periods, including wetland a one-year inundation period and over a 40-year period. The Hamoun wetlands are dealing with intensive drought because of the climate change that dries out these wetlands in some months and some years. Landsat images were classified using a support vector machine (SVM) in both the one-year inundation period and over 40 years to determine the regions that lost water and vegetation cover. The degradation of water bird habitat was also determined over both periods. The multicriteria evaluation (MCE) method was applied to overlay the layers and prioritize the regions for adaptation measures based on the degradation criteria. The two important contributions of this paper include introducing a functional method for the implementation of adaptation measures and running this method by the main components shared between all wetlands, which makes this method applicable in all regions.","[Maleki, Saeideh; Pahlevanravi, Ahmad] Univ Zabol, Dept Nat Resources, Zabol, Iran; [Rahdari, Vahid] Univ Zabol, Hamoun Int Wetland Res Inst, Zabol, Iran; [Baghdadi, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, INRAE, TETIS, Montpellier, France",AgroParisTech; INRAE; Universite de Montpellier,"Maleki, S (corresponding author), Univ Zabol, Dept Nat Resources, Zabol, Iran.",smaleki@uoz.ac.ir,,,University of Zabol [PR-UOZ98-2],University of Zabol,This work was supported by the University of Zabol under project code PR-UOZ98-2.,,61,1,1,3,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0277-5212,1943-6246,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,AUG,2021,41,6,,,,,,,74,10.1007/s13157-021-01471-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-021-01471-0,,,14,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UJ9EA,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000691579800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

First, we examine the impacts that climate change will likely have on cassava itself, and on other important staple food crops for Africa including maize, millets, sorghum, banana, and beans based on projections to 2030. Results indicate that cassava is actually positively impacted in many areas of Africa, with -3.7% to +17.5% changes in climate suitability across the continent. Conversely, for other major food staples, we found that they are all projected to experience negative impacts, with the greatest impacts for beans (-16%+/- 8.8), potato (-14.7 +/- 8.2), banana (-2.5%+/- 4.9), and sorghum (-2.66%+/- 6.45). We then examined the likely challenges that cassava will face from pests and diseases through the use of ecological niche modeling for cassava mosaic disease, whitefly, brown streak disease and cassava mealybug. The findings show that the geographic distribution of these pests and diseases are projected to change, with both new areas opening up and areas where the pests and diseases are likely to leave or reduce in pressure. We finish the paper by looking at the abiotic traits of priority for crop adaptation for a 2030 world, showing that greater drought tolerance could bring some benefits in all areas of Africa, and that cold tolerance in Southern Africa will continue to be a constraint for cassava despite a warmer 2030 world, hence breeding needs to keep a focus on this trait. Importantly, heat tolerance was not found to be a major priority for crop improvement in cassava in the whole of Africa, but only in localized pockets of West Africa and the Sahel. The paper concludes that cassava is potentially highly resilient to future climatic changes and could provide Africa with options for adaptation whilst other major food staples face challenges.","[Jarvis, Andy; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian; Herrera Campo, Beatriz Vanessa; Navarro-Racines, Carlos] CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Jarvis, Andy; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian; Navarro-Racines, Carlos] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Cali, Colombia; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, ICAS, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; University of Leeds,"Jarvis, A (corresponding author), CIAT, Cali, Colombia.",a.jarvis@cgiar.org,"Campo, Beatriz Vanessa Herrera/AAF-4053-2019; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/AAY-8073-2020; Jarvis, Andy/K-5516-2013","Campo, Beatriz Vanessa Herrera/0000-0003-4847-8997; Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/0000-0002-8044-583X; Navarro-Racines, Carlos Eduardo/0000-0002-8692-6431; Jarvis, Andy/0000-0001-6543-0798","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR)","Authors would like to thank the crop experts (i.e. breeders, physiologists) Hernan Ceballos (cassava, CIAT), Steve Beebe (bean, CIAT), Idupulapati M.

Climate change has profound implications (economic, environmental, and social) predominantly on rainfed regions in developing countries like India, where agriculture constitutes the backbone of the economy. In this context, the current study analyzes how farmers perceive climate change in the rainfed ecosystem in India, farmers' adaptation strategies, and their major determinants in addressing climate change. Data were collected from 400 sample farmers in South India. Discriminant and multinomial logit models were employed to identify the adaptation strategies of the farmers. It was evident that the factors such as off-farm income, farm income, and farming experience significantly influenced the adaptation strategies for tackling climate change. Furthermore, access to climate change information and literacy level are vital determinants in different climate change adaptation strategies, including crop diversification, integrated farming system, contingency plans for farm operations, and adoption of soil and water conservation techniques. However, the study highlights the increasing role of institutions (government and private) in future to safeguard the interests of farmers by offering a wide range of policy, research, and technology interventions. In a nutshell, R&D focus on climate-resilient agriculture, application of ICTs in agro-advisory services, and creation off-farm employment opportunities for the farmers is crucial to sustaining their livelihoods as these serve as potential mitigation strategies to impart resilience to climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture in rainfed ecosystems in India or any other countries.","[Kumar, K.

The cell-based model is developed by considering direct runoff based on the Soil Conservation Service - Curve Number (SCS-CN) method and surplus runoff based on the Thornthwaite water balance theory. After calibration and validation, the model is used to predict LVR discharge under future climate and land-cover changes. The hydrologic simulation results reveal climate change as the dominant factor and land-cover change as a secondary factor in regulating future river discharge. The combined effects of climate and land-cover changes will slightly increase river discharge in summer but substantially decrease discharge in winter.

This article examines the turn from a discourse of climate refugees', in which organisations perceive migration as a failure of both mitigation and adaptation to climate change, to one of climate migration', in which organisations promote migration as a strategy of adaptation. Its focus is the promotion of climate migration management, and it explores the trend of these discourses through two sections. First, it provides an empirical account of the two discourses, emphasising the differentiation between them. It then focuses on the discourse of climate migration, its origins, extent and content, and the associated practices of migration management'. The second part argues that the turn to the promotion of climate migration' should be understood as a way to manage the insecurity created by climate change. However, international organisations enacts this management within the forms of neoliberal capitalism, including the framework of governance. Therefore, the promotion of climate migration' as a strategy of adaptation to climate change is located within the tendencies of neoliberalism and the reconfiguration of southern states' sovereignty through governance.","Univ Lausanne, Quartier UNIL Dorigny, Inst Etud Polit & Int, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Felli, R (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Quartier UNIL Dorigny, Inst Etud Polit & Int, Batiment Anthropole, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",romain.felli@unil.ch,,,,,,,101,50,50,5,79,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In Nunavut, one of Canada's Arctic territories, increased weather variability and changes in physical and climatic conditions are having profound effects on residents. One problem is that while these changes have magnified risks associated with travel and land-based activities, individuals lack sufficiently reliable and useful information on which to base decisions. In this paper, we argue that weather-related risk assessment can be improved by integrating local and scientific weather knowledge and making this information accessible to residents through the creation of weather hazards impact advisory groups. We present a qualitative case study of Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, using data from participant observation and semi-structured interviews conducted with indigenous and non-indigenous long-term residents in summer 2009. We examine how long-term residents of Iqaluit acquire, perceive, and use both local and scientific weather knowledge. We find that various barriers, such as a lack of land-based experience, cultural and linguistic differences, and an absence of social networks, prevent most people from obtaining all the information required to make fully informed decisions about the risks associated with land-based activities at different locations. Experienced hunters are perceived to be a reliable source of weather-related information, while scientific weather knowledge is not as accessible or informative as it could be. Increasing the potential use of traditional and scientific hazardous weather knowledge, by making both more universally accessible, can enhance strategies for adapting to climate change in the Arctic.","[Pennesi, Karen] Univ Western Ontario, Social Sci Ctr, Dept Anthropol, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Arokium, Jadah; McBean, Gordon] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [McBean, Gordon] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Polit Sci, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pennesi, K (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Social Sci Ctr, Dept Anthropol, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",pennesi@uwo.ca,,,ArcticNet Network of Centres of Excellence; Storm Studies in the Arctic (STAR) Network through the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences; Northern Scientific Training Program; Department of Indian and Northern Affairs; University of Western Ontario,ArcticNet Network of Centres of Excellence; Storm Studies in the Arctic (STAR) Network through the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences; Northern Scientific Training Program; Department of Indian and Northern Affairs; University of Western Ontario,"Financial support for this research was provided by ArcticNet Network of Centres of Excellence, Storm Studies in the Arctic (STAR) Network through the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences, The Northern Scientific Training Program, the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, and the University of Western Ontario.

This article focuses on the adaptation levers devised by 170 local stakeholders (state services, elected officials, agriculture, forest and river technicians, farmers, inhabitants) in the French Drome Valley. Data was collected through a visioning process combining interviews and workshops designed around three collectively identified structuring issues: quality of life, agricultural production and tourist attractiveness. We characterized the 300 proposed actions according to: (1) stage of implementation, (2) the degree of socio-ecological transformation they imply, (3) the type of strategy for co-production of associated Nature's Contributions to Adaptation through: ecosystem management, mobilization, social appreciation, and associated social dynamics (socio-economic demand, governance, knowledge systems), (4) proponents' roles in governance of the socio-ecological system, (5) the repertoire of values to which they participate as part of collective visions for a desirable future. We identified three typical visions and associated normative goals: sustainable development, ecological and social transition, and ecosystem wealth and self-sufficiency. Each vision was characterized by the set of actions proposed by stakeholders as a pathway to the vision. We compare these three typical pathways with actions already implemented (the current trajectory), and with actions proposed according to the social roles of participants to discuss the cross-cutting nature of desired actions, and convergences or divergences across stakeholders according to their involvement and capacity to influence ecosystem management.","[Bergeret, Agnes; Lavorel, Sandra] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, CNRS, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Grenoble, France; [Lavorel, Sandra] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand",UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Bergeret, A (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, CNRS, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Grenoble, France.",Agnes.bergeret@free.fr; sandra.lavorel@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,,,French Ministry for Environment (MTES); ANR Investissements d'Avenir CDP Trajectories [ANR-15-IDEX-02],French Ministry for Environment (MTES); ANR Investissements d'Avenir CDP Trajectories(French National Research Agency (ANR)),This research was funded through the French Ministry for Environment (MTES) through the Biovallee contract.

While it is possible to identify an emerging strand of critical enquiry concerning the role of cities in facilitating climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, this paper argues that the full implications of critical urban theory to climate change studies have yet to be realised. In this paper, critical urban theory is understood as an approach ( or set of approaches) to the city that recognises the contingent form of urban politics and policy, while asserting that, far from being an inevitable and politically neutral process, urbanisation is an expression of intersecting regimes of social power. This paper utilises critical urban theory as a basis for analysing emerging urban climate adaptation strategies. The analysis presented here asserts that contemporary adaptation policies are being framed by neoliberal practices of market-oriented governance, enhanced privatisation and urban environmental entrepreneurialism. This paper exposes some of the key contradictions that are inherent within neoliberalised urban climate change adaptation strategies and suggests how it might be possible to develop more progressive adaptation regimes.","Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Dyfed, Wales",Aberystwyth University,"Whitehead, M (corresponding author), Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Geog & Earth Sci, Llandinam Bldg,Penglais Campus, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Dyfed, Wales.",msw@aber.ac.uk,,"Whitehead, Mark/0000-0001-6499-4719",,,,,69,55,56,1,67,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,MAY,2013,50,7,,,SI,,1348,1367,,10.1177/0042098013480965,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0042098013480965,,,20,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,146XX,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000319130400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This short communication presents the context in which adaptation to protect human health has been addressed to date and argues for a holistic, transdisciplinary, multisectoral and systems approach going forward. Such a novel health-climate approach requires broad thinking regarding geographies, ecologies and socio-economic policies, and demands that one prioritises services for vulnerable populations at higher risk. Actions to engage more sectors and systems in comprehensive health-climate governance are identified. Much like the World Health Organization's 'Health in All Policies' approach, one should think health governance and climate change together in a transnational framework as a matter not only of health promotion and disease prevention, but of population security. In an African context, there is a need for continued cross-border efforts, through partnerships, blending climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, and long-term international financing, to contribute towards meeting sustainable development imperatives.","[Wright, Caradee Yael] South African Med Res Council, Environm & Hlth Res Unit, 1 Soutpansberg Rd, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Wright, Caradee Yael] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Moore, Candice Eleanor] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Social Sci, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa; [Chersich, Matthew] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Reprod Hlth & HIV Inst, Klein St, ZA-2001 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Hester, Rebecca] Virginia Tech, Dept Sci Technol & Soc, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA; [Nayna Schwerdtle, Patricia] Monash Univ, Nursing & Midwifery, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Nayna Schwerdtle, Patricia] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg Inst Global Hlth, Neuenheimer Feld 672, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Mbayo, Guy Kakumbi; Akong, Charles Ndika] World Hlth Org, African Reg Off, POB 06, Brazzaville, Rep Congo; [Butler, Colin D.] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia",South African Medical Research Council; University of Pretoria; University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Witwatersrand; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Monash University; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; World Health Organization; Australian National University,"Wright, CY (corresponding author), South African Med Res Council, Environm & Hlth Res Unit, 1 Soutpansberg Rd, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.;Wright, CY (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",cwright@mrc.ac.za; moorec@ukzn.ac.za; MChersich@wrhi.ac.za; rjhester@vt.edu; patricia.schwerdtle@monash.edu; mbayog@who.int; cakong@who.int; bodhiaus@gmail.com,,"chersich, matthew/0000-0002-4320-9168; Moore, Candice/0000-0002-0051-8155; Butler, Colin/0000-0002-2942-5294; Nayna Schwerdtle, Patricia/0000-0002-3045-3145; Wright, Caradee/0000-0001-9608-818X",South African Medical Research Council; National Research Foundation of South Africa,South African Medical Research Council(South African Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),C.Y.W. receives research funding from the South African Medical Research Council and the National Research Foundation of South Africa.,,45,2,2,6,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Both fields address matters related to socioeconomic vulnerabilities and thus present opportunities for integration. However, many studies have stated the lack of interaction within the study areas. When dealing with CCA and SP in Brazil, the two offer an opportunity for integration since some SP programmes (such as food-based safety nets) can both affect adaptation and be impacted by expected changes in climate. Impacts from CC are projected to be extreme in the Brazilian semi-arid Northeast, a region where social programmes of assistance and aid are historically crucial during periods of drought. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to address the interaction of CCA and SP in a conceptual level on policies and programmes in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach - A desk review of government documents (policies, plans, decrees) related to food security, food-based programmes and CC. Findings - Based on the results the authors highlight the limited integration between CC and SP in Brazil and the potential for interaction in many of the programmes already in place. Originality/value - The authors attribute findings to the segmented governmental structure and the weak interaction between sectors, and the only recent discussion of linkages between CC and poverty, development and food insecurity. Discussion on the challenges and benefits of this interaction are provided in a context of CC in Brazil, still not very debated in the academic literature.","[Mesquita, Patricia S.; Bursztyn, Marcel] Univ Brasilia, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Mesquita, PS (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",patriciasmesquita@gmail.com,"Bursztyn, Marcel/F-9921-2012",,Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB); Rede CLIMA; CNPq scholarship; CAPES scholarship; Science Without Borders scholarship,Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB); Rede CLIMA; CNPq scholarship(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES scholarship(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Science Without Borders scholarship,"Research supported by Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB), Rede CLIMA, and CNPq, CAPES, and Science Without Borders scholarships.

In this paper, we explore the VBA of stakeholders involved in three water management projects focusing on dams, micro -reservoirs, or wetlands in a Peruvian watershed facing droughts. We apply a framework with the core ideas of the hydrosocial cycle, the decision context perspective, and the VBA hierarchy to show how stakeholders' per-spectives and power influence practices on the ground. The analysis of VBA reveals three different perspectives on water management held by different stakeholder groups. First, a community-based perspective, frequent among local communities, favors micro-reservoirs managed by communities. Second, an infrastructure-based perspective, frequent among public sector stakeholders, shows a preference for dams managed by the private sector. Third, a nature-based perspective, with a preference for wetlands managed by the public sector, is found across stakeholder groups. In the three water management projects, different power distributions determine which VBA dominate and influence practices on the ground. Dams on the ground represent power from the public and private sectors, while micro-reservoirs represent local grassroot control. In the wetland project, the outcomes of the evolving hydrosocial cycle are still unclear and will depend on how multiple perspectives are considered. Examining and questioning the decision context in which adaptation occurs can help excluded stakeholders achieve more power and agency and tackle the fundamental question of 'adaptation of what and for whom'.","[Locatelli, Bruno] Univ Montpellier, Forests & Soc, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Locatelli, Bruno; Laurenceau, Martin; Pramova, Emilia] CIFOR, Lima, Peru; [Laurenceau, Martin] AgroParisTech, Paris, France; [Laurenceau, Martin] Inst Res Dev, Water Resource Management Actors & Uses G EAU, Marseille, France; [Chumpisuca, Yaneth Roxana Calla] Univ Nacl Micaela Bastidas Apurimac, UNAMBA, Abancay, Peru; [Vallet, Ameline] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, AgroParisTech, CNRS,Ecol Systemat Evolut, Orsay, France; [Vallet, Ameline] Univ Paris Saclay, Ecole Ponts ParisTech, AgroParisTech, CNRS,Cirad EHESS,CIRED, Nogent-sur-marne, Marne, France; [Conde, Yesica Quispe; Zavala, Ronal Cervantes] Univ Nacl Agr Molina, Lima, Peru; [Conde, Yesica Quispe; Zavala, Ronal Cervantes] SUNASS, Abancay, Peru; [Djoudi, Houria] CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia; [Lavorel, Sandra] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine, Grenoble, France; [Colloff, Matthew J.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, Australia",CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); AgroParisTech; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universidad Nacional Micaela Bastidas De Apurimac; AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; University Nacional Agraria La Molina; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Australian National University,"Locatelli, B (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Forests & Soc, CIRAD, Montpellier, France.",bruno.locatelli@cirad.fr,"Locatelli, Bruno/C-9957-2009","Locatelli, Bruno/0000-0003-2983-1644; Vallet, Ameline/0000-0002-2731-0098","German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) [15_III_075]; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation [QZA-016/0110]; French Funding Agency for research [17-CE32-0012]; European Union's H2020 research and innovation program (SINCERE Project); CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP FTA); CGIAR Fund; French Ministry for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition","German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB); Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation; French Funding Agency for research; European Union's H2020 research and innovation program (SINCERE Project); CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP FTA)(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund(CGIAR); French Ministry for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition","This paper is a contribution from the Transformative Adaptation Research Alliance (TARA, https//research.csiro.au/tara/) , an international network of researchers and practitioners dedicated to the development and implementation of novel approaches to transformative adaptation to global change.

The influence of this framing is especially clear in the popularity of key metaphors such as 'stress,' 'barriers,' 'vulnerability,' and 'resilience.' There are obvious advantages to this way of proceeding, not least the possibility of using the systems concept as an overarching framework to integrate the multidisciplinary teams of researchers commonly employed in large-scale assessments of climate change impacts. Nonetheless, this underlying conception of linked natural and social systems presents significant challenges when it comes to moving the ideas found in these strategic documents forward into the world of policy and practice. As the case studies of North American, Australian, and European studies presented here show, the strategic documents themselves are very short on policy analysis, fail to incorporate the impact of institutions and policy legacies into their analyses, and, as a result, favor unfounded or infeasible management prescriptions. As a consequence, adaptation policy itself remains poorly developed in most jurisdictions.","[Wellstead, Adam] Michigan Technol Univ, Social Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Howlett, Michael] Simon Fraser Univ, Polit Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Howlett, Michael] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore; [Rayner, Jeremy] Univ Saskatchewan, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",Michigan Technological University; Simon Fraser University; National University of Singapore; University of Saskatchewan,"Howlett, M (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Polit Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada.;Howlett, M (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore.",howlett@sfu.ca,"Howlett, Michael/W-7544-2019","Howlett, Michael/0000-0003-4689-740X",,,,,83,12,12,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1946-0171,1946-018X,,CRIT POLICY STUD,Crit.

We investigate how the framings of adaptation as a policy problem can relate to tractability issues in implementation. We distinguish three framings of adaptation: climate change adaptation (CCA), climate variability adaptation (CVA), and vulnerability-centered adaptation (VCA) that imply conflicting interpretations of the collective problem to be solved and the goals to be attained through policy solutions. Through the methodology of comparative case studies, we conduct an empirical analysis of three implementation processes in India and Switzerland, and examine how adaptation framings translate into formal policy design and concrete policy realizations. We find that, regardless of the adaptive capacity of the country where implementation takes place, the CCA framing meets more tractability issues than the VCA framing. Therefore, we discuss the paradox that the innovative and additional CCA types of policies, advocated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), are more likely to face a deficit in implementation according to our analysis.","[Dupuis, Johann; Knoepfel, Peter] Univ Lausanne, Swiss Grad Sch Publ Adm IDHEAP, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Dupuis, J (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Swiss Grad Sch Publ Adm IDHEAP, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",,"Dupuis, Johann/P-6326-2014","Dupuis, Johann/0000-0001-5098-7956",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),"This research was realized thanks to the support of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).

Potential natural vegetation (PNV) emphasizing the dominant role of climate can provide a useful baseline to guide the potential land use adjustment. This work is particularly important for the revegetated regions with intensive human perturbation. However, it has received little attention. This study chose China's Loess Plateau, a typical revegetated region, as an example study area to generate the PNV patterns with high spatial resolution over 2071-2100 with a process-based dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS), and further investigated the potential land use adjustment through comparing the simulated and observed land use patterns. Compared with 1981-2010, the projected PNV over 2071-2100 would have less forest and more steppe because of drier climate. Subsequently, 25.3-55.0% of the observed forests and 79.3-91.9% of the observed grasslands in 2010 can be kept over 2071-2100, and the rest of the existing forested area and grassland were expected to be more suitable for steppes and forests, respectively. To meet the request of China's Grain for Green Project, 60.9-84.8% of the existing steep farmland could be converted to grassland and the other for forest. Our results highlight the importance in adjusting the existing vegetation pattern to adapt to climate change. The research approach is extendable and provides a framework to evaluate the sustainability of the existing land use pattern under future climate. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The responses of farm households to climate change play a very essential role in addressing the risk of climate change. This study investigated factors influencing adaptation strategies to climate change in the Black Volta Basin of Ghana. Survey questions were administered to 450 households sampled from eight districts using a multistage sampling technique. Out of the six adaptation strategies, four major identified adaptation strategies were subsequently used as the dependent variable in the multivariate (MV) probit and binary logit models. The results revealed that factors such as gender, age, household size, farmer-based-organizations membership, farm income, years of education, districts of location of respondents, farm size and climate change awareness-statistically and significantly-influenced households' adaptation to the changing climate. However, the positive correlation matrix from the MV probit model showed complementarities among all the adaptation strategies adopted by household heads. Priority should be given to improving household heads' adaptive capacity. Also, governmental and non-governmental organizations should invest in climate-resilient programmes. Finally, programmes aimed at sensitizing household heads on climate change adaptation strategies such as changing planting time, changing farming methods, and planting early maturing and drought-resistant varieties through pieces of trainings and workshops may be duly supported by the Government; particularly, for household heads in the Black Volta Basin.","[Damnyag, Lawrence] Forestry Res Inst Ghana, CSIR, Kumasi, Ghana; [Mwinkom, Francis X.

Here we examine the connections between climate mitigation and climate adaptation, specifically, between low-carbon energy systems and extreme events. The article specifically addresses the question, how do responses to extreme climate risks enhance or limit capacity to promote city-level greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation? As a step toward answering this question, we present a framework for considering windows of opportunity that may arise as a result of extreme events and how these windows can be exploited to foster development and implementation of low-carbon energy strategies. Four brief case studies are used to provide empirical background and determine the impact of potential windows of opportunity. Some general conclusions are defined. In particular, the existing energy system structure is an important determinant of impact and potential for energy transitions. Well-developed and articulated governance strategies and ready access of effective and economically efficient alternative energy technology were key to transitions. However, prospects for inequity in development and implementation of low-carbon solutions need to be considered. Finally, exploiting windows of opportunity afforded by extreme events for developing low-carbon economy and infrastructure also can provide resilience against those very events. These types of responses will be needed as extreme events increase in frequency and magnitude in the future, with cities as primary sites of impact and action.

Data were analyzed using the following: descriptive statistics and the stochastic frontier production function. The findings showed that majority of the respondents (59.1 %) still believed that climate change is a natural phenomenon that is beyond man's power to abate while industrial release, improper sewage disposal, fossil fuel use, deforestation and bush burning were perceived as the most human factors that influence climate change by the category that chose human activities (40.9 %) as the main causes of climate change. The main employed adaptation strategies by the farmers were mixed cropping, planting early matured crop, planting of resistant crops and use of agrochemicals. The arable crop farmers were relatively technically efficient with about 53 % of them having technical efficiency above the average of 0.784 for the study area. The study observed that education, adaptation, perception, climate information and farming experience were statistically significant in decreasing inefficiency of arable crop production.

This index can be used ex ante to analyse and compare climate adaptation strategies and plans in different societal contexts as well as at different levels of governance, and we illustrate this by analysing four national and four city-level strategies.

The property development 'industry' consists of diverse private actors with considerable financial, political or technical resources. However, there is no empirical research to date on the potential contribution of these actors, and particularly property developers, to climate adaptation, in terms of their preferences, capabilities and perceptions. This article reports on findings from a survey of, and discussions with, Australian property developers, their representative industry bodies, and technical and advisory service providers to developers. Amongst other themes, we focus here on: participation and capacity; effectiveness of current polices; risks and opportunities; and cost-sharing considerations as perceived by these groups. Results indicate that developers and their interest groups are seeking greater levels of participation and joint decision-making in public-adaptation policy and its implementation. The results also suggest that while developers and their service providers recognise a shift towards greater levels of responsibility and cost sharing for adaptation, perceptions of operational ambiguities and financial risks hinder progress in this area. Given this, the authors point to the need to further examine the potential of new deliberative arenas that can balance and complement existing regulatory controls in the governance of urban adaptation.","[Taylor, Bruce M.; Harman, Ben P.; Heyenga, Sonja; McAllister, Ryan R.

Although the development of adaptation policies is crucial, the first step to this task should be to assess ongoing policies. The present study evaluates four macro-level documents that have the strongest effects on water and agricultural policies in Iran from the perspective of adaptation to climate change. Two frameworks have been applied to evaluate the integrity and maladaptation aspects of the documents. It was found that the themes most often considered in the documents were 'improving resiliency and adaptive capacity' and responding to changes in water availability. The least-considered themes were 'responding to increased irrigation requirements' and 'responding to changes in agricultural land use.' In general, the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan shows acceptable accordance with the evaluated criteria. However, potential concerns exist about maladaptation because of policies such as self-sufficiency for strategic crops and excessive reliance on improving irrigation efficiency to reduce agricultural water consumption. The methodology used in this study can be recommended for similar studies elsewhere.

With a total population of over 300 million people situated on coasts, including 20 of the planet's 33 megacities (over 10 million people), low-lying coastal areas represent one of the most vulnerable areas to the impacts of climate change. Many of the largest cities along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. are already experiencing frequent high tide flooding, and these events will increase in frequency, depth, duration and extent as sea levels continue to rise at an accelerating rate throughout the 21st century and beyond. Cities in southeast Asia and islands in the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean are also suffering the effects of extreme weather events combined with other factors that increase coastal risk. While short-term extreme events such as hurricanes, El Ninos and severe storms come and go and will be more damaging in the short term, sea-level rise is a long-term permanent change of state. However, the effects of sea-level rise are compounded with other hazards, such as increased wave action or a loss of ecosystems. As sea-level rise could lead to the displacement of hundreds of millions of people, this may be one of the greatest challenges that human civilization has ever faced, with associated inundation of major cities, loss of coastal infrastructure, increased saltwater intrusion and damage to coastal aquifers among many other global impacts, as well as geopolitical and legal implications. While there are several short-term responses or adaptation options, we need to begin to think longer term for both public infrastructure and private development. This article provides an overview of the status on adaptation to climate change in coastal zones.","[Griggs, Gary] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Reguero, Borja G.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Griggs, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",griggs@ucsc.edu; breguero@ucsc.edu,"Reguero, Borja/L-8621-2014","Reguero, Borja/0000-0001-5526-7157","Early-Career Research Fellowship from the Gulf Research Program of the National Academies of Sciences; National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","Early-Career Research Fellowship from the Gulf Research Program of the National Academies of Sciences; National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","This research received no external funding.

In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, the city is implementing a variety of green infrastructure practices through the program Green Cities, Clean Waters to meet state and federal stormwater regulations. Though not a current goal of the program, when implemented effectively, a cobenefit of green infrastructure is increased local resilience to potential ecosystem alterations, such as increasing summer temperatures and heavier precipitation, also defined as climate change adaptation. We analyzed the potential of the Green City, Clean Waters plan to increase the city's resilience to the future consequences of climate change. Three future landcover models of Philadelphia were used to analyze climate change adaptation through green infrastructure in the near term, midcentury, and end of century under two climate change scenarios. Green infrastructure was overall found to locally decrease runoff throughout Philadelphia over time. Green infrastructure impact on surface temperature showed mixed results. Impact on runoff and surface temperature differed between types of green infrastructure. As the city is forecasted to grow warmer, wetter, and more urbanized over the century, runoff and local temperatures will increase on average throughout the city, despite the planned growth in green infrastructure. If increased resilience is to keep pace with climate change, the city government will need to expand its green infrastructure plan and consider the cobenefit of climate change adaptation when planning new projects. Additionally, for true climate change resiliency to be achieved, green infrastructure implementation must be connected to citywide greening efforts, accelerate and continue beyond the near term for localities to function as they do today.","[Shade, Charlotte; Kremer, Peleg; Henderson, Keith G.] Villanova Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Rockwell, Julia S.] Philadelphia Water Dept, Climate Change Adaptat Program, Off Watersheds, Philadelphia, PA USA",Villanova University,"Shade, C (corresponding author), Villanova Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",,,,,,,,42,5,5,17,71,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Specifically, perceptions of climate change were assessed and advocacy activities were identified for climate change and/or other topics. Design/methodology/approach Using convenience sampling, students (n= 440) from three universities in the Midwest, the USA, completed surveys assessing their level of agreement with activities related to civic engagement, climate change and policy. Semantic differential scales focused on learning about climate change, advocating for climate change mitigation and advocating for climate change adaptation. Three open-ended questions were used to identify student experiences with civic engagement and/or service-learning, as well as topics in which they advocate and how they advocate. Findings Regarding advocacy in general, over 50% of the sample did not advocate for any topic, with 24.5% of students stating they advocated for the environment/climate change. Students who identified as female, democratic and 1st or 2nd year in school were more likely to be engaged with environmental advocacy. Regarding civic engagement, seniors were more actively engaged with their communities and also more likely to vote in local, state and national elections. Research limitations/implications Time of data collection was a potential limitation with schools conducting data collection at different time periods. Students who identified more progressive politically were also more likely to participate in the study. Originality/value While research exists regarding student civic engagement levels, this research project identified ways in which students engaged in advocacy, identifying potential links with civic engagement and enhanced participation in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.","[Wodika, Alicia B.] Illinois State Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Normal, IL 61761 USA; [Middleton, Wendi K.] Northeastern State Univ, Wadley Coll Sci & Hlth Profess, Dept Hlth Profess, Muskogee, OK USA",Illinois State University,"Wodika, AB (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Normal, IL 61761 USA.",abwodik@ilstu.edu; middletw@nsuok.edu,,,,,,,68,1,1,2,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1467-6370,1758-6739,,INT J SUST HIGHER ED,Int.

First, profound uncertainties are inherent in unique interactions among the many natural and human factors affecting Barrow's vulnerability. Science cannot significantly reduce these uncertainties through extensive approaches, but intensive approaches can reconstruct and update local trends, clarify the underlying dynamics, and harvest experience for policy purposes. Second, sound policies to reduce Barrow's vulnerability to coastal erosion and flooding must incorporate these profound uncertainties and the multiple values of the community. Minimizing vulnerability to climate change is only one of the community's interests, and must compete with other interests for limited time, attention, funds and other resources. Third, the community itself is in the best position to understand its own context, to decide on sound policies, and to take responsibility for those decisions. In short, local context matters in science, policy, and decision-making structures for adaptation to climate change and variability. Overall, cognitive constraints may be the most important human dimension of climate change. Factoring the global problem into more tractable local problems would make the most of our cognitive capacity.","Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; Univ Colorado, Ctr Publ Policy Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Monash University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Lynch, AH (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",Amanda.Lynch@arts.monash.edu.au,"Lynch, Amanda/B-4278-2011","Lynch, Amanda/0000-0003-2990-1016",,,,,52,47,47,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In addition, there has also been a spread of the urbanised area, which has led to an increase in the flood risk in urban areas (due to a greater runoff and the occupation of flood hazard areas) and drought events due to an increase in the water demand. In light of these new scenarios, the Mediterranean cities should design adaptation systems based on rainwater harvesting within the framework of a circular economy. This study analyses the integration of rainwater in flood and water demand management in the city of Alicante (Southern Spain). In recent years, this city has developed infrastructures in order to use these resources. To do this, different databases have been analysed (rainfall and volume of water collected in the green infrastructure systems). The results reveal that stormwater has become highly important in urban water management in Alicante as the city is now using a resource that previously went to waste and created problems (flooding and pollution). By way of conclusion, it is worth mentioning that the incorporation of rainwater for urban use in Alicante has reduced the pressure on traditional resources in satisfying water demand and has also acted as a measure for adapting to climate change.","[Hernandez-Hernandez, Maria; Olcina, Jorge] Univ Alicante, Reg Geog Anal & Phys Geog Dept, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain; [Morote, Alvaro-Francisco] Univ Valencia, Fac Teaching Training, Dept Expt & Social Sci Educ, Valencia 46010, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; University of Valencia,"Morote, AF (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Fac Teaching Training, Dept Expt & Social Sci Educ, Valencia 46010, Spain.",maria.hernandez@ua.es; jorge.olcina@ua.es; alvaro.morote@uv.es,"Hernández, María Hernández/H-2198-2015; Olcina, Jorge/H-2447-2015","Hernández, María Hernández/0000-0002-8823-0083; Olcina, Jorge/0000-0002-4846-8126; Morote, Alvaro/0000-0003-2438-4961","Spanish MINECO [CSO2015-65182-C2-2-P, PGC2018-094491-B-C32]; Catedra del Agua of the University of Alicante; Diputacion Provincial de Alicante",Spanish MINECO(Spanish Government); Catedra del Agua of the University of Alicante; Diputacion Provincial de Alicante,"The results presented in this paper are part of the research's projects Uses and Management of Non-ConventionalWater Resources on the Coast of Valencia and Murcia as an Adaptation Strategy to Drought funded by the Spanish MINECO under grant number CSO2015-65182-C2-2-P and Social representations of school content in the development of teaching competencies funded by the Spanish MINECO under grant number PGC2018-094491-B-C32.

One set of arguments found within the environmental change literature is that socio-ecological systems and people must have general development capacities and climate-adaptive capacities if development under climate change will be successful. This combination is known as adaptive development. The objective of this paper is to study if the emergence of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) influences adaptive development in coastal Cambodia. Our findings are as follows: from a systems perspective, we argue that development capacities are being strengthened with SEZ employment as many employees experience an increased, predictable income, even as climate-specific capacities are weak, beyond the changes to climate exposure that people experience through migration. However, even as industrial and migration systems develop, the lack of climate-specific capacities in the urban system is concerning: water supply, land-use planning, and urban governance take little account of climate change adaptation, which may undermine longer-term development in this region. Within households, however, we see differentiation and agency, including farming households that rely on remittances from migratory SEZ labour during droughts, and local fishing households that diversify their livelihoods via nearby SEZ employment.","[Horlings, Jason; Marschke, Melissa] Univ Ottawa, Sch Int Dev & Global Studies, 120 Univ Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Horlings, J (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Sch Int Dev & Global Studies, 120 Univ Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",Jason.k.horlings@gmail.com,,"Marschke, Melissa/0000-0003-1202-6681",Urban Climate Resilience in Southeast Asia (UCRSEA) project - Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [895-2013-3004]; Urban Climate Resilience in Southeast Asia (UCRSEA) project - International Development Research Center (IDRC) [107776],Urban Climate Resilience in Southeast Asia (UCRSEA) project - Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Urban Climate Resilience in Southeast Asia (UCRSEA) project - International Development Research Center (IDRC),"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Urban Climate Resilience in Southeast Asia (UCRSEA) project, jointly funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the International Development Research Center (IDRC) [Award reference number: 895-2013-3004 (SSHRC); Project no. 107776 (IDRC)].",,61,8,8,1,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

It is based on a summary of conclusions from available studies of how climate change may affect various sectors of the economies in different countries. We apply a macroeconomic general equilibrium model, which integrates impacts of climate change on different activities of the economies. Agents adapt by responding to the changes in market conditions following the climatic changes, thus bringing consistency between economic behaviour and adaptation to climate change. Europe is divided into 85 sub-regions in order to capture climate variability and variations in vulnerabilities within countries. We find that the impacts in the +2 degrees C are moderate throughout Europe, with positive impacts on GDP in some sub-regions and negative impacts down to 0.1 per cent per year in others. At +4 degrees C, GDP is negatively affected throughout Europe, and most substantially in the southern parts, where it falls by up to 0.7 per cent per year in some sub-regions. We also find that climate change causes differentiations in wages across Europe, which may cause migration from southern parts of Europe to northern parts, especially to the Nordic countries.

Based on extensive field research, we find the four processes at work simultaneously in our case studies of five LDCF projects being implemented in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, the Maldives and Vanuatu. The article concludes with a discussion of the broader implications of the political economy of adaptation for analysts, program managers and climate researchers at large.

So far, most research has concentrated on the identification and quantification of these risks as well as the development of adaptation measures. Yet much less is known about how planners actually perceive and deal with climate change, and why. This paper focuses on the governance of two climate change-related risks in urban areas in the Netherlands, namely heat stress and flooding from rainfall and rivers. Heat stress hardly seems to be perceived as an urgent problem, mainly because there is no clear 'problem owner'. Because municipalities are responsible for rain and sewage water management and partly for river flooding, increased flood risk is more often recognised as a (potential) problem. Despite the rather low sense of urgency regarding these two climate change-induced risks, urban planners are, or envisage, investing in more open water and public green areas. Heat stress and flood risks from rainfall are not the reasons per se, but primarily act as additional arguments to legitimise these measures, which should contribute to sustainable urban development in general. Our analysis suggests a gap between the perceived urgency of proactive adaptation to climate change by scientists and the perceptions of planners. Climate science research could enhance its contribution to urban planning by providing conceivable projections of climate change impacts as well as by developing adaptation measures that serve multiple purposes and strategies to successfully implement these.","[Runhaar, Hens; Mees, Heleen; Wardekker, Arjan; van der Sluijs, Jeroen; Driessen, Peter P.

While social-ecological systems evolve to accommodate variability, there is growing evidence that changes in drought, storm and flood extremes are increasing exposure of currently vulnerable populations. In many countries in Africa, these pressures are compounded by disruption to institutions and variability in livelihoods and income. The interactions of both rapid and slow onset livelihood disturbance contribute to enduring poverty and slow processes of rural livelihood renewal across a complex landscape. We explore cross-scale dynamics in coping and adaptation response, drawing on qualitative data from a case study in Mozambique. The research characterises the engagements across multiple institutional scales and the types of agents involved, providing insight into emergent conditions for adaptation to climate change in rural economies, The analysis explores local responses to climate shocks, food security and poverty reduction, through informal institutions, forms of livelihood diversification and collective land-use systems that allow reciprocity, flexibility and the ability to buffer shocks. However, the analysis shows that agricultural initiatives have helped to facilitate effective livelihood renewal, through the reorganisation of social institutions and opportunities for communication, innovation and micro-credit. Although there are challenges to mainstreaming adaptation at different scales, this research shows why it is critical to assess how policies can protect conditions for emergence of livelihood transformation.

Two focus groups were used: one with senior officials from the regional governorates and the other with central government administrators from the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation. The study findings suggested that 51.9% of the investigated farmers at the two targeted governorates had no knowledge about the climate change phenomenon. Maximizing the use of manure, changing crop patterns, and crop rotation were the adaptation measures most commonly adopted by aware respondents against climate change. Results of a probit model analysis indicated that farmers' ability to adapt to climate change was influenced by education level, farm size, diversity of production, and membership of a Water User Association.

In the near future, development of new agricultural measures and proper diffusion of technologies will greatly influence the ability of farmers in adaptation and mitigation to climate change. Using bibliometric approaches through output of academic journal publications and patent-based data, we assess the impact of research and development (R&D) for new and existing technologies within the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation. We show that many developing countries invest limited resources for R&D in relevant technologies that have great potential for mitigation and adaption in agricultural production. We also discuss constraints including weak infrastructure, limited research capacity, lack of credit facilities and technology transfer that may hinder the application of innovation in tackling the challenges of climate change. A range of policy measures is also suggested to overcome identified constraints and to ensure that potentials of innovation for climate change mitigation and adaptation are realized.

In this study, we examine first-time seasonal migration out of a village in North-Western Burkina Faso to neighbouring countries, triggered by more irregular rainfall patterns. Through a set of 52 qualitative interviews, we analyse the perceptions of migrants themselves as well as the sending community regarding migration consequences. Men migrated in the off-season, whereas women stayed behind. Most migrant men and wives of migrants perceive migration to have negative consequences for their socio-economic situation and their health. Despite this, a lack of options and deteriorating environmental conditions might force the men to move again. We interpreted the range of narratives provided by women and men against the background of the scientific literature on migration as climate change adaptation.

Findings indicate that long-term education and short-term training have complementary roles in influencing design and implementation of successful adaptation practices. Short-term training workshops are most useful when customized to particular needs of participants, are participatory in design and implementation and tailored using context-specific examples. Action planning, on-the-job training and continued mentorship after training are also effective, but are rarely used. Challenges that impede effective capacity building relate not only to training design and structure, but also the inadequacy of training needs assessments and the organizational structure in which trainees attempt to put their skills and knowledge into practice. More rigorous coordination and monitoring of training efforts-and appropriate institutional support for action following training sessions are essential to enhance adaptation planning across sub-Saharan Africa.","[Mataya, Diana Chanika] Kulima Integrated Dev Solut, POB 30384, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Vincent, Katharine] Kulima Integrated Dev Solut, Kwa Zulu, South Africa; [Dougill, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Mataya, DC (corresponding author), Kulima Integrated Dev Solut, POB 30384, Lilongwe, Malawi.",diana.mataya@gmail.com,"Vincent, Katharine/L-5669-2019","Vincent, Katharine/0000-0003-3152-1522; Dougill, Andrew/0000-0002-3422-8228; Chanika Mataya, Diana/0000-0002-1408-3455","UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/M020010/1, NE/M020177/1]; UK Government's Department for International Development; Coordination, Capacity Development and Knowledge Exchange Unit (CCKE) of the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme [NE/M020207/1]; NERC [NE/M020010/1, NE/M020177/1] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); UK Government's Department for International Development; Coordination, Capacity Development and Knowledge Exchange Unit (CCKE) of the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This work was carried out under the Future Climate for Africa UMFULA project, with financial support from the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [grant numbers NE/M020010/1 (Kulima) and NE/M020177/1 (Leeds)], and the UK Government's Department for International Development.

Results are used to reflect on the international support to CCA for developing countries. The study is based on field researches led among farmers' households in Southern Benin, on interviews conducted among governmental and non-governmental institutions, and on analysis of relevant literature. Constraints and opportunities to the development of adaptation practices, and their relation to institutional support (or lack of support) are examined. In addition, the impact of farmers' perceptions of institutions is studied. Results highlight that State institutions are currently unable to support adaptive capacities. On the contrary, non-governmental organizations have promoted agricultural adaptive strategies to cope with changing climate patterns. Findings, furthermore, highlight a lack of trust in state institutions among farmers, while traditional chiefs and local organizations are trusted, even when their capacities to provide support are limited.

In this paper, a case study on flood protection of the Kokemaki river running through the city of Pori in West Finland was conducted. The study was realised as a MCDA workshop involving the key stakeholders of the region. The analysis produced a robust ranking of the considered flood protection alternatives. According to the stakeholders, the approach was useful as an exploratory way of gaining a deeper and shared understanding of the flood protection.

We find that disaster-hit cities adopt more solar farms and rooftop solar than cities unaffected by crisis and that the social capital of these disaster-hit communities shapes their adoption patterns.

Drawing from research across three districts in northern Ghana, this study employs a mixed-methods approach and an interpretivist framework to develop understanding of how farmers are implementing Indigenous adaptation strategies in response to climate change risks at both household and community scales. Farmers are perceiving multiple climate risks such as increased temperatures, erratic rainfall and prolonged droughts, which are disrupting cropping calendars and decreasing productivity. In response to those impacts, farming households are utilising Indigenous knowledge to individually implement diverse strategies such as rainwater harvesting, relocation of farms to water sources, neem leaf extract and organic manure applications, while communities are collectively engaging in congregational prayers, rituals for rainmaking, taboos, investment in local irrigation systems and tree planting. Farmers' adaptation strategies are evolving over time, as many people are integrating Indigenous practices with modern knowledge and technologies to facilitate improvements in irrigation, organic manure application, planting drought-resistant crops, agroforestry and crop diversification. Decision-makers in local, regional and national government institutions could work to design multi-scalar adaptation interventions that support the integration of Indigenous and modern knowledge to address the complexity of climate change risks across different scales to promote sustainable livelihoods.","[Guodaar, Lawrence; Bardsley, Douglas K.; Suh, Jungho] Univ Adelaide, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Sch Social Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Guodaar, L (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Sch Social Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",lawrence.guodaar@adelaide.edu.au,,"Guodaar, Lawrence/0000-0003-3227-6709","Department of Geography, Environment and Population, University of Adelaide, Australia; Directors and Extension Officers of the District Directorate of Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA)","Department of Geography, Environment and Population, University of Adelaide, Australia; Directors and Extension Officers of the District Directorate of Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA)","This research is part of a larger Ph.D. project on climate change, indigenous knowledge and food security in northern Ghana with financial support from the Department of Geography, Environment and Population, University of Adelaide, Australia.

Due to the different vulnerability and adaptive capacity of various regions, the impacts and problems should also be handled in a differentiated way. The key areas of climate safe planning are: water safety, food security, human health security, safety of infrastructure, energy security, natural environment. Successful adaptation to climate change is inconceivable without having a sound knowledge of the impacts of climate change. The National Adaptation Geo-information System (NAGiS) may be used by national, regional, and local decision makers and stakeholders. It provides information on the climate status of the country, on the impacts of strategic risks connected to climate change and other long-term natural resource management issues, and on the correspondent adaptation possibilities, based on indicators, analyses, and impact studies. Data layers of NAGiS were elaborated by the Geological and Geophysical Institute of Hungary and partner projects funded by the Adaptation to Climate Change programme of the EEA Grants. The main parts of the NAGiS are a map-visualization system with 650 data layers; a database containing the calculation results based on modeling (GeoDat with 910 data layers); and a meta-database to help finding relevant data. NAGiS can be a useful tool for climate safe planning, analyzing, decision-support activities in governmental strategic planning; or for municipalities in spatial planning, settlement planning, organizing public services. It can be used in climate policy, energy policy planning, transport, and energy infrastructure design and numerous other fields. The further development of NAGiS is financed by the Environmental and Energy Efficiency Operative Programme.

The Swedish forest governance system has undergone extensive deregulation, with the result that social norms and knowledge dissemination are seen by the state as important means of influencing forest owners' understandings and practices. Drawing on Foucault's concept of governmentality this study contributes knowledge on how forest owners understand and manage climate-related risk and their acceptance of advice. From the interview study, three main conclusions can be drawn: (1) forest owners' considerations largely concern ordinary forestry activities; (2) knowledge about forest management and climate adaptation combines experiences and ideas from various sources; and (3) risk awareness and knowledge of best practices are not enough to ensure change in forestry practices. The results of this study show that the forest owners have to be selective and negotiate about what knowledge to consider relevant and meaningful for their own forest practice. Accordingly, local forest management can be understood as situated in a web of multifarious interests, claims, concerns and knowledges, where climate change adaptation is but one of several aspects that forest owners have to consider.","[Uggla, Ylva; Lidskog, Rolf] Univ Orebro, Environm Sociol Sect, Orebro, Sweden",Orebro University,"Uggla, Y (corresponding author), Univ Orebro, Environm Sociol Sect, Orebro, Sweden.",ylva.uggla@oru.se,"Lidskog, Rolf/AAV-2816-2021","Lidskog, Rolf/0000-0001-6735-0011",Mistra (the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research); Forestry Research Institute of Sweden (Skogforsk); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU); Umea University,Mistra (the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research); Forestry Research Institute of Sweden (Skogforsk); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU); Umea University,"This paper was written as part of the interdisciplinary program Future Forests financed by Mistra (the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research), the Forestry Research Institute of Sweden (Skogforsk), the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), and Umea University.",,39,6,6,2,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0282-7581,1651-1891,,SCAND J FOREST RES,Scand.

Although the Norwegian government has been relatively proactive in instituting measures aimed at halting global climate change, less attention has been paid to the challenge of adapting to climate change. The global climate system is likely to undergo changes, regardless of the implementation of abatement policies under the Kyoto Protocol or other regimes. The full range of impacts resulting from these changes is still uncertain; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that adaptation to climate change is necessary and inevitable within several sectors. The potential impacts of climate change in the built environment are now being addressed. Both the functionality of the existing built environment and the design of future buildings are likely to be altered by climate change impacts, and the expected implications of these new conditions are now investigated. However, measures aimed at adjustments within individual sectors, such as altering the criteria and codes of practice for the design and construction of buildings, constitute only a partial adaptation to climate change.

To address this challenge, ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA), i.e., the use of ecosystem services and biodiversity to help people adapt to climate change, is increasingly being considered as an alternative or complement to traditional, engineering-based approaches (increasingly also known as nature-based solutions). However, little research on ecosystem-based adaptation has been carried out in urban areas, and empirical evidence of its effectiveness and uptake in strategic adaptation planning is particularly lacking. Against this background, this study investigates the implementation of urban EbA in strategic adaptation planning. Based on a comparative analysis of all German municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, it examines the integration of EbA into municipal adaptation strategies. The results show that there is, so far, no comprehensive uptake of the EbA concept. While current strategies differ significantly in their type, structure, scope, maturity and content, overall the EbA concept remains implicit. 76% of the assessed strategies include some kind of ecosystem-based adaptation measures, which focus on enhancing the conservation, restoration, creation or sustainable management of ecosystems, and 25% of all strategies highlight the multiple benefits of these measures. However, comprehensive approaches are missing. We conclude that better policy support and comprehensive mainstreaming of EbA (e.g., through more distributed urban governance, science-policy integration, combined top-down policies and bottom-up activities) is urgently needed to foster sustainable urban development.

To ensure reliable estimates of the adoption of these preventive behaviors, many data collection methods are offered by polling firms. The aim of this study was to compare a telephone survey with a web survey on Lyme disease with regard to their representativeness. Methods The data comes from a cross-sectional study conducted in the Province of Quebec (Canada). In total, 1003 people completed the questionnaire by telephone and 956 filled in a web questionnaire. We compared the data obtained from both survey modes with the census data in regard to various demographic characteristics. We then compared the data from both samples in terms of self-reported Lyme disease preventive behaviors and other theoretically associated constructs. We also assessed the measurement invariance (equivalence) of the index of Lyme disease preventive behaviors across the telephone and web samples. Results Findings showed that neither the telephone nor the web panel modes of data collection can be considered more representative of the target population. The results showed that the proportion of item non-responses was significantly higher with the web questionnaire (5.6%) than with the telephone survey (1.3%), and that the magnitude of the differences between the two survey modes was nil for 19 out of the 30 items related to Lyme disease, and small for 11 of them. Results from invariance analyses confirmed the measurement invariance of an index of adaptation to Lyme disease, as well as the mean invariance across both samples. Conclusions Our results suggested that both samples provided similar estimates of the level of adaptation to Lyme disease preventive behaviors. In sum, the results of our study showed that neither survey mode was superior to the other. Thus, in studies where adaptation to climate change is monitored over time, using a web survey instead of a telephone survey could be more cost-effective, and researchers should consider doing so in future surveys on adaptation to climate. However, we recommend conducting a pretest study before deciding whether to use both survey modes or only one of them.","[Domche, Grace Ngambo; Valois, Pierre; Tessier, Maxime] Univ Laval, Fac Educ, 2320 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Canuel, Magalie] Natl Inst Publ Hlth Quebec, 945 Av Wolfe, Quebec City, PQ G1V 5B3, Canada; [Talbot, Denis] Univ Laval, Fac Med, 1050 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Talbot, Denis] Univ Laval, CHU Quebec, Res Ctr, Populat Hlth & Optimal Practices Axis, Quebec City, PQ G1S 4L8, Canada; [Aenishaenslin, Cecile; Bouchard, Catherine] Univ Montreal, FMV, Grp Rech Epidemiol Zoonoses & Sante Publ GREZOSP, St Hyacinthe, PQ, Canada; [Bouchard, Catherine] Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, Natl Microbiol Lab, Publ Hlth Risk Sci Div, St Hyacinthe, PQ, Canada; [Briand, Sandie] Natl Inst Publ Hlth Quebec, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Laval University; Laval University; Universite de Montreal; Public Health Agency of Canada,"Valois, P (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Fac Educ, 2320 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",pierre.valois@fse.ulaval.ca,,"Talbot, Denis/0000-0003-0431-3314; Aenishaenslin, Cecile/0000-0002-8594-4945","Green Fund of the Quebec government (QC, Canada)","Green Fund of the Quebec government (QC, Canada)","This research was supported by the Green Fund of the Quebec government (QC, Canada) as part of the 2013-2020 Climate Change Action Plan (http://www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca/cgfv/programmes.htm).The funders had no role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,79,3,3,1,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2288,,BMC MED RES METHODOL,BMC Med.

Unclear conceptualization and the absence of comparable metrics are challenges that hinder the assessment of progress toward policy goals. This study draws on a policy mix approach to analyze adaptation efforts at the subnational level. It examines the complex pathways by which rural households in Northeast Brazil build resilience capacities and deal with drought with policy support. Particular emphasis is placed on the implementation of policy mixes composed of climate-related and broader development instruments as well as on the coordination of these instruments in the mix. The resilience of households benefiting from different instrument mixes is examined, and the results show a trend toward an intermediary value for our composite resilience metric highlighting the adoption of coping rather than transformative adaptive strategies. However, changing these trends toward enhanced resilience pathways depends on the improved implementation of the policy mixes and on political factors that include administrative issues, but also coordination and negotiation among policy actors.","[Milhorance, Carolina; Le Coq, Jean-Francois; Sabourin, Eric] Ctr Agr Res & Dev, ArtDev Res Unit CIRAD Art Dev, Montpellier, France; [Milhorance, Carolina; Sabourin, Eric; Mesquita, Patricia; Nogueira, Daniela] Univ Brasilia, Ctr Sustainable Dev UnB CDS, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois; Andrieu, Nadine] CIRAD Innovat, Ctr Agr Res & Dev, Innovat Res Unit, Capesterre, Guadeloupe, France; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois; Sabourin, Eric] Int Ctr Trop Agr Alliance Biodivers CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Andrieu, Nadine] Montpellier Univ Excellence Muse, Montpellier, France; [Cavalcante, Louise] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Publ Adm & Policy Grp WUR, Wageningen, Netherlands",Universite de Montpellier; Universidade de Brasilia; Universite de Montpellier; Wageningen University & Research,"Milhorance, C (corresponding author), Ctr Int Dev & Agr Res CIRAD, UMR Art Dev, Dept Environm & Soc, Bur 309,TA C-11373 Rue Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",carolina.milhorance@cirad.fr,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Le Coq, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-1084-1973; Cavalcante de Souza Cabral, Louise/0000-0002-8773-540X; SABOURIN, Eric/0000-0002-1171-2535; Milhorance, Carolina/0000-0002-3290-8596",Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [ARTIMIX] [ANR-16-IDEX-0006]; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [TYPOCLIM] [ANR-16-IDEX-0006]; Brazil's CNPq/Capes/FAPDF [16-2014],Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [ARTIMIX]; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [TYPOCLIM]; Brazil's CNPq/Capes/FAPDF,This work was supported by the Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [ARTIMIX N degrees ANR-17-CE030005]; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [TYPOCLIM ANR-16-IDEX-0006]; Brazil's CNPq/Capes/FAPDF [INCT no 16-2014 ODISSEIA].,,66,3,3,3,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

To understand climate change adaption, it is important to explore the learning process that underlies farmer's adaptation practices in the region. Prairie farmers' learning was analyzed using Transformative Learning Theory whereby learning is categorized into three types: instrumental, communicative, and transformative. All producers learned instrumentally to some degree, but farmers who placed less emphasis on maximizing economic returns generally showed secondary learning outcomes correlating economic and environmental benefits. Communicative learning was mainly limited to producer-producer dialogue to the exclusion of other organizational and institutional players in the agricultural system. Critical reflection was explored as an important precursor to transformative learning. Strong evidence of transformative learning was rare (observed in 11% of farmers), but indicators of transformative learning were diverse and was observed in 43% of farmers. Transformative learning is believed to be important for flexible decision-making and autonomous thinking, making it advantageous for responding to changing environmental conditions. The analysis shows that a large number of information sources, and communication of information in an experiential and observable way, is conducive to transformative learning. Adaptation to environmental uncertainty, resulting from changing climatic conditions, may be most effectively dealt with when individual farmers undergo transformative learning whereby underlying assumptions that govern actions, values, and claims to knowledge are questioned.","Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Tarnoczi, T (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",tylertarnoczi@hotmail.com,,,Manitoba Graduate Scholarship; Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; Canada Research Chairs,Manitoba Graduate Scholarship; Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canada Research Chairs(Canada Research ChairsCGIAR),"I would like to extend my gratitude to the many farmers who participated in this research, Fikret Berkes and John Sinclair (University of Manitoba), and Henry Venema and Darren Swanson (International Institute for Sustainable Development).

Located in a volatile extreme weather region, it is the largest archipelagic country, and is among the five countries with the highest number of natural disasters. Although Indonesia signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 and ratified it in 2004, CCA remains embryonic despite recent changes to facilitate climate policy. Problematic areas include inadequate sectoral policy coordination across government agencies and jurisdictional levels, and inadequate local capacity building. This article addresses these areas both because Indonesia has to date paid little attention to them and because of their significance to other developing countries. To achieve a better understanding of the inadequacies to inform learning and development on CCA policy, a policy analysis was conducted that included 25 interviews with Indonesian policy actors. Key findings are that for effective adaptation, sectoral coordination needs to first address a number of inadequacies in governance and practice inadequacies to facilitate local mainstreaming of adaptation. In turn, local capacity building needs to address inadequacies of resource support, leadership, climate change awareness, government-community partnerships, vulnerability assessment, and inclusion of local knowledge and communities in decision-making.","[Yoseph-Paulus, Rahayu] Local Governance Buton Regency, Pasarwajo, Southeast Sulaw, Indonesia; [Yoseph-Paulus, Rahayu] Univ Dayanu Ikhsanuddin Unidayan Baubau, Lembaga Penelitian & Pengabdian Pada Masyarakat L, Sulaa, Southeast Sulaw, Indonesia; [Hindmarsh, Richard] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Hindmarsh, Richard] Griffith Univ, Ctr Governance & Publ Policy, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Hindmarsh, R (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.;Hindmarsh, R (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Ctr Governance & Publ Policy, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",r.hindmarsh@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,108,18,18,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Accordingly, this paper tries to develop a simple model structure for the tool and consider how best to use the evaluation tool, based on the achievements of a previous study. To enable simple calculations in a spreadsheet, an input-output model is applied to the model structure, assuming minimal impact of shocks on national nominal income. Comparisons of projection results by two alternative candidate models with those by a comprehensive but complex simulation model including flexible and realistic assumptions show that the developed simple models result in realistic and robust projections of real consumption and social welfare index.

Crop diversification is a form of adaptation to climate change that reduces exposure to climate-related risks and has also been shown to increase diet diversity, reduce micronutrient deficiencies, and positively affect agro-ecological systems. Despite these benefits, the level of crop diversification in Bangladesh remains extremely low, requiring an examination of the factors that support uptake of this practice. This paper explores whether women's empowerment, measured using the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), leads to increased diversification in the use of farmland. Our results reveal that some aspects of women's empowerment in agriculture, but not all, lead to more diversification and to a transition from cereal production to other crops like vegetables and fruits. These findings suggest a possible pathway for gender-sensitive interventions that promote crop diversity as a risk management tool and as a way to improve the availability of nutritious crops.","[De Pinto, Alessandro] Univ Greenwich, Fac Engn & Sci, Nat Resources Inst, Livelihoods & Inst Dept, London, England; [Seymour, Greg; Bryan, Elizabeth] IFPRI, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC USA; [Bhandari, Prapti] IFPRI, Washington, DC USA",University of Greenwich; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"De Pinto, A (corresponding author), Univ Greenwich, Fac Engn & Sci, Nat Resources Inst, Livelihoods & Inst Dept, London, England.",a.depinto@greenwich.ac.uk; g.seymour@cgiar.org; e.bryan@cgiar.org,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Seymour, Greg/0000-0002-2213-0450; Bryan, Elizabeth/0000-0002-0906-222X; De Pinto, Alex/0000-0003-0327-494X",USAID; CGIAR Fund Donors,USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR),"This work was undertaken as part of the Gender, Climate Change and Nutrition Integration Initiative (GCAN) funded by USAID and is associated with the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.",,84,3,4,2,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The study analyzed the determinants of ruminant farmers' use of sustainable production practices for climate change adaptation and mitigation in Enugu State, Nigeria. Multistage sampling procedure was used to select ninety six (96) ruminant farmers that constituted the sample for the study. Semi-structured interview schedule with open ended questions was used in data collection. Data were analyzed using multiple regression and Pearson Moment Correlation statistics. Access to veterinary services (t = 2.056, p = 0.044), monthly household income (t = 3.582, p = 0.001) and annual income from ruminant production (t = -2.635, p = 0.011) were socio-economic factors that significantly influenced use of sustainable practices. The adjusted R- square implies that the three factors were able to explain 24% of variance in use of sustainable practices. There is a significant positive correlation (r = 0.426, p = 0.000) between knowledge level of farmers and their use of sustainable production practices.

Developing countries are being dispmportionally affected. In 2010, Pakistan witnessed one of the worst floods in its history. One-fifth of the country was severely affected, leading to major economic losses and casualties. Thus, it is imperative to understand climate change and flood risk perception for designing flood risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies. This study examines flood risk perception and psychological distance to climate change of rural communities along the Indus and Chenab rivers in Muzaffargarh district, Pakistan. Flood risk perception was measured using three main components, i.e., awareness about floods, worry (about floods), and preparedness. Psychological distance to climate change was quantified using five dimensions, i.e., psychological, geographic, social, temporal, and uncertainty. Yamane sampling method was used, and 365 samples were collected. The data was collected using household surveys from rural communities. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, ANOVA-test, and Pearson's correlation were performed. Results indicate that overall flood risk perception and psychological distance to climate change was moderate in a high flood risk area. A negative correlation was also observed between uncertainty and worry. Regression analyses indicate a strong positive influence of homeownership on flood risk perception and the converse impact on the psychological distance to climate change. This study can help integrate the philosophies of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The paper also highlights the need to improve risk communication strategies to help people understand climate change and its impacts, adopt precautionary measures, and reduce flood risks.","[Rasool, Samavia; Rana, Irfan Ahmad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn SCEE, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Shakil] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn SCEE, NUST Inst Civil Engn NICE, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Rana, IA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn SCEE, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",samaviarasool461@gmail.com; irfanrana90@hotmail.com; shakilahmad@nice.nust.edu.pk,"Rana, Irfan Ahmad/C-2560-2017","Rana, Irfan Ahmad/0000-0002-3157-1186; Rasool, Samavia/0000-0003-2224-5239",,,,,87,2,2,4,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

While research has started to track this aid, it has not yet examined its allocation across all donor and recipient countries. We thus do not know to what extent vulnerable countries indeed receive more support for adaptation. We address this research gap and ask: how does this commitment to prioritizing particularly vulnerable countries translate into actual adaptation aid allocation? To what extent do vulnerable countries receive more adaptation aid? We address these questions though a quantitative analysis of data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on bilateral adaptation aid from 2011 through 2014. In contrast to other studies, we find that vulnerability-or more precisely, vulnerability indicators-matter for adaptation aid allocation. Countries that are more exposed to climate change risks, such as extreme weather events or sea level rise, receive more adaptation aid, both on a per capita basis and as a percentage of all adaptation aid. These results indicate that collectively (even if not at the level of each individual donor) donors align their bilateral adaptation aid allocation with global promises.","[Betzold, Carola] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Weiler, Florian] Univ Kent, Rutherford N4-E7, Canterbury CT2 7NX, Kent, England",University of Antwerp; University of Kent,"Betzold, C (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",carola.betzold@uantwerpen.be; f.weiler@kent.ac.uk,"Weiler, Florian/GVU-1958-2022; Weiler, Florian/AAS-2330-2020","Weiler, Florian/0000-0003-3287-395X; Klock, Carola/0000-0003-2987-7570",Gothenburg Centre for Globalization and Development,Gothenburg Centre for Globalization and Development,"We are grateful for helpful comments and suggestions on earlier versions of this paper from participants at the Lund Climate Finance Workshop, Jakob Skovgaard, Jonathan Pickering, and three anonymous reviewers.

Yet little attention has been paid to the consequences of adaptation policies and practices for sustainability. Recognition that not every adaptation to climate change is a good one has drawn attention to the need for sustainable adaptation strategies and measures that contribute to social justice and environmental integrity. This article presents four normative principles to guide responses to climate change and illustrates the significance of the 'sustainable adaptation' concept through case studies from diverse contexts. The principles are: first, recognize the context for vulnerability, including multiple stressors; second, acknowledge that differing values and interests affect adaptation outcomes; third, integrate local knowledge into adaptation responses; and fourth, consider potential feedbacks between local and global processes. We argue that fundamental societal transformations are required in order to achieve sustainable development pathways and avoid adaptation funding going into efforts that exacerbate vulnerability and contribute to rising emissions. Despite numerous challenges involved in achieving such change, we suggest that sustainable adaptation practices have the potential to address some of the shortcomings of conventional social and economic development pathways.","[Eriksen, Siri] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Aldunce, Paulina] Univ Chile, Dept Environm Sci & Renewable Nat Resources, Santiago, Chile; [Aldunce, Paulina] Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Melbourne Sch Land & Environm, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Bahinipati, Chandra Sekhar] MIDS, Madras 600020, Tamil Nadu, India; [Martins, Rafael D'Almeida] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Ctr Environm Studies NEPAM, BR-13083867 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Molefe, John Isaac] Univ Botswana, Dept Environm Sci, Gaborone, Botswana; [Nhemachena, Charles] CSIR, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [O'Brien, Karen; Sygna, Linda; Ulsrud, Kirsten] Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Olorunfemi, Felix] Nigerian Inst Social & Econ Res, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Park, Jacob] Green Mt Coll, Poultney, VT 05764 USA",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Universidad de Chile; University of Melbourne; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; University of Botswana; Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - South Africa; University of Oslo,"Eriksen, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",siri.eriksen@umb.no,"Nhemachena, Charles/D-8489-2018; BAHINIPATI, CHANDRA SEKHAR/H-8627-2019; Aldunce, Paulina/T-2125-2017","Nhemachena, Charles/0000-0002-4685-9246; BAHINIPATI, CHANDRA SEKHAR/0000-0002-4013-8915; Aldunce, Paulina/0000-0002-1159-9333; Martins, Rafael/0000-0002-2937-6170",,,,,66,317,322,1,135,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

In addition, global climate change often leads to novel shifts in plant communities which are difficult to anticipate with detailed models based on current system dynamics, which are often greatly altered under novel climates. In order to identify nonforested plant communities that are highly susceptible to state transitions under global climate change, we examined differences between the historical climate envelopes and end-of-century projections. We developed a vulnerability index based on the realized climate envelope for a given plant community relative to future climate exposure under two different climate-forcing models. To provide an approach to prioritizing climate-change adaptation resources at smaller scales, we used scenario analysis to determine the probability of falling outside of the historical climate envelope for each vegetation type present in a given management unit. The large-scale index consistently identified several areas as highly vulnerable to ecosystem state transition under future global climate change. South and north central Texas, the northwestern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions, eastern Kansas, and large portions of central and western Texas appear most vulnerable under both climate models. Scenarios identified thresholds of potential state shift for every vegetation type in the small-scale management areas investigated. Our study identifies a simple method for determining the relative vulnerability of nonforested plant communities to state shifts, providing a robust approach for prioritizing limited climate-adaptation resources at multiple scales.","[Wonkka, Carissa L.; Twidwell, Dirac; Bielski, Christine H.; Donovan, Victoria M.; Roberts, Caleb P.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Allred, Brady W.] Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Montana System; University of Montana; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Wonkka, CL (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",cwonkka2@unl.edu; dirac.twidwell@unl.edu; brady.allred@umontana.edu; christine.bielski@huskers.unl.edu; victoria.donovan@huskers.unl.edu; caleb.roberts@huskers.unl.edu; sam.fuhlendorf@okstate.edu,"Wonkka, Carissa/AAZ-4199-2020; Fuhlendorf, Samuel/A-2931-2011","Fuhlendorf, Samuel/0000-0002-8726-9402; Donovan, Victoria/0000-0002-2906-5268",US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Natural Resources Stewardship (EL-21) program [W912HZ-12-1-0003],US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Natural Resources Stewardship (EL-21) program,"This research was funded by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Natural Resources Stewardship (EL-21) program, grant award W912HZ-12-1-0003.",,68,5,5,3,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The VIKOR method allows us to find a compromise solution between two decision strategies of maximizing group utility and minimizing individual regret, and the Shannon entropy is used to determine objective weights among multiple climate change scenarios. The proposed methodology was applied to the problem of selecting locations of subwatersheds for reusing treated wastewater (TWW) in a Korean urban watershed. Selected based on the sustainability concept, hydro-environmental and socioeconomic indicators were used to evaluate the sustainability of TWW reuse under multiple climate change scenarios, using the hydrologic simulation model results and statistical data. Finally, sustainability scores under multiple scenarios were aggregated using the VIKOR together with the Shannon entropy-based weights for the robust prioritization of adaptation strategies. According to the different levels of regret aversion or affinity, our results for water quality showed different sets of adaptation strategies as the best options, suggesting that our framework would help stakeholders seeking the robust options considering both the utility and regret.","[Kim, Yeonjoo] Yonsei Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Chung, Eun-Sung] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Seoul 139743, South Korea",Yonsei University; Seoul National University of Science & Technology,"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",eschung@seoultech.ac.kr,"Chung, Eun-Sung/U-9010-2019; Kim, Yeonjoo/A-1462-2012","Kim, Yeonjoo/0000-0003-1622-2209; Chung, Eun-Sung/0000-0002-4329-1800","Advanced Water Management Research Program - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korea [12-TI-C01]; Climate Change Correspondence R&D Program - Ministry of Environment of Korea [RE2013-001310002]","Advanced Water Management Research Program - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korea; Climate Change Correspondence R&D Program - Ministry of Environment of Korea","This study was financially supported by grants from the Advanced Water Management Research Program funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korea (12-TI-C01) and from the Climate Change Correspondence R&D Program funded by the Ministry of Environment of Korea (RE2013-001310002).",,37,8,8,4,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

To address these issues, in this paper we explore the contributions of geographers to this research, critique top-down objective measurements of resilience, highlight the benefits of employing subjective conceptualizations of resilience, and outline methods for measuring subjective resilience with participatory methods.

In fact, there is a growing recognition of the role that healthy ecosystems play in helping people to adapt to climate change, but Ecosystem-based Adaptation is only starting to be incorporated to policy and its role is so far limited to complement (not substitute) more traditional adaptation measures. This paper reviews recent literature on Ecosystem-based Adaptation and looks for the main reasons for this delay by identifying key areas that need more attention from scientists and policymakers in order to incorporate Ecosystem-based Adaptation into the international climate policy agenda. Main challenges relate to governance structures and participation, how to measure effectiveness, the incorporation of longer-term scales for management, appropriate financial mechanisms, and dealing with climate change and ecosystem science inherent uncertainties.","[Ojea, Elena] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao 48008, Spain",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Ojea, E (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Urquijo 4 4-1, Bilbao 48008, Spain.",elena.ojea@bc3research.org,"ojea, elena/D-3709-2018","ojea, elena/0000-0003-4991-8077",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-39553-C04-02],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"The author wishes to thank the editor, Prof. Rik Leemans, and two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful insights and suggestions for reviewing this work.

Development programs in the high Andes have sought to diminish pastoralist vulnerability to the impacts of shifting seasonal weather patterns and glacial retreat. Despite the increase in attention to the gendered distribution of climate change risks and strategies globally, women alpaca herders in the Andes continue to be sidelined in discussions around animal health and pasture management. I argue that women's marginalization reflects the ways that pastoralist expertise is ascribed and reproduced in interactional encounters. Andean women herders lack access to the social, political, and economic resources necessary to perform expertise in a ratified way, and as a consequence are left out of critical decision-making processes around climate change adaptation. An attention to women's herding work yields insight into pastoralist knowledge and skill as distributive, relational, and embedded within social networks that are at increasing risk of fragmentation.","[Caine, Allison] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Caine, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,"Caine, Allison/0000-0003-2054-4729",Fulbright-Hays Program; Wenner Gren Foundation; University of Michigan's International Institute; Rackham School for Graduate Studies; Robert M.

Climate models project warming with slight increases in winter precipitation but drier summers for the IPNW. These conditions combined with elevated atmospheric CO2, which promote crop growth and improve transpiration-use efficiency, may be beneficial for cropping systems in the IPNW and may provide regional opportunities for agricultural diversification and intensification. Crop modeling simulation under future climatic conditions showed increased wheat productivity for the IPNW for most of the century. Water use by winter wheat was projected to decrease significantly in higher and intermediate precipitation zones and increase slightly in drier locations, but with winter crops utilizing significantly more water overall than spring crops. Crop diversification with inclusion of winter crops other than wheat is a possibility depending on agronomic and economic considerations, while substitution of winter for spring crops appeared feasible only in high precipitation areas. Increased weed pressure, higher pest populations, expanded ranges of biotic stressors, and agronomic, plant breeding, economic, technology, and other factors will influence what production systems eventually prevail under future climatic conditions in the region.","[Stockle, Claudio O.; Higgins, Stewart; Nelson, Roger; Karimi, Tina] Washington State Univ, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Abatzoglou, John] Univ Idaho, Dept Geog, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Huggins, Dave] USDA ARS, Northwest Sustainable Agroecosyst Res, Pullman, WA USA; [Pan, William] Washington State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Antle, John] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Eigenbrode, Sanford D.] Univ Idaho, Dept Plant Soil & Entomol Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Brooks, Erin] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Engn, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",Washington State University; Idaho; University of Idaho; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Washington State University; Oregon State University; Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Stockle, CO (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",stockle@wsu.edu,"Abatzoglou, John T/ABE-6134-2020; Abatzoglou, John T/C-7635-2012","Abatzoglou, John T/0000-0001-7599-9750; Abatzoglou, John T/0000-0001-7599-9750; Brooks, Erin/0000-0002-6921-4870; Eigenbrode, Sanford/0000-0003-0054-8511; Karimi, Tina/0000-0003-2801-8854",United States Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-68002-30191],United States Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture,"This research was supported by the United States Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Award #2011-68002-30191 for the project, Regional Approaches to Climate Change for Pacific Northwest Agriculture.",,35,34,34,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Private sector opportunities for engagement in climate change adaptation are less clear than for mitigation, particularly in developing countries. This article first conceptualizes private sector engagement in adaptation by exploring (1) different roles of the private sector in adaptation in developing countries and (2) the way governments can create an enabling environment to increase private sector engagement. Second, it analyses how 47 least developed countries (LDCs) envisage the role of the private sector in their National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). This article argues that private sector engagement in adaptation is often inevitable and potentially significant. Yet, the results show that it receives little attention in NAPAs. This may have three explanations: (1) an intentional approach of LDCs to avoid a distraction from the necessity to scale up public funding; (2) a lack of awareness of the potential of the private sector; and (3) the NAPA formulation guidelines focus on the public sector in the context of public financing, potentially causing path dependency. Developed countries' historic responsibility for emissions obliges them to upscale public climate finance. At the same time, however, LDCs should further explore private sector engagement in adaptation.","[Pauw, Pieter; Pegels, Anna] German Dev Inst, Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE),"Pauw, P (corresponding author), German Dev Inst, Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",w.p.pauw@gmail.com,,"Pauw, Pieter/0000-0002-9323-2577",,,,,37,23,23,3,28,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Climate change is further worsening impacts of existing risks and introducing new risks in the form of heat stress, water scarcity, water and vector borne diseases and extreme events. There is no doubt that countries need to investmentmore in disaster risk reduction (DRR) together with climate change adaptation (CCA) not only to minimize impacts but also build resilience. Sadly, investment in DRR and CCA is far behind compared-with investments in expansion of human settlements, infrastructure and services development. This paper examines existing practices of investment and investigates challenges in increasing investments in reduction of water-related disaster risks. It concludes that in the first place, DRR needs to be integrated in national development plans. In addition, formulating sectoral long-term plans proved helpful to secure commitment of investment.

A community-based vulnerability assessment was conducted that employed semi-structured interviews with community members within or related to the tourism, fisheries and agricultural sectors. The results were analysed using the Local Adaptive Capacity (LAC) framework, which characterises adaptive capacity based on five elements: asset base; institutions and entitlements; knowledge and information; innovation; and flexible forward-looking decision-making and governance. This paper contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it argues that many elements of the LAC framework correspond with an evolutionary perspective on adaptive capacity. Second, it offers an in-depth case study of the capacity of Whitehouse to adapt to climate change. Third, it offers a critical assessment of whether the LAC framework fully captures the important elements of adaptive capacity. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Hogarth, J.

The scientific and professional literature is illustrative of the ways participants in a number of outdoor recreation activities are adapting to climate change, including the ways in which these adaptations are likely to increase in the future. This study explores these issues as they apply to visiting Vermont state parks. Climate change models developed in the physical and natural sciences offer insights into future climate-related scenarios in the Vermont state parks (thereby helping to define the supply of state park recreation opportunities). We used social science to complement these models by examining how visitors may adapt to these changing conditions (thereby helping to define the demand for recreation in the state parks). We conducted an on-site survey of visitors to three representative state parks, describing a range of climate change-related recreation conditions and asking respondents how they would adapt. Three types of adaptations were included in the study: 1) changes in the amount of use, 2) changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of use, and 3) changes in recreation activities. Study findings suggest that most climate-related changes included in the study will: 1) decrease the amount of use; 2) shift substantial amounts of use to more northerly parks and parks at higher elevations, and shift use to earlier and later in the conventional state park season; and 3) shift participation among the 10 recreation activities included in the study, though the pattern of these shifts is complex. Study findings suggest that visitors are likely to make substantial adaptations in their use of the Vermont state parks in response to climate change, and that state park management will also have to adapt accordingly.","[Perry, Elizabeth; Manning, Robert; Xiao, Xiao] Univ Vermont, Pk Studies Lab, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Manning, Robert] Univ Vermont, Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Valliere, William] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Manning, R (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Pk Studies Lab, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;Manning, R (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",Robert.Manning@uvm.edu,"Xiao, Xiao/Z-1199-2019","Perry, Elizabeth/0000-0002-7992-6345",,,,,26,9,9,0,16,SAGAMORE PUBL LLC,URBANA,"1807 N FEDERAL DR, URBANA, IL 61801 USA",0735-1968,2160-6862,,J PARK RECREAT ADM,J.

Research has found that displacement does cause negative health impacts to evacuees, but few studies have observed how planned sheltering might reduce adverse health impacts. This article identifies the good practice and lessons learned from China's response to severe flooding in Anhui province in 2016. Methods: First, we identified the key phases for disaster sheltering by analyzing related government reports. We then interviewed 21 relevant professionals in order to identify good practice and lessons learned which could lead to better health outcomes (e.g., reduce fatalities, infectious diseases, and mental health problems). Interviewees were selected through a purposive sampling strategy, which identified emergency management professionals and those who had been assigned evacuation, sheltering, or medical tasks. Finally, thematic analysis and the constant comparative method were used to code, identify, and describe the good practice and challenges during key phases. Results: Good practice included: using early warning systems to advise communities of risks and enforce evacuation in the flood zone; preparing and using schools as shelters with open-ended periods of operation; and, providing stable shelter accommodations which offered medical and public health services, clean drinking water and food, sanitation, and toilet hygiene through multiagency cooperation. Challenges included: providing mental health services, evaluating intervention effectiveness, managing volunteers, monitoring long-term health effects, and providing economic support. Conclusions: The unintended negative effects caused by sheltering during extreme weather can be reduced. This requires close cooperation among government entities to establish planned mass shelters with appropriate levels of personal, environmental and healthcare support and to ensure long-term physical and mental health support. Additionally, if disaster mitigation strategies are integrated with climate adaptation plans, we can design more health-oriented and sustainable cities.

They provide vital forage for livestock during summer, and their traditional use is decisive for the maintenance of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and open landscapes, which benefit local populations and tourists. With climate change, the increased intensity and frequency of climatic hazards threaten the sustainable management of these systems. To foster climate adaptation in such complex systems, we developed a tool to assess their climate change-related vulnerability. The tool consists of a 3-step vulnerability analysis: first, of the inherent exposure of mountain pastures to climatic hazards based on their physical features; second, of vegetation sensitivity to climatic hazards and changes in practices; and third, of adaptive capacities that lie in the options for managing mountain pastures together with the farms using them. This work was carried out within the research and development network Sentinel Mountain Pastures, which addresses climate change adaptation issues on mountain pastures across the French Alps. We used a transdisciplinary approach that included participatory work with experts and interviews with stakeholders. We believe this diagnostic tool has high potential for practical application to support adaptation on summer mountain pastures, by allowing a shared integrative understanding of the complexity of mountain pasture systems by stakeholders. We hope this will provide new information for policymaking that enhances the resilience of summer mountain pasture systems.","[Deleglise, Claire; Dodier, Hermann; Francois, Hugues; Arpin, Isabelle; Nettier, Baptiste] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Irstea, Lab EcoSyst & Soc Montagne LESSEM, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Dodier, Hermann] FAI, F-38190 Les Adrets, France; [Garde, Laurent] CERPAM, F-04100 Manosque, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE,"Deleglise, C (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, Irstea, Lab EcoSyst & Soc Montagne LESSEM, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",ciaire.deleglise@irstea.fr,,"Deleglise, Claire/0000-0001-6119-8311","LABEX ITEM, within the program Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-10-LABX-50-01]; French General Commission for Territorial Equity; French Ministry of Ecology/Water and Biodiversity; European Union (FEDER-POIA massif alpin); Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region","LABEX ITEM, within the program Investissements d'Avenir(French National Research Agency (ANR)); French General Commission for Territorial Equity; French Ministry of Ecology/Water and Biodiversity; European Union (FEDER-POIA massif alpin); Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region(Region Auvergne-Rhone-AlpesRegion Bourgogne-Franche-ComteRegion Hauts-de-FranceRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine); Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region(Region Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur)","We thank all of the experts from CERPAM (Centre d'Etudes et de Realisations Pastorales Alpes-Mediterranee), FAI (Federation des Alpages de l'Isere), ADEM (Association Departementale d'Economie Montagnarde), Ecrins National Park, Vanoise National Park, LESSEM (Laboratoire des EcoSystemes et Societes En Montagne), and LECA (Laboratoire d'Ecologie Alpine) who participated in participatory modeling during the PhD work of Baptiste Nettier.

It details how the equation between insurance and ethical climate change adaptation emerged through development economists' moral and technical critique of ex post disaster relief, which positioned insurers' unique styles of thought and practice as ethical and technical solutions to the problem of how to manage the state's financial capacity. However, an example of Dominican disaster budgeting demonstrates how insurantialized disaster governance both compliments and contrasts with alternative disaster financing strategies based in Caribbean states' efforts to create autonomy from plantation dependencies. In the contemporary Caribbean, the moral imperative to become economically self-sufficient reconfigures state-donor-market-society relations in ways that further hollow out Caribbean states' political independence.","[Grove, Kevin] Florida Int Univ, Dept Global & Sociocultural Studies, 11200 SW 8th St,SIPA 311, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Grove, K (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Global & Sociocultural Studies, 11200 SW 8th St,SIPA 311, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",kgrove@fiu.edu,,"Grove, Kevin/0000-0001-9114-5050",PSIP,PSIP,"This is a rough estimate based on capital expenditure funded through the PSIP comprising approximately 15-30 per cent of the GDP (Skerrit, 2012), Dominica's flat 15 per cent VAT, and 65-75 per cent of the PSIP financed through external grants and loans.",,87,3,3,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This study suggests an approach in which multi-purpose reservoirs can adapt to climate change using optimal rule curves developed by an integrated water resources management system. The system has three modules: the Weather Generator model, the Hydrological Model, and the Differential Evolution Optimization Model. Two general circulation models (GCMs) are selected as examples of both dry and wet conditions to generate future climate scenarios. This study is using the Nakdong River basin in Korea as a case study, where water supply is provided from the reservoir system. Three different climate change conditions (historic, wet and dry) are investigated through the compilation of six 60 years long scenarios. The optimal rule curves for three multi-purpose reservoirs in the basin are developed for each scenario. The results indicate that although the rule curve for large-size reservoir is less sensitive to climate change, medium or small-size reservoirs are very sensitive to those changes. We further conclude that the large reservoir should be used to release more water, while small or medium-size reservoirs should store inflow to mitigate severe drought damages in the basin.","[Eum, Hyung-Il; Simonovic, Slobodan P.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Simonovic, SP (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.",heum@uwo.ca; simonovic@uwo.ca,,,National Research Foundation of Korea [KRF-2007-357-D00258]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),This work was supported by the grant from the National Research Foundation of Korea (KRF-2007-357-D00258) and the grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.,,27,64,64,0,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

It provides the opportunity to formalize discussions and to store their content in a synthetic format, as well as to collect experiences and evaluate the impacts they had at their respective scales of implementation and on different parameters. The major aim of the ESPREssO-ADB tool, and its main innovation, is to deal with multi-hazard and multi-challenge actions, in an international context and notably in a cross-border initiative. The ESPREssO project aimed at contributing to a new strategic vision on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) in Europe. To do so, stakeholders working with CCA and/or DRR in Europe were consulted to identify measures boosting adaptation or societies' resilience. Each idea, measure or comment was stored and ranked in the ADB using qualitative criteria based on the Sendai Priorities and the SHIELD model proposed by the ESPREssO Team. Each action was assessed through multi-criteria analysis and effectiveness was approached under two different angles. The first one in line with the priorities of the Sendai Framework; and the second one with the SHIELD model. This model incorporate recommendations on how to optimize risk management capabilities through DRR. Positive actions had fed the Vision Paper and Guidelines produced by the project. This paper describes in details the ADB structure and the multi-criteria analysis performed.","[Baills, Audrey; Grandjean, Gilles; Maspataud, Aurelie; Ettinger, Susanne] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, 3 Ave Claude Guillemin, F-45100 Orleans, France; [Abad, Jaime] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, Direct Reg Hauts France, Arteparc Batiment A,2 Rue Peupliers, F-59810 Lesquin, France; [Dias, Nuwan; Clegg, Georgina] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Art Design & Architecture, Queen St S, Huddersfield HD1 3BZ, W Yorkshire, England; [Albris, Kristoffer] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Anthropol, CSS Bygning 16, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Opgang, Denmark; [Hemmers, Jaqueline] DKKV, Kaiser Friedrich Str 13, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Martucci, Casimiro] Univ Naples Federico II, PLINIVS LUPT Study Ctr, Via Toledo 402, I-80134 Naples, Italy",Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); University of Huddersfield; University of Copenhagen; University of Naples Federico II,"Baills, A (corresponding author), Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, 3 Ave Claude Guillemin, F-45100 Orleans, France.",a.baills@brgm.fr,,"Clegg, Georgina/0000-0003-0736-3210; Dias, Nuwan/0000-0002-4642-9975; Albris, Kristoffer/0000-0002-1201-2231; MARTUCCI, CASIMIRO/0000-0002-5409-6752",European Union [700342],European Union(European Commission),"The ESPREssO project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 700342.

A critical step in this process is the identification of existing barriers to effective collaboration, finding new areas of common ground, and ways to enhance co-operation with regards to CCA and DRR policymaking in Europe. This is particularly important considering the potential relationships between CCA and DRR activities at the regional, national, European and global levels. Serious games have emerged as a valuable tool to communicate information and catalyse discussion in many policy arenas. The games have the power to inform, mainly by exposing strengths and weaknesses of a system but not necessarily create policy choices. This paper presents the development process and rationale behind creation of RAMSETE I, a serious game developed by and for the ESPREssO Project to elicit information from its stakeholders in aiming to inform synergies between CCA and DRR sectors. The results assess its application as a device to frame discussions during an international Think Tank workshop. The serious game focused on three particular aspects of CCA and DRR policy interactions: (1) separation of administrative responsibilities and the use of different terminology, (2) the ongoing competition for funding and political will as well as (3) difficulties regarding the top-down implementation of policies. The rules and design process are presented briefly, before going in-depth into the information gleaned during its application in the workshop.","[Abad, Jaime] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, Direct Reg Hauts France, Arteparc Batiment A,2 Rue Peupliers, F-59810 Lesquin, France; [Booth, Laura] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Univ Str 22,CHN J71, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Baills, Audrey] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, 3 Ave Claude Guillemin, F-45060 Orleans, France; [Fleming, Kevin; Petrovic, Bojana] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Leone, Mattia] Univ Napoli Federico II, PLINIVS Study Ctr, Via Toledo 402, I-80134 Naples, Italy; [Schueller, Lynn] DKKV German Comm Disaster Reduct, Kaiser Friedrichstr 13, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Petrovic, Bojana] OGS Natl Inst Oceanog & Expt Geophys, Borgo Grotta Gigante 42-C, I-34010 Sgonico, TS, Italy",Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; University of Naples Federico II; Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale,"Baills, A (corresponding author), Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, 3 Ave Claude Guillemin, F-45060 Orleans, France.",a.baills@brgm.fr,,"Fleming, Kevin Michael/0000-0001-8449-3081; Petrovic, Bojana/0000-0003-3985-2959; LEONE, MATTIA FEDERICO/0000-0003-2434-509X; Booth, Laura/0000-0001-7954-1392","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [700342, DRS-10-2015]",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,The work presented in this paper was undertaken as part of the ESPREssO project (Grant agreement 700342) supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the topic DRS-10-2015: Disaster Resilience and Climate Change topic 2: Natural Hazards: Towards risk reduction science and innovation plans at national and European level.

Similar to other developing countries and those in the Pacific, they are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change more so because of their geographic location, socioeconomic conditions and political instability. Nonetheless, there are approaches to alleviate the damaging effects of climate change in the region's fisheries sector. Using economic modeling, this paper estimates the economic costs of potential climate change adaptation strategies for the fisheries sector in Vanuatu and Timor-Leste through assessment of alternative future scenarios. Strategies include aquaculture development, natural resource management through establishment and/or expansion of marine protected areas, and deployment of low-cost inshore fish aggregating devices. Modeling results demonstrate that the above innovations will enable the two countries to significantly improve coastal and freshwater fish production in the medium-term (2035) and long-term (2050). Fish consumption is projected to grow due to population and income improvements; yet considerable increases in production will augment demand. Furthermore, national-level gains are projected from these adaptation strategies through fish exports. Improved production under climate change will require significant investments from the national governments of Vanuatu and Timor-Leste and/or private sectors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept of adaptation pathways, a diagnostic and analytical tool to assist in adaptive planning and decision-making, is gaining traction as a way of framing and informing climate adaptation. It provides decisionmakers a way to acknowledge the inter-temporal complexities and uncertainties associated with the novel dynamics of climate change and a mechanism to manage these challenges in the local context. In 2012, the Australian Government funded an 18-month program to provide decisionmakers in the coastal zone an opportunity to test the utility of the adaptation pathways concept for coastal climate adaptation. Using a selection of completed projects as case studies, we performed a document analysis to better understand the learnings from the projects. The main themes surrounded: (1) the utility of the adaptation pathway framework in developing options, (2) decision-making rationale and criteria, and (3) stakeholder participation in pathway development. A project participant survey was developed to further understand these themes. Our analysis reveals that adaptation pathways was generally framed narrowly and conservatively to emphasize extant economic, administrative and legal considerations over community, participatory, or exploratory ones. Although some case study projects were able to reach a point in the pathway discussion to actively involve stakeholders in their decision-making process, many case studies continued to build technical data as a method for defending policies and actions. These results indicate that coastal adaptation can take-up adaptation pathways as a useful concept for decision-making and planning; however, many councils may still require assistance in stakeholder communication processes in order to develop sociallyacceptable plans that take into account the full range of values affecting local coastal environments.","[Lin, Brenda B.] CSIRO Land & Water, PMB 1,107-121 Stn St, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Capon, Tim; Langston, Art; Wise, Russ; Williams, Rachel; Lazarow, Neil] CSIRO Land & Water, Black Mt Labs, Black Mt, ACT, Australia; [Taylor, Bruce] CSIRO Land & Water, Ecol Sci Precinct, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Lin, BB (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, PMB 1,107-121 Stn St, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia.",bbclin@gmail.com,"Lazarow, Neil/C-6928-2015; Lin, Brenda B/A-8834-2011; Taylor, Bruce M/C-5771-2011; Lin, Brenda/O-3578-2019; Wise, Russell M/G-5463-2010; Capon, Tim R/J-5911-2013; Williams, Rachel/D-1597-2011","Lin, Brenda B/0000-0002-6011-9172; Lin, Brenda/0000-0002-6011-9172; Wise, Russell M/0000-0002-5882-5123; Capon, Tim R/0000-0002-5443-6710; Taylor, Bruce/0000-0002-7740-2898",,,,,56,29,30,3,38,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0892-0753,1521-0421,,COAST MANAGE,Coast.

Yet cautionary tales about how power and politics are constitutive of these efforts fill the literature. We show how a relational framing of adaptation and transformation demands a political, cross-scalar, and socionatural analysis to probe the affects and effects of climate change and better grasp how transformative change unfolds. We bring affect theory into conversation with the literature on adaptation politics, socio-environmental transformations, subjectivity, and our empirical work to frame our analysis around three under investigated aspects of transformation: (i) the uncertain and unpredictable relations that constitute socionatures; (ii) other ways of knowing; and (iii) the affective and emotional relations that form a basis for action. Affective adaptation represents a different ontological take on transformation by reframing the socionatural, normative and ethical aspects as relational, uncertain, and performative. This directs analytical attention to processes rather than outcomes. The emphasis on the encounter between bodies in affect theory points to the need for experiential and embodied ways of knowing climate to effect transformative change. Effective transformation requires recognizing uncertainty and unpredictability as part of transformative processes. This is not because all outcomes are acceptable, but rather because uncertainty and unpredictability are elements which help generate affects (action) and emotional commitment to shared human and more than human relations in action, projects, and policies.

Yet there is limited research examining how to promote and facilitate private sector adaptation in developing countries and in particular how governments can create an enabling environment to stimulate and incentivize domestic private sector adaptation. In this paper, we address this gap through a review of the key factors required to provide an enabling environment for the private sector denoted by existing adaptation literatures. We do this with a focus on adaptation by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To advance this review, we draw insights from a much larger, yet generally independent, literature on enabling environments for private sector development. This literature disaggregates the private sector and highlights key constraints to the development and growth of SMEs in SSA, including deficient infrastructure and evidence of an African gap in access to and use of finance. Both areas of scholarship are then combined in a framework identifying key building blocks constituting enabling conditions for private sector adaptation. The framework could be applied in many ways including to focus strategies to enhance private sector adaptation and to identify trade-offs and interactions between policies or initiatives surrounding private sector development. By combining these literatures, we call for a more holistic approach to develop enabling environments for SME adaptation and climate resilient development that addresses the broader structural deficits that condition vulnerability and barriers that limit adaptive capacity.

Farmers have diversified their livelihoods to adapt to uncertain environmental conditions in various ways. While traditionally a diversification of the production and migration were the prime means of adaptation, many farmers have started to intensify their production by adopting shallow groundwater irrigation for vegetable gardening for Ghana's urban markets. This has helped to cope with a changing environment, ameliorated poverty and reversed rural-urban migration, while the local hydrology curbed an over-exploitation of groundwater resources, commonly associated with an uncontrolled farmer-driven expansion of groundwater irrigation. This research confirms that farmer-driven small-scale irrigation can play an important role in the process of climate change adaptation. However, while farmers tried to integrate in the larger economy, they have become subject to market failures that in their essence are caused by unfair and unpredictable patterns of global trade. It is this double exposure to global environmental change and economic globalization that need to be taken into consideration when local adaptive capacities are discussed. Many convincing arguments call for the revision of some of the most unfair and devastating economic practices; however, the need to enhance adaptive capacity towards global climate change for poor parts of the population in the south should be added to the discussion.","[Laube, Wolfram] Univ Bonn, Res Dev Ctr, Dept Polit & Cultural Change, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Schraven, Benjamin] German Dev Inst, Dept Environm Policy & Management Nat Resources, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Awo, Martha] Univ Ghana, Inst Stat Social & Econ Res, Legon, Ghana",University of Bonn; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); University of Ghana,"Laube, W (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Res Dev Ctr, Dept Polit & Cultural Change, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",wlaube@uni-bonn.de; benjamin.schraven@die-gdi.de; marthawo@yahoo.com,,,German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF); Challenge Project for Water and Food [CP 65],German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Challenge Project for Water and Food,"The research for this article was conducted in the GLOWA Volta Project, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), and the Shallow Groundwater Irrigation Project (CP 65), funded by the Challenge Project for Water and Food.

Adaptation to human-induced change in climate has largely been envisioned as increments of these adaptations intended to avoid disruptions of systems at their current locations. In some places, for some systems, however, vulnerabilities and risks may be so sizeable that they require transformational rather than incremental adaptations. Three classes of transformational adaptations are those that are adopted at a much larger scale, that are truly new to a particular region or resource system, and that transform places and shift locations. We illustrate these with examples drawn from Africa, Europe, and North America. Two conditions set the stage for transformational adaptation to climate change: large vulnerability in certain regions, populations, or resource systems; and severe climate change that overwhelms even robust human use systems. However, anticipatory transformational adaptation may be difficult to implement because of uncertainties about climate change risks and adaptation benefits, the high costs of transformational actions, and institutional and behavioral actions that tend to maintain existing resource systems and policies. Implementing transformational adaptation requires effort to initiate it and then to sustain the effort over time. In initiating transformational adaptation focusing events and multiple stresses are important, combined with local leadership. In sustaining transformational adaptation, it seems likely that supportive social contexts and the availability of acceptable options and resources for actions are key enabling factors. Early steps would include incorporating transformation adaptation into risk management and initiating research to expand the menu of innovative transformational adaptations.","[Travis, William R.] Univ Colorado, Ctr Sci & Technol Policy Res, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Travis, William R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Wilbanks, Thomas J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Wilbanks, Thomas J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Travis, WR (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Ctr Sci & Technol Policy Res, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",william.travis@colorado.edu,,"Travis, William/0000-0002-9197-1317",Community and Regional Resilience Institute,Community and Regional Resilience Institute,We thank Ami Nacu-Schmidt for editorial assistance and the editor and reviewers for alerting us to related work and sharpening our thinking.

This article presents the results of a University of Waterloo and Canadian Council on Ecological Areas survey on the state of climate change adaptation in Canada's protected areas sector, including all federal, provincial, and territorial jurisdictions. Analysis revealed several important findings. First, three quarters of agencies surveyed reported that climate change impacts were already occurring within their respective protected areas systems. Second, climate change was perceived by 94 percent of respondents to be an issue that will substantially alter protected areas policy and planning over the next 25 years. Third, despite the perceived future importance of climate change, little policy, planning, management, or research response is currently being undertaken by most agencies. Overall, with 91 percent of the agencies conceding that they currently do not have the capacity necessary to respond effectively to climate change, the survey revealed an important gap between the perceived salience of climate change and the capacity of protected areas agencies to adapt. Constraints, such as limited financial resources, limited internal capacity, and lack of understanding of real or anticipated climate change impacts, will need to be overcome if Canada's protected areas agencies are to be able to deliver on their various protected areas-and biodiversity-related mandates, such as the perpetual protection of representative elements of Canada's natural heritage, in an era of rapid climate change.","[Lemieux, Christopher J.] Univ Waterloo, Ctr Appl Sci Ontario Protected Areas CASIOPA, Interdisciplinary Ctr Climate Change IC3, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Beechey, Thomas J.] CCEA, Cambridge, England; [Gray, Paul A.] Ontario Minist Nat Resources, Peterborough, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo; Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry,"Lemieux, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Ctr Appl Sci Ontario Protected Areas CASIOPA, Interdisciplinary Ctr Climate Change IC3, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",cjlemieux@uwaterloo.ca,"Scott, Daniel/AAB-6190-2020","Scott, Daniel/0000-0001-7825-9301; Lemieux, Christopher/0000-0002-4780-2006",,,,,70,25,26,2,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3658,,,CAN GEOGR-GEOGR CAN,Can.

Historically, the economies of coastal communities have been based on the exploitation of natural resources, thus shaping its socioeconomic development. This has led to some limitations in the way these communities can now adapt to climate change. In Canada, coastal communities are increasingly dealing with climate change consequences. Sea level rise, coastal erosion, and increasing frequency in storm surges threaten the fragility of both natural and human systems. Various approaches have been used to try to reduce the vulnerability and improve adaptive capacity of communities. One approach, promoted by many organizations including the United Nations, is ecosystem-based adaptation. This approach is part of the series of nature-based solutions that help social-ecological systems become more resilient; by promoting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, this approach also relates to principles of community engagement and supports adaptive governance and social inclusion. This paper describes and analyzes these principles and considers strategies for ensuring community engagement. Combining ecosystem-based adaptation with a strong community engagement can enhance the long-term sustainability of the social-ecological system.","[Vasseur, Liette] Brock Univ, Dept Biol Sci, UNESCO Chair Community Sustainabil Local Global, 1812 Sir Isaac Brock Way, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",Brock University,"Vasseur, L (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Dept Biol Sci, UNESCO Chair Community Sustainabil Local Global, 1812 Sir Isaac Brock Way, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",lvasseur@brocku.ca,,"Vasseur, Liette/0000-0001-7289-2675",,,,,49,4,4,3,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,4,,,,,,,2344,10.3390/su13042344,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13042344,,,10,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QQ9MJ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000624841000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Place based programs that build adaptive capacity are needed. This paper explores the effectiveness of formal institutions in climate change adaptation for agriculture from the perspectives of farmers and institutional communities of practice within two drought-prone areas in Bangladesh. Our findings show that formal institutions via their communities of practice play an important role in building place based capacity for mitigation and adaptation strategies in agriculture. Over-emphasis on technology, lack of acknowledgement of cultural factors and a failure of institutional communities of practice to mediate and create linkages with informal institutional communities of practice remain barriers. We argue that in order for formal institutions to play an ongoing and crucial role in building adaptive agriculture in Bangladesh, they must incorporate cultural mechanisms and build partnerships with more community based informal institutions.

We hypothesized that smallholders' adaptation practices are gendered because of land fragmentation and gendered division of labour. To explore this, we considered sustainable land management practices as a tool for sustainable adaptation and assessed the effect of land management practices deployed and land fragmentation on intra-household time allocation. The results indicate that although land fragmentation increased hours worked by men and women significantly, fragmentation increased the working hours of men more than women. Application of a larger number of sustainable land management practices increases the mean working hours of women, but leaves unaffected the working hours of men, implying that adaptation practices are gender-biased. Therefore, this study can guide land management decisions by pointing out that fragmentation results in long working hours and adaptation practices may disproportionately affect women.","[Cholo, Tesfaye C.; Fleskens, Luuk] Wageningen Univ & Res, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 4, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Cholo, Tesfaye C.] Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Dept Dev Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Peerlings, Jack] Wageningen Univ & Res, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Cholo, TC (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 4, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",tesfayechofana@yahoo.com,"Cholo, Tesfaye Chofana/Q-1339-2019; Fleskens, Luuk/B-4004-2009","Cholo, Tesfaye Chofana/0000-0001-5094-4710; Fleskens, Luuk/0000-0001-6843-0910",,,,,60,6,6,0,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

By using Krejcie and Morgan Table, and stratified sampling, 404 people were selected with optimum allocation. The main data-gathering tool in the research was a questionnaire which its validity and reliability were confirmed by a group of experts and Cronbach's alpha coefficient, respectively. The results of this research show the poor situation of food security in rural households, and it also indicates their low adaptability against climate change.

This instrument, although subject to basis risk and high start-up costs, should reduce costs over traditional agricultural insurance. Multilateral institutions have suggested that weather index insurance could enhance the ability of stakeholders in lower income countries to adapt to climate change. While weather index insurance could have several benefits in this context (e.g. providing a safety net to vulnerable households and price signals regarding the weather risk), climate change impacts increase the price of insurance due to increasing weather risk. Uncertainty about the extent of regional impacts compounds pricing difficulties. Policy recommendations for insurance market development include funding risk assessments, start-up costs and the extreme layer of risk.

The region is considered to be the breadbasket of Mali, providing a substantial amount of the country's food supplies as well as cotton for exchange earnings. The project had two components: modeling how climate change could affect production of cereal and cash crops in southern Mali; and conducting a stakeholder-driven vulnerability and adaptation assessment to identify potential options for addressing current and projected risks to agriculture from climate change. Projected changes in crop yields were based on a previous analysis that was extended for the purposes of this study. The projections suggested that the sensitivity of maize to changing weather conditions is relatively small (generally less than 10% change) under both dry and wet scenarios in 2030 and 2060. White (Irish) potatoes, the primary cash crop, are the most sensitive to changing weather conditions, with yields decreasing under both dry and wet conditions; yields could decrease by about 25% by 2060. Stakeholder workshops, field interviews, and an expert analysis were used to assess current and future climate-related vulnerability and to identify potential adaptation options. The main focus of the assessment was farmers in a village of about 3,000 people in the Sikasso region that practiced a rice-potato rotation system typical to the region. The farmers emphasized adaptation measures that require outside financial and technical assistance, for example installation of a water gate that would retain more water in the inland valley and increase the water table to flood rice fields during the rainy season and for furrow irrigation of potatoes during the dry season. Adaptations emphasized by both the farmers and representatives of regional technical services were crop diversification and germplasm improvement; soil and water management; access to equipment (plows, carts, oxen, and improved stoves); credit stockage villageois (CSV); and fertilizer.","[Ebi, Kristie L.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Padgham, Jonathan] START Secretariat, Washington, DC USA; [Doumbia, Mamadou; Kergna, Alpha] IER, Bamako, Mali; [Smith, Joel] Stratus Consulting Inc, Boulder, CO USA; [Butt, Tanveer] Amer Mortgage, Phoenix, AZ USA; [McCarl, Bruce] Texas A&M, College Stn, TX USA",Carnegie Institution for Science; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Ebi, KL (corresponding author), Carnegie Inst Sci, 260 Panama St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",krisebi@stanford.edu,"McCarl, Bruce A/E-9445-2011",,,,,,13,27,27,0,62,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The paper used data collected through a series of participatory methods including focus group discussions, questionnaire surveys and key informant interviews in 4 farming communities with different socioeconomic backgrounds in the Bongo and Talensi-Nabdam Districts of the Upper East Region. Results showed that farmers' adaptation to climate change and variability may be categorized under agricultural, water management, communal pooling and livelihood diversification techniques. Specific livelihood diversification adaptation practices identified in the study communities include charcoal or fuel wood sales, temporal and permanent migration to urban areas in search of non-existing jobs. Communal pooling, involving joint ownership and sharing of wealth, labor or incomes across households, is not widely practiced and should be enhanced. The findings showed that male and female farmers may engage in different set of adaptation practices to cope with climate change. Further, the results showed that farmers, especially female farmers, were constrained by a lack of property rights of farmlands, lack of credit facilities and lack of access to irrigation facilities, inadequate climate change information and inadequate seeds for planting. The paper recommends that farmers should be encouraged to form farmer-based associations to network socially, access credit facilities, land, insurance products, extension services and training to empower communities and women. Fostering peer exchange of information between communities will ensure best practices, and lessons learnt are shared and scaled-up. This paper contributes to the literature on mechanisms employed by farmers in dryland farming systems to cope with climate change and variability.","[Kumasi, Tyhra Carolyn] PMB KIA, Community Water & Sanitat Agcy, Accra, Ghana; [Antwi-Agyei, Philip] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Obiri-Danso, Kwasi] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Dept Theoret & Appl Biol, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Kumasi, TC (corresponding author), PMB KIA, Community Water & Sanitat Agcy, Accra, Ghana.",tyhracarolynkumasi@gmail.com,"Antwi-Agyei, Philip/AAI-7392-2020; Kumasi, Tyhra Carolyn/AGP-3190-2022","Antwi-Agyei, Philip/0000-0002-8599-474X; Kumasi, Tyhra Carolyn/0000-0001-7178-7865","Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the District Assemblies and Traditional rulers in the communities from the Upper East Region; Center for International Governance Innovation African Initiative Grant Research","Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the District Assemblies and Traditional rulers in the communities from the Upper East Region; Center for International Governance Innovation African Initiative Grant Research","The authors acknowledge the support and collaboration of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the District Assemblies and Traditional rulers in the communities from the Upper East Region.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a documentary analysis, the authors examined the media coverage of droughts and floods from 2003 to 2013 with concomitant official reports. Findings - The results indicate that although media coverage conveys the direct impact of floods and droughts on society, it underemphasizes the importance of risk management activities. Moreover, the private sector rarely engages in risk management and mitigation activities, despite the documented supply chain disruptions. Research limitations/implications - This study focuses solely on media coverage as provided by wide-circulation newspaper in Brazil and would benefit by being extended to all media platforms. Practical implications - The results highlight the need for private sector involvement in risk management activities to facilitate the adaptation to climate change. Social implications - The study reveals the deficiency of existing reports and lack of awareness regarding EWE. Originality/value - The study contributes by focusing on climate awareness and how society can adapt to climate change, as well as how businesses can improve supply chain operations to facilitate smoother risk management.","[de Brito, Renata Peregrino] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, IAG Business Sch, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [de Souza Miguel, Priscila Laczynski; Farias Pereira, Susana Carla] Fundacao Getulio Vargas Escola Adm Empresas Sao P, FGV EAESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"de Brito, RP (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, IAG Business Sch, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",renata.brito@iag.puc-rio.br,"Brito, Renata/I-3796-2016","Brito, Renata/0000-0002-0624-7915; Farias Pereira, Susana Carla/0000-0002-3952-7489",,,,,53,0,0,1,9,"UNIV SAO PAULO, FAC ECONOMIA",SAO PAULO SP,"TECSI LAB TECNOLOGIA E SISTEMAS INFORMACAO, AV PROF LUCIANO GUALBERTO., 908 FEA 3, SALA F184, SAO PAULO SP, 05508-900, BRAZIL",2531-0488,,,RAUSP MANAG J,RAUSP Manag.

This paper presents a method for assessing impacts and adaptation strategies to global change in a river basin system at different temporal horizons using a hydro-economic model. First, a multiobjective analysis selects climate change projections based on the fitting of the climate models to the historical conditions for the historical period. Inflows for climate change scenarios are generated using calibrated rainfall-runoff models, perturbing observed meteorological time series according to the projected anomalies in mean and standard deviation. Demands are projected for the different scenarios and characterized using economic demand curves. With the new water resource and demand scenarios, the impact of global change on system performance is assessed using a hydro-economic model with reliability and economic indices. A new economic loss index is defined to assess the economic equity of the system. Selected adaptation strategies are simulated to compare performance with the business-as-usual scenario. The approach is applied to the Jucar River water resource system, in eastern Spain, using climate projections from the European Union (EU) ENSEMBLES project. Results show that the system is vulnerable to global change, especially over the long term, and that adaptation actions can save Euro3-65million/year.

The ordeal of adaptation will involve nothing less than bending humanity's will and the arc of history in order to respect natural limits that have been largely ignored during the past two centuries of political economic carbon addiction. The mission of adaptation is to achieve future political economies that promote rather than diminish human flourishing by respecting ecological limits, managing without unsustainable economic growth, but still offering social plenitude in other forms. The fine details and directions of climate adaptation cannot be foreseen. But initial guiding conceptions can be developed now as resources for ongoing discussion and debate.

Nascent literature on climate-related relocation draws on findings and experience from development-forced displacement and resettlement (DFDR), yet DFDR contexts lack a key factor central in climate-related relocation: uncertain environmental change. The article therefore examines how planning and implementing authorities address environmental uncertainty and what implications this may have for relocation outcomes. In the case of coastal erosion and related relocation schemes in Central Vietnam, linked to climate change, the article focuses on responsible government institutions. It looks at the governmental practices they employ to manage environmental change and related relocation. Based on field study, in-depth interviews, and document and policy review, the article finds that the sub-national institutions responsible for relocation attempted to make environmental change legible through quantifying and standardizing fluctuations in coastal erosion. These technical approaches carried through planning and implementation. They contributed to rigid relocation programmes in which households' input and adaptive outcomes were limited and other political goals were realized through territorialization. The findings support literature on the highly political nature of adaptation and challenge the prominence of technical approaches to adaptation.","[Lindegaard, Lily Salloum] Danish Inst Int Studies, Nat Resources & Dev Res Unit, Ostbanegade 117, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies,"Lindegaard, LS (corresponding author), Danish Inst Int Studies, Nat Resources & Dev Res Unit, Ostbanegade 117, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",liln@diis.dk,"Gillette, Amber/AAD-9560-2020",,,,,,56,9,9,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

However, global adaptation costs and adaptation limits in agriculture are understudied. Here, we estimate the global adaptation cost and residual damage (climate change impacts after adaptation) for maize, rice, wheat and soybean using a global gridded crop model and empirical production cost models. Producers require additional expenditures under climate change to produce the same crop yields that would be achieved without climate change, and this difference is defined as the adaptation cost. On a decadal mean basis, the undiscounted global cost of climate change (adaptation cost plus residual damage) for the crops are projected to increase with warming from 63 US$ billion (B) at 1.5 degrees C to $80 B at 2 degrees C and to $128 B at 3 degrees C per year. The adaptation cost gradually increases in absolute terms, but the share decreases from 84% of the cost of climate change ($53 B) at 1.5 degrees C to 76% ($61 B) at 2 degrees C and to 61% ($78 B) at 3 degrees C. The residual damage increases from 16% ($10 B) at 1.5 degrees C to 24 % ($19 B) at 2 degrees C and to 39% ($50 B) at 3 degrees C. Once maintaining yields becomes difficult due to the biological limits of crops or decreased profitability, producers can no longer bear adaptation costs, and residual damages increase. Our estimates offer a basis to identify the gap between global adaptation needs and the funds available for adaptation.","[Iizumi, Toshichika; Shen, Zhihong; Kim, Wonsik; Nishimori, Motoki] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Furuya, Jun] Japan Int Res Ctr Agr Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058686, Japan; [Koizumi, Tatsuji; Furuhashi, Gen] Minist Agr Forestry & Fisheries, Policy Res Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1000013, Japan",National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan; Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences; Ministry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan,"Iizumi, T (corresponding author), Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan.",iizumit@affrc.go.jp,"古家, 淳/GPC-5902-2022",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan [S-14, 2-2005]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18H02317]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18H02317] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","T.I. thanks Shinichiro Fujimori and Tomoko Hasegawa for their comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

Specifically, agriculture has increasingly become a key sector for adaptation and mitigation initiatives that address climate change and help ensure food security for a growing global population. Climate change and agricultural outcomes influence our ability to reach targets for at least seven of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. By 2015, 103 nations had committed themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, while 102 countries had prioritized agriculture in their adaptation agenda. Adaptation and mitigation actions within agriculture still receive insufficient support across scales, from local to international level. This paper reviews a series of climate change adaptation and mitigation options that can support increased production, production efficiency and greater food security for 9 billion people by 2050. Climate-smart agriculture can help foster synergies between productivity, adaptation, and mitigation, although trade-offs may be equally apparent. This study highlights the importance of identifying and exploiting those synergies in the context of Nationally Determined Contributions. Finally, the paper points out that keeping global warming to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 requires going beyond the agriculture sector and exploring possibilities with respect to reduced emissions from deforestation, food loss, and waste, as well as from rethinking human diets.","[Loboguerrero, Ana Maria; Campbell, Bruce M.; Cooper, Peter J.

Credit facilities (p < 0.05), ownership of farmland (p < 0.01), household size (p < 0.01), years of schooling (p < 0.01), household asset (p < 0.01), and location (p < 0.05) also had a significant but mixed effect on CCA choices. PSM revealed that farming households that adopted CCA strategies had 9% higher food security levels than non-adopters. Furthermore, the result of the DID model revealed a significant positive effect of CCA on household food security (beta = 5.93, p < 0.01). It was recommended that education and provision of quality advisory services to farmers is crucial to foster the implementation of CCA options.","[Ogunpaimo, Oyinlola Rafiat] TEAGASC, Rural Econ & Dev Programme, Mellows Campus, Athenry H65 R718, Galway, Ireland; [Ogunpaimo, Oyinlola Rafiat; Surajudeen, Jolaosho] Fed Univ Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Farm Management, Abeokuta 112251, Nigeria; [Oyetunde-Usman, Zainab] Univ Greenwich, Natl Resources Inst, Chatham ME4 4TB, England","Teagasc; University of Agriculture, Abeokuta; University of Greenwich","Ogunpaimo, OR (corresponding author), TEAGASC, Rural Econ & Dev Programme, Mellows Campus, Athenry H65 R718, Galway, Ireland.;Ogunpaimo, OR (corresponding author), Fed Univ Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Farm Management, Abeokuta 112251, Nigeria.",oyinlolaadams@gmail.com; zainabus23@gmail.com; surajudeenjolaosho@yahoo.com,,"OGUNPAIMO, OYINLOLA/0000-0002-1877-2020; Oyetunde-Usman, Zainab/0000-0003-1602-4819",,,,,93,6,6,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,3,,,,,,,1444,10.3390/su13031444,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13031444,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QD6FX,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000615612600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Focus group discussions and stakeholder consultations were used to supplement survey data collected from 537 wheat smallholder producers. We performed an impact evaluation analysis by combining endogenous switching regression (ESR) with propensity score matching (PSM) model to address the issue of unobserved biases. The study indicates that gender, farmers' education level, farming experience, cooperative membership, access to extension services, and weather information were significant determinants of smallholder household decisions for climate change adaptation practices. Both ESR and PSM models revealed that smallholder farmers' adaptation practices significantly enhanced wheat yield by 34.35%. This implies that climate-smart practices adopted by smallholder farmers are vital for improving and sustaining wheat yield. Thus, our findings suggest that policy actions should consider existing smallholder farmers' knowledge and practices in policy actions aimed at mitigating climate change impacts to sustain agricultural productivity.","[Sedebo, Dessalegn A.; Li, Gucheng; Ahiakpa, John K.; Anran, Zhang] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Sedebo, Dessalegn A.; Ahiakpa, John K.] Org African Acad Doctors, OAAD, Kamiti Rd, Nairobi, Kenya; [Sedebo, Dessalegn A.] Policy Study Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Etea, Bekele G.; Abebe, Kidane A.] Ambo Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Ambo, Ethiopia; [Ahiakpa, John K.] Res Desk Consulting Ltd, Kwabenya Accra, Ghana; [Arega, Yibeltal] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Bioinformat, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Arega, Yibeltal] NYU, Sch Med, New York, NY USA",Huazhong Agricultural University; Ambo University; Huazhong Agricultural University; New York University,"Sedebo, DA; Li, GC (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;Sedebo, DA (corresponding author), Org African Acad Doctors, OAAD, Kamiti Rd, Nairobi, Kenya.",anshiso39@gmail.com; lgcabc@mail.hzau.edu.cn,"Ahiakpa, Kojo/O-7768-2014","Ahiakpa, Kojo/0000-0002-1130-8700; Sedebo, Dessalegn Anshiso/0000-0002-3122-0511",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71873050],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71873050].,,84,3,3,9,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This is particularly true in the climate change adaptation field, and has prompted the development of a number of frameworks aiming to characterize system vulnerabilities and identify robust alternatives. One such methodology is robust decision making (RDM), which uses simulation models to assess how strategies perform over many plausible conditions and then identifies and characterizes those where the strategy fails in a process termed scenario discovery. While many of the problems to which RDM has been applied are characterized by multiple objectives, research to date has provided little insight into how treatment of multiple criteria impacts the failure scenarios identified. In this research, we compare different methods for incorporating multiple objectives into the scenario discovery process to evaluate how they impact the resulting failure scenarios. We use the Lake Tana basin in Ethiopia as a case study, where climatic and environmental uncertainties could impact multiple planned water infrastructure projects, and find that failure scenarios may vary depending on the method used to aggregate multiple criteria. Common methods used to convert multiple attributes into a single utility score can obscure connections between failure scenarios and system performance, limiting the information provided to support decision making. Applying scenario discovery over each performance metric separately provides more nuanced information regarding the relative sensitivity of the objectives to different uncertain parameters, leading to clearer insights on measures that could be taken to improve system robustness and areas where additional research might prove useful.","[Shortridge, Julie E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Engn, 3400 N Charles St,Ames Hall 317, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Guikema, Seth D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Johns Hopkins University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Shortridge, JE (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Engn, 3400 N Charles St,Ames Hall 317, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",jshortridge@jhu.edu,,"Shortridge, Julie/0000-0003-1612-5740","National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; National Science Foundation [1149460, 1069213, 1331399]",National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was supported by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship and by National Science Foundation Grants 1149460 (CMMI), 1069213 (IGERT), and 1331399 (SEES).

The average weighted index method was used to construct individual indices. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and paired sample t-tests were used to identify differences between formal and informal settlements. Results showed that households of informal settlements had limited coping capacities, making them more vulnerable to heatwave impacts.

While an extensive foundation of empirical knowledge on urban climate adaptation has accumulated over the last decade, our image of institutional adaptation continues to be dominated by a focus on planning. Whilst understandable, this can obscure a fuller range of areas in which institutional adaptation to climate change is being pursued. Furthermore, methodological path dependency in large-N analysis via a common focus on analyzing formal planning documents risks a skewed perspective as such documents may only offer a partial view. Building on the rich range of work to date assessing climate adaptation in cities, and notwithstanding continued major gaps such as in small-medium cities, we now need to find ways to examine the diversity of institutional adaptation occurring in practice, and to comparatively draw on the situated interpretive knowledge of case experts within individual cities to do so. With this aim in mind, this paper explores institutional adaptation in a specific domain (urban water) in a sample of 96 major cities across six continents through a survey of 319 case experts, examining the diversity of institutional adaptation across contexts and exploratively probing its drivers. Findings show that multiple forms of institutional adaptation are being jointly pursued in cities across all continents, leaning towards 'softer' rather than 'harder' forms, but nonetheless revealing a wide range of activity. Patterns in drivers suggest a political explanation for institutional adaptation (e.g. involving change agents and political pressure) rather than a rational one (e.g. involving response to climate-related risks and/or extreme events). Overall, there is a need to combine parsimony with expanded interpretive sensibility in advancing largeN research on institutional adaptation diversity in comparative perspective.","[Patterson, James J.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Vening Meineszgebouw A,Princetonlaan 8A, NL-3585 CB Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Patterson, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Vening Meineszgebouw A,Princetonlaan 8A, NL-3585 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.j.patterson@uu.nl,,"Patterson, James/0000-0002-4849-7613",European Union [659065],European Union(European Commission),"This research received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 659065 (Dr. James Patterson).

In mountainous regions, protection against gravitational hazards is of particular importance. By preventing soil erosion and functioning as natural barriers and buffers, forests protect the population and infrastructure against avalanches and rock falls. The higher the forests' capacity to regulate and withstand external disturbances and adverse effects the higher the insurance value they provide. To operationalize the insurance value approach and to integrate it into climate change adaptation and disaster risk management, information about supply and demand of this ecosystem service is required. While assessing the capacity of forests to provide protection services has been a longstanding research focus, knowledge about the population's demand for insurance services provided by forests is still lacking. Our study analyzes the preferences of beneficiaries of such services. We conducted a choice experiment in several Swiss municipalities exposed to avalanches and rock falls, accounting for different spatial and institutional contexts. We found that households are willing to pay a significant amount for forest management that enhances forests' insurance services and reduces natural hazard risks. The results help to inform decision making in natural hazard management, and represent a further step towards operationalizing the insurance value of ecosystems.","[Unterberger, Christian; Olschewski, Roland] WSL Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res En, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland",,"Unterberger, C (corresponding author), WSL Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res En, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Unterberger, Christian/0000-0001-8367-231X",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [NRP 73],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) within the framework of the National Research Programme Sustainable Economy: resource-friendly, future-oriented, innovative (NRP 73 -http://www.nrp73.ch/en).",,50,4,4,2,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

It is likely to have a substantial effect on fishers' income and food security. This study aims to estimate the impact of adaptation strategies on fishers' income and their household's food security. Data were collected from small-scale fishers' households, which own a fishing boat smaller or equal to five gross tonnages (GT). The study sites were the two coastal regions of Malang and Probolinggo in East Java, Indonesia, due to the meager socioeconomic resources caused by climate change. A probit regression model was used to determine the factors influencing the fishers' adaptation. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to evaluate the impact of the adaptation strategies on income and food security. Food security was measured by food consumption score (FCS). The findings indicated that participation in the fishers' group affected adaptation strategies significantly, and so did the access to credit and climate information. Also, PSM showed that the adaptation strategies had a positive and significant impact on fishers' income and food security. Those who applied the adaptation strategies had a higher income and FCS than those who did not. This finding implies that the fishery sector's adaptation strategies can have significant expansion outcome and reduce exposure to risks posed by climate change. Therefore, the arrangement of more climate change adaptation strategies should be promoted by the government for small-scale fishers in Indonesia.","[Rahman, Moh Shadiqur] Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Trop Agr & Int Cooperat, Pingtung 912, Taiwan; [Toiba, Hery] Brawijaya Univ, Fac Agr, Agr Socioecon Dept, Malang 65145, Indonesia; [Huang, Wen-Chi] Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agribusiness Management, Pingtung 912, Taiwan",National Pingtung University Science & Technology; Brawijaya University; National Pingtung University Science & Technology,"Toiba, H (corresponding author), Brawijaya Univ, Fac Agr, Agr Socioecon Dept, Malang 65145, Indonesia.;Huang, WC (corresponding author), Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agribusiness Management, Pingtung 912, Taiwan.",mohsodiqurrahman@gmail.com; htoiba@ub.ac.id; wenchi@mail.npust.edu.tw,"Rahman, Moh Shadiqur/AAZ-1338-2021; Huang, Wen-Chi/B-4136-2014; Toiba, Hery/GXG-2224-2022; Toiba, Hery/AFK-1090-2022; Toiba, Hery/AAF-8272-2022","Rahman, Moh Shadiqur/0000-0002-4275-3196; Huang, Wen-Chi/0000-0003-4427-9325; Toiba, Hery/0000-0003-3816-9066; Toiba, Hery/0000-0003-3816-9066",,,,,70,6,6,2,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,14,,,,,,,7905,10.3390/su13147905,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13147905,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TO4QY,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000676899500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results show that: (1) overall, most local perception of climate change and its impacts correspond with patterns of observed climate change from climate records; (2) residents' perception intensity of climate change shows a highly significant correlation with their age and villages' elevation gradient. By contrast, residents' perception intensity to climate change impacts has a significant correlation with their age, whereas their perception intensity to adapt to climate change impacts highly correlates with villages elevation on the whole; (3) over half of the respondents think that climate change did not affect crop' growing and their yields, but residents hold a favorable opinion to crop insect pests' increasing slightly and crop growth period's extending. Meanwhile, almost all respondents believe that climate change seriously affected mountain tourism economy, their living and spiritual world, and hold a higher recognition attitude; (4) because of persistent drought in recent years, mountain dwellers are forced to adjust industrial structure, develop water-saving agriculture economy, participate actively in mountain tourism, and work outside the home in order to adapt to climate change impacts and make up for meager farm income.

Here, we review the concepts of adaptation, synthesis and integration and apply them to the case study of coastal wetlands in South East Queensland, Australia. The distribution and condition of coastal wetlands will change as climate changes. This will create conservation challenges and economic costs, but these can be minimised by drawing from a broad sectoral perspective in undertaking adaptation planning and by ensuring integration into policy. Our review indicates that adaptations to sea level rise that are focussed on wetland and biodiversity conservation are likely to have impacts for urbanisation patterns. Planning regulations that provide spatial buffering around wetlands may give rise to more compact urban forms that may lead to reductions in the cost of defence against sea level rise, reduce energy usage per person and provide more green space. However, more compact urban forms could exacerbate heat island effects and place greater burden on the economically disadvantaged as, for example, single-family homes become more expensive. Planning for climate change needs to balance these equity and cross-sectoral issues in order to reduce the likelihood of unforeseen negative consequences.","[Burley, Jennifer G.; McAllister, Ryan R.

WEAP is an integrated rainfall/runoff, water resources systems modeling framework that can be forced directly from time series of climatic input to estimate water supplies (watershed runoff) and demands (crop evapotranspiration). We applied the model to evaluate the hydrologic implications of 12 climate change scenarios as well as the water management ramifications of the implied hydrologic changes. In addition to evaluating the impacts of climate change with current operations, the model also assessed the impacts of changing agricultural management strategies in response to a changing climate. These adaptation strategies included improvements in irrigation technology and shifts in cropping patterns towards higher valued crops. Model simulations suggested that increasing agricultural demand under climate change brought on by increasing temperature will place additional stress on the water system, such that some water users will experience a decrease in water supply reliability. The study indicated that adaptation strategies may ease the burden on the water management system. However, offsetting water demands through these approaches will not be enough to fully combat the impacts of climate change on water management. To adequately address the impacts of climate change, adaptation strategies will have to include fundamental changes in the ways in which the water management system is operated.","[Joyce, Brian A.; Mehta, Vishal K.; Purkey, David R.] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Dale, Larry L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hanemann, Michael] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Stockholm Environment Institute; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Joyce, BA (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden.",brian.joyce@sei-us.org; vishal.mehta@sei-us.org; dpurkey@sei-us.org; lldale@lbl.gov; Hanemann@berkeley.edu,"Parween, Shama/AFQ-4232-2022",,,,,,15,44,44,3,70,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

This study investigates how cross-level differences may be a potential barrier or enabler of adaptation activities. It focuses on five potentially divisive issues: the level support for adaptation planning, adaptation goals, preferences among adaptation strategies, the desired role for the state vis a vis local leadership/control in supporting adaptation, and elements to include state level adaptation plans. The analysis is based on 138 questionnaires from coastal planners (local, state, and NGO) in Alaska, Florida, and Maryland. Findings reveal topics of agreement and disagreement in CCA planning across levels of management and study areas. State and NGO planners are significantly more likely than local planners to favor near-term planning activities and allocation of resources. This mismatch in timing is a potential barrier for adaptation. There were also significant differences in priorities motivating the development of plans among state, local, and NGO planners, though some differences may provide opportunities for the negotiation of planning priorities that have positive synergies. Although most planners indicated the state should play some role in local-level CCA planning, local planners desired a significantly lower level of involvement - a key threshold difference that represents the common and long-standing tension between state-level regulation and the desire for local control. The high proportion of all planners who have started to consider the development of CCA strategies and the desire for state-level adaptation plans to include support for risk and vulnerability assessments highlight potential synergies and opportunities to increase adaptive capacity and implement adaptation strategies. Few differences were detected among preferences for adaptation options. Analysis across multiple study areas provides additional insight into the stability and variation of cross-level differences.

Some conservation practitioners are beginning to develop, test, and implement new approaches that are designed to deal with climate change. We devised four basic tenets that are essential in climate-change adaptation for conservation: protect adequate and appropriate space, reduce nonclimate stresses, use adaptive management to implement and test climate-change adaptation strategies, and work to reduce the rate and extent of climate change to reduce overall risk. To illustrate how this approach applies in the real world, we explored case studies of coral reefs in the Florida Keys; mangrove forests in Fiji, Tanzania, and Cameroon; sea-level rise and sea turtles in the Caribbean; tigers in the Sundarbans of India; and national planning in Madagascar. Through implementation of these tenets conservation efforts in each of these regions can be made more robust in the face of climate change.

Evidence from analyses of households' climate hazard exposure and adaptation actors in SE Nigeria,MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Remittances; Climate hazards; Climate financing; Adaptation actors; Households; Developing countries,INNOVATION,"Migrant remittances are potentially significant sources of funding for climate change adaptation and resilience building in developing countries. However, very little is understood about the linkages between climate actions and remittances at the household level. It is not clear how remittances can affect households' responses to climate change. This paper presents evidence from analyses of the associations between remittances to households, their climate hazard exposure, and adaptation actors. It uses concurrent data on international remittances receipts, three climate change related hazards (flooding, intense and irregular rainfall), and main adaptation actors (self/family, community, government, and NGOs) from over 600 households in South Eastern Nigeria. The results showed that household incidence of remittances is low (15%) while exposure to climate hazards is higher (flooding: 41.2%, intense rainfall: 47.1%, irregular rainfall: 29.9%). Nominal (contingency coefficient) associations between remittances and household climate hazard exposure and remittances and household adaptation actors were mostly moderate and insignificant. Therefore, households that received remittances and those that did not were not significantly different in terms of their exposure to climate hazard and main actors in climate adaptation. Self/families were the main actors in household climate actions. Governments and NGO actors were less prominent. The results suggest that unregulated remittances have limited impact on household climate hazard exposure and adaptive actions. However, there are indications that the contribution of remittances to financing climate adaptation may be enhanced by addressing issues with cost of remitting and remittee understanding of climate change to increase remittances volumes, incidence, and use.","[Maduekwe, Nnamdi Ifeanyi] Natl Populat Commiss, Abuja, Nigeria; [Adesina, Francis A.] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Geog, Ife, Nigeria",Obafemi Awolowo University,"Maduekwe, NI (corresponding author), Natl Populat Commiss, Abuja, Nigeria.",nnam6p@yahoo.com; faadesin@yahoo.com,,"Maduekwe, Nnamdi/0000-0003-1917-6498",,,,,62,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Adaptation to its impacts ought to be a key focus for planning and policymaking in highly vulnerable countries like Australia. This responsibility, however, has been largely left to local councils with mixed results. This leaves substantial parts of the population at risk where adaptation plans are lacking. Even worse, since the impacts of climate change do not respect jurisdictional boundaries, there is a spill-over risk where good adaptation planning by one council may be undermined by the lack of action in an adjacent council. These risks can be reduced if state and federal governments provide more consistent support and guidance. This paper takes an integrated approach in comparing the relevant legislation, policies, plans, and strategies related to coastal management across the national and state/territory jurisdictions in Australia. The findings indicate that there are major differences, with some states (South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, and Queensland) having more detailed policies and plans for addressing sea level rise and coastal flooding. The findings have implications beyond Australia, particularly for those countries with more devolved or federal systems of government, and provide key lessons for adaptation to climate change. Key policy insights In the absence of national guidance and leadership, climate adaptation responses will remain uneven across jurisdictions placing more of the population at risk and undermining what adaptation plans there are. National, state, and territory policies or plans are more effective if they are consistent over time, but they are undermined by reversals when governments change between political parties that have widely varying views on climate change. Effective long-term adaptation policymaking and planning therefore require a bipartisan commitment and consistent political will across the major political parties to prioritize the problem and commit significant public resources to a response.","[Dedekorkut-Howes, Aysin; Torabi, Elnaz; Howes, Michael] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast, Australia; [Dedekorkut-Howes, Aysin; Torabi, Elnaz; Howes, Michael] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Intitute, Gold Coast, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Dedekorkut-Howes, A (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast, Australia.",a.dedekorkut@griffith.edu.au,"Dedekorkut-Howes, Aysin/V-5636-2018; Torabi, Elnaz/V-3585-2018","Dedekorkut-Howes, Aysin/0000-0002-3844-4796; Torabi, Elnaz/0000-0003-4578-8199; Howes, Michael/0000-0003-1102-1483","Griffith University, School of Environment","Griffith University, School of Environment","This work was supported by Griffith University, School of Environment.",,77,11,11,1,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

A cross sectional survey using semi-structured questionnaires, focus group discussions and key informant interviews were employed among 183 randomly selected households. The ecosystem-based adaptations (EbAs) to perceived drought impacts were characterised basing on ecosystem services, adaptation benefits to drought and livelihood improvement categories unveiling the different proportions of each EbA under each category. Water shortage and intense heat were the major perceived drought impacts. The use of drought resistant shade trees, water reservoirs and dams, and alternative ecosystem-based livelihoods were the majorly utilised EbAs. The alternative ecosystem-based livelihoods were the mostly used EbA dominating all the three categories. The utilisation of drought resistant shade trees dominated the ecosystem services and adaptation benefits categories, whereas the use of water reservoirs and dams were the mostly used EbA for livelihood improvement. These EbAs should be incorporated in climate-change adaptation policies and initiatives, while considering their subsequent dominating categories to enhance farmers' resilience.","[Nanfuka, Susan; Egeru, Anthony] Makerere Univ, Dept Environm Management, Kampala, Uganda; [Mfitumukiza, David] Makerere Univ, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Climat Sci, Kampala, Uganda; [Egeru, Anthony] Reg Univ Forum Capac Bldg Agr, Kampala, Uganda",Makerere University; Makerere University,"Nanfuka, S (corresponding author), Makerere Univ, Dept Environm Management, Kampala, Uganda.",n.susan143@gmail.com,"Nanfuka, Susan/GWC-6291-2022","Mfitumukiza, David/0000-0001-7399-004X; Nanfuka, Susan/0000-0001-7595-7956",USAID,USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This study was financially supported by USAID and implemented through FHI 360 and Makerere University Centre for Climate Change Research and Innovations (MUCCRI).

Consequently, also in climatic change projections, it is essential both to recognise characteristics in breeding programs that can lead to drought tolerance and to reduce the time needed to observe variations of these traits on crop yield. Moreover, changing in management strategies could improve crop adaptation to climate change, not considered in this approach. Crop growth models can assist breeding research in identifying these traits. The CropSyst model was parameterized for durum wheat cultivated in Southern Italy: crop characteristics were analyzed, development (grain filling duration and phenologic response to water stress), canopy expansion (specific leaf area, leaf duration and ratio between leaf and stem) and water uptake (root length). Model sensitivity was evaluated varying one parameter at a time and changing the value by +/-5, +/-10 and +/-20% of calibrated values. Wheat was simulated with past real daily climatic data (55 years, from 1952 to 2006) and future daily climatic data predicted with an HADCM3 global climatic model (100 years, from 2000 to 2100) where an average air temperature increase of +2 degrees C is expected as well as a CO2 concentration of 550 ppm (IPCC, A2 scenario). Leaf area duration and specific leaf area proved to be the parameters with the greatest impacts on wheat yield, with changing in wheat yield from -20 to16% and from -38 to 35% respectively as consequence to variation for these parameters oscillating between 20 and 20%. The ratio between the leaf and the stem biomass accumulation was inversely and linearly related to grain yield. Lengthening or shortening the grain filling duration did not seem to provide benefits in term of grain yield. The non-response in term of grain yield to water stress highlights that the wheat crop was optimized yet in Mediterranean environment in order to maintain production stability in drought conditions which could accelerate different crop phenological stages. The variation of maximum root depth (from 0.8 to 1.2 m) did not result in any significant variation in grain yield. The changes of crop morphology could also enhance climate change adaptation.","[Garofalo, Pasquale; Rinaldi, Michele] Unita Ric & Sistemi Colturali Ambienti Caldoaridi, Bari, Italy; [Rinaldi, Michele] Ctr Ric Cerealicoltura, Foggia, Italy",,"Garofalo, P (corresponding author), Unita Ric & Sistemi Colturali Ambienti Caldoaridi, Bari, Italy.",garofalopasquale@virgilio.it,"Rinaldi, Michele/AAE-7576-2019; Rinaldi, Michele/H-9251-2012","Rinaldi, Michele/0000-0002-1211-8052; Rinaldi, Michele/0000-0002-1211-8052","Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Policies [209/7393/05, 28373/7303/09]; Italian Ministry of Finance and Economy; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Italian Ministry of Environment and Territory; Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies [285 - 20/02/2006]","Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Policies; Italian Ministry of Finance and Economy; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Italian Ministry of Environment and Territory; Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies","This work has been partly supported by Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Policies contract n. 209/7393/05 and n. 28373/7303/09 (AQUATER Project, Coordinator: dr.

It combines insights from a theoretical model of North-to-South transfers with the findings of a calibrated dynamic multi-region multi-sector computable general equilibrium model that takes into account the impacts of climate change and the adaptation to it. Assessing the effects of adaptation funding indicates that funding of adaptation in developing regions can be Pareto-improving. Not only will developing regions, which do not own sufficient resources for adapting optimally, profit from receiving adaptation funding. Terms-of-trade improvements in the high and middle income donor countries can dominate transfer costs and hence lead to a net-welfare gain in almost any developed region except North America. As such our consideration adds a new argument for financially supporting adaptation in the developing world besides the well-known ones such as fairness and incentives for participation in a global climate treaty.

Recent research on adaptation in developing and developed countries argues that the measures of such fairness cannot be captured by standard metrics of vulnerability and should be situated in the milieu of people's daily lives and temporalities. Yet there is little empirical evidence to support this theoretical argument. This paper describes a method, and presents findings from research that aimed to understand and classify the lived values of four marginal rural communities at risk of sea-level rise in Australia to inform adaptation planning and implementation. Our research finds that there are at least five types of primary residents and second homeowners attached to these four low-lying coastal communities. Some of these residents are more likely to be amenable to relocation if their needs for affordable living and belonging are met. For others, there may be little that can be done to compensate for the loss of place attachment, and implementing a measured approach that provides them time to adapt to the idea of change and form connections to new places is the best that could be achieved. We discuss the implications of place-specific and people centric values for achieving fair adaptation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental flow assessment and systematic conservation planning have evolved separately in respective aquatic and terrestrial realms, and both are central to freshwater conservation and can inform integrated water resources management. Integrating these two approaches is mutually beneficial. Environmental flow assessment considers dynamic flow regimes, measuring social, economic and ecological costs of development scenarios. Conservation planning systematically produces different conservation scenarios that can be used in assessing these costs. Integration also presents opportunities to examine impacts of climate change on conservation of freshwater ecosystems. We review progress in environmental flow assessment and freshwater conservation planning, exploring the mutual benefits of integration and potential ways that this can be achieved. Integration can be accomplished by using freshwater conservation planning outputs to develop conservation scenarios for assessment against different scenarios, and by assessing the extent to which each scenario achieves conservation targets.

Taking into account values and perceptions of affected actors and decision-makers is a fundamental and necessary prerequisite for a more effective, legitimate and fair climate policy and has not been given the necessary consideration. This paper uses Q methodology to explore such values in the context of climate change in the Ebro Delta, in Catalonia. The delta is an area highly vulnerable to climate change, mainly because of its topography, but also as a result of human intervention. The study identifies five discourses on vulnerability and adaptation held by delta inhabitants and decision-makers. Social justice and security comprise shared values behind arguments; however, discourses differ in their approaches concerning the proper scale for applying these values with adaptation policy. Our results serve to improve policy dialogue and suggest that the adaptation policy agenda should focus on pursuing consensus over the crucial issue of scale. Our use of Q methodology to advance the incipient literature on value-based climate change vulnerability and adaptation is innovative and suggests that the approach has a capacity to contribute to advancing deliberative environmental decision-making on adaptation.

Consequently, increasing importance is given to disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) in global governance. The projected global warming at 1.5 oC and the climate variability that the Philippine archipelago experiences make DRR-CCA the key priorities of both the national and local government units. In this study, we assessed and measured the degree of mainstreaming of DRR-CCA in the comprehensive development plans (CDPs) of the five component cities in the province of Nueva Ecija in the Philippines. These are among the areas in Central Luzon that are susceptible to hydrometeorological and geologic hazards. We distributed survey questionnaires to 25 employees of the local government units in the five component cities in Nueva Ecija who are directly involved in planning activities. We triangulated their responses using archival data (review of written policies and plans). The main findings of the study indicate that in spite the presence of laws and policies on DRR-CCA, their implementation is only in the preliminary stages. The results also provide insights to policymakers and future researchers on the challenges and opportunities influencing the systemic mainstreaming of DRR-CCA in the province.","[Gabriel, Arneil G.; Santiago, Patrick Neil M.; Casimiro, Rosemarie R.] Nueva Ecija Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Adm, Cabanatuan City 3100, Philippines",Nueva Ecija University of Science & Techology,"Gabriel, AG (corresponding author), Nueva Ecija Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Adm, Cabanatuan City 3100, Philippines.",gabrielarneil77@gmail.com,"Casimiro, Rosemarie/AAU-4255-2021; Gabriel, Arneil/A-4876-2017","Casimiro, Rosemarie/0000-0002-9984-8604; Gabriel, Arneil/0000-0001-6220-8884",,,,,43,4,4,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2095-0055,2192-6395,,INT J DISAST RISK SC,Int.

Existing approaches to generate these recommendations lack scalability and predictivity in marginal production environments. We tested if crowdsourced citizen science can address this challenge, producing empirical data across geographic space that, in aggregate, can characterize varietal climatic responses. We present the results of 12,409 farmer-managed experimental plots of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Nicaragua, durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) in Ethiopia, and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in India. Farmers collaborated as citizen scientists, each ranking the performance of three varieties randomly assigned from a larger set. We show that the approach can register known specific effects of climate variation on varietal performance. The prediction of variety performance from seasonal climatic variables was generalizable across growing seasons. We show that these analyses can improve variety recommendations in four aspects: reduction of climate bias, incorporation of seasonal climate forecasts, risk analysis, and geographic extrapolation. Variety recommendations derived from the citizen science trials led to important differences with previous recommendations.","[van Etten, Jacob; de Sousa, Kaue; Coto, Allan; Madriz, Brandon; Quiros, Carlos F.; Steinke, Jonathan] Biovers Int, Turrialba 30501, Costa Rica; [de Sousa, Kaue] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Agr Sci, N-2318 Hamar, Norway; [Aguilar, Amilcar; Barrios, Mirna] Trop Agr Res & Higher Educ Ctr, Matagalpa 61000, Nicaragua; [Dell'Acqua, Matteo; Pe, Mario Enrico] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Life Sci, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Fadda, Carlo; Gebrehawaryat, Yosef; Mengistu, Dejene K.] Biovers Int, Addis Ababa 1000, Ethiopia; [van de Gevel, Jeske] Biovers Int, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Gupta, Arnab; Mathur, Prem; Paliwal, Ambica; Sharma, Neeraj] Biovers Int, Delhi 110012, India; [Kiros, Afewerki Y.; Mengistu, Dejene K.; Mohammed, Jemal Nurhisen] Mekelle Univ, Dept Dryland Crop & Hort Sci, Mekelle 7000, Ethiopia; [Mercado, Leida] Trop Agr Res & Higher Educ Ctr, Turrialba 30501, Costa Rica; [Rosas, Juan Carlos] Zamorano Panamer Agr Sch, Tegucigalpa 11101, Honduras; [Singh, S.

Climate change adaptation (CCA) is considered to be an important component of risk management. In order to achieve adaptation, it is necessary to determine the indicators influencing adaptation in each community and this requires measurement and standard tools. The aim of this study is to determine and categorize the indicators of CCA. International electronic databases including Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar were investigated for only articles published in English language. In addition, Iranian databases including Irandoc, SID, and Magiran were investigated. There was no limitation on the methods of studies. Furthermore, snowball method was used for finding more articles while the ProQuest database was searched for related dissertations. The published documents from 1990 to November 2017 were gathered in this study. Out of 4439 publications initially search, 152 full texts were investigated. Finally, a total of 45 potentially relevant citations were included for full text review; in addition, fourteen other sources were investigated. Using snowball method, we found 24 other articles that were included in our final result. From the searches, 176 indicators were identified, while seven main domains were mentioned. Since in the articles, domains of adaptation are not in the form of a model, it is better to focus on this issue in the future and it seems that prioritizing and weighting domains in adaptation in different communities with different needs are an important issue.","[Salehi, Shiva; Ardalan, Ali; Ostadtaghizadeh, Abbas] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Emergencies & Disasters, Ghods Ave, Tehran, Iran; [Salehi, Shiva; Ardalan, Ali; Ostadtaghizadeh, Abbas] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Inst Environm Hlth Res, Tehran, Iran; [Ardalan, Ali] Harvard Humanitarian Initiat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Garmaroudi, Gholamreza] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Promot & Educ, Tehran, Iran; [Rahimiforoushani, Abbas] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Tehran, Iran; [Zareiyan, Armin] Aja Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing, Dept Publ Hlth, Tehran, Iran",Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Harvard University; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences,"Ardalan, A (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Emergencies & Disasters, Ghods Ave, Tehran, Iran.;Ardalan, A (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Inst Environm Hlth Res, Tehran, Iran.;Ardalan, A (corresponding author), Harvard Humanitarian Initiat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sh_salehi@razi.tums.ac.ir; aardalan@tums.ac.ir; garmaroudi@tums.ac.ir; a-ostadtaghizadeh@sina.tums.ac.ir; rahimifo@tums.ac.ir; a.zareian@ajaums.ac.ir,"salehi, Shiva/AAN-6390-2021; Ostadtaghizadeh, Abbas/AAO-2137-2020","Ostadtaghizadeh, Abbas/0000-0001-5260-6221",,,,,115,9,9,5,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

This paper outlines the design and implementation of a prototype web-based spatial decision support system (SDSS), referred to as the Community Adaptation Viewer (CAV), to assist adaptation planning. Thin-client, Javascript enabled web-SDSS software was constructed to allow interaction with urban infrastructure, and support on-the-fly assessment of social and economic vulnerability. Facilitated, decision-making workshops were conducted with small groups of stakeholders to evaluate the effectiveness of the prototype. The test case illustrates that high levels of information integration are practical to achieve, and that the SDSS can significantly enhance the ability of communities to conduct elaborate, geographically-specific climate change adaptation planning. Given the long time frame required to fulfil some adaptation plans, it is crucial that communities begin to develop and invest in adaptation strategies as soon as possible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the medium to long term, there is greater potential to adapt to climate change impacts as part of core development activity, compared with the financing of action on adaptation initiated from within the climate regime. Furthermore, OECD work highlights that development activities might need to adapt to medium/long-term trends in climate, and not just current weather extremes and climate variability. Policy coherence between climate and development however remains a major concern. There is a need to downscale the discourse on adaptation from a multilateral negotiations context, to a more substantive dialogue between sectoral planners, relevant stakeholders and climate experts on how best to operationalise adaptation as part of ongoing development activity.","Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Agrawala, S (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,16,15,15,3,18,INST DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,BRIGHTON,"UNIV SUSSEX, BRIGHTON BN1 9RE, E SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0265-5012,,,IDS BULL-I DEV STUD,IDS Bull.-Inst.

Understanding the gaps and differences between risk and perceived risk is a prerequisite to designing effective and sustainable adaptation strategies. Design/methodology/approach This research examined three key groups in Samoa, Fiji and Vanuatu: secondary school teachers, media personnel, and rural subsistence livelihood-based communities that live near or in conservation areas. This study deployed a dual methodology of participatory focus groups, paired with a national mobile phone based survey to gauge perceptions of climate change. This was the first time mobile technology had been used to gather perceptual data regarding the environment in the South Pacific. Findings The research findings highlighted a number of important differences and similarities in ways that these groups perceive climate change issues, solutions, personal vulnerability and comprehension of science among other factors. Practical implications These differences and similarities are neglected in large-scale top-down climate change adaptation strategies and have key implications for the design of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and therefore sustainable development in the region.

The driving forces behind adoption of the two selected adaptation strategies were heterogeneous. Location-specific factors influenced the intensity of adaptation between the two study regions.

Nevertheless, public understanding of this phenomenon varies widely among farmers and the public, the two-target audience of this paper. This paper introduces two research questions: (1) How climate change is perceived by public-farmers' nexus; and (2) How perception and populism (as a thin-ideology moved by social forces) interact? In order to address both questions, we review insights from different sources (literature, research projects, and public opinion services) over the last 10 years. The results proved how public experience of climate change is interdependent with the belief that climate change is happening. What is also notable is that the greater the years of farmers' farming experiences, the greater the percentage rate of their climate change awareness. Differences among farmers and public perceptions were also noted. Uncertainty, coupled with skepticism, the media, and political will, are common findings when asking to farmers and the public for the main weaknesses in adaptation to climate change.

Place-based climate adaptation workshops are commonly employed tools within these larger processes. The research, to date, on these phenomena has yielded mixed results, and the empirical evidence regarding what makes these workshops more or less effective has been mostly based on small samples in disparate contexts. In an effort to seek consensus regarding what factors lead to effective workshop outcomes, including participant learning and the motivation to take action; improved adaptation planning processes and implementation; and the development or strengthening of positive relationships between the participants, twenty-two experienced climate adaptation workshop facilitators participated in a Delphi study involving iterative surveys followed by focus groups. In this short report, we present a synthesis of consensus-based recommendations resulting from the Delphi study for enhancing place-based climate adaptation workshop outcomes. These recommendations address recruitment; fitting the local context; adequately preparing the participants; clarifying the objectives; facilitation strategies; promoting local leadership, efficacy and accountability; and providing post-workshop support.

A case study methodology including observation, semistructured interviews, and discourses analysis is applied to deconstruct the sociospatial process of climate change adaptation. The main findings stress the importance of discourse and land tenure strategies used by different stakeholders. Managers of publicly owned land tend to make environmental strategies (green infrastructure) central to their adaptation strategies, whereas private land owners tend to use man-made interventions (grey infrastructure) and closing space strategies to protect and enhance their land values in response to the increasing threat and evidence of climate change impacts.

We assessed vulnerability of Modoc National Wildlife Refuge (MNWR) through use of the Basin Characterization Model (BCM) landscape hydrology model, and six global climate models, representing projected wetter and drier conditions. We further developed a conceptual model that provides greater value for water managers by incorporating the BCM outputs into a conceptual framework that links modeled parameters to refuge management outcomes. This framework was used to identify landscape hydrology parameters that reflect refuge sensitivity to changes in (1) climatic water deficit (CWD) and recharge, and (2) the magnitude, timing, and frequency of water inputs. BCM outputs were developed for 1981-2100 to assess changes and forecast the probability of experiencing wet and dry water year types that have historically resulted in challenging conditions for refuge habitat management. We used a Yule's Q skill score to estimate the probability of modeled discharge that best represents historic water year types. CWD increased in all models across 72.3-100 % of the water supply basin by 2100. Earlier timing in discharge, greater cool season discharge, and lesser irrigation season water supply were predicted by most models. Under the worst-case scenario, moderately dry years increased from 10-20 to 40-60 % by 2100. MNWR could adapt by storing additional water during the cool season for later use and prioritizing irrigation of habitats during dry years.","[Esralew, Rachel A.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Pacific Southwest Reg Refuges Inventory & Monitor, 3020 State Univ Dr East Suite 2007, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Flint, Lorraine; Flint, Alan] US Geol Survey, Calif Water Sci Ctr, Placer Hall,6000 J St, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Thorne, James H.; Boynton, Ryan] Univ Calif Davis, Environm Informat Ctr, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Esralew, RA (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Pacific Southwest Reg Refuges Inventory & Monitor, 3020 State Univ Dr East Suite 2007, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA.",Rachel_Esralew@fws.gov; lflint@usgs.gov; jhthorne@ucdavis.edu; rmboynton@ucdavis.edu; aflint@usgs.gov,,"Boynton, Ryan/0000-0002-3952-2573; Thorne, James/0000-0002-9130-9921",USFWS Pacific Southwest Region Refuges Inventory and Monitoring Program; California Landscape Conservation Cooperative,USFWS Pacific Southwest Region Refuges Inventory and Monitoring Program; California Landscape Conservation Cooperative,"We thank the USFWS Pacific Southwest Region Refuges Inventory and Monitoring Program for funding and support for this project.

Underlying this is the belief that they will bring clarity to questions regarding the scale of institutional investments required, plausible adaptation policies and measures, and the timing of their implementation. Despite the perceived importance of technical assessments in 'evidence-based' decision environments, assessments cannot be undertaken independent of values and politics, nor are they capable of eliminating the uncertainty that clouds decision-making on climate adaptation As such, assessments can trigger as many questions as they answer, leaving practitioners and stakeholders to question their value. This paper explores the value of vulnerability/risk assessments in climate change adaptation planning processes as a catalyst for learning in four case studies in Southeastern Australia. Data were collected using qualitative interviews with stakeholders involved in the assessments and analysed using a social learning framework. This analysis revealed that detailed and tangible strategies or actions often do not emerge directly from technical assessments. However, it also revealed that the assessments became important platforms for social learning. In providing these platforms, assessments present opportunities to question initial assumptions, explore multiple framings of an issue, generate new information, and galvanise support for collective actions. This study highlights the need for more explicit recognition and understanding of the important role social learning plays in climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning more broadly.","[Yuen, Emma] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Jovicich, Samantha Stone] James Cook Univ, CSIRO Ecosyst Sci & Climate Adaptat Flagship, ATSIP, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Preston, Benjamin L.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); James Cook University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Yuen, E (corresponding author), CSIRO Marine & Atmospher, 107-121 Stn St, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia.",emma.j.yuen@csiro.au; samantha.stone-jovicich@csiro.au; prestonbl@ornl.gov,"Stone-Jovicich, Samantha/G-3689-2011; Preston, Benjamin L/B-9001-2012; Yuen, Emma J/G-5110-2012","Stone-Jovicich, Samantha/0000-0003-0839-0333; Preston, Benjamin L/0000-0002-7966-2386; ",CSIRO Climate Change Adaptation Flagship,CSIRO Climate Change Adaptation Flagship,"The authors would like to acknowledge the project managers of the four case studies for their support, all the interviewees who gave up their time to be interviewed, the reviewers for their valuable comments and the CSIRO Climate Change Adaptation Flagship who funded the research.",,50,37,38,1,59,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Adaptation measures also have possible unintended negative effects that, in the case of system transformations, may be difficult to reverse. This study seeks to identify characteristic features of the adaptation processes that may result in agrifood system transformations. We introduce an integrated framework to identify these features and 'adaptation activity spaces', and apply this framework to the Nordic context, analysing stakeholder interviews that integrated serious gaming. The results show how transformations may result from adaptation measures targeted towards climate risks with an objective of changing either current practices or surrounding supportive structures.

However, many agricultural impact studies have not necessarily accounted for the space-time variations in the water availability under changing climate and land use. Moreover, many hydrologic and agricultural assessments of climate change impacts are not fully integrated. To overcome this shortcoming, a tool that can simultaneously simulate the dynamic interactions between crop production and water resources in a watershed is essential. Here we propose the regional production and circulation coupled model (CROVER) by embedding the PRYSBI-2 (Process-based Regional Yield Simulator with Bayesian Inference version 2) large-area crop model into the global water resources model (called H08), and apply this model to the Songhua River watershed in Northeast China. The evaluation reveals that the model's performance in capturing the major characteristics of historical change in surface soil moisture, river discharge, actual crop evapotranspiration, and soybean yield relative to the reference data during the interval 1979-2010 is satisfactory accurate. The simulation experiments using the model demonstrated that subregional irrigation management, such as designating the area to which irrigation is primarily applied, has measurable influences on the regional crop production in a drought year. This finding suggests that reassessing climate change risk in agriculture using this type of modeling is crucial not to overestimate potential of irrigation-based adaptation.","[Okada, Masashi; Iizumi, Toshichika; Sakurai, Gen; Sakai, Toru; Okamoto, Katsuo] Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan; [Hanasaki, Naota] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Yokozawa, Masayuki] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4328561, Japan",National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences (NIAES) Japan; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Shizuoka University,"Yokozawa, M (corresponding author), Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4328561, Japan.",yokozawa@sys.eng.shizuoka.ac.jp,"Yokozawa, Masayuki/O-2829-2014; Hanasaki, Naota/C-2932-2009","Yokozawa, Masayuki/0000-0001-7053-2465; Hanasaki, Naota/0000-0002-5092-7563","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [S-10-2]; JSPS KAKENHI [26310305]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26310305] Funding Source: KAKEN","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The simulation data used in this study are available upon request to the corresponding author (yokozawa@sys.eng.shizuoka.ac.jp).

In recent years, China has made great efforts in climate change impact assessment, adaptation policy-making, as well as technological research and development. The objective of this paper is to analyze and summarize the achievements and gaps of improving the adaptation strategies. A case study focusing on China is provided as a reference for other developing countries. In China, positive and negative impacts coexist, with the negatives outweighing the positives. Climate change affects mainly seven fields, including agriculture, water resources, coastal zone, ecosystem and biodiversity, urban development, major projects, and human health. A top-down policy system of climate change adaptation in China consists of 117 national and departmental policies, 31 provincial action plans and 21 provincial adaptation plans. There is an increasing number of climate change adaptation policies appearing in China. Identification, classification and key-chain analysis are performed over the adaptation policies, in order to build up the technology system that captures their structure and characteristics. Progress has been made in the development and application of the top 10 adaptation technologies, such as extreme weather event prediction and early warning technology, integrated adaptation technology for human health, as well as technology for the conservation and restoration of typical climate-sensitive ecosystems. However, gaps still exist in the mismatch between adaptation goals and resource management in terms of adaptation policy-making, adaptation mechanism of global changes, and strategic adaptation technology and top-level design.","[He, X.

However, there remains little local level evidence on how DRR and CCA could be linked, the sorts of adjustments that are required for the two concepts to be integrated and the challenges ahead. This paper aims to provide an empirical insight on the possible links and departures between DRR and CCA. Design/methodology/approach - The study used a qualitative case study approach to excavate lessons from an existing DRR intervention for CCA using a local-level adaptive capacity assessment framework as a normative criteria. Data was collected both from primary and secondary sources. The primary data collection involved the use of participatory rural appraisal techniques with village communities in Chifra District, Afar Regional State, Ethiopia. Findings - The findings showed that the DRR interventions studied addressed parts of the elements of adaptive capacity at the local level. The findings also showed the limitation of the DRR intervention, which could be attributed to both the nature of the DRR interventions in general and implementation problems of the case study intervention in particular. The limitations show cases where full integration of DRR with CCA could be challenging. Originality/value - The paper argues why the two approaches may not be integrated fully and also shows the need to focus on the design of DRR interventions in achieving both short-term (reducing disaster risks) and long-term objectives (enhancing adaptive capacity).","[Gebreyes, Million] Univ Bonn, Inst Geog, Bonn, Germany; [Tesfaye, Kindie] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Feleke, Beneberu] Haramaya Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Haramaya, Ethiopia",University of Bonn; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Haramaya University,"Gebreyes, M (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Geog, Bonn, Germany.",milliongeb@gmail.com,,"Tesfaye, Kindie/0000-0002-7201-8053",Africa Climate Change Resilience Alliance (ACCRA) through Oxfam Great Britain Ethiopia Office,Africa Climate Change Resilience Alliance (ACCRA) through Oxfam Great Britain Ethiopia Office,This work was financially supported by the Africa Climate Change Resilience Alliance (ACCRA) through Oxfam Great Britain Ethiopia Office.

However, the current understanding of the costs and benefits of adaptation measures is still fairly rudimentary, and far from comprehensive. An assessment is presented of the current state of knowledge on the magnitude of adaptation costs in the United States. While incomplete, the studies suggest that adaptation cost could be as high as tens or hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the middle of this century. Key studies are identified in each sector, and the cost estimates and approaches to cost estimation are surveyed. Methodological issues are highlighted in interpreting, comparing, and aggregating adaptation cost estimates. Policy recommendations are made along with appropriate steps to make future adaptation cost studies more comparable within and across sectors and more accessible and relevant to policy and decision makers.Policy relevanceDesigning and implementing climate change adaptation policy requires good information about the effectiveness and cost of available adaptive options. The current state of knowledge on adaptation costs in the United States is assessed and significant gaps in the literature are highlighted - particularly in terms of sectoral and geographic coverage - as well as inconsistencies in methodologies and assumptions that hamper comparison across studies.

Thus, there is a potential in gaining valuable insight into how Irish potato smallholder farmers should respond to current and future climate risks. However, studies exploring and linking expert opinion on synergies and trade-offs in adapting the CSA practices are limited. This study integrated qualitative and quantitative data from 22 expert surveys and semistructured questionnaires to answer the following objectives: 1) Which top five CSA practices are currently used by Irish potato farmers and which ones are preferred by experts in response to climate change adaptation in Kenya? 2) How do the selected CSA practices perform in Irish potato farming in Kenya? 3) Which synergies and trade-offs occur upon implementation of these CSA practices? The study found that CSA practices most preferred by both experts and farmers are improved crop varieties, efficient use of agrochemicals, early land preparation, diversified crop production, efficient use of inorganic fertilizer, irrigation and changing planting dates. These selected CSA practices indicated the productivity pillar to be the best performing CSA pillar synergistically while trade-offs to occur across CSA pillars. These findings can inform different potato value chain stakeholders on the synergies and trade-off dynamics associated with adopting CSA practices for climate change adaptation. In conclusion, while CSA practices are perceived as essential, most preferred CSA practices are focused on increased production and adaptation, while mitigation goals receive less attention. The findings of this study provide an important basis for recommendation to farmers and policymakers. This study calls for sustainable and innovative ways that help to upscale the selected CSA practices in Irish potato farming in Kenya and beyond.","[Ogola, Robert John O.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Environm Sci, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ouko, Kevin Okoth] Jaram Oginga Odinga Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness Management, Bondo, Kenya",Wageningen University & Research,"Ogola, RJO (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Environm Sci, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",robertojohn57@gmail.com,"Ogola, Robert/GYU-3653-2022","Ouko, Kevin Okoth/0000-0001-9894-5042; Ogola, Robert John O/0000-0003-4962-5178",,,,,50,1,1,7,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1932,,,COGENT FOOD AGR,Cogent Food Agr.,JAN 1,2021,7,1,,,,,,,1948257,10.1080/23311932.2021.1948257,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2021.1948257,,,19,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,TF0YY,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000670441100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The social, cultural and economic drivers of these movements have generated differences not only between current distributions of crops and their climatic origins, but also between crop distributions and climate suitability for their production. Although these mismatches are particularly important to inform agricultural strategies on climate change adaptation, they have, to date, not been quantified consistently at the global level. Here, we show that the relationships between the distributions of 12 major food crops and climate suitability for their yields display strong variation globally. After investigating the role of biophysical, socio-economic and historical factors, we report that high-income world regions display a better match between crop distribution and climate suitability. In addition, although crops are farmed predominantly in the same climatic range as their wild progenitors, climate suitability is not necessarily higher there, a pattern that reflects the legacy of domestication history on current crop distribution. Our results reveal how far the global distribution of major crops diverges from their climatic optima and call for greater consideration of the multiple dimensions of the crop socio-ecological niche in climate change adaptive strategies.","[Mahaut, Lucie; Violle, Cyrille; Renard, Delphine] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE, EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Pironon, Samuel; Phillips, Charlotte] Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond, Kew, England; [Pironon, Samuel] UNEP WCMC, UN Environm Programme World Conservat Monitoring, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England; [Barnagaud, Jean-Yves] Univ Montpellier, EPHE PSL Univ, CEFE, CNRS,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Bretagnolle, Francois] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, Biogeosci, UMR 6282, Dijon, France; [Khoury, Colin K.

They have begun recently to experience the fire of climate change adaptation and mitigation policies. The fallout of this situation, thus, comes in form of mass-exodus, and social and political conflicts at the margin. This article tells a story of how the postcolonial government in India, like its predecessor i.e. the British colonialists, would orchestrate a concerted effort in accumulation-based development in the name of conservation of SDB. Critically engaging the trajectory of policy interventions including the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, the Draft National Forest Policy, 2018 and the Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers (Recognition of forest rights) act, 2006, it explores the dynamic way in which the government uses the climate change and conservation excuse to evict the Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers from the forestlands.

Robust Decision Making inverts the analytical steps associated with forecast-led methodologies, reframing adaptation in the context of a specific decision maker's capacities and vulnerabilities. In adopting this bottom-up approach, the aim is to determine adaptation solutions which are insensitive to uncertainty. Yet despite the increased use of the approach in large-scale adaptation projects in developed countries, there is little empirical evidence to test whether or not it can be successfully applied in developing countries. The complex realities of decision making processes, the need to combine quantitative data with qualitative understanding and competing environmental, socio-economic and political factors all pose significant obstacles to adaptation. In developing countries, these considerations are particularly relevant and additional pressures exist which may limit the uptake and utility of the Robust Decision Making approach. In this paper, we investigate the claim that the approach can be deemed valuable in developing countries. Challenges and opportunities associated with Robust Decision Making, as a heuristic decision framework, are discussed with insights from a case study of adapting coastal infrastructure to changing environmental risks in South Africa.

This research investigated current and future potential for climate adaptation to be integrated into fisheries management strategies using Tasmanian commercial wild-catch fisheries as a case study, and then identified obstacles and recommendations for fisheries management to better adapt to future climate changes. We conducted qualitative interviews with fisheries stakeholders and experts to identify their perceptions of the effects of climate change on commercial wild-catch fisheries and local marine ecosystems, as well as opportunities for enhanced management in the future. The results show that climate adaptation in Tasmania fisheries management has largely been passive or incidental to date, and suggested future improvements may incorporate: (1) more or different scientific information and better application; (2) government reviews, reforms and stronger action; (3) industry changes and taking responsibility for the issue; (4) gaining more funding and resources; and (5) increasing education, extension and interaction among stakeholder groups. Implementation of the recommendations suggested in this study would help create a more forward-thinking and proactive response to climate change for Tasmanian fisheries, as well as a more flexible and resilient fishing industry that is better able to absorb shocks related to climate change.","[Fogarty, Hannah E.; Pecl, Gretta T.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Fogarty, Hannah E.; Cvitanovic, Christopher; Hobday, Alistair J.; Pecl, Gretta T.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Cvitanovic, Christopher] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Natl Ctr Publ Awareness Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org Oceans & Atmospher, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; Australian National University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Hobday, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.;Hobday, AJ (corresponding author), Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org Oceans & Atmospher, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia.",alistair.hobday@csiro.au,"Pecl, Gretta/D-7267-2011; Hobday, Alistair/A-1460-2012","Pecl, Gretta/0000-0003-0192-4339; Hobday, Alistair/0000-0002-3194-8326; Cvitanovic, Christopher/0000-0002-2565-3396",Centre for Marine Socioecology [111518]; Australian Research Council Future Fellowship [FT140100596]; Australian Research Council [FT140100596] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Centre for Marine Socioecology; Australian Research Council Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Interview transcription was funded by the Centre for Marine Socioecology (Project 111518).

One of the most important approaches in this regard is perceiving farmers' time perspective (FTP). The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of FTP on adaptation behavior toward climate change (ABCC) and adaptation capacity toward climate change (ACCC) with emphasis on water scarcity. This research is a descriptive-correlational, ex post facto research and causal-relational research that was conducted using a survey. The statistical population was the farmers of Lake Urmia watershed area (N = 2855978) of whom 384 people were selected as a sample using Krejcie and Morgan table and stratified random sampling method with proportional assignment. The research instrument was a questionnaire whose validity was confirmed by a panel of experts in extension and education of agriculture and water resources and the reliability of its items was verified using Cmnbach's alpha coefficient. SPSS24 and comparative statistical tests and linear regression (for path analysis) were used for data analysis. The findings indicated that the ABCC of farmers is moderate and most of them have a present-oriented perspective. Also, the results of Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there is a significant difference between farmers with different FTP in terms of adaptation behavior. The causal analysis showed that FTP can play a crucial role in explaining the level of ABCC indirectly by affecting the ACCC. Accordingly, in water resources management planning as a policy strategy, the change of farmers' perspective from past-oriented to present-oriented and especially future-oriented should be considered.","[Shariatzadeh, Maryam; Bijani, Masoud] Tarbiat Modares Univ TMU, Coll Agr, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Tehran, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University,"Bijani, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ TMU, Coll Agr, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Tehran, Iran.",m.shariatzadeh@modares.ac.ir; mbijani@modares.ac.ir,"Bijani, Masoud/N-8275-2018","Bijani, Masoud/0000-0003-2659-6386",,,,,40,2,2,4,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

This is the first study of its kind for drought-prone areas in Bangladesh. Farmers perceived climate changes included increases in temperature and decreases in rainfall which were as consistent with the trends of Chuadanga climate records. Farmers' adaptation measures included changes in cropping systems, cropping calendars, crop varieties, agronomic practices, crop diversification and improved animal'husbandry. Reducing environmental stress, ensuring self-sufficiency in staple crops (mainly rice) and other crop production practices, and enhancing economic viability of farm enterprises have underpinned these adaptations. Off-farm and non-farm wage employment, temporary migration, self-employment and educating children, constituted the core non-farm adaptation strategies. Emerging cropping systems like maize/cucumber and maize/stem amaranth/rice were economically more viable than the traditional rice/rice and rice/maize systems. Despite some uncertainties, farming was preferred to off-farm work, generating higher returns to labour for all cropping systems. Limited access to stress-tolerant varieties, extension services and affordable agricultural credit, combined with high production costs, variability in crop yields and output mites, are the main barriers to adaptation. Stronger agricultural research and support services, affordable credit, community-focussed farming education and training are critically important for effective adaptation to climate change.

In this study, two multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), were applied to determine the best scenario adapting to climate change in agriculture for the Gharanghu basin in Northwest Iran for a 30-year period (2040-2069). Reservoir efficiency indexes were used as evaluation criteria. Specifically, the preference of each criterion relative to the other criteria was determined based on experts' opinions. Five management scenarios were considered, involving reductions in agricultural water demand by 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25%, respectively. By applying the AHP approach, the consolidated weight of each criterion was calculated; the best adaptation scenario to climate change was determined; the inconsistency rate was calculated; and sensitivity analysis was also performed. The AHP results showed that the fifth scenario (25% demand reduction) with a weight of 33.5% was the best one for agricultural water demand management. The results obtained from the TOPSIS model indicated that the third scenario (15% demand reduction) with a weight of 20.8% was the best management scenario for agriculture in the period of climate change. Thus, estimation of uncertainty related to climate change is critical to choosing the best alternative using the MCDM models. Uncertainty analysis helps address the questions about whether the management scenarios are sustainable under unforeseen changes, and whether they are an ideal response to critical conditions of climate change.","[Golfam, Parvin; Ashofteh, Parisa-Sadat; Rajaee, Taher] Univ Qom, Dept Civil Engn, Qom, Iran; [Chu, Xuefeng] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Dept 2470, Fargo, ND 58108 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,"Ashofteh, PS (corresponding author), Univ Qom, Dept Civil Engn, Qom, Iran.",P.Golfam@stu.qom.ac.ir; PS.Ashofteh@qom.ac.ir; trajaee@qom.ac.ir; Xuefeng.Chu@ndsu.edu,"Chu, Xuefeng/H-7285-2012","Chu, Xuefeng/0000-0003-0322-0271; Rajaee, Taher/0000-0002-4325-2537",,,,,24,36,36,4,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

To date, these constraints have focused on simplistic factors such as limited resources and lack of information. In this paper we argue that this focus has obscured a wider set of constraints which need to be acknowledged and addressed if adaptation is likely to advance through municipal planning. Although these recognised constraints are relevant, we argue that what underpins these issues are more fundamental challenges affecting local, placed-based planning by drawing on the related field of community-based environmental planning (CBEP). In considering a wider set of constraints to practical attempts towards adaptation, the paper considers planning based on a case study of three municipalities in Sydney, Australia in 2008. The results demonstrate that climate adaptation was widely accepted as an important issue for planning conducted by local governments. However, it was yet to be embedded in planning practice which retained a strong mitigation bias in relation to climate change. In considering the case study, we draw attention to factors thus far under-acknowledged in the climate adaptation literature. These include leadership, institutional context and competing planning agendas. These factors can serve as constraints or enabling mechanisms for achieving climate adaptation depending upon how they are exploited in any given situation. The paper concludes that, through addressing these issues, local, place-based planning can play a greater role in achieving climate adaptation.","[Measham, Thomas G.; Gorddard, Russell] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Preston, Benjamin L.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Smith, Timothy F.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Brooke, Cassandra] WWF Australia, Sydney, NSW 2001, Australia; [Withycombe, Geoff; Morrison, Craig] Sydney Coastal Council Grp, Sydney, NSW 2001, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of the Sunshine Coast; World Wildlife Fund,"Measham, TG (corresponding author), CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, GPO Box 284, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Tom.Measham@csiro.au,"Measham, Tom/A-5210-2010; Gorddard, Russell/D-7828-2011; Preston, Benjamin L/B-9001-2012","Measham, Tom/0000-0003-4549-5361; Preston, Benjamin L/0000-0002-7966-2386; Smith, Timothy/0000-0002-3991-5211",CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship; Australian Government Department of Climate Change,CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Australian Government Department of Climate Change(Australian Government),"This research was funded by the CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship and the Australian Government Department of Climate Change.

However, where planned adaptation originates outside a community, it has the potential to alter or eclipse autonomous forms of local adaptation. This paper identifies the range of autonomous adaptive practices undertaken by a Maasai pastoralist community and examines existing opportunities and constraints to adaptation. Field data were collected at three complementary levels: community, household and individual. Results indicate that many adaptive practices used in this community have been modified from past risk management strategies drawn directly from pastoralists' experience in dry-land environments. However, not all pastoralists are able to engage in these adaptive practices. Gender and wealth inequality pose a challenge to scaling up as they influence access to land and water for irrigation as well as financial assets required to access adaptive practices that are available in the wider community. This research concludes that planned adaptation should take into consideration the full range of existing adaptive practices and inequality in access as this provides information on opportunities and barriers to scaling up.","[Wangui, Elizabeth Edna; Smucker, Thomas Alan] Ohio Univ, Dept Geog, Athens, OH 45701 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Wangui, EE (corresponding author), Ohio Univ, Dept Geog, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",wangui@ohio.edu,"Smucker, Thomas/AAZ-1332-2021",,,,,,45,6,6,2,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

DCDC is a boundary organization that conducts research in collaboration with policy makers, with the goal of informing decision-making under uncertainty. Our results highlight: the counterintuitive, non-linear, and competing relationships in human-environment dynamics; the myriad uncertainties in climatic, scientific, political, and other domains of knowledge and practice; and, the social learning that has occurred across science and policy spheres.

Research on climate change education has largely focused on system and action knowledge that address mitigation while overlooking equally necessary adaptive responses. This study used a pre/post-test format to identify aspects of middle and high school students' climate system knowledge and action knowledge of both mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. Results indicate that adolescents currently conflate climate change mitigation strategies with unrelated environmental problems far less than in previous surveys. However, students demonstrated limited understanding of adaptive responses to climate change. After engaging in an instructional unit on climate change, students expressed stronger system and action knowledge, but significant misconceptions remained that conflated mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.","[Bofferding, Laura] Purdue Univ, Sch Educ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Kloser, Matthew] Univ Notre Dame, Inst Educ Initiat, Notre Dame Ctr STEM Educ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Notre Dame,"Bofferding, L (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Educ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",LBofferding@Purdue.edu,,,National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX09AL89G],National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"Many thanks go out to the project team at Stanford University that created the climate change education curriculum, including: Rachel Lotan, Jennifer Saltzman, Pamela Matson, Michael Mastrandrea, Noah Diffenbaugh, Polly Diffenbaugh, Salina Gray, and the participating teachers and students.

This approach permits the identification of diverse adaptation responses arising from the existence of multiple and fragmented dimensions of identity (including gender) that intersect with power relations to shape situation-specific interactions between farmers and ecosystems. Based on results from contrasting research cases in Bihar and Uttarakhand, India, this paper demonstrates, inter alia, that there are geographically determined gendered preferences and adoption strategies regarding adaptation options and that these are influenced by the socio-ecological context and institutional dynamics. Intersecting identities, such as caste, wealth, age and gender, influence decisions and reveal power dynamics and negotiation within the household and the community, as well as barriers to adaptation among groups. Overall, the findings suggest that a feminist intersectional approach does appear to be useful and worth further exploration in the context of climate change adaptation. In particular, future research could benefit from more emphasis on a nuanced analysis of the intra-gender differences that shape adaptive capacity to climate change.","[Ravera, Federica] Univ Evora, ICAAM, LDSP Landscape Dynam & Social Proc Res Grp, Polo Mitra, Ap 94, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Ravera, Federica] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Martin-Lopez, Berta] Leuphana Univ, Fac Sustainabil, Inst Eth & Transdisciplinary Sustainabil Res, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Pascual, Unai] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Edificio Sede 1,Planta 1a,Parque Cient UPV EHU, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Pascual, Unai] Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerbasque, Maria Diaz de Haro 3,6 Floor, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [Pascual, Unai] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Drucker, Adam] Biovers Int, Via Tre Denari 472-a, I-00057 Rome, Italy",University of Evora; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Leuphana University Luneburg; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Basque Foundation for Science; University of Cambridge; Alliance; Bioversity International,"Ravera, F (corresponding author), Univ Evora, ICAAM, LDSP Landscape Dynam & Social Proc Res Grp, Polo Mitra, Ap 94, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal.;Ravera, F (corresponding author), CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Catalonia, Spain.",Federica.ravera@gmail.com; martinlo@leuphana.de; unai.pascual@bc3research.org; A.Drucker@cgiar.org,"Pascual, Unai/O-7946-2019; PASCUAL, UNAI/B-4766-2012; Martin-Lopez, Berta/R-9397-2017","Pascual, Unai/0000-0002-5696-236X; PASCUAL, UNAI/0000-0002-5696-236X; Martin-Lopez, Berta/0000-0003-2622-0135","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portugal)","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portugal)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","We would like to thank Dr. Prem Mathur and the entire staff of Bioversity International, Dr. Sahai and colleagues from Gene Campaign, Dr. Solanki and the staff of Rajendra Agricultural University at Pusa Campus in Bihar, staff at VPKAS, Almora and NBPGR Regional Station in Bowali, Uttarakhand, for their logistical support and assistance during the fieldwork.

In recent decades, there has been resurgence in cover crop adoption that is synchronous with a heightened awareness of climate change. Climate change mitigation and adaptation may be additional, important ecosystem services provided by cover crops, but they lie outside of the traditional list of cover cropping benefits. Here, we review the potential for cover crops to mitigate climate change by tallying all of the positive and negative impacts of cover crops on the net global warming potential of agricultural fields. Then, we use lessons learned from two contrasting regions to evaluate how cover crops affect adaptive management for precipitation and temperature change. Three key outcomes from this synthesis are (1) Cover crop effects on greenhouse gas fluxes typically mitigate warming by similar to 100 to 150 g CO2 e/m(2)/year, which is higher than mitigation from transitioning to no-till. The most important terms in the budget are soil carbon sequestration and reduced fertilizer use after legume cover crops. (2) The surface albedo change due to cover cropping, calculated for the first time here using case study sites in central Spain and Pennsylvania, USA, may mitigate 12 to 46 g CO2 e/m(2)/year over a 100-year time horizon. And (3) Cover crop management can also enable climate change adaptation at these case study sites, especially through reduced vulnerability to erosion from extreme rain events, increased soil water management options during droughts or periods of soil saturation, and retention of nitrogen mineralized due to warming. Overall, we found very few tradeoffs between cover cropping and climate change mitigation and adaptation, suggesting that ecosystem services that are traditionally expected from cover cropping can be promoted synergistically with services related to climate change.","[Kaye, Jason P.] Penn State Univ, Coll Agr Sci, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Quemada, Miguel] Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Agr Prod, Avda Complutense S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Kaye, JP (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Coll Agr Sci, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jpk12@psu.edu,"Quemada, Miguel/K-4214-2014","Quemada, Miguel/0000-0001-5793-2835","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture [2011-51300-30638, 2015-51300-24156]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL201452310R]; Comunidad de Madrid [S2013/ABI2717]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Comunidad de Madrid(Comunidad de Madrid)","Funding for this analysis came from the USA-Spain Fulbright Commission.

Results emerges that breeders use various adaptation strategies principally, supplementation, integration agriculture-livestock and conduct's mode through different types such as association. The result of the model reveals that age of breeder, herd size, agricultural area, member of an association, subsidies and well ownerships are the most factors which significantly influence the adaptation choices of breeders to cope to climate change.

Logistic regression was used for modeling the perceptions and adaptation behavior of farmers. Farmers perceptions of climate change tended to closely match those estimated from the climate data, but farmers with better access to water resources, credit, and those with higher family income, higher production, and larger farm sizes had more options to adapt and were more likely to adopt techniques to cope with climate change and variability. Factors such as age, education level, and family size of respondents were less likely to impact farmers' decisions to adapt to climate change.","[Baruah, Ujjal Deka; Saikia, Anup] Gauhati Univ, Dept Geog, Gauhati 781014, India; [Baruah, Ujjal Deka; Mili, Nitashree] Cotton Univ, Dept Geog, Gauhati 781001, India; [Robeson, Scott M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, 701 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Chand, Pritam] Cent Univ Punjab, Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Dept Geog, Bathinda 151001, India",Gauhati University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Central University of Punjab,"Baruah, UD (corresponding author), Gauhati Univ, Dept Geog, Gauhati 781014, India.;Baruah, UD (corresponding author), Cotton Univ, Dept Geog, Gauhati 781001, India.",udbmail@gauhati.ac.in; asaikia@gauhati.ac.in; srobeson@indiana.edu; nitashree.mili@cottonuniversity.ac.in; pritam.chand@cup.edu.in,"Deka Baruah, Ujjal/HIR-1434-2022; Deka Baruah, Ujjal/AAE-2013-2022; Chand, Pritam/H-5804-2016; Saikia, Anup/S-7698-2019; Saikia, A/GPP-3289-2022","Deka Baruah, Ujjal/0000-0003-1778-3534; Chand, Pritam/0000-0001-7388-0393; Saikia, Anup/0000-0003-0448-4869; Robeson, Scott/0000-0002-1558-6951",,,,,81,4,4,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Deliberative democracy forums serve to both better inform the public of the available options and provide a way for policymakers to assess support for proposed policies. This work uses a pilot study in Pittsburgh to generate hypotheses regarding how a deliberative democracy process affects residents' perceptions of and support for City-wide energy policies to address climate change. A convenience sample completed pre and post-surveys during a deliberative forum: Building a Resilient Pittsburgh: Climate Challenges and Opportunities. The surveys focused on knowledge, perceptions, and opinions related to the existence of climate change as well as energy policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Results suggest that the forum was useful in shifting perceptions, but did not significantly influence objective knowledge or policy support. Participants had a slight preference for energy efficiency strategies over renewable energy and public information. More research is needed to evaluate deliberative democracy approaches and expand these findings to a more diverse population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Not only does it pose interesting new challenges for the climate scientific community but also it is naturally linked to a great variety of socio-economic applications. Seasonal climate forecasts are indeed becoming a most important element in some policy/decision making systems, especially within the context of climate change adaptation. Thus, seriously considering the management of risks posed by the variability of climate on the seasonal to interannual time scale is key to achieving the longer terms goals of climate change adaptation strategy. This review paper explores the main components needed to construct a seasonal forecasting system, from the physical basis of climate seasonal predictions, to the tools used for producing them, to the importance of assessing their skill, to their use in risk management decision-making.

Climate change is already having disproportionate impacts on their biophysical and socio-economic processes. The status of national-level climate change adaptation across multiple SIDS is, however, under-explored in the academic literature. A pivotal study by Lesnikowski a al. (2015) (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11027-013-9491-x), which assessed adaptation outcomes in 117 Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), only included 13 SIDS, a number insufficient to establish a baseline of action in these countries. This paper builds on Lesnikowski a al. (2015) and more recent SIDS-specific work by Robinson (2017) (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11027-015-9693-5) by coding 441 national adaptation actions reported in the National Communications of 35 SIDS between 1997 and 2014. It develops a richness index that baselines adaptations in these countries, which are located across three main geographic regions - the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, Caribbean, and Pacific. It further identifies more advanced adaptors and less advanced adaptors among the group, and finds that, while progress was made in the observation and assessment of climate variables (29.7% of reported actions) and planning (25.2%), less tangible actions were implemented (19.0%) with even less monitoring and evaluation (8.2%) and stakeholder engagement and knowledge management (17.9%). This paper concludes that greater investments in ongoing capacity-building in SIDS are required for countries to better plan, implement and evaluate adaptation actions, and to better advocate for more optimal levels of international financing for helping to underwrite the cost of adaptation.","[Robinson, Stacy-ann] Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Mayflower Hill Dr, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Colby College,"Robinson, SA (corresponding author), Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Mayflower Hill Dr, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",stacy-ann.robinson@colby.edu,,"Robinson, Stacy-ann/0000-0003-3163-8771",,,,,109,9,9,3,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2665-9727,,,ENVIRON SUSTAIN IND,Environ.

Identifying, analysing and overcoming these barriers is essential for ensuring that, as climate change worsens, adaptation capacities are not exceeded. Despite current studies providing a useful structuring heuristic to guide inquiry, there is a significant gap related to explanations around barrier occurrence and how to overcome them. In response, this article, based on semi-structured stakeholder interviews, aims to provide preliminary insights into the type of barriers that exist in Laamu Atoll, the Maldives and explore any interdependencies between them. This study found that a range of resource barriers (i.e. funding, physical and human resources in outer islands and data on vulnerable groups) and social barriers (i.e. political/institutional and organisational constraints and inefficiencies, marginalisation and power differences as well as cognitive elements) were hampering adaptation. In exploring the interdependencies that exist between these barriers, the nature of their occurrence, persistence and entry points for resolution were also identified.","[Clissold, Rachel; McNamara, Karen E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Westoby, Ross] Griffith Univ, Griffith Inst Tourism, Gold Coast, Australia",University of Queensland; Griffith University,"Clissold, R (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",rachel.clissold@uq.net.au,"Westoby, Ross/G-8895-2019","Westoby, Ross/0000-0001-9868-2246; Clissold, Rachel/0000-0001-9669-8746",,,,,61,5,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1360-7456,1467-8373,,ASIA PAC VIEWP,Asia Pac.

This paper explores how place attachment affects adaptive responses to a changing social context through analysing adaptation in two coastal municipalities in Northern Norway. The main challenge in these municipalities is declining populations and the consequences accompanying this trend, including livelihood uncertainties and decreased provision of public services. This paper discusses the role of place attachment in motivating adaptation to these changes to contribute to a growing body of literature within climate change adaptation on subjective (values, culture and place) dimensions. The findings suggest that people are motivated to act based on their emotional connection with place, and the paper argues that place attachment may offer a better starting point for climate change adaptation than an emphasis on climate change impacts.","[Amundsen, Helene] CICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res, Oslo, Norway; [Amundsen, Helene] FRAM High North Res Ctr Climate & Environm, Tromso, Norway",,"Amundsen, H (corresponding author), CICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res, Oslo, Norway.",helene.amundsen@cicero.uio.no,,"Amundsen, Helene/0000-0002-4280-730X","NORKLIMA progamme of the Research Council of Norway through the project ACTOR (Arctic Climate Change, Tourism, and Outdoor Recreation)","NORKLIMA progamme of the Research Council of Norway through the project ACTOR (Arctic Climate Change, Tourism, and Outdoor Recreation)","This study was funded by the NORKLIMA progamme of the Research Council of Norway through the project ACTOR (Arctic Climate Change, Tourism, and Outdoor Recreation).

There are few studies that have explored the capacity of farmers to adapt to a changing climate, especially in the Nordic countries. A mix-method design i.e. a combination of action research and explorative research approaches was adopted. Perceptions of farmers was elicited using a questionnaire survey, which achieved a 33% response rate (81 out of 243) and in total 51 interviews were conducted with various stakeholders. Data was analyzed using one sample- and two sample t-test and ANOVA in a commercial software GraphPad Prism. In the article, both climatic and non-climatic drivers, affecting perception of farmers to adopt climate smart agricultural practices are presented and various short- and long-term interventions made by farmers to cope with climate change impacts, along with their positive and negative outcomes are discussed. It is found that stakeholders have poor understanding of land and water resources carrying capacity, are influenced by post exposure-let down mindset and are skeptical to climate change. Moreover, two kinds of apparent stakeholder systems that give rise to passive or active farmers, i.e. a top-down control system, and a bottom-up facilitating support system, were identified. It is recommended for authorities to consider farmers' expectations and education levels while designing advisory training programs, to introduce innovative, incentive driven, support policies for farmers and to consider shifting the current subsidies system to an outcome-based one.","[Ibrahim, Muhammad Asim; Johansson, Marie] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Vaxjo, Sweden",Linnaeus University,"Ibrahim, MA (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Vaxjo, Sweden.",asim.ibrahim@lnu.se; marie.c.johansson@lnu.se,,,KK-Stiftelsen [817-2.1.9]; Aforsk [19-355],KK-Stiftelsen; Aforsk,"This work was supported by KK-Stiftelsen [grant number 817-2.1.9, 2017] and Aforsk [grant number 19-355].",,74,4,4,6,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,1873-1392,,J RURAL STUD,J.

Climate experts, on the other hand, have access to an enormous amount of data that could be useful to users but often do not know how to translate it into something practical. Both users and experts can be linked through two timescales, the system lifespan and climate vulnerability. While the system lifespan relies on the user's estimation of his planning timeframe, the climate vulnerability is estimated from climate model projections and observations. We propose a simple tool to relate user and climate expert knowledge by combining the two timescales. To be reliable, the interconnection implies a dialogue to first identify what sensitive climate variable will impact the system and subsequently the extent of the impact. Climate data can then be used to identify, with the use of a simple graph, how sensitive a system is likely to be and help users position themselves about the urgency of adaptation. The concept has been successfully presented and applied to the tourismindustry, notably the ski industry, which is showcased in this paper. (C) 2016 The Authors.

These are featuring artificial stabilized ground and surface water levels. As a result of the local climate the water levels in the polders are not continuously at a constant level. To maintain a stable water table in the polders, the surplus of relatively clean rainwater has to be pumped away during the cold seasons into canals or rivers, which are located on a higher level. During the summer relatively polluted water from these waterways is led into the polders to top up the declining water levels. This procedure leads to various problems regarding water quantity and water quality. The described existing system is not adaptable to climate change and includes the risk of flooding, particularly from torrential rain. Therefore it is crucial to develop, preferably self-sufficient, rainwater management systems in the polders. They should allow the fluctuation of the water levels inside the polders for seasonal storage and flood control.

Addressing these issues encourages good climate change adaptation governance. So far, however, the literature has not discussed what good governance could mean in this context. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to address this knowledge gap by developing an assessment framework and showing its usefulness. The framework is based on a review of the literature and is applied in an assessment of adaptation practices in Curacao. The assessment is based on a review of Curacao policy documents and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. We found that the developed framework was useful for obtaining a better insight into the quality of adaptation governance on Caribbean islands, and that in the Curacao practices, the good governance principles of transparency and inclusiveness are better elaborated in comparison to connectivity, accountability and government effectiveness.

Results show that to adapt, farmers borrow food from neighbours to repay in good season, use early maturing crops, sell livestock and other assets, engage in other businesses. Farmers also offer prayers and sacrifices based on the belief that climate change is caused by God. Thus, offering prayer and making sacrifices were very pronounced and found to be the dominant strategies farmers adopt in both communities which could potentially lead to less adaptation action thereby indirectly exposing the vulnerable communities to additional shocks. We found that most (50% and above) of the participating farmers in both communities had no access to any formal education which could affect their adaptation decisions. We concluded that farmers' cultural beliefs and practices such as prayer influences their adaptation behaviour and therefore adaptation designs need to address cultural influences to avoid future maladaptive responses consequently exacerbating vulnerability.","[Jellason, Nugun P.; Conway, John S.; Baines, Richard N.] Royal Agr Univ, Sch Agr Food & Environm, Cirencester, Glos, England; [Jellason, Nugun P.] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Whiteknights Campus,POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Jellason, NP (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Whiteknights Campus,POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",nugunjellason@gmail.com,"Jellason, Nugun/AGP-3514-2022","Jellason, Nugun P/0000-0002-5583-354X",,,,,65,2,2,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0362-3319,1873-5355,,SOC SCI J,Soc.

This is due to the ubiquitous nature of the topic. Power is shaped by a variety of institutional factors, including the architecture of governing structures, questions of scale and level, and access to key resources including knowledge and capital, among other factors. To date, there are relatively few tools available that allow policy makers, researchers, and development practitioners to render these power dynamics explicit and thus take steps to mitigate the potentially deleterious effects of power orientations. This paper proposes a methodology, multi-level stakeholder influence mapping (MSIM), for elucidating power dynamics between actors in complex system regimes. MSIM departs from existing power mapping techniques in that it relies on individual interviews conducted across multiple actor levels and utilizes a participatory mapping process for shared system boundary critique. MSIM was piloted in Nepal's agricultural climate change adaptation regime with actors from the central, regional, and local operational levels. The results suggest that without proper consideration of the role of power in agricultural adaptation regimes, the resulting interventions will likely be insufficient in catalyzing adaptation pathways and moderating the negative impacts of climate change. Furthermore, power analyses produced from the perspective of a single actor level or respondent type can risk sub optimization of adaptation outcomes and can misdirect the lobbying efforts of those agencies utilizing mapping outputs.","[Sova, Chase A.; Helfgott, Ariella; Chaudhury, Abrar S.; Vermeulen, Sonja J.] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Sova, Chase A.] CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Sova, Chase A.; Helfgott, Ariella; Chaudhury, Abrar S.; Matthews, David; Thornton, Thomas F.] Univ Oxford, ECI, Oxford, England; [Helfgott, Ariella] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia",CGIAR; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University of Oxford; University of Adelaide,"Sova, CA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, ECI, Oxford, England.",c.sova@cgiar.org,"Thornton, Tom/AAJ-5105-2020","Chaudhury, Abrar/0000-0002-3094-7639",,,,,49,21,21,2,43,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1094-429X,1573-9295,,SYST PRACT ACT RES,Syst.

Furthermore, a complex interplay of unemployment, rural exodus, and an aging population challenges this structurally weak region. We discuss adaptation measures that are either implemented or planned, as well as research into adaptation strategies to climate change for the sectors forestry, agriculture, and water management as well as in nature conservation in light of socioeconomic and ecological challenges and benefits. In doing so, we adopt a systemic view of Brandenburg where the sectors discussed are seen as subsystems embedded in a larger regional system. This at least partially holarchical approach enables the identification of conflicts between adaptation measures, but also of synergies among the sectors that pertain to successful adaptation to climate change. The insights gained ultimately highlight the need for cross-sectoral, adaptive management practices that jointly target a sustainable regional development.","[Reyer, Christopher; Hattermann, Fred F.; Lasch, Petra; Lucht, Wolfgang; Stock, Manfred] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Bachinger, Johann; Bloch, Ralf] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Muncheberg, Germany; [Bloch, Ralf; Ibisch, Pierre L.; Kreft, Stefan; Nowicki, Christoph; Spathelf, Peter; Welp, Martin] Univ Appl Sci, Eberswalde Univ Sustainable Dev, Eberswalde, Germany; [Lucht, Wolfgang] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Reyer, C (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",reyer@pik-potsdam.de,"Spathelf, Peter/A-2287-2015; mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020; Lucht, Wolfgang/G-2180-2011; Reyer, Christopher P.O./A-5515-2013; Kreft, Stefan/AAE-5558-2021","Lucht, Wolfgang/0000-0002-3398-8575; Reyer, Christopher P.O./0000-0003-1067-1492; Lasch-Born, Petra/0000-0001-6468-4411",MOTIVE project; INKA BB project; Eberswalde University,MOTIVE project; INKA BB project; Eberswalde University,"This article partly builds upon the experiences gained during the field trips carried out in the course Response Strategies: Adaptation to Global Change in the framework of the Global Change Management Master Course at the Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development-University of Applied Sciences, Eberswalde, Germany.

We present two concrete but contrasting case studies that focus on coastal realignment and wetland restoration as well as seaside tourism and resort development on the German Baltic Sea coast. The ecosystem service assessments compare past, present and potential future local development scenarios. Complementary, we apply the InVest and the Matrix ecosystem service assessment approaches. Despite some shortcomings, the proactive German hierarchical planning system seems suitable to deal with climate change and provide a framework for adaptation measures in coastal zones. It largely prevents a shift of climate change risks between municipalities and stakeholders. Comparative ecosystem service assessments seem well suited to play a role in the planning process by raising awareness about problems, possible solutions and consequences. On a local level, they can provide comprehensive insight into consequences of alternative measures. Our examples show that, in principle, potential future situations can be addressed with comparative ecosystem service approaches. We discuss whether the results of hypothetical future scenarios, with inherent uncertainties, might be misleading and counterproductive.","[Schernewski, Gerald; Konrad, Alena; Roskothen, Jannik; von Thenen, Miriam] Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res, Coastal & Marine Management Grp, Seestr15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany; [Schernewski, Gerald] Klaipeda Univ, Marine Res Inst, Univ Ave 17, LT-92294 Klaipeda, Lithuania",Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde; Klaipeda University,"Schernewski, G (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res, Coastal & Marine Management Grp, Seestr15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany.;Schernewski, G (corresponding author), Klaipeda Univ, Marine Res Inst, Univ Ave 17, LT-92294 Klaipeda, Lithuania.",gerald.schernewski@io-warnemuende.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03F0911B]; European Commission [101112752],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This research was partly funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research under grant number 03F0911B, project Coastal Futures.

Meanwhile, climate change is a threat to livestock production because of the impact on quality of feed crop and forage, water availability, animal and milk production, livestock diseases, animal reproduction, and bio-diversity. This study reviews the global impacts of climate change on livestock production, the contribution of livestock production to climate change, and specific climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the livestock sector. Livestock production will be limited by climate variability as animal water consumption is expected to increase by a factor of three, demand for agricultural lands increase due to need for 70% growth in production, and food security concern since about one-third of the global cereal harvest is used for livestock feed. Meanwhile, the livestock sector contributes 14.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driving further climate change. Consequently, the livestock sector will be a key player in the mitigation of GHG emissions and improving global food security. Therefore, in the transition to sustainable livestock production, there is a need for: a) assessments related to the use of adaptation and mitigation measures tailored to the location and livestock production system in use, and b) policies that support and facilitate the implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.

Freshwater environments in the Basin are particularly vulnerable to water scarcity and change. In this paper, governmental responses are assessed to draw global lessons on climate change adaptation for rivers. A range of climate change adaptation measures for freshwater ecosystem conservation in the Basin are outlined namely: higher, long-term allocations of water to the environment; reviewing water allocation on a cyclical basis; allocating an equal or greater share of available water to the environment in dry years; and environmental works and measures to use less water to conserve wetlands. Examples of poor translation of science into policy that do not adequately consider the risks, costs, and benefits of adaptation interventions are explored. Adaptation policy in the Basin illustrates the risks of heavy reliance on infrastructure, of the high costs of trade-offs between environmental measures versus socio-economic and political concerns, and of dependence on too few measures. Lessons include the need for rigorous evaluation of risks, costs, and benefits to minimize perverse outcomes, and for adequate incentives and penalties for implementation of adaptation policies across governance scales. It is concluded that rather than a focus on only a few interventions, such as environmental flows, better adaptation practice requires deployment of a suite of different but complementary measures that spreads risk and maximizes resilience to climate variability and change.

For the governments responsible for the implementation of climate policies, adaptation still represents a novel field of action. The purpose of this paper is to show, via the example of Quebec's coastal zone, how the transformation of public action relating to adaptation remains difficult. Design/methodology/approach-For this case study, a qualitative method which combines documentary analysis and semi-directed interviews was selected. Findings-The study shows how adaptation becomes a new issue in public action for the different authorities dealing with the effects of climate change in Quebec's coastal zone. However, the results show that, as with other public policies, path dependence and incrementalism can be observed and limit the scope of public action and of the transformational processes in the field of adaptation. The technical-scientific approach to risk management is dominant, and the adaptation is not approached in a transversal way, despite its importance. Finally, concrete adaptation initiatives appear to be mostly relegated to the local scale, in an informal decentralization process. Originality/value-This study contributes to improve climate action by favouring a reflection on the consideration of the conceptual and theoretical framework in the climate change adaptation literature and offers decision-makers and practitioners keys to the understanding of mechanisms underlying public action in the field of adaptation.","[Noblet, Melinda] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Univ Ctr Res Publ & Polit Act, Amiens, France; [Noblet, Melinda] Univ Quebec, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Brisson, Genevieve] Univ Quebec, Soc Terr & Dev Dept, Rimouski, PQ, Canada",Picardie Universites; Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV); University of Quebec; University of Quebec,"Noblet, M (corresponding author), Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Univ Ctr Res Publ & Polit Act, Amiens, France.;Noblet, M (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Rimouski, PQ, Canada.",melinda.noblet@gmail.com,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada under the Community-University Research Alliance (CURA) on Coastal Communities Challenges in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence facing climate change (CCC-CURA) program [833-2009-4010],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada under the Community-University Research Alliance (CURA) on Coastal Communities Challenges in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence facing climate change (CCC-CURA) program,This work was supported by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada under the Community-University Research Alliance (CURA) on Coastal Communities Challenges in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence facing climate change (CCC-CURA) program (grant number 833-2009-4010).

A new concept of governance that can answer the challenges of contemporary urban development and ensure long-term sustainable development is required. This study aimed to identify the general framework of adaptive urban governance by review, elaboration, and analysis of documents, in this case, scientific articles that discuss urban governance specifically related to climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR). The results of this study include an overview of governance approaches appearing in the literature on CCA and DRR, which was parsed down to the adaptive and anticipatory approaches. Adaptive governance requires the principle of flexibility applied in the management cycle in policy formulation, while anticipatory governance requires the principle of proactivity with the application of future foresight in policy formulation. The dimension of governance consists of process/mechanism (risk management) and capacity (technical, institutional, financial, and human capacity). Some challenges in building good governance based on an adaptive approach are encouraging community involvement, increasing local government capacities, and building integration between actors, networks, and collaborations.","[Ni'mah, Novi Maulida; Wibisono, Bambang Hari; Roychansyah, Muhammad Sani] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Engn, Dept Architecture & Planning, Architecture, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Ni'mah, Novi Maulida] Inst Teknol Nasl Yogyakarta, Fac Civil Engn & Planning, Study Program Urban & Reg Planning, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University,"Ni'mah, NM (corresponding author), Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Engn, Dept Architecture & Planning, Architecture, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.;Ni'mah, NM (corresponding author), Inst Teknol Nasl Yogyakarta, Fac Civil Engn & Planning, Study Program Urban & Reg Planning, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",novimaulida@itny.ac.id,,,,,,,42,5,5,11,34,ITB JOURNAL PUBL,BANDUNG,"LPPM ITB, ITB RECTORATE BUILDING, 5TH FLR, JALAN TAMANSARI 64, BANDUNG, 40116, INDONESIA",2502-6429,,,J REG CITY PLAN,J.

Utilizing a framework which draws from research examining how farmers' climate change beliefs and experiences affect their adaptation strategies, and research on farm succession and adaptation at the rural-urban interface (RUI), we ask 'How do climate change beliefs and different farm attributes (particularly the presence of an heir and location at the RUI) affect adaptation strategies?' Preliminary findings indicate that adaptation varies based on multiple factors, including belief in climate change, the presence of an heir, geographical location and a variety of other farm characteristics and farmer attributes.","[Castellano, Rebecca L.

They are not only growing sources of greenhouse gases, but (in common with urban settlements in other regions) are also hotspots of vulnerability to floods, heat waves, and other hazards that climate change is expected to aggravate. This paper reviews the existing literature on the climate linkages and the relevance of urban development in LAC. It briefly describes research on existing mitigation and adaptation responses. It then explores why it is important to include a pro-poor perspective in adaptation actions. Although LAC cities have been the sources of many initiatives, policies and actions aimed at mitigating emissions and adapting to climate change, these have focused mostly on mitigation. It has been difficult to promote adaptation at the local level without the necessary support from higher levels of government and the international community. This has left a gap in the support and funding of locally determined, locally driven and necessary adaptation that serves and works with those most at risk. The best opportunities to adapt to climate change are linked with actions that address the underlying causes of vulnerability and respond to more than one problem at a time.","[Hardoy, Jorgelina] IIED AL, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Lankao, Patricia Romero] NCAR, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Hardoy, J (corresponding author), IIED AL, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",jhardoy@iied-al.org.ar,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The research work of Patricia Romero Lankao is supported by the National Science Foundation.

Sufficient climate adaptation efforts will require funding at two or three orders of magnitude above the current levels. For rapid-onset climate events, current ex post disaster finance does not offer strong incentives for risk reduction. This article suggests that insurance-related instruments can be a tool to help in adapting to and ameliorating the negative impacts of climate change for those countries likely to be most negatively affected by climate change. One possibility for an insurance-related mechanism would be a scheme that allows countries (or regions in large developing countries) most affected by climate change to purchase insurance-like coverage for defined climate-related risks. This article refers to such a scheme as the Climate Change Finance Mechanism (CCFM). The attempt to design and implement such an insurance-related mechanism requires careful consideration of several issues, including technical and political challenges. We outline a way to indemnify countries that are likely to suffer most from global climate change and consider what the key design elements would be.","Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWA, Hamburg, Germany",,"Bals, C (corresponding author), Germanwatch Kaiserstr 201, Bonn, Germany.",bals@germanwatch.org,,,,,,,20,15,15,1,17,JAMES & JAMES SCIENCE PUBLISHERS LTD/EARTHSCAN,LONDON,"8-12 CAMDEN HIGH STREET, NW1 0JH LONDON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

A state-of-the-art framework for implementing an integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA), the NOAA IEA approach, is used as an example to demonstrate whether and how assessment in ecosystem-based management (EBM), as often implemented in fisheries, can be expected to facilitate planned adaptation. Using comparisons with another assessment framework developed for implementing a climate change adaptation project, the United Nations Development Programme-Global Environment Facility Adaptation Policy Framework (UNDP-GEF APF), this paper expands and operationalizes the concepts of managing for resilience versus change in EBM as presented by West et al.(). It first introduces a variety of terms from climate change adaptation literature to help institutionalize planned adaptation as a useful concept within fisheries, then presents an expanded map of adaptive management processes in EBM. Finally, it proposes steps for enhancing processes supporting planned adaptation in individual applications of EBM in fisheries. Steps include (i) recognizing interest and funding for adaptation planning as prerequisites, (ii) evaluating what information or actors are lacking to implement better planning, and (iii) determining what institutional processes within an adaptive management cycle need augmentation.","[Woods, Pamela J.] Marine & Freshwater Res Inst, Fornubudir 5, IS-220 Hafnarfjordur, Iceland; [Woods, Pamela J.] Univ Iceland, Fac Life & Environm Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",Marine & Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI); University of Iceland,"Woods, PJ (corresponding author), Marine & Freshwater Res Inst, Fornubudir 5, IS-220 Hafnarfjordur, Iceland.;Woods, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Fac Life & Environm Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",pamela.woods@hafogvatn.is,,,EuroMarine Network through the CoDReG Foresight Workshop [EM/PFB/2017.006]; US National Science Foundation [OCE-1323991]; Nordic Centre for Research on Marine Ecosystems and Resources under Climate Change (NorMER) [36800],EuroMarine Network through the CoDReG Foresight Workshop; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Nordic Centre for Research on Marine Ecosystems and Resources under Climate Change (NorMER),"The preparation of this paper has been supported by the EuroMarine Network (www.euromarinenetwork.eu) through the CoDReG Foresight Workshop EM/PFB/2017.006, US National Science Foundation under Award no.

Sea-level rise (SLR) will result in biophysical and socioeconomic impacts that could increase the loss of livelihoods, cultural heritage and infrastructure. Effective adaptation requires a holistic approach that incorporates scientific knowledge together with local and traditional knowledge. Community-based adaptation built on local knowledge is of great value for environmental management, particularly when scientific data are lacking. This article reports a case study that integrated traditional and scientific knowledge using participatory three-dimensional modeling (P3DM) in BoeBoe village, Solomon Islands. P3DM is a process by which members of the local community build a physical terrain model and overlay it with the location of important resources such as protected areas or harvesting sites. Additionally, SLR inundation scenarios based on surveyed elevations were incorporated into a geographic information system (GIS), allowing for a real-time integration of science with local knowledge. Despite discrepancies in scales and accuracy, information from both the P3DM and GIS were complementary. The process, itself, provided a forum for discussion between many members of the village who would normally not be involved and highlighted the importance of community engagement when building capacity for adaptation to climate change.","[Leon, Javier X.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Leon, Javier X.; Albert, Simon] Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Hardcastle, James] Int Union Conservat Nat, Gland, Switzerland; [James, Robyn] Nature Conservancy, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kereseka, Jimmy] Lauru Land Conf Tribal Community, Choiseul, Solomon Islands; [Woodroffe, Colin D.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast; University of Queensland; Nature Conservancy; University of Wollongong,"Leon, JX (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Locked Bag 4, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia.",jleon@usc.edu.au,"Woodroffe, Colin D/K-5222-2015; Albert, Simon/I-1104-2012; Leon, Javier/J-3971-2012","Woodroffe, Colin D/0000-0003-4476-6158; Albert, Simon/0000-0002-5947-7909; Leon, Javier/0000-0002-4201-5804",Australian Government/AusAid Partnership,Australian Government/AusAid Partnership(Australian Government),"This project should be understood in light of a wider initiative called Building the resilience of communities and their ecosystems to the impact of climate change in the Pacific of the Lauru Land Conference of Tribal Communities and Partners with Melanesians funded by the Australian Government/AusAid Partnership and implemented through The Nature Conservancy (TNC).

Despite the potential for participatory adaptation decision-making, scholarship on adaptation has remained largely separate from the literature on participatory environmental governance. This paper brings these literatures into conversation by applying the concept of transformation to both adaptation outcomes and adaptation decision-making. Through an examination of a disputed flood relief scheme in Cork, Ireland this paper develops three main arguments. (1) It demonstrates the need for analytical approaches which recognise that what constitutes transformative adaptation will vary depending on the definitions of transformation that are used, the contexts in which these definitions are applied, and the perspectives of local stakeholders. (2) It argues that by producing an intractable conflict and damaging the reputation of the organisations responsible for hazards management, public participation failures create formidable new barriers to transformative adaptation outcomes. (3) It concludes that incremental changes to the decision-making process will prove insufficient to overcome these barriers. In order to facilitate more effective public participation in hazards management and climate change adaptation, much wider change in hazards management policy and resourcing will be required.","[Jeffers, James] Bath Spa Univ, Sch Sci, Hazard Risk & Disaster Res Grp, Bath, Avon, England",Bath Spa University,"Jeffers, J (corresponding author), Bath Spa Univ, Sch Sci, Hazard Risk & Disaster Res Grp, Bath, Avon, England.",j.jeffers@bathspa.ac.uk,,"Jeffers, James/0000-0001-6315-9949",Bath Spa University,Bath Spa University,This project was made possible by financial support for fieldwork and write up provided by Bath Spa University.,,47,7,7,6,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,JAN,2020,90,,,,,,,,104333,10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104333,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104333,,,10,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JW5LQ,,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000503093800049,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although we agree with Ostrom's assessment, her arguments regarding the advantages of polycentricity could be taken further. In this paper, we supplement Ostrom's work by fleshing out the reasons of how and why a polycentric approach is more conducive to coping with climate change than national governments that attempt to centrally direct climate change policies. We argue that there are at least six advantages that polycentric systems have for coping with climate change: competition among decision makers, cooperation among decision makers, perceptions of legitimacy that lead to coproduction, mutual learning through experimentation, institutional resilience/robustness, and emergent outcomes that are socially desirable but not centrally planned. The combination of these six factors gives polycentric governance systems distinct advantages over more top-down ones, especially in terms of epistemics and incentive compatibility. Scholars and policymakers who are concerned about the implications of climate change should appreciate the many diverse and nuanced advantages of a polycentric approach for coping with climate change.","[Lofthouse, Jordan K.; Herzberg, Roberta Q.] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",,"Lofthouse, JK (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",jlofthouse@mercatus.gmu.edu,,,,,,,111,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2023,15,4,,,,,,,3770,10.3390/su15043770,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15043770,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,9L1YW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000941353100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is gaining popularity in developing countries, but its operationalization has been slow because of the challenges that hinder its on-ground application. To understand the nature of these challenges, this paper developed a four-stage mixed methodology that examined mainstreaming of CCA into local land use planning in Albay, Philippines. The methodology includes a modified Institutional Analysis and Development framework for the qualitative analysis, and 20 mainstreaming indicators for the quantitative assessment. The data used in the analysis were collected from a survey and the interviews conducted among the key players in local land use planning in Albay. The correlation analysis showed that the challenges related to knowledge and awareness, local government prioritization, institutional incentives, availability of funds, access to funds, and stability of funds had the highest frequency of interconnections with the other challenges. Also, a strong tripartite relationship among local leadership, local government prioritization, and local government's commitment to CCA was observed. The paper suggests that mainstreaming challenges are interconnected at varying degrees. It presents analytical tools and quantifiable measures that can be used to develop a reliable basis for the qualitative assessments of adaptation needs and effectiveness. These sets of information can help analyst and practitioners make informed decisions regarding the operationalization of mainstreaming CCA.","[Cuevas, Sining C.] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Cuevas, SC (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",sining.cuevas@uq.net.au,,,,,,,60,7,7,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

However they are highly vulnerable to climate change as limited alterations in temperature and precipitation may cause harmful effects to water systems. Southern Europe and especially Greece are expected to undergo a drought trend over the next decades, resulting in less recharge for the aquifers and water services reduction. Thus, climate change may distort both natural and socioeconomic characteristics of freshwater ecosystem services deteriorating the general social welfare related to them. This paper examines the economic impacts of climate change on river uses of the Aoos basin in Greece. In this regard, a choice experiment is conducted to estimate the value changes in different ecological and economic services in a mountain community. The econometric simulations using conditional logit, random parameters logit and latent class models reveal that despite existing preference heterogeneity, respondents on average derive positive and significant welfare effects from climate change adaptation measures. The findings of the survey may assist in adaptation planning for the Aoos River basin, with possible extensions to other river systems enduring similar climate change indications.

Existing scholarship suggests that national governments play an important role in providing leadership and resources to support local adaptation policy development. However, less research attention has been devoted to investigating sub-national, regional government initiatives to support local adaptation policy and planning in federal states, despite their financial resources and constitutional responsibility to oversee municipalities. This article analyzes how one sub-national government, the provincial government of Nova Scotia (Canada), activated and motivated local adaptation policy and planning through a combination of policy instruments and municipally focused capacity-building initiatives.

Robust approaches must recognise the intertwined social and ecological vulnerabilities of estuaries. Here, a new governance and management framework is proposed that recognises the integrated social-ecological systems of estuaries so as to permit transformative adaptation to climate change within these systems. The framework lists stakeholders and identifies estuarine uses and values. Goals are categorised that are specific to ecosystems, private property, public infrastructure, and human communities. Systematic adaptation management strategies are proposed with conceptual examples and associated governance approaches. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate the practical application of these ideas. The framework will assist estuary managers worldwide to achieve their goals, minimise maladaptative responses, better identify competing interests, reduce stakeholder conflict and exploit opportunities for appropriate ecosystem restoration and sustainable development.

Although recent assessments of JKP projects have provided some arguments in favor of their societal merit, much less is known about their scientific merit. We explored the latter by developing a conceptual framework addressing characteristics of doing JKP as well as hypotheses on potential merits and pitfalls in terms of its process, output, and impact for science. Semistructured interviews with six environmental science research leaders as well as discussions with five researchers involved in past JKP projects were used to start operationalizing the framework into criteria and compiling a survey. This survey was filled out by 144 researchers involved in Knowledge for Climate, a large Dutch multiactor research program. The findings suggest that, at least in the context of recently carried out Dutch climate adaptation projects, JKP contributes to a broader empirical knowledge base; more reflexivity on the part of researchers; and more publications for policy makers. We conclude this paper by formulating next research steps, including evaluating what would be a proper balance between more versus less participatory forms of scientific knowledge production.","[Hegger, Dries; Dieperink, Carel] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Environm Governance, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Hegger, D (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Environm Governance, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"Hegger, Dries/S-8727-2016","Hegger, Dries/0000-0003-2721-3527; Dieperink, Carel/0000-0002-1926-4642",Dutch National Partnership for Sustainable Earth Research,Dutch National Partnership for Sustainable Earth Research,"This paper is a spin-off of the INSPIRATOR project supported by the Dutch National Partnership for Sustainable Earth Research.

We used open top chamber (OTC) experimental facility and simulation analysis to study the effect of elevated [CO2] with varying nutrients management on rice grain yield and to evaluate planting time adjustment as adaptation to climate change. The OTC experiments with ambient [CO2] level ([CO2] similar to 390 ppm) and elevated [CO2] (25% higher than the ambient) using cultivar 'Swarna sub1 (140-145 days)' were conducted during wet season of the years 2011 and 2012 at West Medinipur, India. Using CERES model, we simulated rice grain yield for future climate scenario (A1B) during the years 2020 (2010-2039) and 2080 (2071-2099) at four selected locations of the subtropical India. The elevated [CO2] in OTC increased panicle number, but decreased filled grain number per panicle, 1000-grain weight and grain yield. The increasing [CO2] had smaller adverse impact for integrated nutrients management as compared with chemical fertiliser. The model simulated grain yield reduction of 6.1-13.0% during 2020 and 14.4 -25.0% during 2080 with rising temperature 1.6 and 4.6 degrees C, respectively, compared with the base period (1961-1990). Early planting during 25 June to 25 July received closure favourable temperature and rainfall during the crop growing period, hence had better adaptation to the climate change. Increasing dose of integrated nutrients and early planting is expected to minimise the adverse impact of climate change on rice production of the subtropical India.","[Satapathy, Sushree Sagarika; Swain, Dillip Kumar] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Agr & Food Engn, POB 721302, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India; [Satapathy, Sushree Sagarika] Int Rice Res Inst, Country Off, POB 522034, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Pasupalak, Surendranath] Orissa Univ Agr & Technol, POB 751003, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; [Herath, Srikantha] United Nations Univ, Inst Sustainabil & Peace, Shibuya Ku, 5-53-70 Jingumae, Tokyo 1508925, Japan",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Orissa University of Agriculture & Technology; United Nations University,"Swain, DK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Agr & Food Engn, POB 721302, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India.",swain@agfe.iitkgp.ac.in,"Swain, Dillip Kumar/V-7909-2019","Swain, Dillip Kumar/0000-0001-9883-3307","National Agricultural Innovation Project, Indian Council of Agricultural Research New Delhi [NAIP/COMP-4/C-30023/2008-09]","National Agricultural Innovation Project, Indian Council of Agricultural Research New Delhi","National Agricultural Innovation Project, Indian Council of Agricultural Research New Delhi is gratefully acknowledged for providing a financial grant (NAIP/COMP-4/C-30023/2008-09, Dated 06-01-2009) for execution of the research project.",,50,0,0,1,12,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1836-0947,1836-5795,,CROP PASTURE SCI,Crop Pasture Sci.,,2019,70,10,,,,,858,867,,10.1071/CP19164,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP19164,,,10,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,JI6AN,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000493548800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Water is the primary medium through which the impacts of climate change will be felt. Securing the water sector and enhancing water security is, therefore, imperative for any adaptive response to climate change. A precursor in improving water security is to first establish a mechanism to measure it. Only then can incremental and progressive actions be evaluated. This study has developed such a mechanism in the form of a water security assessment framework using an indictor-based methodology. The framework is developed for city-scale analysis because analyses at this scale is more useful in operationalizing water security enhancement. The framework has a three-layered structure comprising five dimensions (broad elements of water security), twelve indicators (areas of interest within the dimensions), and a set of potential variables that can be used to quantify the indicators. The framework has been developed to foster practical interventions for water security enhancement and not as a comparative tool for benchmarking. Hence, while the dimensions and indicators of the framework are fixed, the choice of variables is up to the city depending upon its context. This aspect of the framework, therefore, is meant to help cities introspect internally and move up the water security ladder. The framework culminates into a Water Security Index (WSI), measured on a scale from one to five. The scale is linear and hierarchical in its grade value. The framework was successfully used to assess the water security situation of Bangkok. The study also makes a case for scaling up this intervention for other major cities in Thailand, which can then help implement some of Thailand's key climate change adaptation initiatives such as the Nationally Determined Contributions and the National Climate Change Master Plan.","[Babel, Mukand S.; Shinde, Victor R.] Asian Inst Technol, Water Engn & Management, Khlong Nueng, Thailand; [Sharma, Devesh] Cent Univ Rajasthan, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ajmer, India; [Nguyen Mai Dang] Thuyloi Univ, Ctr Int Educ, Hanoi, Vietnam",Asian Institute of Technology; Central University of Rajasthan (CURAJ); Thuyloi University,"Babel, MS (corresponding author), Asian Inst Technol, Water Engn & Management, Khlong Nueng, Thailand.",msbabel@ait.ac.th,"SHARMA, DEVESH/B-4008-2019","Babel, Mukand/0000-0003-4203-0059; SHARMA, DEVESH/0000-0003-4117-4771",Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN),Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN),"The authors are grateful to the support provided by the Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) under grant no.

This paper develops and applies a top-down approach to estimate the costs of adapting to climate change on a consistent basis for different climate scenarios. The analysis separates (a) the costs of maintaining service standards for a baseline projection of demand, and (b) the costs of changes in water use and infrastructure as a consequence of changes in climate patterns. The engineering estimates focus on the direct capital and operating costs of adaptation without relying upon economic incentives to affect patterns of water use. On this assumption, the costs of adaptation are 1-2% of baseline costs for all OECD countries with the main element being the extra cost of water resources to meet higher level of municipal water demand. There are large differences in the cost of adaptation across countries and regions. Adopting an economic approach under which water levies are used to cap total water abstractions leads to a large reduction in the burden of adaptation and generates savings of $6-12 billion per year under different climate scenarios.

We compared a food crop and a horticultural farming system, regarding applied adaptation measures and factors influencing adaptation. The data were based on a field survey of 267 smallholder farmers in Laikipia County of Kenya. A binary logistic regression was conducted against individual adaptation measures to identify determinants of adaptation. Adaptation measures employed by food crop farmers were mainly risk-reducing, such as mixed- and inter-cropping, planting early-maturing crop varieties and early planting. In contrast, horticultural farmers tended to focus more on intensifying crop production and applied crop rotation, irrigation and application of agro-chemicals, artificial fertilizer and manure. Factors positively influencing adaptation included access to extension services and risk perception among horticultural farmers, and access to workforce and farmers groups among food crop farmers. Furthermore, food crop farmers with access to less risk-prone income sources than agriculture seemed to have less motivation to adapt. The study showed that as climate change progresses, social differences between horticultural and food crop farmers are likely to increase, hence leading to inequalities in adaptation at local levels. Adaptation planners need to address these differences if sustainable adaptation is to be achieved.","[Stefanovic, Julia Olivera] Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci, Basel, Switzerland; [Yang, Hong; Kamali, Bahareh] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol Eawag, Dept Syst Anal Integrated Assessment & Modelling, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Zhou, Yuan] Syngenta Fdn Sustainable Agr, Basel, Switzerland; [Ogalleh, Sarah Ayeri] Ctr Training & Integrated Res ASALs Dev CETRAD, Nanyuki, Kenya",University of Basel; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); Syngenta,"Stefanovic, JO (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci, Basel, Switzerland.",juliastefanovic89@gmail.com,"Kamali, Bahareh/AAV-3170-2020; Yang, Hong/AAA-5152-2020","Kamali, Bahareh/0000-0002-8070-0175; ",Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture,Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture(Syngenta),This work was supported by Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture.

As such over the past few decades, a plethora of projects intended to assist communities across the region adapt to future climate change have been developed, channelled through multilateral and bilateral funding mechanisms and implemented in communities across a range of countries. Whether such adaptation projects have been effective in reducing the vulnerability of targeted groups remains unclear. This paper evaluates a climate change adaptation project focused on food security implemented across two communities on Abaiang Island, Kiribati (central Pacific). The project was independently evaluated using the following criteria: appropriateness, equity, efficacy, impact, and sustainability. Data was gathered from focus groups with recipient community members (n = 84) supplemented by interviews (n = 26) with relevant local stakeholders involved in implementation. Results show that while the project inputs (such as tangible and intangible goods and services) were provided, the outcomes of the project were largely ineffective and unsustained amongst the target communities. The main lesson is that local contextual factors-be they social norms, environmental, or local governance and decision-making structures-must be clearly identified, meaningfully acknowledged, and accounted for when designing and implementing local-level adaptation initiatives. This then raises broader questions about who is currently, and who should be defining good adaptation. The answer to this question has ramifications for social justice as well as broader issues for developing effective sustainable responses to the challenges of climate change in such places.","[Piggott-McKellar, Annah E.; McNamara, Karen E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Nunn, Patrick D.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Social Sci, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia",University of Queensland; University of the Sunshine Coast,"Piggott-McKellar, AE (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",a.piggottmckellar@uq.edu.au; karen.mcnamara@uq.edu.au; pnunn@usc.edu.au,"Nunn, Patrick D./C-7864-2011; Nunn, Patrick/ABA-2943-2021","Nunn, Patrick D./0000-0001-9295-5741; Nunn, Patrick/0000-0001-9295-5741; Piggott-McKellar, Annah/0000-0002-2810-9812",,,,,82,9,9,2,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Perception data collected referred back to the past 20 years, with stated implementation addressing current adaptation practices. Results showed that the perception variables, namely, severity, ability to withstand, and internal barriers, were significantly correlated with protection motivation, while protection motivation and stated implementation for water conservation technique were strongly correlated. Structural equation modeling confirmed the mediation role of protection motivation between farmers' stated implementation of adaptation measures and their perception of climate variability. A decrease in soil water storage capacity, degradation of the quality of soil surface structure, and a decrease of the length of the growing season are all factors that motivate farmers to implement an adaptation measure. The cost of the implementation and farmers' vulnerability are factors that prevent implantation of adaptation measures. This study suggested that farmers' resilience should be improved and adaptation measures should be subsidized in order to make them more accessible to farmers.","[Bagagnan, Abdoul Rasmane] West Africa Reg Off, Int Livestock Res Inst, 01 BP 1496, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Ouedraogo, Issa] ICRISAT West & Cent Africa Off, CGIAR Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur CCA, BP 320, Bamako, Mali; [Fonta, William M.] West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, 06 BP 9507, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Sowe, Musa] Univ Gambia, Sch Educ, POB 3530, Serrekunda, Gambia; [Wallis, Anne] Univ Louisville, Dept Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth & Informat Sci, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CGIAR; University of the Gambia; University of Louisville,"Bagagnan, AR (corresponding author), West Africa Reg Off, Int Livestock Res Inst, 01 BP 1496, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.",B.Rasmane@cgiar.org; i.ouedraogo@cgiar.org; fonta.w@wascal.org; msowe@utg.edu.gm; anne.wallis@louisville.edu,,"Fonta, William/0000-0002-1398-3355",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),We received fund on field work from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).,,45,14,14,7,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,JAN,2019,7,1,,,,,,,13,10.3390/cli7010013,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7010013,,,14,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,HJ5IG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000457212900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is surprising given the empirical evidence that indicates how often disasters and armed conflicts collide. To understand better the impact of armed conflict on DRR, this paper develops a conceptual typology that is based on rebel groups' territorial control and on the strength of informal institutions. It documents three main political orders amid conflict: rebel stability; informal stability; and fragmented landscape. These wartime political orders will have different effects on DRR and other development programmes, revealing the importance of desegregating armed conflict to facilitate tailor-made and more efficient interventions. The paper provides empirical evidence from Mali and the Philippines that illustrates the influence of these wartime political orders on DRR programmes.","[Walch, Colin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Walch, Colin] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Uppsala University,"Walch, C (corresponding author), 3 Gamla Torget, S-75105 Uppsala, Sweden.",colin.walch@pcr.uu.se,,,"Swedish Research Council [2016-06389, 2016-00243]",Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"I would like to thank Ayesha Siddiqi and two anonymous peer reviewers for their suggestions and careful reading of this paper.

It is aimed at enhancing the sustainability of rural household livelihoods and livelihood resilience against climate variability and change. However, lack of capacity at local household level could negate the intended benefits of community-based participatory forest management initiatives. This paper examines the local-level forest use and management capacity of rural households in Vhembe district of South Africa with respect to their adaptation strategy to climate change using the concept of livelihood resilience. A stratified proportionate random sampling technique was used to select 366 households from the study area, which were then sampled through a household questionnaire survey. The results showed that households' capacity to participate in, and community leadership ability to mobilize people for participatory forest management was low. Nevertheless, the results revealed a widespread aspiration in the study communities to take part in forest management and development initiatives. This calls for the need for significant technical support for households and community leaders towards promoting participatory forest management as a way of ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of forest-based adaptation interventions.","[Ofoegbu, Chidiebere; Chirwa, P.

This requires forums where such groups can meet in order to enhance understanding, reconcile different views, and potentially assist each other in meeting their respective goals. One means of establishing such an exchange involves serious games. During the ESPREssO (Enhancing Synergies for disaster Prevention in the European Union) project, three such games, referred to as RAMSETE (Risk Assessment Model Simulation for Emergency Training Exercise), were developed. They were based on table-top, role-playing, scenario -based exercises, and their purpose was for stakeholder information elicitation about policy issues related to DRR, DRM, and CCA. Participants in the exercises were assigned roles where they interacted and negotiated in order to deal with the presented scenarios. The scenarios were primarily concerned with selecting an optimal set of policies to deal best with the issue in question. The games, while sometimes including an operational element, were meant to examine the motivations behind the decisions made, rather than to test or to train in response protocols. The participants in general found the games to be useful for framing discussions about complex issues, while their problem-solving character was appreciated and enjoyed. Such games allow stakeholders to openly discuss and challenge ideas, policies, and processes in a manner they would not normally do in their daily activities, with other professionals who they would not necessarily be in frequent contact with.","[Fleming, K.; Petrovic, B.] Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam GFZ, German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect 2-6 Seism Hazard & Risk Dynam, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany; [Abad, J.] Bur Geol & Minieres, Lesquin, France; [Booth, L.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Schueller, L.] Deutsch Komitee Katastropenvorsorge, Bonn, Germany; [Baills, A.] Bur Geol & Minieres, Orleans, France; [Scolobig, A.] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; [Petrovic, B.] OGS Inst Nazl Oceanog & Geofis Sperimentale, Trieste, Italy; [Zuccaro, G.; Leone, M.

Although a broad array of federal resources exists, it is difficult for communities to match their specific needs with appropriate agency programs. We produced an automated, easy-to-use, decision-support tool to facilitate communities' finding of appropriate federal partners. The Automated StrAtegic Prioritization (ASAP) tool combines engineering design methods with semantic vector space models (VSMs) to calculate a similarity score between community climate vulnerabilities and related US federal agency strategic plans (SPs) based on their latent semantic similarities. The VSMs were trained using federal SPs and verified using the corresponding federal agencies' climate change adaptation plans (CCAPs). Two commonly used VSM weighting schemes were tested, and the superior scheme was used in the final ASAP model. The ASAP model was then tested using sector-specific vulnerability statements developed by the community of Keene, New Hampshire for their CCAP. ASAP's results compared well to published records of federal funding data for Keene. ASAP should be a useful tool for communities involved in adaptation planning. The results of ASAP will also be helpful for federal agencies seeking to collaborate on disaster relief efforts. The results presented here demonstrate synergies in community-federal partnerships and federal-federal partnerships that will enable more effective implementation of climate adaptation plans, improve community climate preparedness and resilience, and can help reduce the nation's overall vulnerability to climate change.

Therefore, climate adaptation should be properly considered in both building design and operation stages to reduce the impact. This paper identified the potential adaptation pathways for existing and new residential buildings, by enhancing their adaptive capacity to accommodate the impact and maintain total energy consumption and GHG emissions no more than the current level in the period of their service life. The feasibility of adaptations was demonstrated by building energy simulations using both representative existing and new housing in eight climate zones varying from cold, temperate to hot humid in Australia. It was found that, in heating dominated climates, a proper level of adaptive capacity of residential buildings could be achieved simply by improving the energy efficiency of building envelop. However, in cooling dominated regions, it could only be achieved by introducing additional measures, such as the use of high energy efficient (EE) appliances and the adoption of renewable energy. The initial costs to implement the adaptations were assessed, suggesting that it is more cost-effective to accommodate future climate change impacts for existing and new houses by improving building envelop energy efficiency in cooling dominated regions, but installing on-site solar PVs instead in heating and cooling balanced regions.

This has included a call for historical research that particularizes adaptation in specific locations. This paper responds to this call by using newspaper archives to construct a history of wildfires in County Donegal, Ireland. This study goes beyond existing research that particularizes adaptation, by using this history as a lens through which to evaluate current adaptation policy. In doing so it uncovers problematic mismatches between the experience of local communities living with wildfire hazards and current climate change adaptation policies. National adaptation policy in Ireland presents uncontrolled wildfires as a largely new and unfamiliar hazard that requires innovative management approaches. However, newspaper archives reveal that local communities have adopted a variety of adaptive practices for wildfire hazards for over a century, and that these practices have coevolved with shifting economic, social, political, and cultural contexts. This paper also introduces the concept of non-predominant hazards, that is hazards that are often overlooked, forgotten, or neglected. Historical research on non-predominant hazards can play an important role in making visible trajectories of adaptation for such hazards. This study also points towards how deeper particularization studies that examine the long-term usage of specific adaptation practices can also be used to test the effectiveness of these practices through time, and to offer lessons for contemporary adaptation. These results have implications for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to non-predominant hazards in a variety of contexts.","[Jeffers, James M.] Bath Spa Univ, Sch Sci, Risk & Disaster Res Grp, Hazard, Bath BA2 9BN, Avon, England",Bath Spa University,"Jeffers, JM (corresponding author), Bath Spa Univ, Sch Sci, Risk & Disaster Res Grp, Hazard, Bath BA2 9BN, Avon, England.",j.jeffers@bathspa.ac.uk,,"Jeffers, James/0000-0001-6315-9949",,,,,69,3,3,0,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Many poorer people are still grappling with the scourge of climate change impacts. Consequently, there has been a dominant research focus on climate change financing emanating from official development assistance (ODA), Adaptation Fund, public expenditure and private sector support. However, there has been little attempt to examine how migrants' remittances can close adaptation financing gaps at the local level, ostensibly creating a large research gap. This paper aims to argue that migrants' remittances provide a unique complementary opportunity for financing adaptation and have a wider impact on those who are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is aligned to the qualitative research approach. Both secondary and primary data acquired through interviews and focus group discussions were used for the study. Multiple samplingmethods were also used to select the respondents. Findings - The findings show that remittances are used to finance both incremental costs of households' infrastructure and consumption needs, as well as additional investment needs to be occasioned by ongoing or expected changes in climate. Originality/value - In the wake of dwindling government/public revenue, ODA and poor commitment of Annex II countries to fulfil their financial obligations, the study makes the following recommendations: First, the financial infrastructure underpinning money transfers in both sending and recipient countries should be improved to make transfers attractive. Second, significant steps should be taken to reduce the fees on remittance services, especially for the small transfers typically made by poor migrants. Finally, adequate climatic information should be made available to local people to ensure that remittances are applied to the right adaptation option to avoid maladaptation.","[Musah-Surugu, Issah Justice; Ahenkan, Albert; Bawole, Justice Nyigmah] Univ Ghana, Legon, Ghana; [Darkwah, Samuel Antwi] Mendel Univ Brno, Brno, Czech Republic",University of Ghana; Mendel University in Brno,"Musah-Surugu, IJ (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Legon, Ghana.",musah123@gmail.com,"Darkwah, Samuel Antwi/AAV-9276-2020","Darkwah, Samuel Antwi/0000-0003-3996-7246",,,,,56,17,17,0,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

The objective of this research was to identify citizen participation in the design and management of urban forests as a strategy for guiding cities towards a more sustainable and resilient model in the face of climate change. In this study, changes in the park's land use were identified, 136 park users were interviewed to find out their perception of the benefits of forest cover, and the ecosystem services of Mirador Sur Park were quantified using the i-Tree Canopy tool. It was found that the ecosystem services related to the removal of atmospheric pollutants are clearly perceived by the users of the park. However, there are other services that could not be identified if there is no relationship with the users of the park, such as those related to the benefits of human well-being. Citizens' perception and appropriation are important elements for the co-management of the park, and it would be appropriate for them to become involved in the design and implementation of environmental public policies, as well as nature-based solutions, that contribute to adequate and inclusive urban planning aimed at adapting to climate change.","[Bonilla-Duarte, Solhanlle] Inst Tecnol Santo Domingo INTEC, Ave Los Proceres, Santo Domingo 10100, Dominican Rep; [Bonilla-Duarte, Solhanlle; Rojas Mancebo, Yolanny] Trop Agr & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Turrialba 30501, Costa Rica; [Bonilla-Duarte, Solhanlle; Liz Vargas-de la Mora, Alma] Inst Nacl Invest Forestales Agr & Pecuarias INIFA, Ocozocuautla De Espinosa 29140, Mexico; [Garcia-Garcia, Agustin] Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Av Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain",Instituto Tecnologico de Santo Domingo (INTEC); CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; Universidad de Extremadura,"Garcia-Garcia, A (corresponding author), Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Av Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain.",solhanlle.bonilla@intec.edu.do; yolanny.rojas@catie.ac.cr; vargas.alma@inifap.gob.mx; agarcia@unex.es,"Garcia, Agustin/AAS-3255-2020; Bonilla-Duarte, Solhanlle/L-7927-2016","Garcia, Agustin/0000-0002-3680-5850; Bonilla-Duarte, Solhanlle/0000-0002-0458-1805; Vargas- de la Mora, Alma Liz/0000-0002-2308-9621",Regional Government of Extremadura (Junta de Extremadura) [GR21034]; Research Fund of INTEC,Regional Government of Extremadura (Junta de Extremadura); Research Fund of INTEC,"This research was funded by the Regional Government of Extremadura (Junta de Extremadura) through grants GR21034, and Research Fund of INTEC.",,67,0,0,6,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,APR,2022,13,4,,,,,,,587,10.3390/f13040587,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13040587,,,14,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Forestry,0S3YG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000786212300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This often results in vulnerable urban conditions with limited adaptive capacity to respond to climate change-induced hazards. In response, employing innovative solutions that lever existing unused and underutilized interstitial spaces within the urban fabric for climate change adaptation and mitigation purposes are needed. Essential to this strategy is a better understanding of the quantity and type of potentially available interstitial space. Using a mixed-method approach, this paper analysed the spatial and material condition of unused and underutilized interstitial spaces within a Southern African city. This study organizes these interstitial spaces according to programme, zoning, access, spatial definition, microclimatic characteristics and material use. It undertakes a quantitative assessment identifying seven specific interstitial space types, found in the total study area. Underutilized parking spaces and rooftop spaces are identified as the most prevalent space types with significant climate change adaptation and mitigation potential if appropriately retrofitted. Retrofitting these spaces are relatively effortless, and can ultimately improve the climate change resilience of these cities.","[Hugo, Jan; du Plessis, Chrisna] Univ Pretoria, Dept Architecture, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Hugo, J (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Architecture, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa.",jan.hugo@up.ac.za,"Du Plessis, Chrisna/AGD-8658-2022; Hugo, Jan/F-2557-2018","Du Plessis, Chrisna/0000-0002-9889-6735; Hugo, Jan/0000-0003-4840-2642",,,,,53,5,5,1,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The paper's arguments are 'framed' within a paradigm of systemic and adaptive governing, regulating, planning and managing understood as a nested systemic hierarchy. It is argued that climate change adaptation is best understood as a coevolutionary dynamic, principally, but not exclusively between human beings and the biophysical world. Two forms of 'knowledge brokerage' based on mode 1 (knowledge) and mode 2 (knowing) are distinguished with practical implications. Drawing on extensive research by the authors, eight modalities for enacting 'knowledge brokerage' are introduced. The conditions for or against success in employing these modalities are described. Consistent with the views of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4th Report 2007, it is argued that water managing is a paradigmatic domain for making climate change adaptation 'real' and a systemic issue of global concern at the core of sustainable development.","[Ison, Ray; Collins, Kevin; Colvin, John] Open Univ, Dept Commun & Syst, Open Syst Res Grp, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Ison, Ray] Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Jiggins, Janice] Wageningen Univ, Commun & Innovat Studies Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Roggero, Pier Paolo; Seddaiu, Giovanna] Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Sci Agron & Genet Vegetale Agr, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Roggero, Pier Paolo; Seddaiu, Giovanna; Zanolla, Chiara] Univ Sassari, NRD Desertificat Res Grp, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Steyaert, Patrick] Univ Paris Est, INRA SAD, UR SenS, F-77420 Champs Sur Marne, France; [Toderi, Marco] UNIVPM Polytech Univ Marche, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali & Prod Vegetali, Ancona, Italy",Open University - UK; Monash University; Wageningen University & Research; University of Sassari; University of Sassari; INRAE; Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Ison, R (corresponding author), Open Univ, Dept Commun & Syst, Open Syst Res Grp, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",r.l.ison@open.ac.uk,"Toderi, Marco/I-4299-2019; Toderi, Marco/M-5656-2016; Roggero, Pier Paolo/D-2580-2012","Toderi, Marco/0000-0002-0214-7271; Toderi, Marco/0000-0002-0214-7271; Roggero, Pier Paolo/0000-0002-7269-4334; Collins, Kevin/0000-0002-5716-7536; Ison, Ray/0000-0001-9191-119X","Natural Environment Research Council [ESPA010001, NE/G008582/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/G008582/1, ESPA010001] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,74,58,59,0,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

The environmental, economic, and social benefits of agroforestry can contribute to climate change adaptation efforts; however, most studies to date are quantitative and do not focus on specific natural hazards. To address these gaps, this study draws from the concepts of vulnerability and adaptation to explore how individuals from 20 smallholder farming households in semi-arid Isiolo County, Kenya have benefited from their agroforestry trees during drought and flood events. A total of 83 qualitative interviews were conducted with both male and female household heads. The interviews were recorded, and interview text was coded into major themes. The results highlight (1) the contributions of agroforestry trees to reducing sensitivity and increasing adaptive capacity to drought and flood events, as well as (2) the key characteristics of drought-important and flood-important agroforestry trees. In both drought and flood events agroforestry had an important role to play in reducing sensitivity, largely through improving environmental conditions (shade, soil erosion, windbreaker, microclimate regulation), and increasing adaptive capacity by providing critical tree products and financial benefits (fruit, food, firewood, construction materials, fodder, traditional medicines, money from sales of fruit products). Agriculture is often considered the livelihood strategy most vulnerable to climate change, and thus better understanding how to adapt agriculture to the impacts of climate change is critical for both the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and global food security efforts.","[Quandt, Amy] San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Quandt, A (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",aquandt@sdsu.edu,"Quandt, Amy/AAP-1716-2021","Quandt, Amy/0000-0001-7434-1500",US Borlaug Fellows in Global Food Security Graduate Research Grant [206766],US Borlaug Fellows in Global Food Security Graduate Research Grant,This study was funded by the US Borlaug Fellows in Global Food Security Graduate Research Grant (Grant Number 206766) which supported field and research costs for Quandt.,,30,7,7,5,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,1572-9680,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

The index provides a realistic approach to recognize social and natural factors which contribute to successful adaptation and addresses several household functions, such as social networking, livelihood strategy, adjustment strategies, resource availability and accessibility. The proposed Adaptation Capability Index (ACI) is analytically defined, mathematically formulated and field tested on mountainous households in urban and semi-urban regions of the Uttarakhand Himalaya in India. To gather data on the topic relevant to the ACI, a household scale questionnaire was developed and administered to 120 heads of households through face-to-face interviews. The results highlight higher adaptive capability of urban households and low adaptation capacity of rural households due to poor farm productivity, low accessibility and availability of resources and technological input. Future programs and policies must include and implement regulations to remedy attributive factors responsible for higher adaptation. This paper may be applicable to other mountainous regions and may provide insights for effective adaptation strategies to climate change.","[Pandey, Rajiv] ICFRE, Biodivers & Climate Change Div, Dehra Dun 248006, India; [Maithani, Nandini; Gupta, Ajay K.] Forest Res Inst, Dehra Dun 248006, India; [Aretano, Roberta; Zurlini, Giovanni] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Archie, Kelli M.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Pandey, Vishnu Prasad] AITM, Lalitpur 44700, Nepal",Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE); Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE); Forest Research Institute (FRI); University of Salento; Victoria University Wellington,"Pandey, R (corresponding author), ICFRE, Biodivers & Climate Change Div, Dehra Dun 248006, India.",rajivfri@yahoo.com; nandinimaithani12@gmail.com; roberta.aretano@unisalento.it; giovanni.zurlini@unisalento.it; kelli.archie@vuw.ac.nz; ajayfrik@gmail.com; e_vishnupandey@yahoo.com,", RAJIV/AAE-6333-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Pandey, Rajiv/F-2657-2010; , Rajiv/N-9631-2019; Gupta, Ajay Kumar/HNI-1019-2023",", RAJIV/0000-0001-7407-3550; , Rajiv/0000-0003-4849-775X; Pandey, Vishnu/0000-0001-5258-7446; Archie, Kelli/0000-0001-9348-8073; Aretano, Roberta/0000-0001-6871-8105",,,,,54,34,34,3,36,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1672-6316,1993-0321,,J MT SCI-ENGL,J Mt.

This is especially true for small island developing states (SIDS), a group of 58 countries spread across three main geographic regions, which are acknowledged as being disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In many instances, the dynamics of these arrangements in SIDS are poorly understood and documented. This study helps to fill this gap by identifying and analyzing networks of action situations through semi-structured interviews with 14 national and international climate change officials and practitioners in four SIDS (Comoros, Maldives, Seychelles, and Singapore) in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans region. We find that there are a few strategic actors involved in multiple, mutually reinforcing and sometimes conflicting arrangements, which are simultaneously being shaped and reshaped at different scales. We also find varying patterns of power, politics and participation that act as both drivers of and barriers to adaptation in these countries. By deconstructing institutional interlinkages and strategic feedback loops, this paper contributes to a broader understanding of the complexities of environmental governance in small jurisdictions.","[Robinson, Stacy-ann; Carlson, D'Arcy] Colby Coll, Environm Studies Dept, Mayflower Hill Dr, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Bouton, Emma; Dolan, Mara; Meakem, Allison; Messer, Anna; Roberts, J.

We examine whether the needs of the poor influence mitigation and adaptation policies in the region. The continent is characterized by an interesting dynamic between inequality and climate change: it is predicted to disproportionately bear the effects of climate change, at the same time that it accounts for four out of the top five countries with the starkest inequality globally. In our analysis, we construct a statistical measure of social inequality for a group of 54 African countries and use the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to obtain corresponding data on mitigation and adaptation policy actions. We then estimate the intensity of the responsiveness of the latter to the former. Using fractional regression and data imputation methods, we find a statistically significant negative relationship between social inequality and climate change policy actions in Africa. Across African countries, mitigation and adaptation actions fall by about 23% for every 1% rise in social inequality. African countries are therefore not responding to climate change threats in ways that simultaneously reduce social inequality and adapt to climate change. Furthermore, there is some evidence that countries emitting more pollutants are less likely to take action to address climate change. Our results imply that in order to address differences in the burden of climate change in Africa, a re-evaluation of current policy actions is warranted. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of this study is to use text mining to review the climate change literature and study the evolution of the main trends over time. Specific keywords from articles published in the special issue  Industrial Ecology for Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience in the Journal of Industrial Ecology are first selected. Details of over 35,000 publications containing these keywords are downloaded from the Web of Science from 1990 to 2018. The number of publications and co-occurrence of keywords are analyzed. Moreover, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-a probabilistic approach that can retrieve topics from large and unstructured text documents-is applied on the abstracts to uncover the main topics (consisting of new terms) that naturally emerge from them. The evolution in time of the importance of some emerging topics is then analyzed on the basis of their relative frequency. Overall, a rapid growth in climate change publications is observed. Terms such as climate change adaptation appear on the rise, whereas other terms are declining such as pollution. Moreover, several terms tend to co-occur frequently, such as climate change adaptation and resilience.

Traditional knowledge can help to provide efficient, appropriate and time-tested ways of responding to climate change especially in far-flung communities. However, little is known about how traditional coping strategies translate into adaptation to long-term changes, and to what degree they prevent pro-active, transformational responses to climate change. This paper assesses the use of climate related information for communities in the Himalayan foothills of rural India, and reports on the barriers to adaptation planning and actions. Surveys have been carried out to analyze the current practices and the role of information in planning for climate change adaptation in the rural areas of the Nainital region of India located in Western Himalaya. Respondents perceive the local climate change, the intensity of change, and the negative impacts on the community and landscape. Decreases in water quantity and changes in precipitation patterns are among the major concerns for respondents, however, communities have begun to use traditional knowledge and historical climate information for developing strategies suitable to cope with impacts of climate change. Going forward, additional information is needed to match the high priority community needs with viable adaptation strategies. Lack of money, lack of access to information, and lack of awareness or understanding are considered the three largest hurdles besides low priority for adaptation, recognized by community members as barriers to adaptation planning and actions. Adaptation plans must be integrated into both top-down and bottom-up approaches to plan for enabling sustainable development and the efficient use of information for adaptation. Finally, tradititilkal knowledge seems to be useful not only in contrasting climate change impacts, but also in recovering several ecosystem services that work all together for enanching the quality of life of villagers at local scale.","[Pandey, Rajiv; Gupt, Ajay K.] ICFRE, Dehra Dun, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kumar, Praveen; Joshi, P.

This research explores the potential influence of climate-driven environmental change on visitation to North America's most popular glacier, the Athabasca Glacier in Jasper National Park, Canada. Photorealistic environmental visualizations were used to gauge visitors' perceptions of environmental change and potential impacts on consumer behaviour. Results suggest that impacts could substantially diminish the site's pull as a tourism destination. Rather than improving visitation prospects, expert-proposed adaptations underestimated the importance of perceived naturalness and contributed to further potential decline. Findings are relevant to protected areas planning and management. They suggest that a natural path to climate change adaptation is the best way to support both ecological integrity and the long-term tourism pull of protected areas.","[Groulx, Mark] Univ Northern British Columbia, Sch Environm Planning, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Lemieux, Christopher J.] Wilfred Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Lewis, John L.; Brown, Sarah] Univ Waterloo, Sch Planning, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Northern British Columbia; Wilfrid Laurier University; University of Waterloo,"Groulx, M (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Sch Environm Planning, Prince George, BC, Canada.",mark.groulx@unbc.ca,,"Lemieux, Christopher/0000-0002-4780-2006",Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-2012-0441]; Wilfred Laurier University,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Wilfred Laurier University,This research was supported by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada under [grant number 430-2012-0441] and by a Wilfred Laurier University short-term research grant.,,65,35,35,1,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Climate change and its impacts fundamentally affect the transition to sustainable development. Therefore beside sustainability, resilience is getting more and more popular in urban research. Despite the academic relevance, it is barely understood how these paradigms affect each other, particularly in practice. People, economic functions and related environmental encumbrances are densified in cities that are main contributors of global warming and related extreme weather events. Thus, urban areas play a crucial role in the adaptation to changing conditions. This study attempts to identify how the core spatial planning actions limit sustainability and resilience at the micro-level. The study area is the 17th District of Budapest, the capital of Hungary, but the used method can be adapted to other settlements based on local circumstances. Aspects of strong sustainability, adaptation to climate change, and lock-in are taken into account in three different but associated ex-ante surveys. Direct and indirect effects are deeply considered in the presented framework as part of a complex impact assessment. The elaborated method eases the identification of trade-offs, synergies, and potential lock-ins among the key projects at the design stage; hence it can be a beneficial ex-ante tool for decision-makers. The presented analysis can be used universally; however, the results depend significantly on local conditions, purposes, and the defined adaptation aspects. The applied methodology provides decision-making in urban development with a novel input, which was not or barely considered before, despite the fact that adaptation to climate change as a horizontal part of sustainable development is crucial. it is shown that these aspects can stay hidden in a comprehensive sustainability assessment. The identified adverse effects should not automatically mean the cancellation of the project. On the contrary, they can open decision-makers' and planners' eyes to potential issues, which risk long-term transition to sustainability. Besides, they indicate where more conscious and profound planning and implementing is required. In sum, the elaborated method is capable of a complex ex-ante impact assessment of urban planning projects. It can unveil previously hidden aspects of sustainability and potential path dependencies thus, it can be a useful tool for decision-makers and urban planners. After a short introduction, an academic review sums up linkages between the paradigms of sustainability and resilience. Then the description of the study area and methods are discussed, followed by the analysis of results, including synergies and trade-offs of the three ex-ante cases Finally, the potentials, limits, and challenges of the elaborated impact assessments are featured in the conclusion with recommendations for further research paths.","[Buzasi Attila; Csizovszky Anna] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ, Magyar Tudosok Krt 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Buzasi, A (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ, Magyar Tudosok Krt 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",buzasi.attila@gtk.bme.hu; cs.anna46@gmail.com,"Buzási, Attila/AAG-1339-2020","Buzási, Attila/0000-0002-4088-9276",,,,,50,0,0,3,12,"CENTRE ECONOMIC & REGIONAL STUDIES, HUNGARIAN ACAD SCI, INST REGIONAL STUD",BUDAPEST,"BUDAORSI 45 III EMELET, BUDAPEST, H-1112, HUNGARY",2062-9923,,,TER TARSAD,Ter Tarsad.,,2021,35,1,,,,,72,91,,10.17649/TET.35.1.3291,http://dx.doi.org/10.17649/TET.35.1.3291,,,20,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,QM5IB,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000621811800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

One concrete objective consists in setting a reduction target, by which cities commit to reduce their baseline GHG emissions for a chosen target year. In monitoring their emissions, cities report inventories for any arbitrary year(s), making available only discrete readings in what can be considered a very sparse yearly time series. Examining the performance of the cities for the target years of 2020 and 2030, the actual measurements are usually not available. Therefore, a machine learning methodology is proposed to predict the GHG emissions inventories for each city on their target year, enabling the assessment of the cities' performance inside a common reporting framework. Using the reported inventories, the methodology identifies a model for each city, minimizing the error for the last known reported value. As a result, the proposed method allows predicting GHG emissions for cities from their yearly inventories, controlling the uncertainty associated to the estimations and extracting reliable information that can be updated as soon as new emissions inventories become available.","[Franco, Camilo; Melica, Giulia; Treville, Aldo; Pisoni, Enrico; Bertoldi, Paolo; Thiel, Christian] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Ispra, Italy; [Baldi, Marta Giulia] Piksel srl, Milan, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Franco, C (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Ispra, Italy.",camilo.franco-de-los-rios@ec.europa.eu; giulia.melica@ec.europa.eu; aldo.treville@ec.europa.eu; giulia.melica@ec.europa.eu; enrico.pisoni@ec.europa.eu; paolo.bertoldi@ec.europa.eu; christian.thiel@ec.europa.eu,"; Franco, Camilo/F-5178-2015","Pisoni, Enrico/0000-0001-5484-5744; Franco, Camilo/0000-0002-2006-3821; Thiel, Christian/0000-0001-6439-5775",,,,,33,0,0,11,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

Several adaptation and mitigation strategies to counteract climate change impacts have been proposed for these ecosystems. However, effective implementation of such strategies requires a clear understanding of how climate change will influence the future distribution of forest ecosystems. This study uses maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt) to predict environmentally suitable areas for cork oak (Quercus suber) woodlands, a socio-economically important forest ecosystem protected by the European Union Habitats Directive. Specifically, we use two climate change scenarios to predict changes in environmental suitability across the entire geographical range of the cork oak and in areas where stands were recently established. Up to 40 % of current environmentally suitable areas for cork oak may be lost by 2070, mainly in northern Africa and southern Iberian Peninsula. Almost 90 % of new cork oak stands are predicted to lose suitability by the end of the century, but future plantations can take advantage of increasing suitability in northern Iberian Peninsula and France. The predicted impacts cross-country borders, showing that a multinational strategy, will be required for cork oak woodland adaptation to climate change. Such a strategy must be regionally adjusted, featuring the protection of refugia sites in southern areas and stimulating sustainable forest management in areas that will keep long-term suitability. Afforestation efforts should also be promoted but must consider environmental suitability and land competition issues.","[Correia, Ricardo A.; Palmeirim, Jorge M.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Change cE3c, Dept Anim Biol, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Correia, Ricardo A.; Franco, Aldina M.

Due to rising temperatures throughout the tropics, pressures for adaptation will be greatest in some of the poorest parts of the world where the adaptive capacity is least abundant. We discuss both autonomous (market driven) and planned adaptations, distinguishing: (a) those that can be undertaken with existing technology, (b) those that involve development of new technologies, and (c) those that involve institutional/market and policy reforms. The paper then proceeds to identify which of these adaptations are currently modeled in integrated assessment studies and related analyses at global scale. This, in turn, gives rise to recommendations about how these models should be modified in order to more effectively capture climate change adaptation in the farm and food sector. In general, we find that existing integrated assessment models are better suited to analyzing adaptation by relatively well-endowed producers operating in market-integrated, developed countries. They likely understate climate impacts on agriculture in developing countries, while overstating the potential adaptations. This is troubling, since the need for adaptation will be greatest amongst the lower income producers in the poorest tropical countries. This is also where policies and public investments are likely to have the highest payoff. We conclude with a discussion of opportunities for improving the empirical foundations of integrated assessment modeling with an emphasis on the poorest countries. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

There is a need to integrate climate change-related concerns into consciousness to understand this concept, which involves a radical transformation. For this, Romanian farmers' level of climate change consciousness was assessed considering three layers: affective, cognitive, and conative. The Introduction of new crops (not GMOs) was the climate change adaptation measure adopted by most farmers. The variables that predicted the implementation of climate change adaptation measures were identified using regression analyses.

Adaptive capacity, resource dependence, local climate change exposure and biological sensitivity were used to assess socioeconomic vulnerability to climate change in three Australian coastal communities: St Helens, Tasmania; Bowen, Queensland; and Geraldton, Western Australia. Higher adaptive capacity was associated with larger population size (i.e., Geraldton) whereas greater resource dependence, and lower human and natural capital were associated with smaller populations (St Helens and Bowen). Socioeconomic vulnerability was greatly influenced by climate exposure and sensitivity with the moderately sized Bowen having the highest socioeconomic vulnerability to climate change. Adaptation strategies that utilized available assets, improved adaptive capacity, or reduced socioeconomic vulnerability were identified in partnership with local communities, including increased and diversified employment opportunities, the re-establishment of local fish markets, and improved education and communication. The level of resources, or capitals, available to communities can indicate where barriers and enablers to adaptation exist. Identified barriers to adaptation included a heavy reliance on one sector for employment and a lack of physical capital. We demonstrate that knowledge of intrinsic community characteristics can be beneficial for prioritizing adaptation actions to reduce socioeconomic vulnerability to marine climate change.","[Metcalf, Sarah J.; Tull, Malcolm] Murdoch Univ, Sch Management & Governance, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [van Putten, Elizabeth I.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [van Putten, Elizabeth I.; Frusher, Stewart; Haward, Marcus; Hobday, Alistair J.; Holbrook, Neil J.; Jennings, Sarah M.; Pecl, Gretta T.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Frusher, Stewart; Haward, Marcus; Holbrook, Neil J.; Pecl, Gretta T.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Marshall, Nadine A.] CSIRO Land & Water Flagship, Acton, ACT, Australia; [Caputi, Nick] Dept Fisheries, Perth, WA, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere Flagship, Acton, ACT, Australia; [Jennings, Sarah M.] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Shaw, Jenny] Curtin Univ, Sustainabil Policy Inst, Bentley, WA, Australia",Murdoch University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; Curtin University,"Metcalf, SJ (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Sch Management & Governance, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",,"Hobday, Alistair/A-1460-2012; Holbrook, Neil J/M-7544-2013; Haward, Marcus/G-3369-2014; Pecl, Gretta/D-7267-2011; Marshall, Nadine/D-9339-2011","Hobday, Alistair/0000-0002-3194-8326; Holbrook, Neil J/0000-0002-3523-6254; Haward, Marcus/0000-0003-4775-0864; Pecl, Gretta/0000-0003-0192-4339; Marshall, Nadine/0000-0003-4463-3558",Fisheries Research and Development Corporation [FRDC 2010/542]; ARC Future Fellowship,Fisheries Research and Development Corporation; ARC Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council),"This study was funded by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC 2010/542).

We build on David Harvey's notion of activity space to derive a framework and research agenda for climate change adaptation seen as a political decision-point and as an opportunity for transformation, incremental adjustment or resistance to change in development pathway. Decision-making is unpacked through the notion of the activity space into seven coevolving sites: the individual, technology, livelihoods, discourse, behaviour, the environment and institutions.

The first process, led by a German-financed research team, developed climate change scenarios using innovative tools. The second, Chance2Sustain, brought spatial perspectives to urban development and water governance, mapping spatial inequities in water-related vulnerabilities and including community-based knowledge. The Metropolitan Municipality of Lima (MML) initiated the third process, to prepare a city development and Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. This paper examines how these processes of knowledge construction contributed to transitions in water governance and climate change adaptation strategies. Although all processes used concertacion((1)) in their knowledge construction, the actors and the incorporated knowledge differed considerably. While the first example was dominated by professional groups and technical-professional knowledge, the Chance2Sustain and city processes included a wider range of actors and shifted thinking about adaptive management towards including contextual-embedded knowledge.","[Miranda Sara, Liliana] Foro Ciudades La Vida FORO, Lima, Peru; [Miranda Sara, Liliana; Baud, Isa] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Human Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Sara, LM (corresponding author), Vargas Machuca 408, Lima, Peru.",lmiranda@ciudad.org.pe; i.s.a.baud@uva.nl,,"Miranda Sara, Liliana Raquel/0000-0001-5555-931X; Baud, Isa/0000-0001-5801-6193",,,,,22,12,12,2,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

Producers will need to adapt to climate change if they, and the communities dependent on them, are to remain viable. There are essentially two ways to adapt-incrementally and transformationally. We differentiate between incremental and transformative adaptation mostly on the basis of the size of the change needed. Here, we studied the Australian peanut industry, which is already experiencing the effects of climate change. We expand on the notion of adaptive capacity and refer to 'transformational capacity' and test its association with resource dependency. Resource dependency is a measure of the interactions that primary producers have with a natural resource and includes factors such as occupational identity, networks, resource use as well as a range of financial factors. We hypothesized that some primary producers were more likely to demonstrate higher levels of transformational capacity if they possessed lower levels of resource dependency. We surveyed, by phone, 69 farmers representing 87 % of the peanut industry in northern Australia. Our results show that the capacity to transform depends upon individual's networks, their employability, tendency for strategic thinking and planning, business profitability, local knowledge, environmental awareness, use of irrigation and use of climate technology. Barriers to transformational change were occupational identity, place attachment and dependents. Our study is one of the first to focus on transformational capacity. This approach allows us to understand why some individuals are better able to adapt to change than others and also to assist industry and community leaders to develop broad-scale strategies.","[Marshall, Nadine Anne] James Cook Univ, CSIRO Ecosyst Sci & Climate Adaptat Flagship, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Dowd, Anne-Maree] CSIRO Sci Soc & Climate Adaptat Flagship, Dutton, Qld 4001, Australia; [Fleming, Aysha] CSIRO Sci Soc & Climate Adaptat Flagship, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Gambley, Clair; Jakku, Emma; Thorburn, Peter John] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci & Climate Adaptat Flagship, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Howden, Mark; Park, Sarah] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci & Climate Adaptat Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Larsen, Carl] RM Consulting Grp, Camberwell, Vic 3124, Australia; [Marshall, Paul Augustine] Great Barrier Reef Marine Pk Author, Townsville, Qld 4801, Australia; [Moon, Katie] Univ Canberra, ANZSOG Inst Governance, Bruce, ACT 2601, Australia; [Moon, Katie] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Bruce, ACT 2601, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); James Cook University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Canberra; University of Canberra,"Marshall, NA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, CSIRO Ecosyst Sci & Climate Adaptat Flagship, ATSIP Bldg, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",nadine.marshall@csiro.au,"Jakku, Emma/G-9340-2011; Thorburn, Peter J/A-6884-2011; Fleming, Aysha/E-8753-2011; Howden, Stuart M/C-1138-2008; Marshall, Nadine/D-9339-2011","Jakku, Emma/0000-0001-8083-5785; Thorburn, Peter J/0000-0002-6506-0456; Fleming, Aysha/0000-0001-9895-1928; Howden, Stuart M/0000-0002-0386-9671; Marshall, Nadine/0000-0003-4463-3558; Moon, Katie/0000-0003-2538-9262; Brandon, Clare/0000-0002-8426-8412; jakku, srikanth/0000-0002-8611-1021","CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship; Department of Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries, Australia","CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Department of Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries, Australia(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Agriculture and Water Resources)","The authors are sincerely grateful to the 69 farmers who agreed to participate in the study and to Rebecca Vallis who interviewed them.

The study particularly evaluates the role of perceived climate extremes (frequency of dry spells and droughts), early warning information, and access to private ranch grazing, in determining response decisions to climate change. Besides, we test if households jointly adopt climate change adaptation strategies. The primary data collected from 440 sample households was analyzed using the multivariate probit (MVP) model. In the MVP model, we consider the following measures: increased mobility (distance & frequency), storage/purchase of fodder, change in water management, partial shift to other livelihoods, and herd management. The results reveal that these adaptation strategies are jointly adopted by pastoralists as complements and substitutes. From the empirical result, the perceived increase in the number of dry spells and drought, access to early warning information, access to private ranch grazing, main market distance from homesteads, and the highest level of education in the household are the key determinants of the choices of adaptation strategies to cope with drought and climate change. From a policy perspective, this research contributes to the ongoing debate on best practices by addressing climate change-related challenges in semi-arid land management. Therefore, there is a need for early warning institutions to increase their visibility in the semi-arid areas by exploring effective methods of delivering climate risk information in good time. Improving access to market and private ranch grazing should be promoted in the Kenyan semi-arid areas. Given that pastoralists' perceptions of climate change and climate risk is a decisive variable in adaptation decision-making, there is need to improve the understanding of pastoralists' changing climatic conditions. Furthermore, since the results indicate that mobility and storage of fodder are substitutes, the adoption of hay production could become a key production strategy for pastoralists which will increase the competitiveness of their livestock in the market and increase milk production.","[Ndiritu, S.

Some authors have suggested that riparian ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts due to their high levels of exposure and sensitivity to climatic stimuli, and their history of degradation. Others have highlighted the probable resilience of riparian ecosystems to climate change as a result of their evolution under high levels of climatic and environmental variability. We synthesize current knowledge of the vulnerability of riparian ecosystems to climate change by assessing the potential exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of their key components and processes, as well as ecosystem functions, goods and services, to projected global climatic changes. We review key pathways for ecological and human adaptation for the maintenance, restoration and enhancement of riparian ecosystem functions, goods and services and present emerging principles for planned adaptation. Our synthesis suggests that, in the absence of adaptation, riparian ecosystems are likely to be highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. However, given the critical role of riparian ecosystem functions in landscapes, as well as the strong links between riparian ecosystems and human well-being, considerable means, motives and opportunities for strategically planned adaptation to climate change also exist. The need for planned adaptation of and for riparian ecosystems is likely to be strengthened as the importance of many riparian ecosystem functions, goods and services will grow under a changing climate. Consequently, riparian ecosystems are likely to become adaptation 'hotspots' as the century unfolds.","[Capon, Samantha J.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Chambers, Lynda E.] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Mac Nally, Ralph] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Biodivers, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Naiman, Robert J.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Naiman, Robert J.; Davies, Peter] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Excellence Nat Resource Management, Albany, WA 6330, Australia; [Marshall, Nadine] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Pittock, Jamie] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Reid, Michael] Univ New England, Sch Behav Cognit & Social Sci, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia; [Capon, Timothy] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Douglas, Michael] Charles Darwin Univ, NERP Northern Australia Hub, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Douglas, Michael] Charles Darwin Univ, Trop Rivers & Coastal Knowledge Res Hub, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Catford, Jane] Univ Melbourne, Sch Bot, Melbourne, Vic 2689, Australia; [Catford, Jane] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Baldwin, Darren S.] La Trobe Univ, CSIRO Land & Water, Wodonga, Vic 3689, Australia; [Baldwin, Darren S.] La Trobe Univ, Murray Darling Freshwater Res Ctr, Wodonga, Vic 3689, Australia; [Stewardson, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3689, Australia; [Roberts, Jane] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Parsons, Meg] Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat Hlth, Melbourne, Vic 3689, Australia; [Williams, Stephen E.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Ctr Trop Biodivers & Climate Change, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",Griffith University; Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Monash University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Western Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University; University of New England; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Charles Darwin University; Charles Darwin University; University of Melbourne; Australian National University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); La Trobe University; La Trobe University; Murray Darling Basin Authority; University of Melbourne; Charles Sturt University; University of Melbourne; James Cook University,"Capon, SJ (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",s.capon@griffith.edu.au,"Capon, Tim R/J-5911-2013; Stewardson, Michael J/C-8678-2015; Catford, Jane/N-1253-2019; Catford, Jane/B-9578-2012; Williams, Stephen E/A-7250-2008; Douglas, Michael M/I-3149-2012; Capon, Samantha J/L-4944-2019; Pittock, Jamie/N-1541-2018; Marshall, Nadine/D-9339-2011; Capon, Samantha J/B-6937-2009; Baldwin, Darren S/H-2257-2011; Parsons, Meg/C-2405-2019","Capon, Tim R/0000-0002-5443-6710; Stewardson, Michael J/0000-0003-1356-0472; Catford, Jane/0000-0003-0582-5960; Catford, Jane/0000-0003-0582-5960; Williams, Stephen E/0000-0002-2510-7408; Douglas, Michael M/0000-0003-3650-3374; Pittock, Jamie/0000-0001-6293-996X; Marshall, Nadine/0000-0003-4463-3558; Capon, Samantha J/0000-0002-1975-553X; Parsons, Meg/0000-0001-8721-659X; Reid, Michael/0000-0002-3948-9347",,,,,103,224,243,10,310,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,APR,2013,16,3,,,,,359,381,,10.1007/s10021-013-9656-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-013-9656-1,,,23,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,145FA,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000318999000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We also examine the alternative hypothesis that rangeland ecosystems and the people they support are highly vulnerable to climate change. Past climate is likely to become an increasingly poor predictor of the future, so there is a risk in relying on adaptation approaches developed solely in response to existing variability. We find incremental, autonomous adaptation will be sufficient to deal with most of the challenges provided by the gradual expression of climate change in the next decade or two. However, projections of greater climate change in the future means that the responses required are qualitatively as well as quantitatively different and are beyond the existing suite of adaptation strategies and coping range. The proactive adaptation responses required go well beyond incremental on-farm or local actions. New policies will be needed to deal with transformational changes associated with land tenure issues and challenges of some displacement and migration of people in vulnerable parts of rangelands. Even where appropriate adaptation actions can be framed, issues of when to act and how much to act in a proactive way remain a challenge for research, management, and policy. Whether incremental or transformational involving system changes, a diversity of adaptation options will be required in different rangeland regions to enhance social and ecological resilience.","[Ash, Andrew] CSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Thornton, Philip] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Stokes, Chris] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Townsville, Qld 4814, Australia; [Togtohyn, Chuluun] Natl Univ Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar 14250, Mongolia; [Togtohyn, Chuluun] Dryland Sustainabil Inst, Ulaanbaatar 14250, Mongolia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); National University of Mongolia,"Ash, A (corresponding author), CSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",Andrew.Ash@csiro.au,"Thornton, Philip/AAB-8806-2020; Stokes, Chris J/G-5199-2010; Stokes, Chris/AAR-2890-2021; Ash, Andrew J/D-5237-2012","Thornton, Philip/0000-0002-1854-0182; Stokes, Chris J/0000-0003-1576-2457; Stokes, Chris/0000-0003-1576-2457; Ash, Andrew/0000-0001-9156-6664",,,,,44,29,29,2,44,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",1550-7424,1551-5028,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

Here, we assess the potential of a variety of sustainable land management practices that, beyond addressing specific and local issues, assist in tackling Mediterranean Basin-wide land-use challenges. With this work, we aim to highlight those options that simultaneously promote local and regional Basin-wide adaptation. To do that, we developed a novel multi-objective assessment that evaluates the effectiveness of 104 practices adopted within the Mediterranean Basin and documented in the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies global database. Results indicate that agroforestry and green covers in perennial woody crops can promote multiple ecosystem services while addressing climate change adaptation. We further argue that these two practices together with reforestation, assist in regulating the hydrological cycle of the Basin and in maintaining its multifunctional landscape. Lastly, we reflect on potential biophysical and socio-economic barriers and opportunities associated with the implementation of the three practices. Our approach provides a Basin-wide integrated view that facilitates the coordination of sustainable management strategies across the Mediterranean region.","[Ruiz, Itxaso; Almagro, Maria; Garcia de Jalon, Silvestre; del Mar Sola, Maria; Jose Sanz, Maria] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Sci Campus UPV EHU,Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor, Leioa 48940, Bizkaia, Spain; [Almagro, Maria] Spanish Natl Res Council CEBAS CSIC, Murcia, Spain; [Jose Sanz, Maria] Ikerbasque Basque Fdn Sci, Bilbao, Spain",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Edafologia y Biologia Aplicada del Segura (CEBAS); Basque Foundation for Science,"Ruiz, I (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Sci Campus UPV EHU,Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor, Leioa 48940, Bizkaia, Spain.",itxaso.ruiz@bc3research.org,"Almagro, María/A-9722-2016; Sanz Sanchez, Maria Jose/A-6099-2016","Almagro, María/0000-0003-2585-9893; Sanz Sanchez, Maria Jose/0000-0003-0471-3094; Sola, Maria del Mar/0000-0002-0755-9662",Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation [MDM 2017-0714]; Juan de la Cierva Program [IJCI-2015-23500],Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program(Basque Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence accreditation(Spanish Government); Juan de la Cierva Program,The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers whose comments helped improve this work.

Hence, Landscape Restoration also called Integrated Watershed Management (IWM) was practiced to rehabilitate the degraded lands. However, its contribution to climate change adaptation and mitigation was not well studied. Hence, this work has examined the role of IWM on improving climate change adaptation and mitigation, taking SOC stock as an indicator. IWM impact time series (1999, 2009 and 2018) data on land use and land cover (LULC) and total soil organic carbon changes were collected at Sero Watershed of northern Ethiopia. Soil samples (84 disturbed and 84 undisturbed) were collected from three soil depths (0-30, 30-60 and 60-90 cm) for soil carbon, bulk density, gravel content analysis and for overall SOC stock estimation. Research findings indicated that vegetation cover increased by 37.2% from 1999 to 2018 at the expenses of bare land and cropland. Thus, in turn has resulted to an overall increase in total SOC stock by 8.5%. It can be concluded that IWM has a significant role to adapt and mitigate the impacts of climate change through increased soil carbon stock in addition to its contribution to landscape restoration.","[Gebrehiwot, Gebretsadik] Ahferom Dist Off Agr & Rural Dev, Mekele, Tigray, Ethiopia; [Gebrehiwot, Gebretsadik; Teka, Kassa; Welday, Yemane] Mekelle Univ, Dept Land Resources Management & Environm Protect, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia; [Teka, Kassa] Mekelle Univ, POB 251-231, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia",Mekelle University; Mekelle University,"Teka, K (corresponding author), Mekelle Univ, POB 251-231, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia.",kassateka2012@gmail.com,,,"Steps towards Sustainable Forest Management with the Local Community of Tigray, northern Ethiopia NORAD/NORHED Project [ETH 13/0018]; AgriFoSe2030 success story write-shop project in Mekelle University [CCSO/17/09/2017]","Steps towards Sustainable Forest Management with the Local Community of Tigray, northern Ethiopia NORAD/NORHED Project; AgriFoSe2030 success story write-shop project in Mekelle University","This work was supported by the Steps towards Sustainable Forest Management with the Local Community of Tigray, northern Ethiopia NORAD/NORHED Project (ETH 13/0018) , and the AgriFoSe2030 success story write-shop project (CCSO/17/09/2017) in Mekelle University.",,57,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2351-9894,,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

The suitability of hydrothermal conditions in Naqu Prefecture was studied based on the spatial displacement of 500 mm precipitation and 2000 degrees C accumulated temperature contours. Results showed that the 500 mm precipitation contour had a shifting trend toward the southwest, with a 3.3-year and 7.1-year period, respectively, in the longitudinal and latitudinal direction, and the longitude changed suddenly around 1996. The 2000 degrees C accumulated temperature contour had a shifting trend toward the northwest, with a 1.8-year period and a 7-year sub-period in the longitudinal direction; the longitude had a catastrophe point between 1966 and 1967, while the latitude had a catastrophe point between 2005 and 2006. When located in the same vegetation zone, the annual precipitation in Naqu Prefecture was higher than the national average, while the accumulated temperature was lower than the national average, indicating that areas with suitable hydrothermal conditions suitable for vegetation growth showed a northwestward shift tendency.

Yet, there is little information in the academic literature about how SIDS are adapting to climate change, across multiple countries and geographic regions. This paper helps to fill this gap. Using a sample of 16 countries across the Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea, Caribbean and Pacific regions, this study has two main aims, to identify (1) national-level adaptation trends across climate, climate-induced and non-climate-induced vulnerabilities, sectors and actors, as reported in National Communications (NCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and (2) typologies of national-level adaptation actions in SIDS. It identifies, codes and assesses 977 adaptation actions. These actions were reported as addressing 47 climate and climate-induced vulnerabilities and 50 non-climate-induced vulnerabilities and were undertaken in 37 sectors by 34 actors. The paper proposes five typologies of adaptation actions for SIDS, based on actions reported by SIDS. It specifically explores the implications of its findings for global adaptation strategies. As this work establishes a baseline of adaptation action in SIDS, it can assist national governments to gauge their adaptation progress, identify gaps in their adaptation effort and, thereafter, develop appropriate strategies for filling the gaps. It can also assist donors, whether bilateral or multilateral, to make more 'climate-smart' investment decisions by being able to identify the adaptation needs that are not being met in SIDS.","[Robinson, Stacy-ann] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 48 Linnaeus Way, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Robinson, SA (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 48 Linnaeus Way, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",stacy-ann.robinson@anu.edu.au,"Robinson, Stacy-ann/R-2769-2019","Robinson, Stacy-ann/0000-0003-3163-8771",,,,,70,51,51,2,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Questions asking about church attendance show that the vast majority of participants have spiritual values that explain their feelings of connectedness to Nature which in turn may account for high levels of pessimism about the current state of the global/Pacific environment. Concern about climate change as a future livelihood stressor in the Pacific region is ubiquitous at both societal and personal levels. While participants exhibited a degree of understanding matching objective rankings about the vulnerability of their home islands/countries, a spatial optimism bias was evident in which 'other places' were invariably regarded as 'worse'. Through their views on climate change concern, respondents also favoured a psychological distancing of environmental risk in which 'other places' were perceived as more exposed than familiar ones. Influence from spirituality is implicated in both findings. Most interventions intended to reduce exposure to environmental risk and to enable effective and sustainable adaptation to climate change in the Pacific Islands region have failed to acknowledge influences on decisionmaking of spirituality and connectedness to Nature. Messages that stress environmental conservation and stewardship, particularly if communicated within familiar and respected religious contexts, are likely to be more successful than secular ones.","[Nunn, Patrick D.; Mulgrew, Kate; Scott-Parker, Bridie; Mahar, Doug] Univ Sunshine Coast, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia; [Hine, Donald W.; Marks, Anthony D.

J,"Cheng, HF; Hu, YA",,,,"Cheng, Hefa; Hu, Yuanan",,,Improving China's water resources management for better adaptation to climate change,CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RIGHTS; AGRICULTURE; SCENARIOS; IMPACTS; REFORM,"Challenged by insufficient water resources and by degraded water quality caused by widespread pollution, China faces an imbalance between the supply and the demand of water for supporting the rapid social and economic development while protecting the natural environment and ecosystems. Climate change is expected to further stress freshwater resources and widen the gap between the demand for and supply of water. As a legacy of the earlier planned economy, water resources management has been primarily supply-driven, which largely fails to account for the economic nature of water resources in relation to their natural characteristics. This paper presents a historical perspective on the water resources management policies and practices in China, and recommends demand management and pollution control as key measures for improving water resources management to adapt to climate change based on the current political, socio-economic and water resources conditions. The past and future impacts of climate change on water resources in China and the general adaptation strategies are also presented. How demand management through increasing water use efficiency, improving water rights and rights trade, and effective regulation enforcement, along with pollution control could improve China's water resources management are discussed in details. Ultimately, China should develop a sustainable water resources management strategy based on both supply- and demand-side management options to make the limited water supplies meet the demands of economic development, social well-being and the conservation of ecosystems in the context of global climate change.","[Cheng, Hefa] Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Organ Geochem, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yuanan] Stanford Univ, Educ Program Gifted Youth, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, CAS; Stanford University","Cheng, HF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Organ Geochem, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.",hefac@umich.edu,"Hu, Yuanan/F-3830-2012; Cheng, Hefa/A-1193-2007","Hu, Yuanan/0000-0001-7103-8119; Cheng, Hefa/0000-0003-4911-6971",Natural Science Foundation of China [41073079]; State Key Laboratory of Organic Geochemistry [SKLOG2009A04]; Chinese Academy of Sciences,Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Organic Geochemistry(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This work was partially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41073079), the State Key Laboratory of Organic Geochemistry (Grant No. SKLOG2009A04), and the One Hundred Talents program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

We developed a numerical modeling approach for a partially mixed estuary to simulate long-term alterations to hydrodynamics and transport processes induced from human modifications; two types of partially embanked storm surge barriers across the mouth of Chesapeake Bay were examined. Under modeled scenarios, surge barriers exerted a significant influence on the tide, salinity, residual current, and transport processes. The surge barrier caused (1) a reduction of tidal range inside the estuary, (2) stronger stratification and further salt intrusion, weaker vertical mixing and larger vertical exchange time, and (3) a decrease of bottom inflow in the mainstem and weakened horizontal water exchange. The change of horizontal water exchange and residence time was not a linear response with the barrier size and it varied at different regions of the estuary. The modeling approach is suitable to assess large-scale long-term ecosystem changes induced by human modifications or adaptations under a changing system.","[Du, Jiabi; Shen, Jian; Bilkovic, Donna M.; Hershner, Carlton H.; Sisson, Mac] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA",William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science,"Du, JB (corresponding author), Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",jiabi@vims.edu,"Bilkovic, Donna Marie/A-8343-2009; Jiabi, Du/J-2109-2019","Jiabi, Du/0000-0002-8170-8021","National Science Foundation [1325518]; Virginia Institute of Marine Science, College of William Mary [3587]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Virginia Institute of Marine Science, College of William Mary","We thank the anonymous reviewers that helped to improve the manuscript.

However, local planning practices that support these approaches are scattered, and measures are neither systematically implemented nor comprehensively reviewed. Against this background, this paper advances the operationalization of ecosystem-based adaptation by improving our knowledge of how ecosystem-based approaches can be considered in local planning (operational governance level). We review current research on ecosystem services in urban areas and examine four Swedish coastal municipalities to identify the key characteristics of both implemented and planned measures that support ecosystem-based adaptation. The results show that many of the measures that have been implemented focus on biodiversity rather than climate change adaptation, which is an important factor in only around half of all measures. Furthermore, existing measures are limited in their focus regarding the ecological structures and the ecosystem services they support, and the hazards and risk factors they address. We conclude that a more comprehensive approach to sustainable ecosystem-based adaptation planning and its systematic mainstreaming is required. Our framework for the analysis of ecosystem-based adaptation measures proved to be useful in identifying how ecosystem-related matters are addressed in current practice and strategic planning, and in providing knowledge on how ecosystem-based adaptation can further be considered in urban planning practice. Such a systematic analysis framework can reveal the ecological structures, related ecosystem services, and risk-reducing approaches that are missing and why. This informs the discussion about why specific measures are not considered and provides pathways for alternate measures/ designs, related operations, and policy processes at different scales that can foster sustainable adaptation and transformation in municipal governance and planning.","[Wamsler, Christine; Niven, Lisa; Osmani, Adelina; Stalhammar, Sanna] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Wamsler, Christine] Ctr Societal Resilience, Lund, Sweden; [Beery, Thomas H.] Kristianstad Univ, Kristianstad, Sweden; [Bramryd, Torleif] Lund Univ, Environm Strategy, Campus Helsingborg, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Ekelund, Nils] Malmo Univ, Malmo, Sweden; [Jonsson, K.

This study examines public responses to planned power outages in California and finds that the outages shaped some energy behavioural intentions but did not alter climate or energy policy preferences. As climate change accelerates, governments will be forced to adapt to its impacts. The public could respond by increasing mitigation behaviours and support for decarbonization, creating a virtuous cycle between adaptation and mitigation. Alternatively, adaptation could generate backlash, undermining mitigation behaviours. Here we examine the relationship between adaptation and mitigation in the power sector, using the case of California's public safety power shut-offs in 2019. We use a geographically targeted survey to compare residents living within power outage zones to matched residents in similar neighbourhoods who retained their electricity. Outage exposure increased respondent intentions to purchase fossil fuel generators while it may have reduced intentions to purchase electric vehicles. However, exposure did not change climate policy preferences, including willingness to pay for either wildfire or climate-mitigating reforms. Respondents blamed outages on their utility, not local, state or federal governments. Our findings demonstrate that energy infrastructure disruptions, even when not understood as climate adaptations, can still be consequential for decarbonization trajectories.","[Mildenberger, Matto; Stokes, Leah C.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Howe, Peter D.] Utah State Univ, Quinney Coll Nat Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Trachtman, Samuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lubell, Mark] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Mildenberger, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",mildenberger@ucsb.edu,,"Mildenberger, Matto/0000-0001-5784-435X; Stokes, Leah/0000-0002-9919-8664","Research Council of Norway as part of DEMOS grant [302869]; Swedish Formas Research Council [2019-01962]; US National Science Foundation [BCS-1753082, CRISP-1541056]",Research Council of Norway as part of DEMOS grant(Research Council of Norway); Swedish Formas Research Council; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was supported in part by funding from the Research Council of Norway as part of DEMOS grant 302869 (L.C.S.), the Swedish Formas Research Council grant 2019-01962 (L.C.S.), and the US National Science Foundation as part of both grant BCS-1753082 (P.D.H.) and grant CRISP-1541056 (M.L.).

We identified a total of 765 distinct areas at least 4 ha (10 ac) in size. We assessed these areas for their level of conservation, the extent of development and recent timber harvesting, and 14 ecological values. We developed a quantitative scoring system that allowed us to rank areas for their conservation value and identify the most significant unconserved areas. While 86% of high-elevation land across the region has some form of conservation protection, significant areas remain unconserved, particularly in the Western Mountains region of Maine.

We develop a two-period real options game model with two landlord ports, each consisting of a port authority (PA) and a downstream terminal operator company (TOC). The two PAs compete with each other at the upstream level, and the two TOCs downstream. The model assumes an accumulation of information about the adaptation projects over time, allowing decision-makers to improve the investment efficiency. The results show that the optimal timing of investment is significantly influenced by the disaster occurrence probability, the potential information gain over time and the level of competition. When competition is intensified, it is optimal for ports to invest earlier than later. However, immediate investments are less preferred when competition is weak, even lesser in the presence of information accumulation. Waiting until the next period to invest is also a better option if the disaster occurrence probability is low or if the shippers' expected disaster losses are negligible. Moreover, information accumulation reduces the ports' investment size, while improving the discounted welfare associated with late investments. These results hold for both the private and public ports and for simultaneous investments by the PAs. In most cases, social welfare is much higher with immediate investments, mainly because of the associated positive spillover effects on the surrounding areas and other sectors of economy. The implications of the assumption of Knightian uncertainty for the disaster occurrence probability are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The core of this strategy is the establishment of a climate insurance programme specialized in supporting developing country insurance-related initiatives for sudden- and slow-onset weather-related disasters. This programme could take many institutional forms, including an independent facility, a facility in partnership with other institutions of the donor community, or as part of a multi-purpose disaster management facility operated outside of the climate regime. Its main purpose would be to enable the establishment of public-private safety nets for climate-related shocks by assisting the development of (sometimes novel) insurance-related instruments that are affordable to the poor and coupled with actions and incentives for pro-active preventive measures. A second tier could provide disaster relief contingent on countries making credible efforts to manage their risks. Since it would be based on precedents of donor-supported insurance systems in developing countries, a main advantage of this proposed climate insurance strategy is its demonstrated feasibility. Other advantages include its potential for linking with related donor initiatives, providing incentives for loss reduction and targeting the most vulnerable. Many details and issues are left unresolved, and it is hoped that this suggested strategy will facilitate needed discussion on practical options for supporting adaptation to climate change in developing countries.","Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Risk & Vulnerabil Programme, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Linnerooth-Bayer, J (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Risk & Vulnerabil Programme, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",bayer@iiasa.ac.at,,"Bayer, Joanne/0000-0003-3084-2471; /0000-0003-2239-1578",,,,,44,46,47,2,43,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

The case context is particularly challenging because it involves intra-individual dynamics of psychological processes, inter individual dynamics of social influence and environmental dynamics governed by future climate scenarios. To account for the spatial and temporal dynamics of social mobilisation the proposed methodical approach is agent-based modelling. The presented social simulation experiments obtain their empirical grounding from a fine grained set of socio-geographic data for the target area which groups the population according to sociological lifestyles in a spatially explicit way. Simulation results show that social mobilisation of neighbourhood support can be substantially inhibited because passive habits establish quicker than prosocial behaviours which require successful social coordination prior to becoming habitual. In contrast, an alternative scenario simulation reveals that a time-limited intervention can provide an enlarged temporal window of opportunity for cooperative habits to stabilise and to persist after the end of the intervention.

The index supports national authorities in designing adaptation policies and plans, guides the initial problem formulation phase, and identifies administrative areas with higher propensity to being adversely affected by climate change. The index combines (i) climate change-amplified hazards; (ii) high-resolution indicators of exposure of chosen economic, social, natural and built-or manufactured capital (MC) assets and (iii) vulnerability, which comprises both present sensitivity to climate-induced hazards and adaptive capacity. We use standardized anomalies of selected extreme climate indices derived from high-resolution regional climate model simulations of the EURO-CORDEX initiative as proxies of climate change-altered weather and climate-related hazards. The exposure and sensitivity assessment is based on indicators of manufactured, natural, social and economic capital assets exposed to and adversely affected by climate-related hazards. The MC refers to material goods or fixed assets which support the production process (e.g. industrial machines and buildings); Natural Capital comprises natural resources and processes (renewable and non-renewable) producing goods and services for well-being; Social Capital (SC) addressed factors at the individual (people's health, knowledge, skills) and collective (institutional) level (e.g. families, communities, organizations and schools); and Economic Capital (EC) includes owned and traded goods and services. The results of the climate risk analysis are used to rank the subnational administrative and statistical units according to the climate risk challenges, and possibly for financial resource allocation for climate adaptation.

It presents a systematic review of the adaptations suggested in the literature. Although it is frequently claimed that this socially and economically important sector is particularly vulnerable to climate change, there is comparatively little research into its adaptation. The 63 sources we found are analysed following an action framework of adaptation. This distinguishes different adaptational functions and means of adaptation. By an open coding procedure, a total of 245 adaptations are found and classified. The paper shows a broad diversity of interdependent actors to be relevant-ranging from transportation providers to public and private actors and households. Crucial actors are hybrid in terms of being public or private. A substantial share of the identified adaptations follows a top-down adaptation policy pattern where a public or hybrid operator initiates action that affects private actors. Most of the exceptions from this pattern are technical or engineering measures. Identified adaptations mostly require institutional means, followed by technical means, and knowledge. Generally, knowledge on adapting transport to climate change is still in a stage of infancy. The existing literature either focuses on overly general adaptations, or on detailed technical measures. Further research is needed on the actual implementation of adaptation, and on more precise institutional instruments that fill the gap between too vague and too site-specific adaptations.","[Eisenack, Klaus; Stecker, Rebecca] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Reckien, Diana] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Hoffmann, Esther] Inst Ecol Econ Res, D-10785 Berlin, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Eisenack, K (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",klaus.eisenack@uni-oldenburg.de,"Reckien, Diana/P-7348-2015","Reckien, Diana/0000-0002-1145-9509",German Ministry for Education and Research [01UU0910],German Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We want to thank Julia Dinkelacker, Nils Marscheider, Stefan Lewandowski, Michaelle Nintecheu, and Micha Steinhauser for their support in coding the adaptations.

Climate change might become one of the key drivers pushing integrated approaches for natural resources management into practice. The National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) is an initiative agreed under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. An analysis was done to find out how widely ecosystem restoration and integrated approaches have been incorporated into NAPA priority adaptation projects. The data show that that the NAPAs can be seen as potentially important channel for operationalizing various integrated concepts. Key challenge is to implement the NAPA projects. The amount needed to implement the NAPA projects aiming at ecosystem restoration using integrated approaches presents only 0.7% of the money pledged in Copenhagen for climate change adaptation.","[Stucki, Virpi] Aalto Univ, Water & Dev Res Team, Sch Sci & Technol, Espoo 02150, Finland; [Smith, Mark] IUCN, Water Programme, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland",Aalto University,"Stucki, V (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Water & Dev Res Team, Sch Sci & Technol, Tietotie 1E, Espoo 02150, Finland.",virpi.stucki@gmail.com; mark.smith@iucn.org,,,Maa- ja Vesitekniikan Tuki r.y.,Maa- ja Vesitekniikan Tuki r.y.,The authors would like to thank Prof. Olli Varis and Prof. Steven De Bie for constructive comments and advice during the drafting stage of this article.

We first investigate policy transitions toward sustainable adaptation in tourism and then analyze the systematization of tourism reflected in the definitions of AC. Next, we conduct an in-depth analysis of evolutions in tourism adaptation by interpreting the occurrences and interactions of three main streams of AC: resource, social-psychological, socio-ecological. We conclude that diverse methodologies in tourism research on adaptation contribute to augmenting the quantitative measurement of social factors influencing AC.

In this paper, we present an accessible, cost-effective and user-tested climate change risk assessment framework which allows organisations to systematically apply a risk management process aligned with international standards to identify and manage their climate change risks. It is delivered through CoastAdapt', a resource supporting climate change adaptation in Australia. This three-tier framework offers four benefits to the adaptation process. First, it allows organisations to identify climate change risks and integrate them with their mainstream risk management process. Second, it makes optimal use of an organisation's limited adaptation resources by taking a tiered approach, so allowing an organisation to start from a low knowledge base using minimal resources and, only if required, then move to more complex and resource-intensive risk assessment processes. Third, it introduces a time-dependent vulnerability rating which recognises the particular characteristics of climate change risksthat they are long term and associated with a considerable degree of uncertainty. Finally, it takes into account business inter-dependencies that can exacerbate impacts but be overlooked in a sector-based impacts evaluation. In this paper, we highlight the appropriate context in which to use each risk assessment tier, explore key technical differences among the three tiers, describe performance testing and present one case study of application. We discuss the benefits of this tiered risk assessment approach in the context of broader adaptation planning.","[Tonmoy, Fahim Nawroz; Rissik, David; Palutikof, J.

However, adaptation to climate change takes place at the broader scale of coupled social ecological systems (SES), where decision making and adaptation policies are relevant. Despite the general need to understand adaptation in coupled systems, there is no evidence to date to the extent to which current adaptation and vulnerability studies are covering the full range of SES components. The present study contributes to this need by examining such coverage in applied studies of vulnerability, adaptation and SES sustainability in the field of small-scale fisheries. By means of a systematic review and comparison of case studies, we detected a gap between theory and implementation and a lack of consideration of several SES components in the adaptation and vulnerability literature. This gap is larger for the Interactions between social and ecological domains, and in the coverage of Related Ecosystems. By contrast, greater attention has been given to the Actors, Governance system and Resource unit components. On the basis of our findings, we propose a set of guidelines to better address adaptation in social-ecological systems by broadening the outlook of adaptation studies and policies, specifically by considering interactions, evaluating outcomes and integrating cultural and ecological variables.","[Salgueiro-Otero, Diego; Ojea, Elena] CIM Univ Vigo, Future Oceans Lab, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; CIM UVIGO,"Salgueiro-Otero, D (corresponding author), CIM Univ Vigo, Future Oceans Lab, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Spain.",dsalgueiro@uvigo.es; elenaojea@uvigo.es,"ojea, elena/D-3709-2018","ojea, elena/0000-0003-4991-8077","European Research Council under the European Union [679812]; GAIN (Axencia Galega de Innovacion) from Xunta de Galicia; Conselleria de Educacion; Xunta de Galicia, Conselleria de Cultura, Educacion e Ordenacion Universitaria","European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); GAIN (Axencia Galega de Innovacion) from Xunta de Galicia; Conselleria de Educacion; Xunta de Galicia, Conselleria de Cultura, Educacion e Ordenacion Universitaria(Xunta de Galicia)","We thank Alex Tidd and Iratxe Rubio for their revision and recommendations of this paper.

The impacts of climate change in this zone are expected to be pervasive and will require adaptation of Canada's forest management system. This paper reviews potential climate change adaptation actions and strategies for the forest management system, considering current and projected climate change impacts and their related vulnerabilities. These impacts and vulnerabilities include regional increases in disturbance rates, regional changes in forest productivity, increased variability in timber supply, decreased socioeconomic resilience, and increased severity of safety and health issues for forest communities. Potential climate change adaptation actions of the forest management system are categorized as those that reduce nonclimatic stressors, those that reduce sensitivity to climate change, or those that maintain or enhance adaptive capacity in the biophysical and human subsystems of the forest management system. Efficient adaptation of the forest management system will revolve around the inclusion of risk management in planning processes, the selection of robust, diversified, and no-regret adaptation actions, and the adoption of an adaptive management framework. Monitoring is highlighted as a no-regret action that is central to the implementation of adaptive forest management.","[Gauthier, Sylvie; Bernier, Pierre; Isabel, Nathalie; Jayen, Karelle; Le Goff, Heloise] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Stn St Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada; [Burton, Philip J.] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada; [Edwards, Jason; Isaac, Kendra] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, No Forestry Ctr, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada; [Nelson, Elizabeth A.] Nat Resources Canada, Sci & Program Branch, Natl Capital Reg, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E4, Canada",Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service; Natural Resources Canada,"Gauthier, S (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, 1055 PEPS,POB 10380, Stn St Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada.",sylvie.gauthier@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca,"Burton, Philip J./X-5808-2019; Gauthier, Sylvie/J-3923-2019","Burton, Philip J./0000-0002-5956-2716; Gauthier, Sylvie/0000-0001-6720-0195; Isabel, Nathalie/0000-0001-8621-9801",,,,,250,85,86,10,116,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",1208-6053,1181-8700,,ENVIRON REV,Environ.

In this study, (1) climate change risk indicators were extracted based on the concept of risk (hazard, vulnerability, and exposure), (2) a spatial analysis was performed using a graphic information system (GIS), and (3) the primary influencing factors were derived through a logistic regression analysis. The principal results show that urban regeneration areas have a higher risk of climate change impact than other areas. The results indicate that urban regeneration areas have a higher population density per area and more impermeable or flooded areas can increase the risk of climate change impacts.

Effective climate change adaptation strategies are needed to determine the optimal allocation of scarce resources, commodities or capital under crisis conditions to minimize the economic consequences. In such cases, it is necessary to account for structural properties of economic systems to ensure that rational distribution policies are implemented. Input output models are used to illustrate interdependencies among economic sectors and to assess both direct and indirect effects of disruptive events. Alternatively, these interdependencies may be exploited for developing effective recovery efforts to minimize the ripple effects of a crisis. In this paper, a process graph representation of the input output model is developed to generate a rational procedure for the allocation of scarce resources, commodities or capital during crisis conditions. The process graph model is a graph-theoretic approach originally developed for chemical process design applications. The analogous problem structure allows it to be used for the input-output system. The method is demonstrated through several case studies to identify allocation policies geared towards reducing the impact of disruptions attributed to critical resources, commodities, or capital. Results show that depending on the economic structure, the optimal allocation of scarce resources, commodities or capital will satisfy the final demands of some economic sectors and reduce the production capacity of others in order to minimize the reduction of total gross domestic product. Though similar results can be obtained through traditional mathematical programming models, the process graph platform has the advantage to visually present the distribution of scarce resources, commodities or capital within the system. This work is a first attempt to implement the process graph approach in the fields of economics and climate change adaptation. In conclusion, the process graph based approach developed in this work can be used to provide policymakers with insights in developing appropriate risk mitigation plans associated with climate change-induced crisis conditions. Potential applications include both the development of disaster preparedness measures for anticipated disruptions, as well as the implementation of real-time emergency response in the midst of a crisis.

It is based on both a retrospective ex-post evaluation of existing practices in Austria and Germany as well as prescriptive examination and development of outcomes for practice through the development of a climate-fit toolkit that supports the incorporation of climate change impacts into EIAs. The scenario analysis applied with a backcasting approach provided the opportunity to look beyond limitations related to legal compliance and partly lack of data identified by previous research. Three scenario narratives were elaborated based on nine key impact factors based on literature review, content analysis of EIA documents and interviews with EIA actors. The groups of actors carried out a prioritization of actions towards consideration of climate change in EIA.

Recent studies in Southern Africa (of which Zimbabwe is part) have indicated the extreme vulnerabilities of smallholder farmers to the impact of climate change and recommended that appropriate adaptation measures be put in place. In-field rainwater harvesting is one of the adaptation strategies that has been adopted by some smallholder farmers in drought-prone regions. The study examines the effectiveness of in-field rainwater harvesting as a climate change adaptation strategy for smallholder farmers in Gwanda district, Zimbabwe. Data was collected through semi-structured questionnaires (administered to 45 smallholder farmers) and five key informants. We find that most respondents adopted pit planting and mulching in-field rainwater harvesting techniques. A few respondents practised deep tillage, dead level contours, ephemeral stream diversion, ridges/furrows and hillside sheet runoff. In-field rainwater harvesting techniques increase the time required for crop moisture to set in resulting in improved crop yields. However, farmers are reluctant to adopt in-field rainwater harvesting techniques as they are labour intensive and some require technical expertise. We recommend the implementation of programmes that will enhance the capacity of smallholder farmers to implement various adaptation strategies.","[Ndlovu, Sibonokuhle; Mathe, Bakani; Phiri, Keith; Nyathi, Douglas] Lupane State Univ, Dept Dev Studies, POB AC 255, Ascot, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe",,"Ndlovu, S (corresponding author), Lupane State Univ, Dept Dev Studies, POB AC 255, Ascot, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.",ndlovus@lsu.ac.zw; mathebakani93@gmail.com; kphiri@lsu.ac.zw; dnyathi@lsu.ac.zw,"Phiri, Keith/AAY-7662-2021","Phiri, Keith/0000-0003-0356-3338; Ndlovu, Sibonokuhle/0000-0002-0917-6956; Nyathi, Douglas/0000-0003-1310-627X",,,,,42,2,2,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1886,,,COGENT SOC SCI,Cogent Soc.

A systematic literature review was carried out to draw insights from the current state of implementation of adaptation projects, programmes and schemes at the subnational levels, along with barriers to mainstreaming climate change adaptation. The findings from a literature review were supplemented with lessons emerging from the implementation of India's National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC). The results of this study underscore the scheme's relevance. Key policy insights Experience with NAFCC implementation reveals that states require sustained 'handholding' in terms of financial, technical and capacity support until climate change issues are fully understood and embedded in the policy landscape. Domestic sources of finance are critically important in the absence of predictable and adequate adaptation finance from international sources.

But climate change may place substantial stress on these sectors within this archipelago. This paper assesses the potential economic impact of two important climate change adaptation strategies in Fiji, natural resource management (NRM) and aquaculture, using a market fish supply-demand model. The model undertakes a comparative analysis of alternative fisheries development scenarios for 2035 and 2050, while taking account of the impact of climate change on the fisheries sector. The modeling and scenario analyses show that promoting aquaculture can help raise aggregate fish production, consumption, and trade. However, the required increases in aquaculture could be massive. While aqua culture development alone is unlikely to meet the growing excess demand for fish in Fiji, it will be an important component in adapting to the negative effects of climate change on capture fisheries. Various NRM strategies, such as marine protected areas (MPAs) and locally managed marine areas (LMMA5), are projected to have positive impacts in Fiji, expanding the stock and catch of fish. But current efforts on various NRM strategies are too small to have any meaningful impact to reverse the declining trends of coastal fisheries catch. Efforts would need to be greatly scaled-up to achieve significant production gains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - For this explorative case study research, an early adapter was selected: Philadelphia (USA). By reconstructing the organization of two climate adaptation programs, the authors have identified stimuli and whether these influence the city's governance approach. The reconstruction is based on data triangulation that consists of semi-structured interviews with actors involved in these programs, policy documents and newspaper articles. Findings - The research illustrates the importance of stimuli such as strategically framing climate adaptation within wider urban agendas, political leadership and institutional entrepreneurs. Moreover, the research reveals that it is often a combination of stimuli that triggers a governance approach and that there is a possible link between specific stimuli and governance approaches, proposing that some stimuli will trigger a dedicated approach to climate adaptation, while others initiate a mainstreaming approach. Originality/value - An in-depth understanding of stimuli of climate adaptation is currently lacking in literature, as most of the studies have focused on barriers to climate adaptation. Moreover, still little is known about what explains why certain governance approaches to climate adaptation emerge.","[Uittenbroek, Caroline J.; Runhaar, Hens A.

Previous research has not clearly distinguished the flood-mitigation effects of green infrastructure at the local scale due to its complex range of functions including socioeconomic benefits, ecosystem services, and amenity value. Using data on 3768 housing sales from 2009 to 2019 in Hong Kong, we employ a difference-in-differences framework to examine the effect of green infrastructure on perceptions of flood risk mitigation, with housing prices as a proxy for risk perception. We find a positive effect of green infrastructure on the value of nearby housing. The effect does not exist in apartment units on higher floors, however. This vertical discrepancy further suggests that the observed pricing effects are due to green infrastructure's capacity to reduce perceptions of flood risk. By contrast, properties near conventional gray infrastructure show no evidence of such effects. The results thus provide quantitative evidence that supports the ongoing shift toward green infrastructure as a form of climate change adaptation.","[Kim, Seung Kyum] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Social Sci, Pok Fu Lam, 7-02C Jockey Club Tower,Cent Campus, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Joosse, Paul] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Sociol, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Bennett, Mia M.] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Bennett, Mia M.] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Modern Languages & Cultures, China Studies Programme, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [van Gevelt, Terry] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [van Gevelt, Terry] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong,"Kim, SK (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Social Sci, Pok Fu Lam, 7-02C Jockey Club Tower,Cent Campus, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",skim1@hku.hk,"Kim, Seung Kyum/AAX-8447-2021","Kim, Seung Kyum/0000-0002-6932-5829",,,,,59,4,4,16,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

As in many other countries, adaptation to climate change is likely to be an important challenge for Colombian agricultural systems. In a recent study, a national-level assessment of the likely future impacts of climate change on agriculture was performed (Ramirez-Villegas et al. Clim Chang 115:611-628, 2012, RV2012). The study diagnosed key challenges directly affecting major crops and regions within the Colombian agricultural system and suggested a number of actions thought to facilitate adaptation, while refraining from proposing specific strategies at local scales. Further insights on the study were published by Feola (2013) (F2013), who stressed the need for transformative adaptation processes to reduce vulnerability particularly of resource-limited farmers, and the benefits of a predominantly stakeholder-led approach to adaptation. We clarify that the recommendations outlined in RV2012 were not intended as a recipe for multi-scale adaptation, but rather a set of actions that are required to diagnose and develop adaptation actions particularly at governmental levels in coordination with national and international adaptation initiatives. Such adaptation actions ought to be, ideally, a product of inclusive sub-sectorial assessments, which can take different forms. We argue that Colombian agriculture as a whole would benefit from a better outlining of adaptation needs across temporal scales in sub-sectorial assessments that take into account both RV2012 and F2013 orientations to adaptation. We conclude with two case studies of research on climate change impacts and adaptation developed in Colombia that serve as examples of realistic, productive sectorial and sub-national assessments.","[Ramirez-Villegas, Julian; Khoury, Colin K.] CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] CIAT, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Cali, Colombia; [Ramirez-Villegas, Julian] Univ Leeds, ICAS, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Khoury, Colin K.] Wageningen Univ, Ctr Crop Syst Anal, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; University of Leeds; Wageningen University & Research,"Ramirez-Villegas, J (corresponding author), CIAT, Cali, Colombia.",j.r.villegas@cgiar.org,"Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/AAY-8073-2020; Khoury, Colin K./AAA-1864-2020","Ramirez-Villegas, Julian/0000-0002-8044-583X; Khoury, Colin K./0000-0001-7893-5744","CGIAR-ESSP Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","CGIAR-ESSP Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","Authors acknowledge the support of the CGIAR-ESSP Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

Most impact studies have focused on the most densely populated core areas where top-down governance is most effective. In contrast, this research looks at peripheral (rural/outer-island) communities where long-established systems of environmental governance exist that contrast markedly with those which governments and their donor partners in this region favour. Peripheral communities in the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, and Vanuatu were studied. Traditional systems of environmental governance are described, and three common barriers to effective and sustainable climate-change adaptation identified. The first is lack of awareness among key community decision makers about climate change and associated environmental sustainability that could be lessened by targeted awareness raising. The second is the inappropriateness of traditional decision-making structures for dealing with both the complexity and pace of climate-driven environmental changes. The third is the short-term views of resource management and sustainability held by many community decision makers. Despite 30 years of assistance, there has been negligible effective and sustainable adaptation for climate change in peripheral parts of Pacific Island Countries, something that is explicable by both the ineffectiveness of top-down approaches in such places as well as a lack of attention to the nature and the context of adaptation communications. It is timely for interventions to be made at community level where the greatest disconnect lies between the science and stakeholder awareness of climate change.","[Nunn, Patrick D.; Lata, Shalini] Univ New England, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Aalbersberg, William] Univ S Pacific, Suva, Fiji; [Gwilliam, Marion] Secretariat RAMSAR, Gland, Switzerland",University of New England; University of the South Pacific,"Nunn, PD (corresponding author), Univ New England, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",pnunn3@une.edu.au,"Nunn, Patrick/ABA-2943-2021; Nunn, Patrick D./C-7864-2011","Nunn, Patrick/0000-0001-9295-5741; Nunn, Patrick D./0000-0001-9295-5741",Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change (APN) through CAPaBLE grant [CBA2007-03NSY],Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change (APN) through CAPaBLE grant,"The study on which this work is based was funded by the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change (APN) through CAPaBLE grant CBA2007-03NSY.

The paper discusses the added value of these types of communities to help address uncertain futures from the impact of climate change, which are highly context dependent. The paper frames these communities of innovation as part of innovation ecosystems in order to reflect on their key elements and added value. We argue that climate change and disaster risk management responses need to meet the needs of those experiencing problems with those that can offer solutions in distinct localities, including those that could fund or finance potential innovative solutions. Developing communities of innovation with the specific task of anticipating and creating niche solutions has been gaining traction in the EU. Some developed under the H2020 BRIGAID project are analysed here for other emergent COIs, as future-oriented communities tasked with the challenge to reduce disaster risks and enhance the climate resilience in their own spaces. This paper reflects on the experience of participants in these communities and their reflections and experience on whether these offer a useful form of organisation to anticipate future challenges, create niche solutions, and bring innovations to the market. The paper concludes with how communities of innovation can contribute to niche design and narratives of change to help achieve social and environmental resilience to reframe and help transition and transform current systems into more resilient, future-oriented communities.","[Lopez-Gunn, Elena; Bea, Manuel; Rica, Marta] Icatalist, Madrid 28232, Spain; [Swinkels, Julian] Delft Univ Technol, Valorisat Ctr, NL-2628 CS Delft, Netherlands; [Anzaldua, Gerardo; McDonald, Hugh] Ecol Inst gemeinnutzige GmbH, D-10717 Berlin, Germany; [Colaco, Maria Conceicao] Univ Lisbon, Sch Agr, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves CEABN InBIO, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Deksne, Mara] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; [Lalaj, Nensi] Natl Territorial Planning Agcy, Tirana 1001, Albania",Delft University of Technology; Universidade de Lisboa; Delft University of Technology,"Lopez-Gunn, E (corresponding author), Icatalist, Madrid 28232, Spain.",elopezgunn@icatalist.eu; j.r.a.swinkels@tudelft.nl; gerardo.anzaldua@ecologic.eu; mbea@icatalist.eu; ccolaco@isa.ulisboa.pt; m.deksne@gmail.com; nensimehmetilalaj@gmail.com; hugh.mcdonald@ecologic.eu; mrica@icatalist.eu,,"Colaco, Maria/0000-0003-0472-3065",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [700699],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,This article is based on BRIGAID Project results.

Increasing our understanding of maladaptation is important for avoiding negative outcomes of adaptation project implementation. However, maladaptation has received limited research attention. Previous research has focused on frameworks that can assist in defining and avoiding maladaptive risk and be applied to adaptation initiative planning processes. Adaptation may cause more significant influences on spatial land change than the direct effect of climate change does. Identifying the adaptation consequences that are likely to result in maladaptation is crucial. A combination of spatial land analysis and climate change analysis can be used for the aforementioned identification. However, empirical case studies on methods that can assess and evaluate the risk of maladaptation by integrating spatial and temporal aspects in a land spatial modeling tool have not been conducted. The present study aimed to fill this research gap by exploring the existing knowledge on maladaptation to climate change. We examined the interaction among spatial analysis, evaluated maladaptation frameworks, and project design to extend our conceptual understanding on maladaptation to climate change. We adopted a systematic review method that involved considering several questions including the following: (a) What are the definitions and categories of maladaptation? (b) What methods and theoretical frameworks exist for the assessment and evaluation of maladaptive risk? (c) How have climate-related research communities considered issues of maladaptation? (d) What are the experimental studies on land use change that can be referred to for minimizing maladaptive risks in future adaptation planning? In conclusion, further research on maladaptation should integrate spatial land analysis methods to facilitate the identification and avoidance of maladaptive risk in the initial stage of adaptation planning.","[Chi, Chia-Fa; Lu, Shiau-Yun] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Marine Environm & Engn, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Hallgren, Willow] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia; [Hallgren, Willow; Ware, Daniel] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia; [Ware, Daniel; Tomlinson, Rodger] Griffith Univ, Griffith Ctr Coastal Management, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia",National Sun Yat Sen University; Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Lu, SY (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Marine Environm & Engn, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",d005040007@gmail.com; shiauyun@faculty.nsysu.edu.tw; w.hallgren@griffith.edu.au; d.ware@griffith.edu.au; r.tomlinson@griffith.edu.au,,"Ware, Daniel/0000-0002-6208-4399",National Sun Yat-sen University; Ministry of Science and Technology (Overseas Project for Post Graduate Research) [MOST-106-2917-I-110-003],National Sun Yat-sen University; Ministry of Science and Technology (Overseas Project for Post Graduate Research),"The authors thank National Sun Yat-sen University and the Ministry of Science and Technology (Overseas Project for Post Graduate Research, MOST-106-2917-I-110-003) for their support that Chia-Fa Chi study in Griffith Center for Coastal Management from 2017 to 2018.

Duara's thesis was counterattacked by scientists and religionists who stated that religion has the spirit and teachings of careness for the environment. Nevertheless, the arguments they built are still theological, normative and theoretical This study is an antithesis to the Duara's statement and at the same time presents evidence based on the primary data that occurred in three Sufi communities. The focus of this study analyzes Sufi activism in Indonesia in safeguarding the earth, as a form of substantial religious responses to the environmental crisis due to climate change. Through the principles and mechanism of qualitative research methods, researchers sought to analyze mitigation and adaptation actions to climate change carried out by the Majlis Zikir Kraton Pekalongan, Jamaah Aoulia Panggang and Pesan Trend Ilmu Giri. The data are obtained through interviews, observation and documentation and they are analyzed interactively. The results of the study revealed that climate change is believed by the Sufis as God's authority due to human destructive behavior. For Sufis, overcoming climate change must begin with a change in the perspective of human relations, nature and God In the case of three Sufi communities, religion is not just a doctrine of the relationship between God and humans, but also operational guidance on how to synergize with nature. Through a substantial religious hit, the Sufis guard the earth through the re-actualization of the narratives of takhalli, tahalli and tajalli, as ecological repentance, ecological movements, and ecological campaigns in mitigating and adapting to climate change.","[Ahmad, Maghfur] State Inst Islamic Studies IAIN Pekalongan, Pekalongan, Indonesia",,"Ahmad, M (corresponding author), State Inst Islamic Studies IAIN Pekalongan, Pekalongan, Indonesia.",maghfur@iainpekalongan.ac.id,,,,,,,81,3,3,1,6,SUNAN KALIJAGA STATE ISLAMIC UNIV,YOGYAKARTA,"AL-JAMIAH RESEARCH CTR JLN MARSDA ADISUCIPTO 1, YOGYAKARTA, 55281, INDONESIA",0126-012X,2338-557X,,AL-JAMIAH,al-Jamiah,,2019,57,2,,,,,359,396,,10.14421/ajis.2019.572.359-396,http://dx.doi.org/10.14421/ajis.2019.572.359-396,,,38,Religion,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Religion,MH2AT,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000546535300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet few studies have evaluated whether and how well resilience are integrated into climate change adaptation planning. In this study, we first conceptualized resilience as five key elements (i.e., system, collaboration, uncertainty, coping capacity, and adaptive capacity) and developed a coding protocol based on these key elements. We then used it to evaluate a sample of 50 climate change plans in the United States (US) that has a major adaptation component. We found that the concept of resilience has not been adequately embedded in US climate change plans and that the predominant notions of resilience has limited influence on how well plans integrate resilience. We also found that standalone adaptation plans outperform hybrid plans in addressing uncertainty and fostering systems thinking. Ultimately, major barriers exist in translating the concept of resilience into climate change planning practice.

A significant barrier to the development of effective and sustainable adaptive strategies for climate change in such places is the gap between risk and perceived risk. This study looks at a vulnerable location in Fiji-the densely populated Rewa River Delta where environmental changes resulting from shoreline retreat and floods are expected to increase over the next few decades and entail profound societal disruption. The numbers of people living in the Rewa Delta who know of climate change and could correctly identify its contributory causes are few although many rank its current manifestations (floods, riverbank erosion, groundwater salinization) as among their most serious environmental challenges. While lack of awareness is a barrier to adaptation, there are also cultural impediments to this such as short-term planning perspectives, spiritual beliefs, traditional governance structures. One way forward is to empower community leaders in places like the Rewa Delta to make appropriate decisions and for regional governments to continue working together to find solutions that acknowledge the variation in sub-regional trans-national vulnerability to climate change.","[Nunn, Patrick] Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Lata, Shalini] Univ S Pacific, Suva, Fiji",University of New England; University of the South Pacific,"Nunn, P (corresponding author), Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",pnunn3@une.edu.au,"Nunn, Patrick/ABA-2943-2021; Nunn, Patrick D./C-7864-2011","Nunn, Patrick/0000-0001-9295-5741; Nunn, Patrick D./0000-0001-9295-5741",University of the South Pacific,University of the South Pacific,Research work by SL was funded by the University of the South Pacific.

Perhaps the greatest challenge facing agricultural producers will be adapting water management to an increasingly variable climate. Adaptation will be extremely difficult, in part because other demands for water (e.g., energy, domestic, industrial, municipal) will continue to increase. Despite considerable improvements in irrigation technology, product development, and other water-saving approaches, agricultural producers will be expected to reduce water consumption and improve or protect water quality of water discharged from agricultural operations. In 2004, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture embarked on an effort to address Agricultural Water Security, ensuring sufficient water of the appropriate quality at the needed time to meet demands for food, fiber, and other agricultural goods and services. This effort identified six broad areas where agricultural research, education, and extension can impact water management to achieve agricultural water security. The six areas are: biotechnology, water reuse, general conservation, irrigation efficiency, water markets and trading, and drought preparedness. We present an overview of the six areas and opportunities for agriculture and specifically horticultural and specialty crop producers to adapt to climate change through improved water management.","[O'Neill, Michael P.; Dobrowolski, James P.] USDA, Natl Inst Food & Agr, Washington, DC 20250 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"O'Neill, MP (corresponding author), USDA, Natl Inst Food & Agr, 800 9th St SW, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",moneill@infa.usda.gov,,,,,,,21,13,14,2,30,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",0018-5345,2327-9834,,HORTSCIENCE,Hortscience,FEB,2011,46,2,,,,,155,157,,10.21273/HORTSCI.46.2.155,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI.46.2.155,,,3,Horticulture,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,721EI,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000287336000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such an approach was used in small kitchen meetings for the elaboration of an adaptation action plan that was approved by the municipal council in September 2013 and revised in November 2014. The impacts of climate hazards were discussed as obstacles to the desired future conditions expressed by participants. This approach allowed the planning of a number of adaptation options, to define roles and responsibilities of different actors involved and to articulate different plans that are either in existence or being developed, linking them with adaptation. Based on our observations and on other studies in the fields of social movements, psychology and risk perception, we suggest that the use of a vision in discussion meetings with local actors could increase their motivation by placing the avoidance of undesired situations in the context of reaching their aspirations, in other words by embedding a prevention problem in promotion logic. The expression of a vision of a desired future could allow them to express their values and could facilitate the framing of a plan in a way that is coherent with them. The visions could then also be used to frame awareness-raising activities along the values they express.","[Beaulieu, Nathalie; Silva, Julia Santos; Plante, Steve] Univ Quebec, Dept Soc Terr & Dev, Rimouski, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec,"Beaulieu, N (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Soc Terr & Dev, Rimouski, PQ, Canada.",nbeaulieu1@gmail.com,,,Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) through the Community-University Alliance (CURA) [833-2009-4010]; Ministry of Public Security; Conseil regional des elus de la Cote-Nord,Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) through the Community-University Alliance (CURA); Ministry of Public Security; Conseil regional des elus de la Cote-Nord,"This research was supported by a grant from the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC, [grant number 833-2009-4010]), through the Community-University Alliance (CURA) entitled Coastal communities Challenges in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence facing climate changes (CURA-CCC).

Yet, researchers and scholars have paid limited attention to the institution of chieftaincy and to understanding its role in the management of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. This paper draws on a micro ethnographic evaluation conducted in two predominantly rural districts of Malawi in southeast Africa to assess two different manifestations of elite control. In the first case, a resettlement programme was implemented where chiefs were co-opted and took the lead. In the second case, a food insecurity response programme was designed to exclude chiefs. The study finds that neither co-opting nor countering chiefs prevents elite capture. Rather, the majority of chiefs oscillate between malevolent and benevolent capture. The findings require that states focus on the cultural and political dimensions of rural life when designing climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction programmes.","[Kita, Stern Mwakalimi] Dept Disaster Management Affairs, Off Vice President, Private Bag 336, Lilongwe, Malawi",,"Kita, SM (corresponding author), Dept Disaster Management Affairs, Off Vice President, Private Bag 336, Lilongwe, Malawi.",stenkita@gmail.com,,"Kita, Stern Mwakalimi/0000-0002-8339-1697","University of Sussex, United Kingdom; Department of Disaster Management Affairs in Malawi","University of Sussex, United Kingdom; Department of Disaster Management Affairs in Malawi","The research on which this paper is based was part of a larger PhD study by the author that was supported by a Chancellor's International Research Scholarship at the University of Sussex, United Kingdom.

More than 63% of the 239 survey respondents believe that human activities are increasing the rate at which global climate changes occur, and 60% of 231 respondents adapted their management because of climate change. Cattle ranchers operating for less than 20 years were more likely to agree that human activities are increasing the rate of global climate change compared with those operating more than 40 years. This may reflect the fact that the concept of climate change has gained more public acceptance in the past 2 decades and would likely be perceived as a legitimate risk to an operation by those in this category in comparison with those who have been operating for a long period of time and tend to rely on experiential or embedded knowledge. Regional analysis showed that the most northerly region is more likely to have noticed change in climate compared with one of the most southern regions. With respect to operation of scale in terms of head of cattle, those ranches with more than 50 head of cattle identified water availability as a significant challenge to operations. Family succession planning was identified as a greater challenge for those operating their ranch for more than 40 years, compared with those operating less than 20 years. Adaptation to climate change included accessing available forage and providing a water source for cattle. Experiential and scientific knowledge will be crucial to future planning to reduce the vulnerability of the ranching industry and building adaptive capacity. (C) 2015 Society for Range Management.

However, research into adaptation has been scarce in terms of analysing power and the politics that in conjunction with socio-economic factors often determine how people in local communities in the Global South respond to climate change. In light of these considerations, the aim of this paper is to contribute to the wider effort to politicize adaptation to climate change research and, as a result, democratize adaptation policy and practice. It is argued that any kind of social vulnerability to climate change is, in essence, political. Once understood as a political process, adaptation should be studied critically by interrogating the local power structures and the resulting political inequalities that determine people's ability to benefit from programmes and projects that aim to facilitate local adaptation. This is necessary if such interventions are to avoid benefitting some while leaving others, and particularly the poor and marginalized, behind. Democratization is seen as a process that must occur (1) between communities and interventions, and (2) within local communities, themselves. The paper concludes with reflections on how democratizing adaptation could function in theory and practice.","[Mikulewicz, Michael] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Mikulewicz, M (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England.",michal.mikulewicz@manchester.ac.uk,,,University of Manchester,University of Manchester,I would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers whose insightful comments have greatly improved the arguments in this paper.

Climate change predictions were simulated using models perturbed with climatic data and A2 emission scenario. A biased correction method was applied to the simulated future climatic data. The study site reveals different nature of vulnerabilities to the changing climate based on climate change scenario downscaling. The variation in rainfall patterns, especially the seasonal shifts, would have likely impact on water availability for irrigation and subsequently on the crop growth. A detailed survey was conducted to investigate how farmers in HBCC perceive variations in weather patterns and the proposed adaptation measures. The statistical significance of farmers' perceptions and decisions about adaptation measures are reported with regard to their location along the secondary canals. The literature offers a range of potential climate change adaptation measures to the farming community that sometimes are not coherent with the national policy and the local practice. Farmers generally feel it difficult to pick a suitable adaptation option that suits their particular conditions. This research proposes a simple yet robust criterion to prioritize the potential climate change adaptation measures. This criterion (colloquially known as 3P) is based on three subjective factors - i.e. policy, prevalence and practicability - and it could be scaled out to other areas where results of climate change studies are available.","[Bhatti, Muhammad Tousif; Ahmad, Waqas; Shah, Muhammad Azeem] Int Water Management Inst, Lahore, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Waqas] Hongik Univ, Hydrol Innovat Lab, Dept Civil Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Khattak, Muhammad Shahzad] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Agr Engn, Peshawar, Pakistan",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); PCSIR Laboratories Complex; Hongik University; University of Engineering & Technology Peshawar,"Ahmad, W (corresponding author), Int Water Management Inst, Lahore, Pakistan.;Ahmad, W (corresponding author), Hongik Univ, Hydrol Innovat Lab, Dept Civil Engn, Seoul, South Korea.",waqas@alumni.ait.asia,"Ahmad, Waqas/T-3207-2019","Ahmad, Waqas/0000-0002-9607-1254; Bhatti, Muhammad Tousif/0000-0001-7834-6114",Abu Dhabi DialogueSmall Grants Programme Project under the South Asia Water Initiative (SAWI),Abu Dhabi DialogueSmall Grants Programme Project under the South Asia Water Initiative (SAWI),"Part of this research was supported by the Abu Dhabi DialogueSmall Grants Programme Project under the South Asia Water Initiative (SAWI) and co-ordinated by the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), Nepal.",,15,6,6,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

However, despite emerging research interest, they continue to occupy the peripheries of mainstream agriculture. There is a need to consolidate the gains made and propose a coherent strategy for translating underutilised crops into mainstream agriculture. The status of underutilised crops in South Africa (past, present and on-going research) was reviewed with a view to identifying existing gaps, opportunities and challenges for developing future research capacity. The review confirmed that several underutilised crops are drought tolerant, adapted to low levels of water use and thus suitable for cultivation in most marginal production areas typical of semi-arid and arid cropping systems. In addition, several are nutrient dense and could be used to improve dietary diversity among poor rural people. These characteristics make them ideal for inclusion in climate change adaptation and promotion of food sovereignty. There is need for a paradigm shift away from practices that have promoted a few major crops to an agro-ecology based land use classification system that recognises diversity and strengthens food networks. There is a need to identify those underutilised crops that show the greatest potential for success and can be fitted into semi-arid and arid cropping systems and prioritise them for future research, development and innovation.","[Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe; Chimonyo, Vimbayi G.

In developing countries, the low-hanging fruit; no-regret options, should be identified with stakeholders and assessed against future changes in water availability and demand, for comparing effectiveness and robustness. Such integrated basin-scale assessments, including reservoir catchment and command areas, can suitably inform adaptation decision-making. In this study, we integrate participatory and modelling approaches for evaluation of reservoir catchment and command area no-regret options addressing water availability and demand in the Kangsabati river basin. Through multi-level stakeholder workshops we identify and prioritize options, followed by evaluation of two reservoir catchment options; check dams and increasing forest cover and three reservoir command options; changing cropping pattern, traditional ponds and waste water reuse, using the Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) model. We use four high resolution (similar to 25 km) regional climate model simulations of future climatic factors, along with non-climatic factors affecting water demand, for forcing WEAP. We find that options have varied ability in addressing adaptation requirements. Amongst catchment options, increasing forest cover addresses adaptation requirements more suitably than check dams, while in the command areas we observe mixed abilities of options, leading to the inference that combining complementary options may be a more useful strategy. We conclude by discussing our experiences with this approach in a developing country context, in terms of benefits, limitations, lessons learnt and future research directions.","[Bhave, Ajay Gajanan] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Mittal, Neha] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mishra, Ashok; Raghuwanshi, Narendra Singh] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Agr & Food Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Leeds; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Bhave, AG (corresponding author), Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",ajaybhave84@gmail.com; nehamitts@gmail.com; amishra@agfe.iitkgp.ernet.in; nsr@agfe.iitkgp.ernet.in,"Raghuwanshi, Narendra/E-7321-2016","Mittal, Neha/0000-0002-7875-9952; Bhave, Ajay/0000-0001-5896-8661",HighNoon project; European Commission Framework Programme [227087]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,HighNoon project; European Commission Framework Programme(European Commission); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We wish to acknowledge the financial support from the HighNoon project, funded by the European Commission Framework Programme 7, under Grant Number 227087.

This can be achieved by the precise scheduling of deficit irrigation systems taking into account the crops' response to water stress at different stages of plant growth. Particularly in the light of climate change with rising population numbers and increasing water scarcity, an optimal solution for this task is of paramount importance. We solve the corresponding complex multidimensional and nonlinear optimization problem, i.e., finding the ideal schedule for maximum crop yield with a given water volume by a well tailored approach which offers straightforward application facilities. A global optimization technique allows, together with physically based modeling, for the risk assessment in yield reduction considering different sources of uncertainty (e.g., climate, soil conditions, and management). A new stochastic framework for decision support is developed which aims at optimal climate change adaption strategies in irrigation. It consists of: (1) a weather generator for simulating regional impacts of climate change; (2) a tailor-made evolutionary optimization algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling with limited water supply; and (3) mechanistic models for rigorously simulating water transport and crop growth. The result, namely, stochastic crop-water production functions, allows to assess the impact of climate variability on potential yield and thus provides a valuable tool for estimating minimum water demands for irrigation in water resources planning and management, assisting furthermore in generating maps of yield uncertainty for specific crops and specific agricultural areas. The tool is successfully applied at an experimental site in southern France. The impacts of predicted climate variability on maize are discussed.","[Schuetze, Niels; Schmitz, Gerd H.] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrol & Meteorol, D-01187 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Schutze, N (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrol & Meteorol, Wurzburger St 46, D-01187 Dresden, Germany.",ns1@rcs.urz.tu-dresden.de,"Schütze, Niels/AAI-9459-2020; Schütze, Niels/D-4984-2009","Schütze, Niels/0000-0002-2376-528X; Schütze, Niels/0000-0002-2376-528X",E.U.

Some European authors highlighted already the need to look at conflicting interests when elaborating and applying adaptation and mitigation strategies. This study analysed the level of consideration of these emerging topics arising through increased competition of resources, contrasting interests, climate change adaptation as well as mitigation measures for Austria and Southern Germany in detail. Furthermore, it surveyed the application of possible approaches for conflict prevention and mitigation in an international perspective and additionally examined the particular role of SEA as one of the instruments to cope with conflicts related to climate change. The results express the strong need to look at emerging conflicts in cross-sectoral and sectoral adaptation early enough and a strategic perspective. Based on the content analysis of the Austrian and German adaptation and mitigation documents, expert interviews as well as the international literature review, a rather low consideration of these emerging topics as well as approaches to cope with them became evident. In response to these deficiencies, the paper introduces a first framework to identify and tackle emerging and exacerbated conflicts related to climate change. This novel framework is internationally applicable. In the final step of the framework approaches to prevent and minimize conflicts are the key topic. Among these approaches, SEA could take a leading role in case mandatory planning instruments cover the topics related to potential or existing exacerbated fields of conflicts. Overall a mix of formal and informal instruments and a more cross-sectoral perspective seems necessary. To this aim, the paper introduces four main guiding principles to consider and minimize up-coming conflicting topics.","[Jiricka-Puerrer, Alexandra] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Wachter, Thomas] Hannover Herne Munchen Berlin, Bosch & Partner, Lortzingstr 1, D-30177 Hannover, Germany","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Jiricka-Purrer, A (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",Alexandra.jiricka@boku.ac.at; t.wachter@boschpartner.de,,"Jiricka-Purrer, Alexandra/0000-0002-6842-1835",StartClim,StartClim,"We thank all interview partners who allowed to carry out this transdisciplinary research.

This information ranges from climate scenarios, geographical site information, socio-economic data and several possible adaptation measures. Thus, there is an urgent need to have a framework that is capable of organizing adaptation strategies and measures in the agriculture and forestry sectors in Mediterranean climatic regions. Additionally, this framework should provide a cause effect relation with climate vulnerability to adequately support the development of adaptation planning at municipal and local (farm) level. In this context, we propose to test and evaluate a framework for climate adaptation of the agriculture and forestry sectors, based on the local causal-effect relation between adaptation strategies and measures and the level of vulnerability reduction achieved for Mediterranean areas. The framework was developed based on the combination of the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impacts, Responses) and Vulnerability frameworks and reviewed 162 practical adaptation measures, further organized into strategies, complemented by a set of efficacy indicators. The framework was tested with 70 stakeholders in six stakeholder workshops for the planning of two farms and one municipal climate adaptation study, that are now in actual implementation and monitoring. The framework is composed by a set of eight adaptation strategies in which adaptation measures are clustered and assessed using efficacy indicators. In the evaluation of the adaptation framework, 96% of stakeholders considered its content as good or very good and 89% considered the final outcomes as good or very good. Finally, the framework was also used to assess and compare the adaptation strategies and measures presented in the climate adaptation plans of the three case studies. On average, 52.2% of the adaptation measures selected by the three case studies are dedicated to Ecosystem Resilience, 30.9% to Adaptive Capacity, 9.1% to Microclimates, 7.4% to Protection, and 0.3% to Mitigation strategies. This framework was considered effective in supporting adaptation planning at farm and municipal levels and useful to assess and compare adaptation plans in the frame of vulnerability reduction. Future studies can further contribute to support adaptation planning in these sectors by using, developing and streamlining this framework to additional and different socio-ecological contexts.","[Vizinho, Andre; Avelar, David; Branquinho, Cristina; Capela Lourenco, Tiago; Carvalho, Silvia; Nunes, Alice; Sucena-Paiva, Leonor; Oliveira, Hugo; Fonseca, Ana Lucia; Duarte Santos, Filipe; Penha-Lopes, Gil] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes Ce3c, Bloco C2,Piso 5, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Roxo, Maria Jose] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias Sociais & Humanas, Ave Berna 26-C, P-1069061 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Vizinho, A (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes Ce3c, Bloco C2,Piso 5, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",andrevizinho@fc.ul.pt; dnavelar@fc.ul.pt; cmbranquinho@fc.ul.pt; tcapela@fc.ul.pt; sccarvalho@fc.ul.pt; amanunes@fc.ul.pt; mlpaiva@fc.ul.pt; hfoliveira@fc.ul.pt; alfonseca@fc.ul.pt; fdsantos@fc.ul.pt; mj.roxo@fcsh.unl.pt; gppenha-lopes@fc.ul.pt,"Nunes, Alice M.R./B-4817-2014; Lourenço, Tiago Capela/B-4947-2008; Branquinho, Cristina/B-3670-2008; Penha-Lopes, Gil/N-1475-2015; Santos, Filipe/M-7709-2013","Nunes, Alice M.R./0000-0002-6900-3838; Lourenço, Tiago Capela/0000-0002-8796-5993; Branquinho, Cristina/0000-0001-8294-7924; Vizinho, Andre/0000-0002-0503-3624; Penha-Lopes, Gil/0000-0002-1024-1954; Oliveira, Hugo/0000-0001-5953-3686; Carvalho, Silvia/0000-0002-8414-6503; Santos, Filipe/0000-0001-7316-1479; Sucena-Paiva, Leonor/0000-0003-3138-5428; Fonseca, Ana Lucia/0000-0001-5711-0698",BASE Bottom up Adaptation for a Sustainable Europe [308337]; EEA Grants/Programa AdaPT project AdaptForChange (2015-2016); EU LIFE Programme [LIFE15 CCA/PT/000043]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [PD/BD/113929/2015]; FCT [IF/00940/2015]; cE3c FCT Unit [UIDB/00329/2020]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PD/BD/113929/2015] Funding Source: FCT,BASE Bottom up Adaptation for a Sustainable Europe; EEA Grants/Programa AdaPT project AdaptForChange (2015-2016); EU LIFE Programme; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); cE3c FCT Unit; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,"This research was funded by BASE Bottom up Adaptation for a Sustainable Europe (2012-2016) (Grant Agreement No. 308337), EEA Grants/Programa AdaPT project AdaptForChange (2015-2016) and the EU LIFE Programme with project LIFE Montado-Adapt (LIFE15 CCA/PT/000043) (2016-2021).

The 10 Essential Public Health Services can be applied to adaptation activities. Objective: To develop a state health department climate and health adaptation plan as informed by stakeholder feedback. Design: With Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) implemented a 2010-2013 climate and health planning process, including 7 surveys on perceptions and adaptation priorities. Participants: New York State Department of Health program managers participated in initial (n = 41, denominator unknown) and follow-up (72.2%) needs assessments. Surveillance system information was collected from 98.1% of surveillance system managers. For adaptation prioritization surveys, participants included 75.4% of NYSDOH leaders; 60.3% of local health departments (LHDs); and 53.7% of other stakeholders representing environmental, governmental, health, community, policy, academic, and business organizations. Interviews were also completed with 38.9% of other stakeholders. Results: In 2011 surveys, 34.1% of state health program directors believed that climate change would impact their program priorities. However, 84.6% of state health surveillance system managers provided ideas for using databases for climate and health monitoring/surveillance. In 2012 surveys, 46.5% of state health leaders agreed they had sufficient information about climate and health compared to 17.1% of LHDs (P = .0046) and 40.9% of other stakeholders (nonsignificant difference). Significantly fewer (P < .0001) LHDs (22.9%) were incorporating or considering incorporating climate and health into planning compared to state health leaders (55.8%) and other stakeholders (68.2%). Stakeholder groups agreed on the 4 highest priority adaptation categories including core public health activities such as surveillance, coordination/collaboration, education, and policy development. Conclusions: Feedback from diverse stakeholders was utilized by NYSDOH to develop its Climate and Health Strategic Map in 2013.

By using structured questionnaire, the data from 816 respondents were collected from seven provinces of Vietnam. We used ordinary least squares regression and logistic regression approach to analyze farmers' belief, perception of climatic change, and risk attitude towards climatic hazards. Results revealed that farmers in the study area are using the most common climatic risk management strategies including applying new technologies, adjustment of the seasonal calendar, and diversification. Findings further revealed that that farm households were mostly concerned about the risk in soil erosion and washout, followed by the stress of prolonging dry season and droughts. The study participants also reported a decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature and frequency and incidence of other extreme climatic events. A positive significant relationship was found between farm management practices and ecological communities. Risk perceptions and attitude toward climate change are essential factors among farm households of northern mountains of Vietnam.

(2012) for Brazil, by using the new Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) projections and more recent 2010 social indicators data. The updated maps differ significantly from their earlier versions in two main ways. First, they show that heavily populated metropolitan areas - namely Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Salvador, Manaus, Rio de Janeiro and So Paulo - and a large swath of land across the states of So Paulo, Minas Gerais and Bahia now have the highest SCVI values, that is, their populations are the most vulnerable to climate change in the country. Second, SCVI values for Northeast Brazil are considerably lower compared to the previous index version. An analysis of the causes of such difference reveals that changes in climate projections between CMIP3 and CMIP5 are responsible for most of the change between the different SCVI values and spatial distribution, while changes in social indicators have less influence, despite recent countrywide improvements in social indicators as a result of aggressive anti-poverty programs. These results raise the hypothesis that social reform alone may not be enough to decrease people's vulnerability to future climatic changes. Whereas the coarse spatial resolution and relatively simplistic formulation of the SCVI may limit how useful these maps are at informing decision-making at the local level, they can provide a valuable input for large-scale policies on climate change adaptation such as those of the Brazilian National Policy on Climate Change Adaptation.","[Darela Filho, Joao Paulo; Lapola, David M.] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Dept Ecol, Earth Syst Sci Lab, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [Torres, Roger R.] Fed Univ Itajuba IRN UNIFEI, Nat Resources Inst, BR-37500903 Itajuba, MG, Brazil; [Lemos, Maria Carmen] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Universidade Estadual Paulista; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Darela, JP (corresponding author), Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Dept Ecol, Earth Syst Sci Lab, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil.",jpdarela@rc.unesp.br,"Torres, Roger Rodrigues/G-1043-2012; Filho, João Paulo Darela/I-1624-2014; Lapola, David M/N-4954-2017; Filho, João Paulo Darela/AAC-9179-2019","Torres, Roger Rodrigues/0000-0002-5684-3125; Filho, João Paulo Darela/0000-0002-0277-0370; Filho, João Paulo Darela/0000-0002-0277-0370; Lemos, Maria Carmen/0000-0001-6686-730X",Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP [2013/09742-0]; Minas Gerais State Research Foundation - FAPEMIG [APQ-01088-14]; U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-1061966],Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Minas Gerais State Research Foundation - FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study was supported by Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP (grant no 2013/09742-0), by the Minas Gerais State Research Foundation - FAPEMIG (APQ-01088-14) and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF grant no SES-1061966).

Yet there is still limited understanding of how to determine whether and how adaptation is occurring. Through qualitative analysis of focus group interviews, I evaluated individual behavioral responses to local forest stressors that can arguably be linked to global climate change among landowners in the Upper Midwest, USA. I found that landowner responses were planned as well as autonomous, more proactive than reactive, incremental rather than transformational, and aimed at being resilient to change and transitioning to new conditions, rather than resisting change alone. Many of the landowners' responses can be considered forms of adaptation, rather than coping, because they were aimed at moderating and avoiding harm on long time horizons in anticipation of change. These findings stand in contrast to the short-term, reactive, and incremental responses that current socio-psychological theories of adaptation suggest are more typical at the individual level. This study contributes to scientific understanding of how to evaluate behavioral adaptation to climate change and differentiate it from coping, which is necessary for developing conceptually rigorous analytical frameworks to guide research and policy.","[Fischer, Alexandra Paige] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 49109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Fischer, AP (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 49109 USA.",apfisch@umich.edu,"Fischer, Alexandra Paige/D-4068-2016","Fischer, Alexandra Paige/0000-0003-2274-1689","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire-Stennis Program [1011135]; USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, University of Michigan Energy Institute; University of Michigan Graham Sustainability Institute","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire-Stennis Program; USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, University of Michigan Energy Institute; University of Michigan Graham Sustainability Institute","This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire-Stennis Program (1011135), USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, University of Michigan Energy Institute, and University of Michigan Graham Sustainability Institute.",,105,30,32,1,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

The paper begins with a discussion of the economic meaning of impact and adaptation. Noting that analyses of impacts have focused on economic variables such as farm income or value of farm assets, we describe a modeling approach that allows environmental indicators, such as the productivity or value of the ecosystem and its components, to be included in impact assessments. The approach is based on a model of farm-level decisionmaking that represents land-use and crop-specific management decisions, as a function of the spatial heterogeneity of the physical environment, technology, prices of outputs and inputs, and policy variables. Using this model, it is then possible to discuss a number of key issues that arise in modeling impacts of and adaptation to climate change. These issues include the effect of choosing a modeling 'scale' or level of data aggregation; technological innovation and adoption; and changes in economic or environmental policies.",,,"Antle, JM (corresponding author), MONTANA STATE UNIV,DEPT AGR ECON,BOZEMAN,MT 59717, USA.",,,,,,,,26,31,32,1,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1923,,,AGR FOREST METEOROL,Agric.

This paper investigates the generation of climate change adapted simulation weather data for locations worldwide from readily available data sets. An approach is presented for 'morphing' existing EnergyPlus/ESP-r Weather (EPW) data with UK Met Office Hadley Centre general circulation model (GCM) predictions for a 'medium-high' emissions scenario (A2). It was found that, for the United Kingdom (UK), the GCM 'morphed' data shows a smoothing effect relative to data generated from the corresponding regional climate model (RCM) outputs. This is confirmed by building performance simulations of a naturally ventilated UK office building which highlight a consistent temperature distribution profile between GCM and RCM 'morphed' data, yet with a shift in the distribution. It is demonstrated that, until more detailed RCM data becomes available globally, 'morphing' with GCM data can be considered as a viable interim approach to generating climate change adapted weather data.

The risks are reduced more effectively if both planned and autonomous adaptations take place. Flood risk management is dominated by planned adaptation, which is primarily command-and-control in nature, e.g. spatial planning and engineered flood defenses. If autonomous adaptation is downplayed people are more likely to make land-use choices that collectively lead to increasing flood risks while leaving the costs of adaptation and land scarcity with governments. Unless governments provide stimuli, autonomous adaptation in flood-prone areas is unlikely to happen due to spatial externalities, path-dependency and time lag between private investment decisions and consequences. This paper reviews the theory and practice of using market-based instruments (MBIs) for flood-risk management as means for autonomous climate change adaptation. While the use of MBIs for climate change mitigation is widely discussed, systematized reviews of various MBIs for climate change adaptation are rare. Yet, international experience shows that such measures as preferential taxes, non-perverse subsidies, flood insurance, marketable permits and transferable development rights can engage local stakeholders and provide price signals that stimulate individual adaptation. MBIs combined with command-based instruments help policy-makers to guide developments in flood-prone zone by affecting individual behavior via market forces. As adverse consequences of climate change become more pronounced locally, quantity-based MBIs unfeasible at present should become more attractive. Price-based MBIs that are currently employed could be designed to strategically account for increasing climate-induced flood and erosion probabilities in coastal and delta areas.

This paper provides an overview of the constraints and barriers to public health adaptation and explores future research directions in this emerging field. An extensive literature review was conducted in 2010 and published literature from 2000 to 2010 was retrieved. This review shows that public health adaptation essentially can operate at two levels, namely, adaptive-capacity building and implementation of adaptation actions. However, there are constraints and barriers to public health adaptation arising from uncertainties of future climate and socioeconomic conditions, as well as financial, technologic, institutional, social capital, and individual cognitive limits. The opportunities for planning and implementing public health adaptation are reliant on effective strategies to overcome these constraints and barriers. It is proposed here that high research priority should be given to multidisciplinary research on the assessment of potential health impacts of climate change, projections of health impacts under different climate and socioeconomic scenarios, identification of health co-benefits of mitigation strategies, and evaluation of cost-effective public health adaptation options.

Climate variability is a challenge to tourism destinations, especially coastal and Island destinations, categories under which Mombasa, our study site falls under. Mombasa has limited capacity to adapt to climate change considering its socio economic conditions and weak institutions, thus making it necessary to explore the possible sustainable pathways for the city using the enhanced Regional Tourism Sustainable Adaptation Framework. Earlier frameworks for tourism adaptation to climate change lacked focus on regional dynamics as well as sustainability aspects, and their implementation pose the risk of mal adaptation to some extent. Using secondary data and data from interviews with tourism stakeholders in Mombasa, the enhanced Regional Tourism Sustainable Adaptation Framework guides our assessment of vulnerability and resilience of the destination, as well as identification of region specific adaptation options for the city within the context of sustainable practice. Based on climate change perceived impacts, risks and vulnerability various adaptation options are presented and discussed as provided in literature. The usefulness of the framework in guiding regional tourism destination managers and policy makers in their pursuit for a regional adaptation options within the tourism sector in order to reduce destinations vulnerability, increase resilience and take advantage of opportunities presented by climate change is underscored.","[Njoroge, Joseph Muiruri] Muranga Univ Technol, Sch Hospitality & Tourism Management, POB 75-10200, Muranga, Kenya; [Ratter, Beate M.

Adaptation may be necessary to ensure that infrastructure offers consistent service and remains cost effective. But long service times and deep uncertainty associated with future climate projections make adaptation decisions especially challenging for managers. Incorporating flexibility into systems can increase their effectiveness across different climate futures but can also add significant costs. In this paper we review existing work on flexibility in climate change adaptation of infrastructure, such as robust decision-making and dynamic adaptive pathways, apply a basic typology of flexibility, and test alternative strategies for flexibility in distributed infrastructure systems comprised of multiple emplacements of a common, long-lived element: roadway culverts. Rather than treating a system of dispersed infrastructure elements as monolithic, we simulate options flexibility in which inherent differences in individual elements is incorporated into adaptation decisions. We use a virtual testbed of highway drainage crossing structures to examine the performance under different climate scenarios of policies that allow for multiple adaptation strategies with varying timing based on individual emplacement characteristics. Results indicate that a strategy with options flexibility informed by crossing characteristics offers a more efficient method of adaptation than do monolithic policies. In some cases this results in more cost-effective adaptation for agencies building long-lived, climate-sensitive infrastructure, even where detailed system data and analytical capacity is limited.","[McCurdy, Adam D.; Travis, William R.] Univ Colorado, Western Water Assessment, Campus Box 216, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [McCurdy, Adam D.; Travis, William R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Campus Box 260, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Travis, WR (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Campus Box 260, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",adam.mccurdy@colorado.edu; William.travis@colorado.edu,,"Travis, William/0000-0002-9197-1317","Western Water Assessment, a project of the University of Colorado's Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences - U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA10OAR4310214]","Western Water Assessment, a project of the University of Colorado's Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences - U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","This work was supported by the Western Water Assessment, a project of the University of Colorado's Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences, funded by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under Climate Program Office grant #NA10OAR4310214.",,54,2,2,2,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

But there is limited understanding about forest agencies' role in the adoption of new governance modes and their contribution to policy delivery. By drawing on a qualitative implementation study of Bavaria's Mountain Forest Initiative in locally-operating forest agencies, the present paper addresses these gaps. The government wants them to establish collaborative arrangements with various stakeholders to facilitate measures for adaptation to climate change in private forests. The cross-case comparison provides detailed empirical insights into distinct sets of activities for making the initiative 'work'. Stakeholder participation gains a firm basis at the local level if forest agencies develop interest in and generate ownership of prospects for collaborative planning, and tailor these to their needs. The study suggests, however, that involvement of local stakeholders in forest planning is not necessarily instrumental for delivery of effective policies, as reliance on the local level entails the risk that the broader picture of initial policy goals gets lost.

The research relies on 13 interviews with aid agencies and eight focus group discussions with participatory activities at local community level. While aid agencies actively responded during and after Pam, local people too responded to the event with strategies based on livelihoods diversification, food security techniques, traditional knowledge and cooperation intra- and inter-communities. The study emphasizes the need for an integrative approach where disaster responses from the top-down integrate that from the bottom-up. Aid agencies should build on the livelihood mechanisms developed at local level so responses and recovery can be more effective, socioculturally acceptable and may lead to sustainable outcomes of disaster risk reduction including climate change adaptation.","[Le De, Loic] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth & Psychosocial Studies, Auckland, New Zealand; [Rey, Tony; Leone, Frederic] Univ Montpellier 3, Dept Geog, Montpellier, France; [Rey, Tony; Leone, Frederic] UMR GRED, Montpellier, France; [David, Gilbert] IRD Res Inst Dev, UMR Espace Dev, Montpellier, France",Auckland University of Technology; Universite de Montpellier; Universite Paul-Valery; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Universite des Antilles; University of La Reunion; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Le De, L (corresponding author), Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth & Psychosocial Studies, Auckland, New Zealand.",loic.le.de@aut.ac.nz,,,French Institute of Research for Development/Institut de recherche pour le developpement (IRD),French Institute of Research for Development/Institut de recherche pour le developpement (IRD),"The authors thank the French Institute of Research for Development/Institut de recherche pour le developpement (IRD) who funded this research.

A sample of 225 households' farms from the participating 15 LGAs in Ondo State were randomly selected. However, only 200 questionnaires were properly filled and returned. The study deployed both descriptive and inferential statistics (t-test and regression models) to achieve its objectives. The study found that only 20% of the households have strategies to ensure a smooth succession of the management in the family farm. The results of the probit regression analysis showed that the membership of collaborative groupings significantly and positively influenced the per capita household farm income and households' decision to adapt management strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. In addition, findings from the study also empirically validated that farmers who adapted to the climate earned a higher farm income than non-adapters. On the strength of these findings, the study recommends that more farmers should be encouraged to form collaborative groupings where they can also share in the numerous benefits of being in such a network, including the access to more information on adaptation to climate change.","[Ikuemonisan, Edamisan Stephen] Adekunle Ajasin Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Akungba Akoko PMD 001, Adekunle Ajasin, Nigeria; [Ajibefun, Igbekele Amos] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, PMB 704, Akure, Nigeria",,"Ikuemonisan, ES (corresponding author), Adekunle Ajasin Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Akungba Akoko PMD 001, Adekunle Ajasin, Nigeria.",edamisan.ikuemonisan@aaua.edu.ng; iajibefun@yahoo.com,,"Ajibefun, Igbekele/0000-0001-6492-9036; Ikuemonisan, Edamisan/0000-0001-7121-6392",,,,,72,0,1,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2021,13,24,,,,,,,13668,10.3390/su132413668,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132413668,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YI7CY,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000744004000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Efforts to understand national-level vulnerability in these countries are limited. This paper helps to fill this gap and has two main aims. First, it identifies trends in national-level climate change adaptation among SIDS in the Caribbean region. Second, it identifies the limits to adaptation at the national level in these countries. In applying a resilience lens, and using summative content analysis techniques and semi-structured interviews with 26 senior policy-makers, this paper finds that Caribbean SIDS are primarily adapting to changes in hurricane, rainfall, and drought patterns. It also finds that most adaptations are being undertaken in the coastal zone and the water and agriculture sectors, and that there are many factors limiting national-level adaptation. The most commonly reported limit is financing, though not all policy-makers agree that financing is a limit. These findings are important for national SIDS governments and international donors and agencies that will be better able to identify and fill gaps in their adaptation actions and financing. This paper's findings also highlight the importance of depoliticising climate change and prioritising good governance, improving SIDS' access to international adaptation financing, and making the road to a climate-resilient future by walking.","[Robinson, Stacy-ann] Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Robinson, SA (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",stacy-ann_robinson@brown.edu,"Robinson, Stacy-ann/R-2769-2019","Robinson, Stacy-ann/0000-0003-3163-8771",Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University,Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University,The author would like to acknowledge fieldwork funding from the Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University; helpful comments from the anonymous reviewers; and proofreading and editing support from Sonya Gurwitt.,,60,36,36,9,36,Island Studies Journal,Copenhagen,"c/o Adam Grydehj, Lillegrund 39, Copenhagen, DENMARK",,1715-2593,,ISL STUD J,Isl.

However, introducing these network-centred deliberations between public and private players may contrast with institutionalized traditions of interest intermediation between state and society. This paper shows how these so-called state traditions affect the processes and outcomes of newly set up deliberative governance initiatives. Because of the similarities in geographical characteristics and the differences in state tradition we conducted a qualitative case study comparison of Dutch and British water management. Our comparison is two-fold. First, we compare deliberative governance initiatives in the different state traditions of the Netherlands and UK. Second, we compare the newly set up deliberative governance initiative to an existing policy regime mainstreaming climate adaptation in a similar state tradition, in our case the Netherlands. We find that: (1) deliberative governance initiatives in the corporatist state tradition of the Netherlands yields learning but shows apathy among politically elected decision-makers compared to deliberative governance initiatives in the pluralist state tradition of the UK where clearly defined rules and responsibilities yields negotiation and action; and (2) a typical corporatist policy regime mainstreaming climate adaption in a corporatist state tradition yields effective and legitimate policy formation but lacks learning.","[Vink, M.

The disappearance of wetland ecosystems due to coastal development prevents birds from completing their migrations, resulting in population declines, and even an eventual collapse of the migration phenomenon. Coastal wetlands are also under threat from global climate change and its consequences, notably sea level rise (SLR), extreme storm events, and accompanying wave and tidal surges. The impacts of SLR are compounded by coastal subsidence and decreasing sedimentation, which can result from coastal development. Thus, important wetlands along the flyway should be assessed for the impacts of climate change and coastal subsidence to plan and implement proactive climate adaptation strategies that include habitat migration and possibility of coastal squeeze. We modelled the impacts of climate change and decreasing sedimentation rates on important bird habitats in the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site to support a climate adaptation strategy that will continue to host migratory birds. Located in the Inner Deep Bay of the Pearl River estuary, Mai Po's tidal flats, coastal mangroves, marshes, and fishponds provide habitat for over 80,000 wintering and passage waterbirds. We applied the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) to simulate habitat conversion under two SLR scenarios (1.5m and 2.0m) for 2050, 2075, and 2100 for four accretion rates (2mm/yr, 4 mm/yr, 8 mm/yr, 15 mm/yr). The results showed no discernible impact to habitats until after 2075, but projections for 2100 show that the mangroves, marshes and tidal flats could be impacted in almost all scenarios of SLR and accretion. Under a 1.5m SLR scenario, even at low tide, if accretion levels decrease to 4 mm/yr, the tidal flats will be inundated and with a 2 mm/yr accretion the mangroves will also be inundated. Thus, important shorebird habitats will be lost. During high tide the ponds inside the nature reserve, which are intensively managed to provide high tide roosting sites and other habitats for waterbirds, will also be inundated. Thus, with a 1.5m SLR and declining sedimentation the migratory shorebirds will lose habitat, including the high tide roosting habitats inside the nature reserve. The model also indicates that the fishponds further inland in the Ramsar site will be less impacted. Most fishponds are privately owned and could be developed in the future, including into high rise apartments; thus, securing them for conservation should be an important climate change adaptation strategy for Mai Po, since they provide essential habitats for birds under future climate change scenarios. But Mai Po is only one steppingstone along the EAAF, and hundreds of other wetlands are also threatened by encroaching infrastructure and climate change. Thus, similar analyses for the other wetlands are recommended to develop a flyway-wide climate-adaptation conservation strategy before available options become lost to wetland conversion.","[Wikramanayake, Eric; Or, Carmen; Wen, Xianji; Cheung, Fion] WWF Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Costa, Felipe; Shapiro, Aurelie] WWF Germany Space Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Shapiro, Aurelie] Here There Mapping Solut, Berlin, Germany",World Wildlife Fund,"Wikramanayake, E (corresponding author), WWF Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ericw@wwf.org.hk,,"Wikramanayake, Eric/0000-0002-1373-6952; Shapiro, Aurelie/0000-0001-9693-9394",general Mai Po Nature Reserve management fund; WWF Hong Kong,general Mai Po Nature Reserve management fund; WWF Hong Kong,"The analysis was supported by the general Mai Po Nature Reserve management fund, which is capitalized from multiple sources and managed by WWF Hong Kong.

Crop growth models can help identify and assess such strategies. In this study, the SUBSTOR potato model was used in a systematic assessment of all cultivar parameters in the model in a range of environments including temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions to identify options for future crop improvement and to develop strategies for climate change adaptation in potato production. Our results show that yield responses to changes in cultivar parameters are specific to the environment. Some changes are less effective in subtropical and tropical environments and more effective in increasing yields in temperate environments. Solar radiation, day length, and temperature are the environmental factors that constrain the effectiveness of cultivar parameters in changing yields. The simulated variation in yields among environments was larger than the variation from changes in cultivar parameters. The impact of cultivar parameter changes on yield also varied with the cultivar parameter. The potential tuber growth rate was the cultivar parameter with the strongest effect on yields. Changes in the potential tuber growth rate parameter can lead to large yield changes in tropical highlands and temperate environments that have high solar radiation to ensure sufficient assimilate production for a larger sink. Results also suggest that improving crop management (e.g., N input) is more important for increasing yields than the potential in cultivar improvement. The study showed that crop modeling can help assess alternative strategies of yield improvement and support targeting and prioritization of efforts to improve crop productivity across different environments, based on an improved understanding of genotype by environment by management interactions. Results also showed how crop models can yield insights relevant for climate change adaptation even when only using weather data of the current climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to ascertain farmers' risk behavior towards flood and their willingness to pay (WTP) for flood insurance as a strategy for climate change adaptation and agricultural sustainability, this study employed survey data collected from 480 flood-affected farm households in northern Bangladesh with experiment-based risk preference and subjective risk perception data. Farmers' flood risk perceptions and attitude were assessed through risk matrix and ELCE technique (equally likely certainty equivalent) and used as independent variables in a probit regression model. Farmers' WTP decisions were found to be influenced by a variety of factors, including land ownership status, off-farm income, flood experience, farmers' group and access to information and extension services. Additionally, the findings indicated that farmers' subjective risk perceptions and experiment-based risk aversion measures were positively and significantly linked with their decision to purchase flood insurance. Risk-averse farmers were more inclined to obtain insurance and those who perceived greater flood risk factors were more willing to pay for flood insurance than those who perceived lower risks. In designing the insurance scheme, the socio-economic features of flood affected rural farm households as well as their risk perceptions and attitudes should be considered carefully.","[Hossain, Mohammad Shakhawat] World Vision Bangladesh, BIeNGS Project, Jamalpur 2000, Bangladesh; [Hossain, Mohammad Shakhawat; Rabbany, Md.

To reduce these costs, sector-specific climate change adaptation measures are needed, raising the question of the net benefits of adaptation at a macroeconomic level. However, despite their importance such assessments of impacts and adaptation at the macrolevel are scarce and coarse in their implementation. This paper contributes to fill this research gap by analyzing specific adaptation measures for the road and rail sectors in Austria using a computable general equilibrium model. The findings are as follows: First, direct impact costs more than double due to macroeconomic linkages. Hence, the indirect costs are found to be larger than the direct costs. Second, when analyzing adaptation measures for the road and rail sectors, without capturing any indirect effects, benefit-cost ratios imply a clear benefit only for the rail sector. However, when indirect effects via sectoral interlinkages are also captured, adaptation measures in both sectors, road and rail, clearly pay off. Climate change-induced GDP and welfare losses are reduced by 55 and 34% and lead to positive employment effects. Third, even at rather low damage reduction potentials, adaptation leads to a net benefit at the macroeconomic level.","[Bachner, Gabriel] Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Bachner, G (corresponding author), Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria.",gabriel.bachner@uni-graz.at,"Bachner, Gabriel/N-7536-2019","Bachner, Gabriel/0000-0003-2025-0747",University of Graz; Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (Austrian Climate Research Program) [adapt2to4],University of Graz; Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (Austrian Climate Research Program),"Open access funding provided by University of Graz.

This article focuses on island ocean states (IOS), or 'small island developing states' (SIDS), which are characterized by limited land and oceanic remoteness, creating local and international dependencies for food, livelihoods, trade and transport. While IOS contribute less than 1% to global green-house gases, they are directly impacted by extreme weather and climate change, in particular sea level rise. Near-shore marine ecosystems (mangroves, seagrasses and coral reefs) provide critical coastal protection and other benefits (e.g. fisheries), yet continue to be degraded from coastal development. Given their importance, restoration is needed where ecosystem function has declined, in concert with conservation of healthy sites. The overall restoration goals for IOS are to: i) enhance ecological integrity, ii) inspire local capacity building, and iii) accelerate climate change adaptation. This article examines the scope for such restoration through the UN SDGs, the Biodiversity Convention, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Paris Agreement. Practical considerations of near-shore restoration are reviewed, emphasizing local and traditional knowledge regarding past and future perspectives. The article concludes with policy recommendations to integrate near-shore marine restoration across climate adaptation, conservation and planning processes to achieve synergies in effectiveness, essential to IOS settings. The UN SDGs provide a timely platform for IOS to align international processes with local needs to address their own goals in balancing population growth, economic development, food security and climate security.","[Meriwether, A.; Wilson, W.; Forsyth, Catherine] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FE, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Wilson, W (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FE, Midlothian, Scotland.",meriwether.wilson@ed.ac.uk,,,"Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme, a global interdisciplinary research programme - United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), as part of the UK's Living with Environmental Change partnership.

The specificity of adaptation has called for partnerships between scientific and local communities to co-produce'' knowledge of climate variability (weather) and longer-term climate change. However, this raises numerous methodological challenges, including how to elicit the representations, knowledge, and cultural meanings of weather that are tacit to people in a community, and represent them in an explicit form that can be shared in a process of co-production''. Such work demands careful attention to the way tightly intertwined knowledge systems continuously rebuild representations of climate in a place, and how these knowledge systems are also intertwined with values and the exercise of power. This paper takes up this challenge and explores the potential offered by theories and methods of narrative. Looking at a research project co-producing'' knowledge of weather and impacts in northeast Bangladesh, this paper describes the experience of running narrative interviews with communities there, and how these narratives were analyzed along four themes to contribute to the co-production process. These themes included 1) the weather phenomena and impacts important to local communities, 2) how weather provides meaning and identity in that place, 3) how community actors produce and share weather knowledge, and 4) the climate-related narratives pervading the community. In sharing this experience, this paper seeks to fulfil a demand for more detailed practical accounts of narrative methods in climate adaptation research, particularly for knowledge co-production.","[Bremer, Scott; Blanchard, Anne] Univ Bergen, Ctr Study Sci & Humanities, Bergen, Norway; [Mamnun, Nabir] Bangladesh Ctr Adv Studies, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Stiller-Reeve, Mathew] Uni Res Climate, Bergen, Norway; [Haque, Md.

While such indirect effects have been analyzed intensively for mitigation policies, similarly detailed model-based frameworks and studies for adaptation policy are still missing. The objectives of the present paper are (i) to fill this gap by proposing a general modeling framework that allows for a comprehensive analysis of effects of adaptation on federal budgets, both on the expenditure and the revenue side, as well as of macroeconomic effects and (ii) to demonstrate its usefulness by applying this framework to the case of Austria. We find that public adaptation can lead to substantial positive macroeconomic effects on gross domestic product (GDP), welfare, and employment. The results are robust with respect to assumptions about the effectiveness of adaptation. Also, we demonstrate that it is essential for analysis to cover both the expenditure and revenue side, as overall government revenues can increase due to adaptation, offsetting additional direct public expenses for adaptation, thus increasing the budget balance. This is because of less severe climate change impacts and the corresponding lower payments for post-disaster relief and unemployment benefits as well as higher tax revenues. We thus strongly recommend making use of economy-wide modeling frameworks when planning for adaptation, as they shed light on the true costs and benefits of adaptation.","[Bachner, Gabriel; Bednar-Friedl, Birgit; Knittel, Nina] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Brandhofgasse 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Bednar-Friedl, Birgit] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Econ, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz,"Bachner, G (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Brandhofgasse 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",gabriel.bachner@uni-graz.at; birgit.friedl@uni-graz.at,"Bednar-Friedl, Birgit/F-3257-2016; Bachner, Gabriel/N-7536-2019; Knittel, Nina/I-2768-2016","Bednar-Friedl, Birgit/0000-0002-8348-4615; Bachner, Gabriel/0000-0003-2025-0747; Knittel, Nina/0000-0002-0694-3419",University of Graz; Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under its 6th Call of the Austrian Climate Research Program [B36862],University of Graz; Austrian Climate and Energy Fund under its 6th Call of the Austrian Climate Research Program,Open access funding provided by University of Graz.

However, when facing unprecedented and potentially extreme climatic changes, public spaces may not have the same adaptation capacity. In this context, planned adaptation gains strength against business as usual. While public spaces are among the most vulnerable areas to climatic hazards, they entail relevant characteristics for adaptation efforts. As such, public space design can lead to effective adaptation undertakings, explicitly influencing urban design practices as we know them. Amongst its different intrinsic roles and benefits, such as being a civic common gathering place of social and economic exchanges, public space may have found an enhanced protagonism under the climate change adaptation perspective. In light of the conducted empirical analysis, which gathered existing examples of public spaces with flood adaptation purposes, specific public space potentialities for the application of flood adaptation measures are here identified and characterized. Overall, this research questions the specific social potentiality of public space adaptation in the processes of vulnerability tackling, namely considering the need of alternatives in current flood management practices. Through literature review and case study analysis, it is here argued that: people and communities can be perceived as more than susceptible targets and rather be professed as active agents in the process of managing urban vulnerability; that climate change literacy, through the design of a public space, may endorse an increased common need for action and the pursuit of suitable solutions; and that local know-how and locally-driven design can be considered as a service with added value for adaptation endeavors.","[Silva, Maria Matos; Costa, Joao Pedro] Univ Lisbon, CIAUD, Fac Arquitetura, Polo Univ Alto Ajuda, Rua Sa Nogueira, P-1349063 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa,"Silva, MM (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, CIAUD, Fac Arquitetura, Polo Univ Alto Ajuda, Rua Sa Nogueira, P-1349063 Lisbon, Portugal.",m.matosilva@fa.ulisboa.pt; jpc@fa.ulisboa.pt,"; Matos Silva, Maria/J-8217-2016","Costa, Joao Pedro/0000-0002-6069-7052; Matos Silva, Maria/0000-0003-4608-3975",,,,,61,14,14,1,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2018,10,2,,,,,,,180,10.3390/w10020180,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10020180,,,24,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,FY4ES,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000426775500090,View Full Record in Web of Science

The magnitude of these impacts is expected to be amplified by the extensive reliance on rainfed agriculture and the prevalence of subsistence farming. In the Great Lakes Region of Central Africa, smallholder farming households are largely dependent on root, tuber and banana crops. However, the potential impacts of various climate change scenarios on these crops are not well reported. Yet, data-rich insights about the future impacts of climate change on these crops and the adaptive capacity of food systems in the Great Lakes Region is critical to inform research and development investments towards regional climate change adaptation. Objectives: We aimed to gain insights of potential impacts of climate change on root, tuber, and banana crops in the Great Lakes Region, specifically investigating changes to localised crop suitability, planting dates, and identifying potential 'climate-proof' variety types of each crop for specific geographies. Methods: We developed a modified version of the EcoCrop model to analyse the suitability of future climates for four key root, tuber, and banana crops (banana, cassava, potato, and sweetpotato) and a suite of varieties for each (typical, heat-tolerant, drought-tolerant, and early maturing). The model considers only the direct impacts of climate change on crop suitability. It does not consider how climate change impacts crop suitability by affecting the occurrence of extreme weather events or indirect effects on incidence and severity of pest and disease outbreaks. Results and conclusions: Our results demonstrate that climate change will be somewhat favourable to root, tuber, and banana-based systems, with only widespread negative impacts seen for potato. These changes should be qualified by the observation that in most cases the environmental suitability for banana, cassava, and sweet potato will remain constant or improve if farmers shift planting schedules. Location-and crop-dependent shifts to different variety types were found to be effective in improving suitability under future climates. Significance: Data driven insights generated from this work can be used as a first step in developing spatially explicit recommendations for both farmers and decision-makers on how to adapt to climate change and plan investment in the research needed to adapt root, tuber, and banana-based livelihoods and systems to those longterm changes.","[Manners, Rhys; Adewopo, Julius] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, Kigali, Rwanda; [Vandamme, Elke] Int Potato Ctr CIP, Kigali, Rwanda; [Thornton, Philip] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Nairobi, Kenya; [Friedmann, Michael; Thiele, Graham] Int Potato Ctr CIP, CGIAR Res Program Roots Tubers & Bananas, Lima, Peru; [Carpentier, Sebastien] Biovers Int, Leuven, Belgium; [Ezui, Kodjovi Senam] African Plant Nutr Inst, Nairobi, Kenya",CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP); Alliance; Bioversity International,"Manners, R (corresponding author), Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, Kigali, Rwanda.",r.manners@cgiar.org,"carpentier, sebastien C.M./D-9482-2018","carpentier, sebastien C.M./0000-0002-7389-6405; Thornton, Philip/0000-0002-1854-0182","CGIAR Research Program on Roots, Tubers and Bananas (RTB); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Trust Fund; Belgian Directorate General for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid (DGDC) through the Consortium for Improving Agricultural Livelihoods in Central Africa (CIALCA)","CGIAR Research Program on Roots, Tubers and Bananas (RTB)(CGIAR); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR); Belgian Directorate General for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid (DGDC) through the Consortium for Improving Agricultural Livelihoods in Central Africa (CIALCA)","We would like to thank everyone who provided valuable advice during the preparation of this work, specifically, Robert Mwanga, David Ramirez, Johan Ninanya, Pepijn van Oort, Anette Pronk, and Ghislain Tepa-Yotto.

Here, we review progress in integrating climate change adaptation into MPA design and management and provide eight recommendations to expedite this process. Climate-smart management objectives should become the default for all protected areas, and made into an explicit international policy target. Furthermore, incentives to use more dynamic management tools would increase the climate change responsiveness of the MPA network as a whole. Given ongoing negotiations on international conservation targets, now is the ideal time to proactively reform management of the global seascape for the dynamic climate-biodiversity reality.","[Tittensor, Derek P.; Boerder, Kristina; Boyce, Daniel G.; Lotze, Heike K.; Wilson, Kristen L.; Worm, Boris] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Tittensor, Derek P.; Harfoot, Mike; Kingston, Naomi; McOwen, Chris J.] UN Environm Programme World Conservat Monitoring, Cambridge, England; [Beger, Maria] Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Sch Biol, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Beger, Maria] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Cavanagh, Rachel D.; Grant, Susie M.] British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, England; [Cosandey-Godin, Aurelie] WWF Canada, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Crespo, Guillermo Ortuno; Dunn, Daniel C.; Halpin, Patrick N.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Marine Geospatial Ecol Lab, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Dunn, Daniel C.] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Ghiffary, Wildan] Global Fishing Watch, Washington, DC USA; [Hannah, Lee] Conservat Int, Moore Ctr Sci, Arlington, VA USA; [Heaslip, Susan G.; Jeffery, Nicholas W.; Stanley, Ryan R.

Design/methodology/approach - Case studies are undertaken for three cities: Amman, Jakarta and Dar es Salaam, including determination of GHG emissions and analysis of climate change data (where available) for each. Findings - In Amman, the most climate-sensitive municipal service is water; Jordan is exceptionally dry, and nearly 15 per cent of all electricity consumption is by the water authority. Jakarta has already experienced extreme flooding. The climate vulnerabilities associated with sea-level rise are intensified by subsidence in parts of Jakarta. Alternating floods and droughts are climate impacts already experienced in Dar es Salaam. Droughts have impacted Tanzania's electricity infrastructure disrupting hydroelectricity production, requiring new natural gas infrastructure to maintain power, thereby increasing GHG emissions. Nonetheless, Dar es Salaam's GHG emissions at 0.56 t CO(2)e/cap are small compared to Amman and Jakarta at 3.66 and 4.92 t CO(2)e/cap., respectively. Originality/value - Synergist development strategies, addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation are suggested. In Amman an increased share of photovoltaic electricity production might be used for service provision, especially for energy needs surrounding water supply. Advanced slum upgrading in Jakarta could see relocation of the at-risk poor to safe areas with energy efficient homes connected to public transit and decentralized, community-based electricity generation. The focus in Dar es Salaam community-based waste-to-energy facilities would reduce climate change impacts and vulnerabilities while addressing energy poverty in poor communities.","[Sugar, Lorraine; Kennedy, Chris] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Sugar, Lorraine; Hoornweg, Dan] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Toronto; The World Bank,"Kennedy, C (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada.",christopher.kennedy@utoronto.ca,,"Kennedy, Christopher/0000-0001-8812-4451",,,,,41,22,22,1,82,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Over the past years at least six development agencies have screened their project portfolios, generally with two goals in mind: (1) to ascertain the extent to which existing development projects already consider climate risks or address vulnerability to climate variability and change, and (2) to identify opportunities for incorporating climate change explicitly into future projects. As each portfolio screening was conducted independently, the broader lessons emerging from the screenings have not been systematically analysed. In this paper we assess the screening activities to date, focusing on both the results and the methods applied. Based on this assessment we identify opportunities for development agencies to expand their current focus on the links between climate and development. Most agencies already consider climate change as a real but uncertain threat to future development, but they have given less thought to how different development patterns might affect vulnerability to climate change. The screenings undertaken have shown the need to take a comprehensive approach to adaptation and its integration into development planning and sectoral decision-making, and a number of policy initiatives have been taken to promote such integration. We provide some initial guidance as to how portfolio screening can be carried out in a way that would allow agencies to assess systematically the relevance of climate change to their ongoing and planned development projects.","Stockholm Environm Inst, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Oslo, Dept Social & Human Geography, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Int Inst Sustainable Dev, CH-1219 Geneva, Switzerland; Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England; Intercooperat, Bern, Switzerland",Stockholm Environment Institute; University of Oslo; University of East Anglia; University of Sussex,"Klein, RJT (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Kraftriket 2B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",richard.klein@sei.se; siri.eriksen@sgeo.uio.no; l.o.nass@cicero.uio.no; ahammill@iisd.org; T.Tanner@ids.ac.uk; crobledo@intercooperation.ch; karen.obrien@sgeo.uio.no,"Klein, Richard J.T./B-1148-2009","Klein, Richard J.T./0000-0002-9458-0944; Tanner, Thomas/0000-0001-7975-4267",NERC [tynd10001] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [tynd10001] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,48,142,148,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In the two decades since, the accelerating pace of climate change and environmental decline has strengthened the moral case for reducing the environmental costs of health care. Nevertheless, mainstream bioethics has until recently neglected these vital issues. In response, a field of clinical environmental bioethics is emerging that applies concepts and measures of sustainability to such key clinical ethical issues as humanizing technology, setting limits, caring for the dying, respecting patient wishes, and allocating resources justly. Bioethical analysis of these and other issues can support just and humane healthcare adaptation to climate change. Health-care adaptation in turn plays an important role in helping communities and nations adapt to the inevitable forward march of climate change. This essay offers two recommendations: (1) establish a climate transition commission for health-care adaptation to climate change with bioethics participation, and (2) strengthen advocacy for health-care reform by uniting it with climate activism.","[Jameton, Andrew] Univ Nebraska Med Ctr, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Promot, Omaha, NE USA; [Jameton, Andrew] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Bioeth, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Pierce, Jessica] Univ Colorado, Ctr Bioeth & Humanities, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Medical Center; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus,"Jameton, A (corresponding author), UNMC Coll Publ Hlth, 986075 Nebraska Med Ctr, Omaha, NE 68198 USA.",ajameton@unmc.edu,"Pierce, Jessica/GQQ-2422-2022","Pierce, Jessica/0000-0001-6890-4127",,,,,187,4,4,1,4,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV PRESS,BALTIMORE,"JOURNALS PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2715 NORTH CHARLES ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21218-4363 USA",0031-5982,1529-8795,,PERSPECT BIOL MED,Perspect.

This does not only apply for technical knowledge, but for governance knowledge also. Both the Netherlands and Germany have set up large-scale collaborative action research (CAR) programmes for the governance of adaptation to climate change. Despite the collaborative designs, the initial enthusiasm, the available resources and the many positive outcomes, both programmes encountered several stubborn difficulties. By comparing both programmes, this paper explores the difficulties researchers encounter, analyses the underlying mechanisms and presents some lessons. It found that many difficulties are related to the tensions that exist between the assumptions underlying the new collaborative trajectories and the logics of the existing policy and research institutions. These institutional misfits are decisive to explain ultimate difficulties and successes. Furthermore, the paper concludes that risk aversion, stereotyping and scale fixation strengthen institutional misfits; and that these misfits persist due to lacking bridging capabilities. We suggest some lessons that can help to resolve the difficulties and reconcile CAR into existing institutions: organize the knowledge arrangement as a collaborative process; construct boundary objects as focal point for collaboration; and invest in bridging capabilities.","[Termeer, Catrien] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Buuren, Arwin] Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Knieling, Joerg] HafenCity Univ, Inst Urban Planning & Reg Dev, Hamburg, Germany; [Gottschick, Manuel] Univ Hamburg, Competence Centrum Sustainable Univ, Hamburg, Germany",Wageningen University & Research; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Hamburg,"Termeer, C (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",katrien.termeer@wur.nl,"van Buuren, Arwin/I-6240-2013; Knieling, Jörg/AAM-7877-2020","van Buuren, Arwin/0000-0002-8504-0495; Knieling, Jörg/0000-0003-1555-5458",Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment,Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment,This research has been carried out in the framework of the Dutch National Research Programme Knowledge for Climate (www.knowledgeforclimate.org).

Cobb Douglas type production function was employed with rice yield as dependent variable and climatic factors as independent variables. Results showed that an increase in temperature by 1.5 degrees C and 3 degrees C would enhance rice yield by 2.09% and 4.33%, respectively compared to the base year regression estimates. However, an increase in precipitation by 5% and 15% during September-October could adversely affect rice productivity by 5.71% and 15.26%, respectively. However, its decrease is positively related with rice yield. Evolving and disseminating rice varieties having adaptation to climate change should be the focus of future research and development.

Therefore, as carbon abatement is a public good, coping with climate change is also a public-good; however, it suffers from many free-rider incentives, leading to a tragedy of the commons. Overcoming this challenge from a systemic perspective, requires that all sectors such as industry, government, and citizens on global, national, and regional levels engage in low-carbon development and the implementation of fair and efficient climate policies. Through a theoretical exploration of carbon abatement and a systemic description of low-carbon systems, this paper developed a cybernetic framework for coping with climate change, which consists of a cloud platform for data analysis, meta-synthetic engineering for decision support, a polycentric approach to extensive consultation and various functional goal achievement modules. On this basis, by combining the invisible hand and visible hand and by integrating negotiation at the global level, cooperation at the national level and knowledge at the local level, a multilevel policymaking model is proposed to address complex climate change problems. This cybernetic paradigm based innovative approach could provide valuable illumination to stakeholders seeking to cope with climate change.","[Lu, Yi; Xu, Jiuping] Sichuan Univ, Uncertainty Decis Making Lab, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jiuping] Sichuan Univ, Engn Res Ctr Low Carbon Technol & Econ, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China",Sichuan University; Sichuan University,"Xu, JP (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Uncertainty Decis Making Lab, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China.;Xu, JP (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Engn Res Ctr Low Carbon Technol & Econ, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China.",luyiscu@163.com; xujiuping@scu.edu.cn,,,"Major Bidding Program of National Social Science Foundation of China [12ZD217]; Program of the Social Science Foundation of Sichuan [SC16C010]; Research Funding of Sichuan University [skqy201640, 2016SCU11036]",Major Bidding Program of National Social Science Foundation of China; Program of the Social Science Foundation of Sichuan; Research Funding of Sichuan University,"This research is supported by the Major Bidding Program of National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 12&ZD217), the Program of the Social Science Foundation of Sichuan (Grant No. SC16C010), and the Research Funding of Sichuan University (Grant No. skqy201640; 2016SCU11036).

These environmental changes pose a threat to pavement infrastructure worldwide. Therefore, it is necessary to modify pavement design procedures to consider climate change. In addition, it is necessary to consider suitable pavement materials for future climate. The objective of this study is to develop a framework for selecting an appropriate adaptation strategy to mitigate climate change impact. To fulfill this, the influence of climate change on long-term pavement performance in Canada has been quantified over sixteen Canadian pavement sections located over various provinces in Canada. In addition, the fundamental causes of pavement deterioration due to climate change were determined using ten different climate change models. Various adaptation strategies such as upgrading asphalt binder grade, increasing the thickness of asphaltic concrete layer, increasing the base layer thickness, and using stabilized base layers were analyzed to reduce pavement deterioration and to extend the service life of the pavement. Unlike the other studies, pavement temperatures were determined using Enhanced Integrated Climate Model (EICM) to determine the change in binder grade for the future climate in the adap-tation process. The study found that by 2070 all examined locations will require an upgrade in binder grade and the majority will require an upgrade in mixture gradation. Furthermore, the east and west coast will be more vulnerable to climate change and require additional measures in comparison to Central Canada. Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island are the only locations that will need to consider a change in asphalt thickness while British Columbia is the only location eventually requiring a stabilized base. This study emphasizes the necessity of climate change adaptation strategies for Canadian asphaltic concrete pavements.","[Swarna, Surya Teja; Hossain, Kamal] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Civil Engn, Adv Rd & Transportat Engn Lab ARTEL, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada; [Swarna, Surya Teja; Mehta, Yusuf A.] Rowan Univ, Ctr Res & Educ Adv Transportat Engn Syst CREATEs, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA; [Hossain, Kamal; Bernier, Alyssa] Carleton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Adv Rd & Transportat Engn Lab ARTEL, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland; Rowan University; Carleton University,"Swarna, ST (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Civil Engn, Adv Rd & Transportat Engn Lab ARTEL, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.;Swarna, ST (corresponding author), Rowan Univ, Ctr Res & Educ Adv Transportat Engn Syst CREATEs, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA.",swarna@rowan.edu; kamal.hossain@carleton.ca; mehta@rowan.edu; alyssabernier@cmail.carleton.ca,"Swarna, Surya Teja/AAD-6684-2020","Swarna, Surya Teja/0000-0003-0406-6675; Hossain, Kamal/0000-0003-1155-9347","Mr. Ken Pike, Manager of Materials Engineering, Department of Transportation, Newfoundland","Mr. Ken Pike, Manager of Materials Engineering, Department of Transportation, Newfoundland","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support provided by Mr. Ken Pike, Manager of Materials Engineering, Department of Transportation, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, for sharing valuable data such as material properties, traffic, and structural design details of the Trans-Canada Highway pavement sections.

Altogether 24 and 21 local stakeholders were approached for survey in the Madi and Deukhuri valleys, respectively. We assume multiple factors and stakeholders' perceptions influence the policies and practices at the local level. We found floods, droughts, cold waves and riverbank erosion to be the major climatic hazards that eventually impacted on agriculture, livestock and properties. It was found that the farmers dealt with these impacts based on traditional knowledge and practices, followed by the support provided by stakeholders and neighbors/communities. The major supports provided were mainly on training and awareness, risk analysis, livelihood and financial support, coordination and networking, and facilitating policy formulation. They emphasized the capacity enhancement, appropriate technologies, community-based planning, prioritization of the poor and marginalized, community funds as the top priorities for the communities. The public stakeholders are influential in adaptation policies/plans, whereas private and civic stakeholders are influential in adaptation practices. An issue-/interest-based governance model is effective and sustainable with the active participation of stakeholders. Thus, a shift from the position-based to the issue-/interest-based model is appropriate in climate adaptation in Nepal.","[Maharjan, Shree Kumar; Maharjan, Keshav Lall] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, Higashihiroshima 7398529, Japan",Hiroshima University,"Maharjan, SK (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, Higashihiroshima 7398529, Japan.",smilingsiri@gmail.com,"Maharjan, Keshav Lall/B-6851-2014; Maharjan, Shree Kumar/U-7706-2017","Maharjan, Keshav Lall/0000-0001-5885-4162; Maharjan, Shree Kumar/0000-0003-1104-1601",,,,,52,5,5,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The key activity is disaster risk reduction including climate change adaptation, for which many concepts and techniques have emerged from island studies. Although these concepts and techniques are not exclusive to island contexts, this paper focuses on island communities in order to illustrate the importance of human actions in causing and dealing with disasters involving environmental hazards. This point is demonstrated by examining key human and physical geography characteristics representing 'islandness': population, area, geomorphology and connectedness. The characteristics are not mutually exclusive, but island stereotypes emerge as small and static populations, small resource areas, highly volatile and changing geomorphology and limited connectedness. In exploring exceptions and diversities amongst islands, stereotypes are sometimes seen and sometimes not seen in reality. Advantages and disadvantages are demonstrated for different island settings dealing with environmental hazards and hazard drivers.","[Kelman, Ilan] UCL, Inst Global Hlth, London, England; [Kelman, Ilan] Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, London, England; [Kelman, Ilan] Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway",University of London; University College London; University of Agder,"Kelman, I (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Global Hlth, London, England.;Kelman, I (corresponding author), Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, London, England.;Kelman, I (corresponding author), Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway.",ilan_kelman@hotmail.com,,"Kelman, Ilan/0000-0002-4191-6969",,,,,79,10,10,2,45,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0376-8929,1469-4387,,ENVIRON CONSERV,Environ.

Four CBAs are conducted: (i) a standard CBA; (ii) a standard CBA considering equity; (iii) a standard CBA considering equity and employment; and (iv) a standard CBA considering equity, employment and risk aversion. All CBAs are conducted using a time frame of 2014-2080 and considering a 100-year return period under a middle of the road emission scenario (RCP4.5). A sensitivity analysis is also undertaken. Results suggest that the economic efficiency of the adaptation investment is contingent on what types of considerations are included within CBA. Integrating elements of employment, equity and risk aversion can strengthen or weaken the case for action (leading to higher or lower net-present values) and (depending on the discount rate chosen) may even be the deciding factor for determining whether a particular action should be carried out or not (whether the net-present value is positive or negative).","[Markanday, Ambika] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Bilbao, Spain; [Markandya, Anil; de Murieta, Elisa Sainz; Galarraga, Ibon] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Leioa 48940, Spain",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Markanday, A (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change, Bilbao, Spain.",ambika.markanday@bc3research.org,"Sainz de Murieta, Elisa/D-4946-2012","Sainz de Murieta, Elisa/0000-0001-8120-3392",European Commission 7th Framework Programme ECONADAPT project on the Economics of climate change adaptation in Europe [603906]; Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence [MDM-2017-0714],European Commission 7th Framework Programme ECONADAPT project on the Economics of climate change adaptation in Europe; Basque Government through the BERC 2018-2021 program(Basque Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO through BC3 Maria de Maeztu excellence,The funding for this work was provided by the European Commission 7th Framework Programme ECONADAPT project on the Economics of climate change adaptation in Europe under the grant agreement No. 603906.

This article proposes an approach for increasing the water availability of two or more water basins taking into consideration land use and wind patterns, and was named Land, Water, and Wind Watershed Cycle (L3WC). This approach can be applied to one watershed or a combination of watersheds. In the first case, if wind patterns blow mainly in the opposite direction of the main river flow, plantations with high water demand should be focused on the lowest part of the basin. The transpired moisture would then return to the basin with the wind and possibly increase the water availability of the basin. Applying this method to a series of basins, water is transposed from one basin to another, used for irrigated agriculture, returned to the atmosphere with evapotranspiration and pushed back to the basin where the water was extracted by the wind. Case studies of this methodology are presented in the So Francisco basin and between the Tocantins, Amazonas, and Parana basins and the So Francisco basin in Brazil. The So Francisco basin was selected because it is located in a dry region, its flow has considerably reduced in the past decade and because the trade winds blow constantly from the ocean into the continent all year around. L3WC is a strategy to plan the allocation of water consumption in a watershed, taking into account wind patterns to support the sustainable development of a region. It has the potential of increasing water availability and creating a climate change adaptation mechanism to control the climate and reduce vulnerability to climatic variations.","[Hunt, Julian D.] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Leal Filho, Walter] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Centres Sustainable Dev & Climate, Hamburg, Germany",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Manchester Metropolitan University; Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg,"Leal, W (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England.;Leal, W (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Res & Transfer Centres Sustainable Dev & Climate, Hamburg, Germany.",hunt@iiasa.ac.at; w.leal@mmu.ac.uk,"Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022","Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225",,,,,30,6,7,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Methods: An online survey was conducted among residents of California (Los Angeles/Orange), Florida (Miami-Dade/Broward), and Arizona (Maricopa) counties in July 2018 (n=605). Multivariable ordered logistic regression measured associations between the perceived importance of adaptation/mitigation approaches and income, race/ethnicity, and health conditions, controlling for age, political party, and county. Results: Lower income was associated with higher perceived importance of improved emergency alerts, government-subsidized costs of household air conditioners and energy-efficient appliances, strengthening buildings against extreme weather, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, urban planning using cooling technologies, and expanding community gardens/local agriculture. Black respondents perceived evacuation services for those with financial barriers during extreme weather, government-subsidized costs of energy-efficient appliances, and communication from government agencies about local climate impacts and mitigation as significantly more important compared to non-Black, non-Hispanic respondents. Hispanic respondents perceived significantly greater importance of improved emergency alerts and health care access during extreme weather, evacuation services for residents without transportation, government-subsidized costs of energy-efficient appliances, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, communication from government agencies about local climate impacts and mitigation efforts, and intergovernmental cooperation on mitigation compared to non-Hispanic respondents. Conclusions: Perceptions of the importance of specific local climate actions differ according to race/ethnicity and income.

Yet, evidence on their economic benefits is scarce, especially since the provided environmental amenities usually spatially correlate with climate-induced hazards, effects of which NbS aim to curb. This lack of empirical evidence creates obscurity regarding social acceptability of NS, hindering their uptake and upscaling. We apply hedonic price models to estimate homeowners' willingness-to-pay for NbS (like flood safety, environmental benefits), while controlling for spatio-temporal changes in capitalized flood risk discounts due to the 1993-1995 floods in the Limburg Province, the Netherlands. We reveal a pre-flood effect of 5.6% (discounting on average-euro12,753 for flood-prone properties), which rises to 10.9% (-euro24,691 on average) immediately after the floods. However, the effect is only transitory. The flood discount of home values price discount diminishes over time and eventually vanishes in 9-12 years, which coincides with the implementation of the largest and oldest NbS intervention in the Netherlands. Our analysis shows that NbS amenities provide a 15% (euro33,687 on average) premium to nearby residential property prices. This evidence of the evolving flood risk discount and the stable NbS premium for individual homeowners could support the economic feasibility and wide acceptability of NbS for climate change adaptations.","[Mutlu, Asli; Filatova, Tatiana] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; [Roy, Debraj] Univ Amsterdam, Informat Inst, Fac Sci, Sci Pk 904, NL-1090 GH Amsterdam, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; University of Amsterdam,"Mutlu, A; Filatova, T (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",a.mutlu@tudelft.nl; t.filatova@tudelft.nl,"Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930",Dutch Research Council NWO [17596]; NWO [191015],Dutch Research Council NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The authors are thankful to NVM, Brainbay and the Amsterdam School of Real Estate for the provision of the house transaction data used for this analysis.

It is the need of time to set new precedence by observing the adaptations and resilience as tools to respond to the climate variations. This study analyzed the influence of climate change adaptations and synergy between resilience from livelihood vulnerability and adaptations. A field survey of 489 farming households is conducted with the help of a well-structured questionnaire from four districts of the south part of Punjab province of Pakistan. This study uses the Endogenous Switching Regression model for the sake of analysis. The outcomes of the study reveal that age, education, family size, total land, and seed price have significant linkage with the adoption of adaptations. The synergistic effects of adaptation and resilience are also visible here as the adaptations factors are significantly contributing towards yield, per capita income, poverty, and poverty gap of the respondents. This study suggests the provision of proper education and smart technology to help in enhancing the adaptive capacity of farmers. More imperatively, adaptations to climate variations can be concluded as a remedial tool for resilient livelihood. It is believed that the present study can be considered as a guide for future research on other regions of Pakistan and neighboring countries.","[Naqvi, Syed Asif Ali; ul Hassan, Rai Hasis; Makhdum, Muhammad Sohail Amjad; Shah, Syed Ale Raza] Govt Coll Univ Faisalabad, Dept Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Wu, Wenya] China Agr Univ CAU, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies COHD, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol NUIST, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Government College University Faisalabad; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Naqvi, SAA (corresponding author), Govt Coll Univ Faisalabad, Dept Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",syedasif_1@yahoo.com,"Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/AAT-7073-2021; Makhdum, Muhammad Sohail Amjad/D-2537-2017; Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/J-2476-2019","Makhdum, Muhammad Sohail Amjad/0000-0002-1139-5568; Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/0000-0001-9142-2441; Shah, Syed Ale Raza/0000-0002-5842-3298",,,,,82,4,4,3,13,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,AUG 13,2020,15,8,,,,,,,e0236794,10.1371/journal.pone.0236794,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236794,,,21,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,NE5VG,32790703,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000562668300032,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents a national planning framework for adaptation to climate change, which is pioneer in the field as it is multi-sectoral and focuses specifically on coastal areas, pursuing the safety of their communities in an uncertain future. The strategy is statutory as it emanates from the new Spanish Coastal Law, which in addition to many other implications includes the compulsory development of a Spanish Strategy for Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change (SSCACC) and its submission to Strategic Environmental Assessment. This paper covers the fundamental aspects of both the SSCACC and the accompanying Strategic Environmental Study, providing recommendations on the assessment of coastal risks triggered by climate change and extreme events, adaptation and risk reduction planning and implementation, and monitoring. Additionally, this work gives insight into the wide-ranging consultation process carried out prior to the SSCACC's approval and the stakeholders involved, and how the SSCACC handles climate change uncertainty and struggles for overcoming barriers.","[Losada, Inigo J.; Toimil, Alexandra; Diaz-Simal, Pedro] Univ Cantabria, Environm Hydraul Inst IHCantabria, Isabel Torres 15, Santander 39011, Spain; [Munoz, Angel; Garcia-Fletcher, Ana P.] Spanish Minist Ecol Transit, Direct Gen Sostenibilidad Costa & Mar, Plaza San Juan Cruz S-N, Madrid 28003, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Losada, IJ (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Environm Hydraul Inst IHCantabria, Isabel Torres 15, Santander 39011, Spain.",losadai@unican.es,"Toimil, Alexandra/AAS-9897-2020; Diaz-Simal, Pedro/P-5873-2015; Losada, Iñigo J/F-9001-2012","Diaz-Simal, Pedro/0000-0002-8645-952X; Losada, Iñigo J/0000-0002-9651-9709",Spanish Ministry for Ecological Transition (MITECO); Spanish Government [BIA2017-89401-R]; Universidad de Cantabria,Spanish Ministry for Ecological Transition (MITECO); Spanish Government(Spanish Government); Universidad de Cantabria,"The development of the SSCACC was supported by the Spanish Ministry for Ecological Transition (MITECO).

For rural smallholders, shifting cultural, social, economic, demographic, environmental, and climatic pressures are all impacting livelihoods simultaneously. We present two case studies in which residents list livelihood priorities such as access to healthcare, markets, education, and agricultural extension support above climate change adaptation management. Impacts of climate change cannot be separated from impacts of capitalist economic systems on those most dependent upon natural resources, since by nature modern capitalism and associated structures of landownership and resource access blocks economic mobility by those too poor to differentiate their economic activities. To meaningfully improve adaptive strategies to increasing climate variability for the world's poor and subsistence agriculturists, a re-thinking of economic and social support is required; one that goes beyond land use and management objectives and includes creating more permeable economic and social structures across larger political landscapes.","[Diamond, S.

We tested and applied a 32-multi-model ensemble to simulate global wheat yield and quality in a changing climate. Potential benefits of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration by 2050 on global wheat grain and protein yield are likely to be negated by impacts from rising temperature and changes in rainfall, but with considerable disparities between regions. Grain and protein yields are expected to be lower and more variable in most low-rainfall regions, with nitrogen availability limiting growth stimulus from elevated CO2. Introducing genotypes adapted to warmer temperatures (and also considering changes in CO2 and rainfall) could boost global wheat yield by 7% and protein yield by 2%, but grain protein concentration would be reduced by -1.1 percentage points, representing a relative change of -8.6%. Climate change adaptations that benefit grain yield are not always positive for grain quality, putting additional pressure on global wheat production.","[Asseng, Senthold; Gao, Yujing; Hoogenboom, Gerrit; Kassie, Belay T.; Liu, Bing] Univ Florida, Agr & Biol Engn Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Martre, Pierre; Maiorano, Andrea] Univ Montpellier, INRA, LEPSE, Montpellier SupAgro, Montpellier, France; [Maiorano, Andrea] European Food Safety Author, Parma, Italy; [Roetter, Reimund P.] Univ Gottingen, Trop Plant Prod & Agr Syst Modelling TROPAGS, Gottingen, Germany; [Roetter, Reimund P.] Univ Gottingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use CBL, Gottingen, Germany; [O'Leary, Garry J.] Agr Victoria Res, Dept Econ Dev Jobs Transport & Resources, Grains Innovat Pk, Horsham, Vic, Australia; [Fitzgerald, Glenn J.] Agr Victoria Res, Dept Econ Dev Jobs Transport & Resources, Horsham, Vic, Australia; [Fitzgerald, Glenn J.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Creswick, Vic, Australia; [Girousse, Christine] Univ Clermont Auvergne, INRA, UMR GDEC, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Motzo, Rosella; Giunta, Francesco] Univ Sassari, Dept Agr Sci, Sassari, Italy; [Babar, M.

Villagization has been officially promoted to encourage diversification from livestock herding to agricultural cultivation, and to fulfil basic needs through infrastructure and services. From the late 2000s, villagization was reintroduced for arid and semi-arid regions as a strategy for adaptation to climate change, as part of the country's green growth agenda. The aim of this paper is to evaluate to what extent this phase of villagization has contributed to adaptation strategies among pastoral and agro-pastoral communities, based on an empirical analysis of four villagised sites in the Middle Awash Valley using qualitative data collected between 2014 and 2018. Perceptions and experiences of villagization varied across individuals, households, villages, and districts. While villagization has generally delivered infrastructure and services, and offered income diversification to those able to access irrigated agriculture, its implementation has been partial and uneven, and it has reproduced previous problems of resource scarcity while creating new risks and vulnerabilities. We argue that villagization may play a role in some aspects of adaptation, if programmes address the drivers of livelihood change, and embed equity and rights.","[Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew; Assen, Mohammed] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew] Debre Markos Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Debre Markos, Ethiopia; [Satyal, Poshendra; Budds, Jessica] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England",Addis Ababa University; University of East Anglia,"Degefu, MA (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.;Degefu, MA (corresponding author), Debre Markos Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Debre Markos, Ethiopia.",mekonnenadnew@yahoo.com,"Budds, Jessica/AAE-3717-2019; Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew/GRR-6199-2022","Budds, Jessica/0000-0001-5793-5200; Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew/0000-0001-6316-7543",,,,,40,5,5,3,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

A growing body of literature has argued for the need to link disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. However, there is limited articulation of the commonalities between these health impacts. Understanding the shared risk pathways is an important starting point for developing joint strategies for adapting to, and reducing, health risks. Therefore, this article discusses the common aspects of direct and indirect health risks of climate change and climate-sensitive disasters. Based on this discussion a theoretical framework is presented for understanding these commonalities.

Many face existing challenges such as poverty, food insecurity and lack of resources. Hence, there seems to be a logical case for planned community-based adaptation (CBA) in these contexts, but there is limited empirical evidence of planned CBA in developing countries. Numerous barriers hinder the implementation of planned CBA. This systematic literature review investigated what these barriers are and how they influence adaptation. Context-specific social, resource and physical barriers are significant, and these overlap and interact with one another. The most pervasive of these barriers relate to poor coordination within and between organizations responsible for planning and implementing adaptation actions, who adhere to discourses that are often technical and managerial and therefore not well suited to supporting CBA, and a lack of, or irrelevant knowledge/information on climate change as well as ineffectual communication between stakeholders involved in CBA actions.","[Spires, Meggan; Shackleton, Sheona; Cundill, Georgina] Rhodes Univ, Dept Environm Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Spires, M (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Environm Sci, POB 94, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",megg.spires@gmail.com,,"Shackleton, Sheona/0000-0002-6133-9070",,,,,45,58,59,1,40,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

A systematic review,CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,VULNERABILITY; PRIVATE; HAZARD; LIMITS; RISK,"The UK Government's first National Adaptation Programme seeks to create a 'climate-ready society' capable of making well-informed and far-sighted decisions to address risks and opportunities posed by a changing climate, where individual households are expected to adapt when it is in their interest to do so. How, and to what extent, households are able to do this remains unclear. Like other developed countries, research on UK adaptation has focused predominately on public and private organisations. To fill that gap, a systematic literature review was conducted to understand what actions UK households have taken in response to, or in anticipation of, a changing climate; what drives or impedes these actions; and whether households will act autonomously. We found that UK households struggle to build long-term adaptive capacity and are reliant upon traditional reactive coping responses. Of concern is that these coping responses are less effective for some climate risks (e.g. flooding); cost more over the long-term; and fail to create household capacity to adapt to other stresses. While low-cost, low-skill coping responses were already being implemented, the adoption of more permanent physical measures, behavioural changes, and acceptance of new responsibilities are unlikely to happen autonomously without further financial or government support. If public policy on household adaptation to climate change is to be better informed than more high-quality empirical research is urgently needed.","[Porter, James J.; Dessai, Suraje; Tompkins, Emma L.] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Porter, James J.; Dessai, Suraje; Tompkins, Emma L.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Tompkins, Emma L.] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Leeds; University of Southampton,"Dessai, S (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.dessai@leeds.ac.uk,"Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009; Tompkins, Emma/B-6863-2016","Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364; Tompkins, Emma/0000-0002-4825-9797; Porter, James/0000-0002-5442-5544","PREPARE programme - UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; European Research Council (ERC) [284369]; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI","PREPARE programme - UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the PREPARE programme, funded by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and led by Ricardo-AEA Ltd.

These promise a wide range of ecological, social and cultural benefits and have been accompanied by distinctive new design visions and imaginaries. However, there are also competing interests and agendas which threaten to undermine the realisation of socially equitable and ecologically sustainable design in this context. In response, this article explores the politics of designing ecological infrastructures through a case study of the redevelopment of Hans Taysens Park, a green climate adaptation, stormwater management and regeneration project in Copenhagen, Denmark. The case study exemplifies the ecological turn in design through its aspiration to deliver ecological, social and cultural benefits in conjunction with improvements to stormwater management. However, the article also identifies connections between innovative design and entrepreneurial strategies related to place-branding. It highlights conflicts between this entrepreneurial green design agenda and both social and ecological priorities. The article's distinctive contributions are its analysis of the politics of green, climate-resilient design and its description of the relationship between seemingly innovative design, including visible greening and ideals of 'co-creation', and the exclusion of disadvantaged groups from green, resilient spaces.","[Tubridy, Daniel] Univ Sheffield, Urban Studies & Planning, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Tubridy, Daniel] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Architecture Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin 4, Ireland",University of Sheffield; University College Dublin,"Tubridy, D (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Urban Studies & Planning, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.;Tubridy, D (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Architecture Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin 4, Ireland.",daniel.tubridy@ucd.ie,,"Tubridy, Fiadh/0000-0002-1934-6883","University of Sheffield, UK","University of Sheffield, UK","This research was funded by a PhD Network Award from the University of Sheffield, UK.",,111,14,14,9,34,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,JUL,2020,113,,,,,,133,145,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.04.020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.04.020,,,13,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,LZ3IV,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000541122400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in the absence of a national framework to guide the sustainable development of the built environment, responding to this challenge is problematic. The articulation of a comprehensive assessment method that would enable issues of sustainability to be addressed and incorporated within building construction projects is urgently required. The research that underpins this paper takes account of current tools in aiming to support the development of a national building sustainability assessment method (BSAM) for use in Iran that involves the identification of sources of impact, specific benchmarks, and priorities for a weighting system for assessment criteria. This paper profiles the basis of a contextual framework that will inform the development of such a regional-based tool, taking account of Iran's current climate change adaptation policies and priorities, its environmental conditions and socio-economic challenges, building typologies, standards and benchmarks.","[Malek, Shahrzad; Grierson, David] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Architecture, Glasgow G1 1XJ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Malek, S (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Architecture, Glasgow G1 1XJ, Lanark, Scotland.",s.malek@strath.ac.uk; d.grierson@strath.ac.uk,,"Grierson, David/0000-0002-4070-9909",,,,,39,7,7,0,8,OPEN HOUSE INT,GREAT BRITAIN,"URBAN INTERNATIONAL PRESS, PO BOX 74, GATESHEAD, TYNE & WEAR, GREAT BRITAIN, NE9 5UZ, ENGLAND",0168-2601,,,OPEN HOUSE INT,Open House Int.,JUN,2016,41,2,,,,,64,75,,,,,,12,Architecture; Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Architecture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,DV6HV,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000383035300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

SRI reduces water consumption by half, which makes it a promising farming system in the adaptation to climate change in moisture-constrained areas, and it does not require flooding of rice fields, resulting in reduced methane emissions. Endogenous switching regression results suggest that SRI indeed improves yield in rain-dependent areas, but its profitability hinges on the actual market price farmers face. SRI becomes profitable only when the rice variety sells at the same market price as that of traditional varieties, but results in loss when SRI rice sells at a lower price. We argue that the effort of promoting adoption of such types of climate-friendly agricultural practices requires complementary institutional reform and support in order to ensure their profitability to small-holder farmers.","[Alem, Yonas; Eggert, Hakan; Ruhinduka, Remidius] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Ruhinduka, Remidius] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Econ, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",University of Gothenburg; University of Dar es Salaam,"Alem, Y (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",yonas.alem@economics.gu.se; hakan.eggert@economics.gu.se; remidius.ruhinduka@economics.gu.se,,"Eggert, Hakan/0000-0001-7607-3394","Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) through the Environmental Economics Unit of the Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg; Gothenburg Centre of Globalisation and Development (GCGD); Swedish Research Council Formas through the program Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources (COMMONS)","Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) through the Environmental Economics Unit of the Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg; Gothenburg Centre of Globalisation and Development (GCGD); Swedish Research Council Formas through the program Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources (COMMONS)","We would like to thank the Editor (Thomas Sterner), an anonymous reviewer, Travis Lybbert, Haileselassie Medhin, Mans Soderbom, Marcella Veronishi and participants of the 8th Environment for Development Initiative annual meeting at Barahi Beach Hotel, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, October 23-26, 2014; participants of the Environment and Climate Research Centre (ECRC) seminar series at the Ethiopian Development Research Institute (EDRI) for useful comments on earlier versions of the paper.

The study revealed that majority (55.6%) of the land is marginally suitable. Significant changes in weather and climate were also revealed, and these generally translated to lower maize crop yields.

It does this by examining the potential social impacts of sea-level rise in Kingston Beach, Australia, informed by a mail-out survey of the community. The lived values approach identified that the natural environment, scenery, relaxed lifestyle and safety are highly important to local residents, while the landscape values mapping approach revealed that Kingston Main Beach is the most highly valued of eight coastal landscape units. Incorporating the landscape values mapping into the lived values cluster analysis revealed that while Kingston Main Beach is highly important for its recreational value to some members of the community, for others manmade features such as community halls or sports ovals may be of higher importance because they facilitate social interactions. There is potential to further integrate these two approaches to better inform adaptation policy about how lived and landscape values are distributed among communities, where they are located in space and whether they change over time. A deeper understanding of such assigned values can lead to improved engagement with coastal residents to inform adaptation policy now and into the future.","[Ramm, Timothy David; White, Christopher John] Univ Tasmania, Sch Engn & ICT, Private Bag 65, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Ramm, Timothy David] Bushfire & Nat Hazards Cooperat Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Graham, Sonia] Univ New South Wales, Sch Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [White, Christopher John] Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [White, Christopher John] Univ Exeter, European Ctr Environm & Human Hlth, Truro, England; [Watson, Christopher Stephen] Univ Tasmania, Sch Land & Food, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of New South Wales Sydney; Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC); University of Exeter; University of Tasmania,"Ramm, TD (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Engn & ICT, Private Bag 65, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",timothy.ramm@utas.edu.au,"Graham, Sonia/G-4399-2012","Graham, Sonia/0000-0003-4195-4559; Ramm, Timothy/0000-0003-2496-7075; Watson, Christopher/0000-0002-7464-4592",Commonwealth of Australia through the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre program; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Commonwealth of Australia through the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre program(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)",The authors are grateful for the financial support of the Commonwealth of Australia through the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre program and the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.

Various strategies for adaptation to climate change have been proposed. In this paper we examine the prospects of what we call the 'transgenic adaptation strategy', i.e. the appeal to use transgenic seeds to adapt to climate change, through the lens of smallholder maize farming in Mexico. Landraces are the bedrock of maize production in Mexico. We consider how maize farmers may respond to climate change and the effects of those responses on crop diversity. In this paper, we argue that the promotion of the transgenic adaptation strategy is problematic for biological and social reasons. Smallholder livelihoods in southern Mexico could suffer a disproportionate negative impact if transgenic technology is privileged as a response to climate change. Agroecological and evolutionary approaches to addressing the effects of climate change on smallholder agriculture provides an alternative adaptive strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Literature, interviews, secondary data, official statistics, project reports and policy briefs were used to identify institutional arrangements used by the city governments to encourage innovations in climate adaptation strategies and involve the private sector in climate change policy implementation. We focus on cases that create positive opportunities; exploring how innovations are facilitated within the theoretical frameworks of the Porter hypothesis and eco-innovation. We examine two possible pathways of climate change governance, firstly strict regulation and formal enforcement, and secondly institutional eco-innovation and voluntary measures. We found that different emphasis is placed on the preferred pathway in each of the case studies. Hamburg focuses on formal enforcements while the Rotterdam city government encourages institutional eco-innovation by acting as a platform and also providing incentives. Our findings suggest that a well-designed institutional framework can enhance innovation and increase environmental and business performance. The framework could vary in instruments and patterns, using both formal constraints and incentives to increase voluntary actions to shape policy. The formal rules could be stringent or incentivising to shape the climate change measures. The research aims to contribute to both practice and science by providing examples that might motivate and inspire other cities to design appropriate institutions for climate change policy implementation.

This arises because of pressures related to population growth and increased per capita demand for water. Additionally, climate change is impacting the natural cycle of water in many locations, with a significant impact projected for the future. Many scholars advocate sustainable urban water management' (SUWM) as an approach that can address the root causes of these challenges. Yet the implementation of SUWM and adaptation to climate change in the urban water sector remains limited. This paper argues that spatial planning provides tools and processes that can facilitate the full implementation of SUWM goals, and adaptation to climate change. The potential of spatial planning to achieve SUWM, including sustainable urban water supply management through both supply and demand end initiatives, in light of climate change, is discussed. A framework is developed to consider a broad range of spatial planning interventions that can facilitate adaptation to climate change and SUWM concurrently. The paper provides information and tools to assist water planners achieve SUWM and a well-adapted water sector and urban environment, in an integrated, holistic and comprehensive manner, to meet future water supply needs. Achieving these goals will need collaborative activities across multiple built environment disciplines. Future research activities to advance these goals are outlined.","[Hurlimann, Anna] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Wilson, Elizabeth] Oxford Brookes Univ, Fac Technol Design & Environm, Oxford OX3 0BP, England",University of Melbourne; Oxford Brookes University,"Hurlimann, A (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",anna.hurlimann@unimelb.edu.au; ebwilson@brookes.ac.uk,,"Wilson, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3116-5524; Hurlimann, Anna/0000-0001-9110-9340",University of Melbourne,University of Melbourne(University of Melbourne),"The authors wish to thank The University of Melbourne for their financial support of Anna Hurlimann's sabbatical, during which this paper was conceived and written.

A case study of adapting to drought events associated with crop failure in a Semi-Arid Ecosystems of northern Ghana was taken. A total of 49 semi-structured interviews with key representatives of various local institutions from different sectors were conducted and 120 farm households were randomly interviewed to assess their perceptions about their livelihood outcomes and local institutions accessibility. social network analysis (SNA) has been used to bring into light the institutional framework in the context of adaptation in Bongo district. From our research we noted five salient findings and their implications in effective local level adaptation. First, the public and civic institutions in the study area play a key role in facilitating adaptation. Essentially, institutional performance is inherently local and may vary depending on their mandate as well as availability of resources. Secondly, it has been realised that most of the institutions leading adaptation among the farming community are not directly adaptation related but are those intervening in various domains of households' rural life. Thirdly, it appears that institutional role is not limited to the leading aspect but also the ability of some institutions to channel or extend the available resources to the beneficiaries in the network (known as resources controllers or communicators), and others in controlling the flow of resources in the network (known as bridges or brokers). Fourthly, the results revealed that institutional support is more evident in term of knowledge management, on farm management than farm financial management (insurance, credit, market), livelihood diversification and the investment in infrastructures (dams). Fifthly, it appears that institutional support has at some extend facilitated adaptation within the farming communities by increasing the annual income, farm productivity and well-being while reducing households' adaptation. This paper contributes to the growing knowledge of the role of institutional framework in the facilitation of local adaptation.","[Yomo, Mawulolo] Univ Lome, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Lome, Togo; [Villamor, Grace B.] Univ Idaho, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Villamor, Grace B.] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany; [Villamor, Grace B.; Aziadekey, Mawuli] Univ Lome, Ecole Super Agron, Lome, Togo; [Olorunfemi, Felix] Nigerian Inst Social & Econ Res, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Mourad, Khaldoon A.] Lund Univ, Lund 22100, Sweden; [Mourad, Khaldoon A.] Ctr Sustainable Vis, Lund 22100, Sweden",Idaho; University of Idaho; University of Bonn; Lund University,"Mourad, KA (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Lund 22100, Sweden.;Mourad, KA (corresponding author), Ctr Sustainable Vis, Lund 22100, Sweden.",khaldoon.mourad@cme.lu.se,"Mourad, Khaldoon A./P-8067-2014","Mourad, Khaldoon A./0000-0001-5358-2217",German Federal Ministry of Education (BMBF) through the West African Science Service Center for Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL); Lund University; Centre for Sustainable Visions,German Federal Ministry of Education (BMBF) through the West African Science Service Center for Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Lund University; Centre for Sustainable Visions,"Great thanks go to the Almighty God for the wisdom and knowledge He gave us to carry out this study.

The community's adaptation is more important than before. Community-based adaptation (CBA) is now gaining worldwide attention. Taiwan has promoted disaster prevention communities (DPC) for many years. Although the communities' promotion can increase their capacity to promote efficiency, the top-down job designation may not adequately meet the community's needs. This research aims to establish a community adaptation model and focus on building community adaptation capabilities from the bottom-up due to climate change. We design a community adaptation model that integrated climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR).

The 2D flooding model using future rainfall simulates the flooding depth for the hazard for it. This information is offered for discussing possible countermeasures with residents during the participatory risk analysis process. An urban laboratory concept is also adopted in this study. The Zutian community, Tucheng District, New Taipei City, Taiwan, a flood-prone community, served as a case study area to illustrate those concepts and tools.

Further objectives include indicating the weak and strong points of adaptation planning, attempting to explain the causes of different assessment results of adaptation plans for particular cities, and evaluating the usability of the Adaptation Policy Credibility (APC) framework in Polish conditions. It was found that institutional support for adaptation planning had a highly positive effect. All the cities which joined the project developed highly credible plans, but the quality of these plans varied. The weak points of planning in Polish cities include its regulatory nature and the related legislation, past performance, funding, consistency, equity and justice, and public opinion. On the other hand, the strong points of planning in Polish cities include network membership, adaptation options, and taking uncertainty into consideration. Important aspects also include directing future research towards the development of a method for assessing the implementation of planned actions.","[Kalbarczyk, Eliza] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Human Geog & Planning, Dept Spatial Econometr, Bogumila Krygowskiego St 10, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Kalbarczyk, Robert] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture, Grunwaldzka St 55, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland",Adam Mickiewicz University; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences,"Kalbarczyk, R (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture, Grunwaldzka St 55, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland.",robert.kalbarczyk@upwr.edu.pl,"Kalbarczyk, Eliza/ACD-9103-2022; Kalbarczyk, Robert/A-5099-2017","Kalbarczyk, Eliza/0000-0002-4871-2483; Kalbarczyk, Robert/0000-0002-0564-8653",,,,,57,2,2,13,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

In this study, we identified the variation in the interacting relationships among vegetation (normalized difference vegetation index), socioeconomic status (neighborhood income), elevation and land surface temperature (LST) to identify how vegetation based surface cooling services change throughout the pronounced coastal to desert climate gradient of the Los Angeles, CA metropolitan region, a megacity of >18 million residents. A key challenge for understanding variation in vegetation as a climate change adaptation tool spanning neighborhood to megacity scales is developing new big data analytical tools. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to quantify the interacting relationships among socio-economic status data obtained from government census data, elevation and new LST and vegetation data obtained from an airborne imaging campaign conducted in 2013 for the urban and suburban areas across a series of fifteen climate zones. Vegetation systematically increased in cooling effectiveness from 6.06 to 31.77 degrees with increasing distance from the coast. Vegetation and neighborhood income were positively correlated throughout all climate zones with a peak in the relationship occurring near 25 km from the coast. Because of the interaction between these two relationships, we also found that higher income neighborhoods were cooler and that this effect peaked at about 30 km from the coast. These results show the availability and effectiveness of vegetation on the local climate varies tremendously throughout the Los Angeles, CA metropolitan area. Further, using the more inland climate zones as future analogs for more coastal zones, suggests that in the warmer climate conditions projected for the region the effectiveness of vegetation for regional cooling may increase thus acting as a localized negative feedback mechanism.

Local institutions provide the framework within which idiosyncratic capacities of local people can be exercised in their adaptation to climate change. This paper examines the importance of formal and informal institutions for building adaptive capacity. Both formal and informal institutions play different but complementary roles in enabling or preventing the ability to cope, benefit and adapt to climate change. Responses to climate change in northern Ghana are dependent on the nature of institutions that grant people access to resources; define their exposure to climate threats; and dictate the rate of recovery from debilitating disasters. The effectiveness of institutions is constrained by their limited spatial and temporal reach, limited financial and human resources, and sometimes the faulty strategy designs and implementation procedures. Traditional institutions may malfunction when modern interpretations of tradition are in the interests of custodians of tradition rather than the ordinary poor. We emphasize the need for synergy between institutions that support adaptive capacities of the poor, and request corrective measures to institutions that lead to maladaptation.","[Yaro, Joseph Awetori; Teye, Joseph] Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, Accra, Ghana; [Bawakyillenuo, Simon] Univ Ghana, Inst Stat Social & Econ Res, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana; University of Ghana,"Yaro, JA (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, Accra, Ghana.",yarojoe@yahoo.com,,,"Office of Research Innovation and Development (ORID), University of Ghana","Office of Research Innovation and Development (ORID), University of Ghana","We deeply appreciate the support of the Office of Research Innovation and Development (ORID), University of Ghana for the funding this project.

Three different cases are developed: 1) Base Case, which gives the optimal electricity production mix, taking into account country's development plans (without climate change); 2) Climate Change Damage Case, which introduces the climate changes by adjusting the heating and cooling degree days inputs, consistent with the existing national climate scenarios; and 3) Climate Change Adaptation Case, in which the optimal electricity generation mix is determined by allowing for endogenous capacity adjustments in the model. This modeling exercise will identify the changes in the energy demand and in electricity generation mix in the Adaptation Case, as well as climate change damages and benefits of the adaptation.

The political administrative context is Germany, and the institutional context is a joint research framework in which each network works independently on a particular topic, but remains bound to the principle of practical and solution-oriented research carried out in close partnership between scientific and extra-scientific actors. Our objective is to provide empirical insights into the processes and outcomes of such networks and to systematically analyse the networks' collaboration success and its influencing factors. To this end, collaboration success is operationalised as a three-dimensional metric including (1) the practitioners' satisfaction with the cooperation, (2) their perceived learning effects, and (3) their perceived implementation capacity. Results show a decreasing level of success throughout the three dimensions and particularly a gap between knowledge acquisition and learning on the one hand and implementation, i.e., transforming the knowledge into action, on the other. While the positive relationship between these dimensions is confirmed, results of correlation analysis highlight the importance of repeated participation, appropriate information management, and inclusive as well as responsive network practices. We discuss the results against our existing knowledge on multi-actor collaborative research and deduce (methodological) lessons learnt as well as future research needs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach Studies that focused on determinant factors of CCA by crop-livestock farmers and pastoralists in SSA and written in English were reviewed from five major databases using the applications of Endnote and NVivo. The review process followed a sequence of steps to reach into the final selection. Findings A total of 3,028 papers were recovered from the databases and screened for duplicates (777) and publications before 2000 (218). The titles and abstracts of 2,033 papers were reviewed, and 1,903 of them were excluded owing to preliminary exclusion criteria. Finally, 130 papers were selected for full-text review and more detailed assessment, where 36 papers qualified for the final review. The most important determinant factors of CCA by pastoralists were household income, access to information, access to extension services, government support and access to market. In the case of agro-pastoralists, access to information, household income, age and land/livestock ownership were found as the major determinant factors. Household income, land ownership, access to information, farm size, household size and access to extension services were the determinant factors found for CCA by smallholder farmers.

Water organisations, that are managing societal and ecological needs for water, are therefore likely to experience the impact the most. This study reviews the current literature regarding adaptation to climate change by water management organisations and associated barriers. Literature on adaptive capacity is growing and a general consensus is emerging on the determinants of adaptive capacity, although variations exist regarding how it is to be evaluated, enhanced and applied to policy making due to its dynamic, contextual and latent nature. Since adaptive capacity is hard to measure and successful adaptation difficult to define, some studies focus on the existence of adaptation attributes of organisations. Studies reporting successful adaptation are minimal and barriers of adaptation are being discovered as adaptation research transitions into implementation. But the root causes of these barriers are often overlooked and the interconnectedness of the barriers is poorly addressed. Increasingly, combining top-down and bottom-up approaches to adaptation is being recommended due to the limitations of each. However, knowledge regarding how organisations operating at different scales can enhance adaptive capacity of other organisations operating at another scale is lacking due to the few studies of inter-organisational networks across scales. Social networks among actors are recognised as a key factor to enable adaptation. However, network studies generally focus on individual actors and rarely between public agencies/organisations. Moreover, the current literature is inadequate to understand the relationship between adaptation enabling characteristics, barriers and adaptation manifestation. The review demonstrates that research on understanding the emergence and sustenance of barriers is urgently required.

In the Mediterranean, agriculture, as the largest consumer of freshwater, has the highest potential to suffer adverse impacts of climate change. Future water availability predictions, conflicting interests among stakeholders and an increasing social concern about the environment further aggravate the situation. Therefore studying public support for adaptation policies can play a key role in successfully adapting the sector. The study site, approximately 36,000 hectares of rice fields in Seville (Spain), exemplifies an area in the Mediterranean where water needs to be carefully reallocated in view of the limitations anticipated by climate change scenarios; in particular where conflicts will arise between water for agriculture and water for 'natural' ecosystems. This paper proposes an ex-ante evaluation of the societal support for adaptation policies. A survey of 117 respondents was conducted and a Logit model utilized to analyze which predictors positively or negatively affect people's support for adaptation policies. Results suggest that the main barriers to support these policies were economic losses and low climate change concern whereas the primary motivation factor was environmental commitment. Additionally, the main socio-demographic determinants were gender, age, education and family structure. In order to improve societal support for climate change adaptation policies, implementing educational and awareness raising initiatives will be the main challenges for policy makers to overcome.

Integrating the basic aspects on climate information, the project toolkit had two main objectives; firstly it increases community awareness about climate change risks to farmers and natural resource users, and secondly it aims to build momentum at community levels for innovative adaptation tools as applicable to their environments. These toolkits are applicable to the rural communities, pen-urban and communities across Namibia. Design/methodology/approach - Participatory rural appraisal methods were used to solicit inputs from the local people during the toolkits development process. Resource mapping, root analysis of climate impacts, and gender mainstreaming were key to this project. A total of 30 community consultations were held in 12 constituencies in all the regions. About 200 people per region were consulted. Their selection was based on their day-to-day engagement with community members these included community activists, farmers, local NGOs as well as governmental civil servants and resource users. Findings - The main outcomes of the project were the compilation of the climate change toolkits, as well as outreach materials such as a video for training of trainers events on climate change adaptation, posters, and radio talks in the different regions. The toolkits are in the process of being implemented, and there are positive reports from the regions where they have been distributed. Originality/value - This paper is a synopsis of the experiences from Namibia's climate change adaptation toolkits and offers insights relevant to many other African countries, and how these can be improved to make climate change adaptation work especially in the rural areas.","[David, Asella; Braby, Justine; Zeidler, Juliane; Kandjinga, Laudika] Integrated Environm Consultants Namibia, Windhoek, Namibia; [Ndokosho, Johnson] Minist Environm & Tourism, Africa Adaptat Project Namibia AAP NAM, Windhoek, Namibia",,"David, A (corresponding author), Integrated Environm Consultants Namibia, Windhoek, Namibia.",,,,,,,,15,11,11,1,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Consequently, approaches to urban adaptation should be both multilevel and multidimensional. Community-based adaptation (CBA) presents an opportunity for local-level participation in framing adaptation planning and activities, with wider transformative potential for urban governance. This paper presents five case studies from cities in the Global South which offer insights into the different scales at which CBA can be mainstreamed in urban contexts, and the various ways in which this is happening. These examples demonstrate five emerging opportunities for mainstreaming urban CBA, which include using CBA as part of a wider package of approaches; seizing processes of institutional reform as an opportunity to integrate community perspectives; institutionalizing new actors and approaches as a mechanism for scaling up multi-stakeholder approaches; ensuring top-down planning approaches are connected to local dynamics; and using participatory research to facilitate local communities in shaping planning processes. The cases also demonstrate that while obstacles to mainstreaming in urban contexts remain, some lessons in addressing these challenges have emerged, and CBA should, therefore, be a part of the toolbox of local and national urban adaptation policy frameworks.","[Archer, Diane] Int Inst Environm & Dev, London WC1X 8NH, England; [Almansi, Florencia] Inst Int Medio Ambiente & Desarrolloamer Latina, RA-2698 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [DiGregorio, Michael] Asia Fdn, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Roberts, Debra] Ethekwini Municipal, Environm Planning & Climate Protect Dept, Durban, South Africa; [Sharma, Divya] Energy & Resources Inst TERI, Sustainable Habitat Div, New Delhi, India; [Syam, Denia] Mercy Corps, Indonesia Country Off, South Jakarta, Jakarta Greater, Indonesia",TERI University,"Archer, D (corresponding author), Int Inst Environm & Dev, 80-86 Grays Inn Rd, London WC1X 8NH, England.",diane.archer@iied.org,,"almansi, florencia/0000-0002-2654-0975; Archer, Diane/0000-0002-7494-1183",,,,,46,80,80,5,66,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

According to the results of a sociological study, the level of food safety of Ukraine in terms of the introduction of the land market was assessed. A portrait of a landowner was formed, and the presence of a land plot affects the state of food supply. Based on the analysis of the main provisions of the European Green Deal and food safety policy (on the example of Poland), the areas of increasing the level of food safety in Ukraine were identified: completion of land reform and lifting the moratorium on the sale of agricultural land; ensuring the production of value-added products; adaptation to climate change, development, and implementation of a national program for rural development.

In this paper, we study how land use adaptation to climate change impacts land use competition in the agriculture, forest and other land use (AFOLU) sector and how a mitigation policy in agriculture might affect this competition. We use for this purpose two sector-specific bio-economic models of agriculture and forest combined with an econometric land use shares model to simulate the impacts of two climate change scenarios (A2 and B1, 2100 horizon), and a greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture policy consisting of a tax of between 0 and 200 (sic)/tCO(2) equivalent. Our results show that both climate change scenarios lead to an increase in the area devoted to agriculture at the expense of forest which could have a negative impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change. The mitigation policy would curtail agricultural expansion, and thus could counteract the effects of land use adaptation to climate change. In other words, accounting for land use competition results in a reduction of the abatement costs of the mitigation policy in the agricultural sector.","[Lungarska, Anna; Chakir, Raja] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, Econ Publ, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France",AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Lungarska, A (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, Econ Publ, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",Anna.Lungarska@inra.fr; Raja.Chakir@inra.fr,"CHAKIR, RAJA/X-1414-2019","CHAKIR, RAJA/0000-0002-6980-0343; Lungarska, Anna/0000-0002-6236-0701; CHAKIR, RAJA/0000-0003-3821-092X",European Union within the European Commission [235175 TRUSTEE (ANR-13-RURA-0001-01)]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche through the ModULand project [ANR-11-BSH1-005]; ORACLE project [ANR-10-CEPL-011]; STIMUL (Scenarios Towards integrating multi-scale land use tools) flagship project as part of the Investments d'Avenir Programme (LabEx BASC) [ANR-11-LABX-0034],European Union within the European Commission; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche through the ModULand project(French National Research Agency (ANR)); ORACLE project; STIMUL (Scenarios Towards integrating multi-scale land use tools) flagship project as part of the Investments d'Avenir Programme (LabEx BASC),"We thank Pierre-Alain Jayet for providing us with the results from the AROPAj model, and Antonello Lobianco and Sylvain Caurla for giving us access to the results of the FFSM+ + model.

And of civil engineered facilities, the transportation network is likely to be one of the systems most affected by changing climate, weather, and local environmental conditions. This paper examines the current practice of looking at transportation system adaptation to climate changes and develops a conceptual framework of the different components of transportation infrastructure that will be affected differently by a range of climate changes. An adaptive systems management approach is suggested as one approach for transportation engineers to anticipate likely climate changes, identify vulnerabilities in the transportation system, and assess different strategies for mitigating potential impacts. The result of this approach is a strategic perspective on what transportation agencies should do today and in the future to respond to changing environmental conditions. Developing an organizational strategy for dealing with the different elements of these changes is a critical component of this strategic perspective. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000108.

Four empirically significant social perspectives are determined - institutional, grassroots, developmental, and physical planning - using Q-method, an intensive qualitative and quantitative technique. Major differences and commonalities between perspectives are highlighted, in addition to actors' arguments used to justify claims. Drawing upon an actor-oriented approach, results contribute filling a knowledge gap in the literature on the need to develop approaches that can guide adaptation thinking in development planning. While the four perspectives identified provide evidence that differentiated viewpoints on climate change and planning practices may lead to divergent adaptation strategies, commonalities among social perspectives suggest that shared adaptations may also emerge both among actors from multiple organizational structures and across the organisational hierarchy of planning. By building learning processes that include multiple social perspectives across scales, development planning can become a promising candidate for strengthening adaptive capacities and delivering more effective responses to climate change.","[Dujardin, S.; Orban-Ferauge, F.; Dendoncker, N.] Univ Namur, Geog Dept, Rue Bruxelles 61, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [Canares, M.

However, it needs to be assessed critically as one attribute of sustainable development, not as a lesser substitute. Originality/value - This paper provides new insights to the emerging contrast between proponents and critics of the resilience paradigm with recommendations for avoiding potential dangers that this paradigm brings.","Univ Lausanne, Ctr Res Terr Environm, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Sudmeier-Rieux, KI (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Ctr Res Terr Environm, Lausanne, Switzerland.",,,"Sudmeier-Rieux, Dr. Karen/0000-0003-0513-8968",,,,,70,67,68,1,67,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0965-3562,1758-6100,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

However, such high-resolution climate information is not widely incorporated into climate change adaptation plans. In this study we analyze high-resolution (1.24 x 1.24-mile grid) temperature data generated by a climate model for Los Angeles County (CA). The data include projected surface air temperature and the number of extreme heat days (daily maximum temperature exceeding 95 degrees F) between a baseline period (1981-2000) and a mid-21st-century period (2041-2060). The data assume that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions will continuously increase at the current level and no change in existing built environments. We find significant geographic heterogeneity in terms of climate change effects in Los Angeles County. Also, given the assumptions, we expect inland suburban areas where urban expansion has been occurring to have more severe extreme heat effects than central and coastal areas by mid-century. Takeaway for practice Planners should engage with climate scientists to access and use high-resolution climate data. The use of high-resolution climate data needs to be mandated in plan-making in the era of climate change. Many regions may have different spatial patterns of extreme heat events and require tailored climate adaptation plans. In Los Angeles County, for example, continuing suburbanization in inland valley areas may need to be discouraged, whereas coastal areas with the least effects may consider denser, inclusive redevelopment strategies.","[Kim, Sungyop] Univ Missouri Kansas City, Urban Planning & Design, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Sun, Fengpeng] UMKC, Earth & Environm Sci, Kansas City, MO USA; [Irazabal, Clara] UMKC, Urban Planning & Design, Kansas City, MO USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Univ Missouri Kansas City, Urban Planning & Design, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",kims@umkc.edu; sunf@umkc.edu; irazabalzuritac@umkc.edu,"Irazabal, Clara/AAD-4968-2021","Irazabal, Clara/0000-0003-2312-9360; Kim, Sungyop/0000-0002-1784-1813",,,,,49,1,1,3,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0194-4363,1939-0130,,J AM PLANN ASSOC,J.

Six participatory workshops involving 66 stakeholders based within SEQ produced six system conceptualizations and 22 alpha-level BBNs. The outcomes of the initial systems modeling exercise successfully allowed the selection of critical determinants of key response variables for in depth analysis within more homogeneous, sector-based groups of participants. Using two cases, this article focuses on the processes and methodological issues relating to the use of the BBN modeling technique when the data are based on expert opinion. The study expected to find both generic and specific determinants of adaptive capacity based on the perceptions of the stakeholders involved. While generic determinants were found (e.g. funding and awareness levels), sensitivity analysis identified the importance of pragmatic, context-based determinants, which also had methodological implications. The article raises questions about the most appropriate scale at which the methodology applied can be used to identify useful generic determinants of adaptive capacity when, at the scale used, the most useful determinants were sector-specific. Comparisons between individual BBN conditional probabilities identified diverging and converging beliefs, and that the sensitivity of response variables to direct descendant nodes was not always perceived consistently. It was often the accompanying narrative that provided important contextual information that explained observed differences, highlighting the benefits of using critical narrative with modeling tools.

In these concepts, broad stakeholder involvement is intended to promote knowledge integration, consensus formation and activation of local actors to initiate and advance learning and change processes. In doing so, however, transdisciplinary processes enter societal battlegrounds and meet conflicting interest and knowledge claims. Thus, building on the discussion on transdisciplinarity in the context of sustainability-related research, the paper seeks to understand when and why which types of conflicts emerge in sustainability-related transdisciplinary research, how they affect knowledge integration, and how they can be resolved. It develops a categorization of conflicts including differing values, conflicting interests, dissimilar claims of legitimacy, and diverse knowledge claims. They are applied empirically in the analysis of a project on regional adaptation to climate change in Northwestern Germany. It studies processes and outcomes with regard to the societal impact of the project and discusses experiences of conflicts and relevant solutions. The paper finds that societally relevant transdisciplinary research processes need to be prepared for conflict resolution and overcoming resistance and blockages in cases when consensus formation and mutual agreement is not attainable.","[Siebenhuener, Bernd] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ Business Adm & Law, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-116, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Siebenhuner, B (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ Business Adm & Law, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-116, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",bernd.siebenhuener@uol.de,,,Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [01LR0813B],Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Financial support by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) for the research project Nordwest 2050 [registration number 01LR0813B] is gratefully acknowledged.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for a desktop review approach, using the forest-based rural communities of South Africa as a case study. Findings - This review shows that climate variability and change are affecting rural people and their livelihoods negatively. Forest-based livelihoods are particularly vulnerable. Nevertheless, the people have developed coping mechanisms to cushion the effects of climate variability and change. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these strategies are greatly constrained by factors that are related mostly to their socioeconomic characteristics (for example, skill level, educational status and health) and the functionalities of infrastructures and services in their communities. Research limitations/implications - Given that the study focused on forest-based rural communities and livelihoods, the results may be limited in generalizability. This may have particular implications for other categories of rural communities and livelihoods in Africa and developing countries in other continents. Practical implications - The study showed that opportunities for planning and implementing effective climate change adaptation at rural community level in South Africa are reliant on effective strategies to overcome the constraints identified by the study. The authors thus recommend that climate change adaptation initiatives in rural communities of Africa should focus on improving people's socioeconomic conditions and the overall sustainable development of the community.

Despite advances in monitoring urban environmental change, research on the application of adaptation-oriented criteria remains a challenge in urban planning in the Global South. This study proposes to include urban land management as a criterion and timely strategy for climate change adaptation in the cities of the Tropical Andes. Here, we estimate the distribution of the soil organic carbon stock (OCS) of the city of Quito (2,815 m.a.s.l.; population 2,011,388; 197.09 km2) in the following three methodological moments: i) field/laboratory: city-wide sampling design established to collect 300 soil samples (0-15 cm) and obtain data on organic carbon (OC) concentrations in addition to 30 samples for bulk density (BD); ii) predictors: geographic, spectral and anthropogenic dimensions established from 17 co-variables; and iii) spatial modeling: simple multiple regression (SMRM) and random forest (RFM) models of organic carbon concentrations and density as well as OCS stock estimation. We found that the spatial modeling techniques were complementary; however, SMRM showed a relatively higher fit both (OC: r2 = 20%, BD: r2 = 16%) when compared to RFM (OC: r2 = 8% and BD: r2 = 5%). Thus, soil carbon stock (0-0.15 m) was estimated with a spatial variation that fluctuated between 9.89 and 21.48 kg/m2; whereas, RFM showed fluctuations between 10.38 and 17.67 kg/m2. We found that spatial predictors (topography, relative humidity, precipitation, temperature) and anthropogenic predictors (population density, roads, vehicle traffic, land cover) positively influence the model, while spatial predictors have little influence and show multicollinearity with relative humidity. Our research suggests that urban land management in the 21st century provides key information for adaptation and mitigation strategies aimed at coping with global and local climate variations in the cities of the Tropical Andes.","[Bonilla-Bedoya, Santiago] Univ Tecnol Indoamer Machala & Sabanilla, Res Ctr Terr & Sustainable Habitat, Quito 170301, Ecuador; [Bonilla-Bedoya, Santiago; Herrera, Miguel Angel] Univ Cordoba, Campus Excelencia Int Agroalimentario ceiA3, Dept Forest Engn ETSIAM, Cordoba, Spain; [Vaca, Angelica] Inst Invest Geol & Energet, Quito, Ecuador; [Salazar, Laura] Univ Tecnol Indoamer, Ctr Invest Biodiversidad & Cambio Climat BioCamb, Quito, Ecuador; [Bonilla-Bedoya, Santiago; Salazar, Laura] Univ Tecnol Indoamer Machala & Sabanilla, Fac Ciencias Medio Ambiente, Ingn Biodiversidad Recursos Genet, Quito 170301, Ecuador; [Zalakeviciute, Rasa] Univ Las Amer, Fac Ingn Ciencias Agropecuari, Intelligent & Interact Syst Lab SI2 Lab & Biodive, Medio Ambiente Salud BIOMAS, Quito 170125, Ecuador; [Mejia, Danilo] Univ Cuenca, Centro Estudios Ambient, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Lopez-Ulloa, Magdalena] Univ Reg Amazon Ikiam, Ingn Agroecol, Tena Ecuador, Tena, Ecuador",Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Las Americas - Ecuador; Universidad de Cuenca,"Bonilla-Bedoya, S (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Indoamer Machala & Sabanilla, Res Ctr Terr & Sustainable Habitat, Quito 170301, Ecuador.;Bonilla-Bedoya, S (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Campus Excelencia Int Agroalimentario ceiA3, Dept Forest Engn ETSIAM, Cordoba, Spain.;Bonilla-Bedoya, S (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Indoamer Machala & Sabanilla, Fac Ciencias Medio Ambiente, Ingn Biodiversidad Recursos Genet, Quito 170301, Ecuador.",santiagobonillab@hotmail.es; mherrera@uco.es; laurasalazar@uti.edu.ec; danilo.mejia@ucuenca.edu.cc,"Bonilla-Bedoya, Santiago/J-8851-2017; de Investigación Geológico y Energético - IIGE, Instituto/AAJ-2630-2020","Vaca, Angelica/0000-0002-1278-0134; Mejia, Danilo/0000-0002-2668-2789; Zalakeviciute, Rasa/0000-0001-9641-7318",Universidad Tecnologica Indoamerica; Corporacion Ecuatoriana para el Desarrollo de la Investigacion y Academia-CEDIA,Universidad Tecnologica Indoamerica; Corporacion Ecuatoriana para el Desarrollo de la Investigacion y Academia-CEDIA,"The authors would like to thank to Universidad Tecnologica Indoamerica and Corporacion Ecuatoriana para el Desarrollo de la Investigacion y Academia - CEDIA for the financial support given to the present research, development, and innovation work through its CEPRA program, especially for the Resiliencia ambiental en sistemas socioecologicos urbanos de ciudades neo-tropicales, casos Quito y Guayaquil fund.

The percentiles of the climate change factor are then used to measure expected hurricane losses in the Caribbean Island of St. Lucia. We also undertake benefit-cost analyses on four adaptation measures for homes in St. Lucia and determine when those are cost-effective for different time horizons and discount rates with and without climate change. Adaptation makes an enormous difference and can offset additional losses even with a high climate change factor by making houses much more resilient.

Under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) predicts a 0.6-m ensemble mean of sea level rise for the Central Pacific from the 1986-2005 to 2081-2100 epochs. Fifty downscaling simulations of the 2080-2099 period from the CMIP5 NCAR-CCSM4 model produce 2492 hurricanes around the Hawaiian Islands. In comparison with a control dataset for the 1980-1999 period, the simulated future hurricanes show a slight increase in number and a northward shift of the tracks toward the Hawaiian Islands. There are 627 hurricanes in the 2080-2099 dataset with potential impact on Oahu, and the top 24 storms selected by wind speed at the urban Honolulu coast define a scenario set for inundation mapping. A suite of spectral wave, circulation, and Boussinesq models in a nested grid system describes generation and propagation of surge and waves across the ocean as well as wave setup and runup at the coast. The interoperable package includes phase-averaged and phase-resolving processes to determine the coastal flood hazards over a range of spatial and temporal scales during a hurricane event. Since the simulated dataset corresponds to a quasi 1000-year period, barring the tail end of the distribution, the suite of inundation scenarios enables definition of flood hazard maps with return periods of up to 500 years or annual exceedance probabilities of 0.2% or greater for climate change adaptation.","[Li, Ning; Yamazaki, Yoshiki; Cheung, Kwok Fai] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Ocean & Resources Engn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Roeber, Volker] Tohoku Univ, Int Res Inst Disaster Sci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Chock, Gary] Martin & Chock Inc, Honolulu, HI USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Tohoku University,"Cheung, KF (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Ocean & Resources Engn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",cheung@hawaii.edu,,,"State of Hawaii Office of Planning - Coastal Zone Management Program; Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism; Pacific Island Ocean Observing System [NA11NOS0120039]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [15K06224]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K06224] Funding Source: KAKEN","State of Hawaii Office of Planning - Coastal Zone Management Program; Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism; Pacific Island Ocean Observing System; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This paper describes the results and findings from a study supported in part by the State of Hawaii Office of Planning - Coastal Zone Management Program and Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism.

In this paper, we examine UK residents' expectations of future threats and opportunities associated with climate change impacts, along with willingness to prioritise different climate change impacts for investment. Using a national survey (n = 2007), we report on three main findings. First, UK residents tend to expect threats related to flooding and wet weather to be more likely and concerning than heat extremes or opportunities. Second, UK residents' expectations of climate change impacts do not align with expert assessments, especially showing lower estimates of heat-related threats as compared to experts. Third, willingness to allocate resources to potential climate change impacts tends to be more strongly associated with anticipated concern should they occur than climate change belief or the expected likelihood of them occurring.

The impact of climate change on Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves and on urban drainage is reported. The flood mitigation measures comprised both green and grey alternatives, i.e., permeable surfaces and sewer enlargement. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5) was calibrated and employed. Prior to calibration, sensitivity analysis of SWMM hydrologic-hydraulic and permeable surfaces input parameters was conducted using a global sensitivity analysis method. Two novel indices, the Index for Reliability of Urban Drainage Adaptation (IRUDA) and the Climate Variability Adaptation Index (CVAI), were also introduced. IRUDA assesses the total reliability of an urban drainage network in hydraulic, temporal and volumetric terms. Sizing of flood mitigation measures was undertaken employing construction cost along with IRUDA. CVAI was used for alternative selection among different flood mitigation scenarios. CVAI assesses the total adaptive capacity of the drainage network based on hydrological, hydraulic and economic aspects of the proposed adaptation plan. A forward uncertainty propagation scheme was employed on the selected alternative in order to examine input data and parametric uncertainty with respect to the peak discharge at the outlet of the basin. Finally, monetization of ecosystem services offered by green measures is presented. The simulation results for the study area illustrated that under the non-stationarity assumption future rainfall intensities and urban flooding risk will increase, and therefore, further flood mitigation measures will be required. Furthermore, the majority of the adaptation strategies examined were found to improve the capacity and reliability of the drainage network. Moreover, the results revealed that permeable pavements perform better for storm events with return period of up to five years. Overall, it can be concluded that design criteria need to be reviewed and also green measures, such as permeable surfaces, can be introduced in the design procedure.","[Kourtis, Ioannis M.; Bellos, Vasilis; Kopsiaftis, George; Tsihrintzis, Vassilios A.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Ctr Assessment Nat Hazards & Proact Planning, Sch Rural Surveying & Geoinformat Engn, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15780, Greece; [Kourtis, Ioannis M.; Bellos, Vasilis; Kopsiaftis, George; Tsihrintzis, Vassilios A.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Lab Reclamat Works & Water Resources Management, Sch Rural Surveying & Geoinformat Engn, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15780, Greece; [Psiloglou, Basil] Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Natl Observ Athens, 1 Metaxa & Vas Pavlou St, GR-15236 Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens; National Technical University of Athens; National Observatory of Athens,"Tsihrintzis, VA (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Ctr Assessment Nat Hazards & Proact Planning, Sch Rural Surveying & Geoinformat Engn, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15780, Greece.;Tsihrintzis, VA (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Lab Reclamat Works & Water Resources Management, Sch Rural Surveying & Geoinformat Engn, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15780, Greece.",gkourtis@mail.ntua.gr; vmpellos@mail.ntua.gr; bill@noa.gr; tsihrin@otenet.gr,,"Kourtis, Ioannis/0000-0002-8123-4700","European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning in the context of the project Strengthening Human Resources Research Potential via Doctorate Research [MIS-5000432]","European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning in the context of the project Strengthening Human Resources Research Potential via Doctorate Research","This research is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning in the context of the project Strengthening Human Resources Research Potential via Doctorate Research (MIS-5000432), implemented by the State Scholarships Foundation (IKY).

J,"Rose, SK",,,,"Rose, Steven K.",,,Integrated assessment modeling of climate change adaptation in forestry and pasture land use: A review,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Review,,,,,,Climate change; Adaptation; Land use; Forestry; Pasture; Livestock,IMPACTS; CROPS,"Climate change is likely to affect commercial forest and pasture land use and production activities. As such, behavioral responses that adapt to the new and evolving climatic conditions are also likely. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) have an important role to play. IAMs are a unique class of models that integrate global biophysical and economic systems in order to explore issues with potentially significant interactions and feedbacks between the two systems, such as potential future impacts from climate change. Climate risks to forestry, pasture, and livestock are potential risks that need to be understood and weighed. Those risks are defined by both the nature of climate change as well as society's adaptive capacity. This paper reviews and characterizes climate change adaptation modeling of forestry and pasture land use by IAMs, as well as economic modeling. The paper discusses what needs to be modeled or considered, what we have learned from the literature available, and issues and opportunities for future research. The literature is sparse, and in an early stage, but has already yielded insights regarding adaptation's potential for reducing risks, and possibly generating societal benefits. Empirical modeling will be important going forward to identify adaptation options and provide an observation based grounding for JAM modeling. Relevant empirical modeling to date is limited but highlights that there are many potential facets to adaptation related to these sectors that need to be considered by IAMs in some form. Data deficiencies will also need to be overcome and IAM model development advanced. This paper is part of a research initiative, and special issue of this journal, to improve adaptation modeling in climate impacts research. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the study draws on two detailed case studies in Kenya for a better understanding of the nuances of climate adaptation, requiring a range of measures to be adopted and institutions working together. Findings from the study reveal that the most consistent observation among farmers is that eastern Africa is experiencing increased temperature and decreased rainfall across all its agro-ecological zones. In response to their perceived climatic risks, smallholder farmers in the region are using both short-term and long-term strategies, with the former mainly consisting of coping mechanisms against climate chocks. In addition, the adaptation strategies implemented by the farmers are influenced by agro-ecological conditions which shape their farming systems and institutional settings including proximity to a major city and markets. The case studies highlight the importance of collaborative efforts between key local and external stakeholders in supporting adaptation to climate change. Key lessons are drawn from this study for the development of future adaptation programmes.","[Gbegbelegbe, Sika] IITA, Chitedze Res Stn, Lilongwe 3, Malawi; [Serem, Jared] Univ Nairobi, Coll Agr & Vet Sci, Nairobi, Kenya; [Stirling, Clare] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Conservat Agr Program, Apdo, DF, Mexico; [Kyazze, Florence] Makerere Univ, Kampala, Uganda; [Radeny, Maren] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Misiko, Michael] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Tongruksawattana, Songporne] Partnership Econ Policy, Nairobi, Kenya; [Nafula, Lydia; Gakii, Mercy] Natl Museums Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya; [Sonder, Kai] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Texcoco, Mexico",University of Nairobi; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Makerere University; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Gbegbelegbe, S (corresponding author), IITA, Chitedze Res Stn, Lilongwe 3, Malawi.",g.sika@cgiar.org,,"Sonder, Kai/0000-0001-9672-5361; Misiko, Michael/0000-0002-5298-4393",,,,,45,14,14,3,38,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Experience with the ongoing development of Durban's Municipal Climate Protection Programme indicates that achieving EBA in cities means moving beyond the conceptualization of a uniform, one-size-fits-all layer of street trees and parks to a more detailed understanding of the complex ecology of indigenous ecosystems and their resilience under climate change conditions. It also means engaging with the role that this bio-infrastructure plays in improving the quality of life and socioeconomic opportunities of the most vulnerable human communities.

However, it is currently poorly understood what determines farmers' adaptation and how to measure it. In this study, we develop an activity-based adaptation index (AAI) and explore the relationship between socioeconomic variables and farmers' adaptation behavior by means of an explanatory factor analysis and a multiple linear regression model using latent variables. The model was tested in six villages situated in two administrative wards in the Morogoro region of Tanzania. The Mlali ward represents a system of relatively high agricultural potential, whereas the Gairo ward represents a system of low agricultural potential. A household survey, a rapid rural appraisal and, a stakeholder workshop were used for data collection. The data were analyzed using factor analysis, multiple linear regression, descriptive statistical methods and qualitative content analysis. The empirical results are discussed in the context of theoretical concepts of adaptation and the sustainable livelihood approach. We found that public investment in rural infrastructure, in the availability and technically efficient use of inputs, in a good education system that provides equal chances for women, and in the strengthening of social capital, agricultural extension and, microcredit services are the best means of improving the adaptation of the farmers from the six villages in Gairo and Mlali. We conclude that the newly developed AAI is a simple but promising way to capture the complexity of adaptation processes that addresses a number of shortcomings of previous index studies.

Exploring the impact of climate change on the production potential of maize, wheat, and rice in China is of great significance in adapting to climate change and safeguarding global food security. In this study the Global Agro-Ecological Zone (GAEZ) model and the Extreme-Point Symmetric Mode Decomposition (ESMD) model were used to explore the trends in production potential of China's three major crops in the context of climate change from 1960 to 2010. There was a quasi-3-year and quasi-5-year cycle in changes in maize, wheat, and rice production potential due to climate change in China. Climate change increased maize and rice production potential and reduced wheat production potential. The increase in minimum temperature was the main reason for the increased maize and rice production potential. Reduced wheat production potential was mainly caused by increased maximum temperature. Decreases in precipitation had a substantial negative impact on the production potential of all three crops. These results suggest that priority should be given to adjusting the structure of agricultural cultivation and appropriately expanding the planting area of maize and rice to adapt to climate change. Accelerating the construction of agricultural infrastructure to reduce the negative impact of declining precipitation and increasing daytime temperature on agriculture is also a high priority in order to safeguard food security.","[Li Fei; Zhou Meijun; Shao Jiaqi; Chen Zehui; Wei Xiaoli] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China; [Li Fei] Shaanxi Key Lab Earth Surface Syst & Environm Car, Xian 710127, Peoples R China; [Yang Jiuchun] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China","Northwest University Xi'an; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS","Li, F (corresponding author), Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China.;Li, F (corresponding author), Shaanxi Key Lab Earth Surface Syst & Environm Car, Xian 710127, Peoples R China.;Yang, JC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China.",lifei@nwu.edu.cn; yangjiuchun@neigae.ac.cn,,"Li, Fei/0000-0001-6647-6958",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701094],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We acknowledge the large number of scientists who have developed models and tools used to create the simulations used in this study.

In this respect, we distinguish between adaptation of winter sports vacations due to lacking snow reliability and other journeys apart from winter sports vacations due to higher temperatures. By examining the tourism sector, our study investigates an industry, which has not been extensively considered in economic analyses of climate change so far in spite of its worldwide huge economic relevance and strong sensitivity to climate change. Our empirical analysis on the basis of unique data from German tourists first reveals a large extent of stated tourism-related adaptation to climate change in the amount of nearly three quarters for winter sports tourists and more than 50% for other tourists. Our microeconometric analysis indicates that female tourists and tourists with a high awareness of climate change effects and increasing age are more willing to adapt. Our empirical results underline several challenges for the tourism industry and policy makers in order to transform the tourism infrastructure and to diversify holiday offers. They additionally reveal important focus groups of tourists such as (the increasing group of) elderly persons who are crucial for the development of successful future product strategies in the tourism sector.","[Schwirplies, Claudia] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Ziegler, Andreas] Univ Kassel, Kassel, Germany",University of Hamburg; Universitat Kassel,"Schwirplies, C (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",claudia.schwirplies@uni-hamburg.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the funding priority Economics of climate change'',German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the funding priority Economics of climate change''(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Financial Support by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the funding priority Economics of climate change'' is gratefully acknowledged.",,50,8,8,4,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Considering the lowest carbon emission intensity and the greatest mitigation task in the Eastern Economic Zone of China, this paper analyses the change of carbon emission intensity in Eastern China from 2000 to 2015. First, to prove the significance of carbon emission intensity, this paper studies the cointegration relationship between carbon emissions and the GDP. Afterwards, from the spatiotemporal perspective, this paper decomposes and analyses the carbon emission intensity of the whole country, Eastern China and the provinces of Eastern China and quantifies the impact of different factors. This paper finds that the energy structure of China and the East was in a relatively stable state during this period. In the past, the decrease in carbon emission intensity mainly depended on the improvement of sectoral emission efficiency, and the influence of industrial structure is growing. Furthermore, changes in the eastern region are similar to those in the whole country. The eastern region needs to give full play to its economic advantage in the future. On the spatial scale, GDP per capita and the ratio of tertiary industry have a significant impact on the spatial heterogeneity of carbon emission intensity in East China, while the ratio of secondary industry has few effects. Replacing energy-intensive industry with the service industry will be the focus of emission reduction in the future.","[Yang, Fan; Chou, Jieming; Sun, Mingyang; Zhao, Weixing] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Dong, Wenjie] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Atmospher Sci Sch, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Chou, JM (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",choujm@bnu.edu.cn,"yang, fei/HPF-9658-2023; Yang, Fan/GYU-4249-2022",,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA150903, 2016YFA0602703]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41575001]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFA150903, 2016YFA0602703), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41575001).",,39,9,9,8,16,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1474-7065,1873-5193,,PHYS CHEM EARTH,Phys.

However, the livelihood of residence of Dhye was becoming more difficult due to impact of climate change (CC). This research had attempted to evaluate the potential adaptation measures to avoid CC-induced migration based on analysis of hydro-meteorological data, documented bio-physical and socio-economic effects of CC, locally available natural resources, and recommended best adaptation measures. The study assessed that low rainfall and erratic pattern, shifting snowfall pattern, decreasing humidity, and increased air temperature created the water stress as the result dried up the spring and dropping of soil moisture which had direct negative impact on supporting healthy plant growth and animals had to travel further for fodder and water. In realized that fact residents in village have adopted different adaptation strategy mainly seasonal migration, started selling their properties and leaving the village for the collective-survival of the community, the Dhye farmers unanimously decided to leave their habitats enmasse and resettle at Thangchung (near the bank of Dhye River), thus become climate refugee. The findings revealed that there was a direct link between the changes in climate parameters in Dhye Village and its consequences, and suggesting the resettlement of them to Thangchung as the best adaption option with need to make proper policy on climate change adaptation, and its timely implementation that could have averted this unfortunate situation.","[Prasain, Suresh] Agr & Forestry Univ, Rampur, Chitwan, Nepal",,"Prasain, S (corresponding author), Agr & Forestry Univ, Rampur, Chitwan, Nepal.",suresh11prasain@gmail.com,,"prasain, suresh/0000-0002-2982-333X",,,,,24,6,7,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

It assessed their attitude, behavioural motivation for mitigating and adapting to climate change in the two capital cities of South Asia: Islamabad in Pakistan and Dhaka in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach This study used the quantitative research technique based on responses of 800 close-ended questions embedded in a close-ended questionnaire, which were filled-out from randomly selected sample of respondents. The primary data was analysed and presented through tabulation. For binary dependent variables, the standardised logistic coefficients were projected for more reliable estimates. Findings The findings reveal that the population of both capital cities have a low personal perception of climate change. Also, the dwellers of both cities have a low level of motivation to take mitigative and adaptive measures against climatic hazards. The results of the logistic regression model further indicate that the people who believe that climate change is a threat to their lives are more likely to adopt mitigative and adaptive strategies. This mostly applies to the people with a relatively higher income and education level. Research limitations/implications This study implies to create awareness and sensitise the local community in both the capitals and beyond through information dissemination. Further, the availability of toolkits to handle emergencies remains imperative in registering attitudinal and behavioural changes to reduce the impacts of climate variability in poor localities. Originality/value This research study analysed the link between climate change mitigation and energy conservation from the societal attributes of perception, motivation, attitude and behaviour, which remains essential for community-based mitigation against climatic hazards.","[Alvi, Shahzad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Social Sci & Humanities S3H, Dept Econ, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Khayyam, Umer] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Social Sci & Humanities S3H, Dept Dev Studies, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Hossen, Altap] Federat Bangladesh Chambers Commerce & Ind FBCCI, Dhaka, Bangladesh",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Khayyam, U (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Social Sci & Humanities S3H, Dept Dev Studies, Islamabad, Pakistan.",dr.umer@s3h.nust.edu.pk,"Alvi, Shahzad/AAN-1234-2020","Alvi, Shahzad/0000-0002-1565-2517; Khayyam, Dr. Umer/0000-0002-1253-7265",,,,,65,3,3,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

At the same time, they possess valuable knowledge for fair and sustainable climate adaptation planning and policymaking. Yet Indigenous peoples and knowledges are often excluded from or underrepresented within adaptation plans and policies. In this paper we ask whether the concept of epistemic injustice can be applied to the context of climate adaptation and the underrepresentation of Indigenous knowledges within adaptation policies and strategies. In recent years, the concept of epistemic injustice has gained prominence, indicating that someone has been unfairly discriminated against in their capacity as a knower (Fricker 2007, 1). We argue that many climate adaptation policies are epistemically unjust towards Indigenous peoples because of the underrepresentation of Indigenous knowledges by showing how the case of Indigenous knowledges in climate adaptation planning and policy satisfies five conditions of epistemic injustice. We further consider what challenges there are to integrating local and Indigenous knowledges within development in general, and climate adaptation strategies in particular and how these can be addressed. Whether the lack of Indigenous knowledges in climate adaptation policies constitutes an epistemic injustice matters because an injustice denotes an unfair (dis)advantage to one group - whether by design or default - that ought to be remedied and redressed.","[Byskov, Morten Fibieger; Hyams, Keith] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Byskov, MF (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",morten.byskov@warwick.ac.uk,,"Byskov, Morten Fibieger/0000-0002-1682-2311",British Academy's 2018 UK International Challenges programme [IC2\100139],British Academy's 2018 UK International Challenges programme,The research for this paper is supported by the British Academy's 2018 UK International Challenges programme (grant no.: IC2\100139).,,96,0,0,3,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2820,1572-8447,,ETHICAL THEORY MORAL,Ethical Theory Moral Pract.,SEP,2022,25,4,,,,,613,634,,10.1007/s10677-022-10301-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10677-022-10301-z,,JUN 2022,22,Philosophy,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Philosophy,5M4AT,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000807302900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although disease is a major threat to aquaculture production, the underlying global epidemiological patterns are unknown. We analysed disease outbreak severity across different latitudes in a diverse range of aquaculture systems. Disease at lower latitudes progresses more rapidly and results in higher cumulative mortality, in particular at early stages of development and in shellfish. Tropical countries suffer proportionally greater losses in aquaculture during disease outbreaks and have less time to mitigate losses. Synthesis and applications. Disease can present a major problem for food production and security in equatorial regions where fish and shellfish provide a major source of dietary protein.

Yet, they have been relatively overlooked by human geographers and critical risk theorists, whose interests have been to document the political processes involved in shaping climate change and the global scientific enterprise it has generated. By looking at the ways in which CS have been developed and exported to countries deemed as climate-vulnerable, the paper sheds light on two simultaneous kinds of knowledge politics that are occurring at the interstices of global human security aspirations and the realpolitik of local practices. The first emerges from the ways in which CS political relevance has been secured by climate scientists in the midst of grand developmentalist and humanitarian ambitions, what we have called beneficent knowledge politics. The second comes from the nitty-gritty of risk management practices in countries to which CS are exported, in this case China, and highlights how a myriad of knowledge and sensitivities involved in shaping risk and science have been overlooked by the superseding ideals underpinning the production of CS and their application to wider climate adaptation agenda. By doing so, the paper contributes to the geographies of risk and emergencies as well as to the geographies of science by enhancing our understanding of the knowledge politics at play in the development of and resistance to technocratic climate governance.","[Nobert, Sebastien] Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Wen, Cheng] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, England",Universite de Montreal; University of Leeds,"Nobert, S (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",S.Nobert@umontreal.ca,,"Wen, Cheng/0000-0003-3546-9813; Nobert, Sebastien/0000-0002-9282-8184",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [P015348]; UK Newton Fund [430- 2019-00339],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); UK Newton Fund,"First and foremost, we would like to thank all those who have participated to this research and without whom this paper would not have been written.

Agriculture will, however, continue to be the most important sector to adapt to climate change: nearly 70 per cent of China's population depends directly on agriculture. Like other developing countries, China will need to develop adaptation strategies imposed by climate change against a background of existing poverty, resource and infrastructure constraints. Northeast China was selected for this case study because it illustrates how anticipatory adaptation can lead to positive impacts from climate change. This region is already one of the most important bases of commercial food grains (wheat, rice and maize) and economic crops (soybean, sugar beets). Recent climate warming has on the one hand created favourable conditions for agricultural development in Northeast China through a prolonged growth period, northward movement of accumulated temperature belts and decreases of cold stress. On the other hand, environment and natural resource problems (e.g. water shortage, urbanisation) have placed enormous regional stress on agricultural production and ecosystems, illustrating the complex nature of the impacts of climate change. This case study demonstrates that the positive opportunities provided by climate change will not happen automatically but will require communities to be supported through resources such as extension services, new crop varieties and institutional frameworks that allow experimentation and reward entrepreneurship.

The worst affected are the small and marginal farmers who constitute more than 70 per cent of the farming community in India. Extreme weather events like increased frequency of heatwaves and cold spells, droughts and floods in the last decade have become common. In India agriculture contributes about 28 per cent of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; about 78 per cent of methane and nitrous oxide emissions are estimated to be due to the current agricultural practices. Sustainable agriculture approaches are now acknowledged for the wide range of ecological and economic benefits that accrue to the practitioners as well as consumers of agricultural products. These approaches, based on low external inputs, are also less energy-intensive and less polluting and so mitigate and help in adapting to climate change. Combined with coordinated action by groups or communities at the local level, and supportive external institutions working in partnership with farmers, sustainable agriculture will help to mitigate and adapt to climate change.","Ctr Sustainable Agr CSA, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",,"Ramanjaneyulu, GV (corresponding author), Ctr Sustainable Agr CSA, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0265-5012,,,IDS BULL-I DEV STUD,IDS Bull.-Inst.

The main objective of the current research is to introduce an innovative methodological framework which can effectively assess adaptation measures in basins with severe water deficits by coupling hydrology, climate change and management scenarios, leading to accurate decision making. In this paper, both supply and demand adaptation measures were proposed in line with various regional, national and European policies in order to improve the severe water problem of the Mygdonia basin. The overexploitation of the surface water systems (Lakes Koronia and Volvi) and groundwater resources of the Mygdonia basin during the previous decades, along with the projected decrease of the future water availability, due to climate change, accentuate the need for concerted action towards adaption to climate change. The measures include the increase of a stream diversion towards Lake Koronia, the increase of the embankment elevation at the outfall point of Lake Volvi, the restructuring of crops and their combinations. The measures were examined in terms of their sustainability and effectiveness in the short-term (2020-2050) and long-term (2050-2080) future periods under the most reliable climatic model. The results indicate that the application of demand management measures is more efficient compared to supply oriented solutions for addressing the future water deficit of the Mygdonia water system. The combination of crop restructuring and the decrease of agricultural land proved to be the most efficient and sustainable solution.","[Kolokytha, Elpida; Malamataris, Dimitrios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Civil Engn, Lab Water Resources Engn & Management, Univ Campus, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Kolokytha, E (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Civil Engn, Lab Water Resources Engn & Management, Univ Campus, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece.",lpcol@civil.auth.gr,,"Kolokytha, Elpida/0000-0002-4852-9734",IKY FELLOWSHIPS OF EXCELLENCE FOR POSTGRADUATE STUDIES IN GREECE - SIEMENS PROGRAM,IKY FELLOWSHIPS OF EXCELLENCE FOR POSTGRADUATE STUDIES IN GREECE - SIEMENS PROGRAM,"This research was funded by the IKY FELLOWSHIPS OF EXCELLENCE FOR POSTGRADUATE STUDIES IN GREECE - SIEMENS PROGRAM.

Current and potential impacts are especially hard on farming in the Sudan savannah, thus adaptation is widely advised and encouraged, and already occurring. In the study sites Dassari, Benin, and Dano, Burkina Faso, farmers' climate change perceptions and practiced coping measures were qualitatively and quantitatively recorded. Analyses included statistical testing to detach anecdotal responses from factual decisions. Results reveal that responses regarding climate change perception and adaptation are frequently subjective, conjectural and inconsistent. Farmers' acknowledge that adaptations to climate change impacts are diverse, but site specific. Measures do not causally respond to the type of hazard, nor to its impacts, but instead tend to address wide-ranging demands, such as household food security, income generation and capitalization. Hence, causally linking hazards, impacts and responses can be misleading, and measures can thus be ineffective. After our findings, key qualities of effective coping measures are short-term economic returns, compatibility with local ecological, social and institutional settings and agreeing with the customary farming traditions. With respect to operability, the national agricultural extension services are still the most relevant instances. Considering these aspects can support local farming adaptation and also increase the general resilience of the households.","[Callo-Concha, Daniel] Univ Bonn, Dept Ecol & Nat Resources Management, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Genscheralle 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Callo-Concha, D (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Ecol & Nat Resources Management, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Genscheralle 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",d.callo-concha@uni-bonn.de,,,West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) - German Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung; BMBF),West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) - German Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung; BMBF),"This research was financially supported by the West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung; BMBF).

This study investigated the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) among university students in Bangladesh and significant factors associated with their prevention practices related to climate change and DF. Methods: A social media-based (Facebook) cross-sectional KAP survey was conducted and secondary data of reported DF cases in 2019 extracted. Logistic regression and spatial analysis were run to examine the data. Results: Of 1500 respondents, 76% believed that climate change can affect DF transmission. However, participants reported good climate change knowledge (76.7%), attitudes (87.9%) and practices (39.1%). The corresponding figures for DF were knowledge (47.9%), attitudes (80.3%) and practices (25.9%). Good knowledge and attitudes were significantly associated with good climate change adaptation or mitigation practices (p<0.05). Good knowledge, attitudes and previous DF experiences were also found to be significantly associated with good DF prevention practices (p<0.001). There was no significant positive correlation between climate change and DF KAP scores and the number of DF cases. Conclusions: Findings from this study provide baseline data that can be used to promote educational campaigns and intervention programs focusing on climate change adaptation and mitigation and effective DF prevention strategies among various communities in Bangladesh and similar dengue-endemic countries.","[Rahman, Md Siddikur; Amrin, Miftahuzzannat] Begum Rokeya Univ, Dept Stat, Rangpur 5400, Bangladesh; [Karamehic-Muratovic, Ajlina] St Louis Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, St Louis, MO 63103 USA; [Baghbanzadeh, Mahdi] Zarrin Jam Marina, Data Analyt Div, Tehran, Iran; [Zafar, Sumaira] Asian Inst Technol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Rahman, Nadia Nahrin] Bangladesh Univ Professionals, Dept Mass Commun & Journalism, Dhaka 1216, Bangladesh; [Shirina, Sharifa Umma] Univ Barishal, Dept Mass Commun & Journalism, Barishal, Bangladesh; [Haque, Ubydul] Univ North Texas, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Hlth Sci Ctr, Ft Worth, TX 76107 USA",Saint Louis University; Asian Institute of Technology; University of Barishal; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Rahman, MS (corresponding author), Begum Rokeya Univ, Dept Stat, Rangpur 5400, Bangladesh.",siddikur@brur.ac.bd,"Amrin, Miftahuzzannat/CAH-8120-2022; Rahman, Md.

At the same time, they are central to the EU's biodiversity policy, and particular the Natura 2000 network of protected areas. Yet, the interlinkage between climate change and biodiversity policy is complex and discursively contested. In this paper, we assess how the debate on climate change adaptation affects forest conservation and management under Natura 2000. Drawing on the concept of argumentative discourse analysis, we present evidence from 213 qualitative interviews with policy stakeholders and practitioners that were conducted at both the European policy level and the local country level in 6 EU member states. Our results demonstrate that the nexus between climate change adaptation and forest conservation policy is conceptualised differently by different stakeholders and practioners at different levels. Three major discourses can be made out (pragmatic discourse, dynamics discourse, threat discourse), which are characterised by a set of partially overlapping story lines. These discourses are employed by four discourse coalitions (environmental, forest users', expert, and grass root coalition). As a general rule, debates at the European level are more polarised and politicised, while the local debates on climate change and Natura 2000 remain rather vague and are less polarised. This seems to indicate that the link between climate change adaptation and forest conservation is mostly an issue for an abstract high-level policy debate. At this level, climate change is used to influence well-known policies, and to legitimise distinct interests that were already present before the climate change debate has emerged.

Water management strategies are becoming especially important. In the past, societies had to adapt in order to survive as well. Communities often practised long-term sustainable agriculture. By understanding the ways in which ancient communities were successful at or failed in attaining social-ecological resilience through water management archeologists can provide important information for modern communities facing similar problems. Archeology's long time perspective is very valuable. However, archeologists are confronted with a number of issues. Archeology can only study the material remains of past societies, not the living communities. Not all human activity translates into material residue and not all materials survive. Moreover, people will not demonstrate completely rational cause-and-effect behavior, but ideology and beliefs, which archeology can only poorly attest, will also have influenced decisions. Nevertheless, archeology can bring a unique perspective to the debate on climate change adaptation: archeology can falsify or corroborate sustainability claims, ancient water management techniques may still be a resilient mode of subsistence and ancient techniques often rely on relatively simple technology allowing for easier adoption. When transposing ancient water management techniques to modern situations it is important to involve stakeholders from an early stage, to incorporate traditional knowledge systems as much as possible and most importantly to ascertain whether physical and socio-cultural circumstances are comparable. Archeological knowledge on ancient sustainability and water management is not a panacea for all climate related aridification, but can contribute a unique longue duree perspective.

By tracing a travelling idea about 'Adaptation to Climate Change' (ACC) along multiple encounters and negotiation arenas, this paper wishes to explore the epistemological and political challenges that are entailed by this narrative in the making. It focuses on the power dynamics and (ontological) politics that are revealed by the translation that characterize the emergence of this nascent discourse in Tanzania. It is argued that this travelling idea - which is continuously co-produced and reshaped by varying actors in its journey to the `local' level - brings longstanding tensions to the fore that exist between Maasai agro-pastoralists and the Tanzanian government. Whereas the government portrays the pastoralists in the debate both as victims as well as perpetrators of a changing climate, the grassroots organizations and NGOs representing the pastoral communities, contend that the Maasai are rather masters of adaptation. It will be shown how the ACC paradigm is wholeheartedly embraced by several actors along its journey until it reaches the rural village of Terrat, where it is by and large rejected. By shining light on these translation practices, it is argued that in face of the emergence and increasing dissemination of climate change discourses around the world, adaptation should not solely be treated as a collective human response to (external) changing bio-physical stimuli, but also as an integrated process that cannot be detached from adaptations to its discursive formations.","[de Wit, Sara] Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc InSIS, 64 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6PN, England",University of Oxford,"de Wit, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc InSIS, 64 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6PN, England.",sara.dewit@insis.ox.ac.uk,,"de Wit, Sara/0000-0003-4696-2777",DFG,DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This research formed part of the SPP 1448 priority program 'Adaptation and Creativity in Africa', and the jointly coordinated project 'Translating Adaptation to Climate Change in Eastern Africa'.

For successful adaptation policies, in-depth understanding of farmers' perceptions about climate change, agriculture, and adaptation strategies is essential. This qualitative study in rural Burkina Faso characterized farmers' perceptions and knowledge through in-depth interviews. The study enumerated the barriers, possibilities, strategies/practices, and support sources of farmers. There was awareness but limited understanding of climate change amongst farmers. Those unable to adapt, faced increased health difficulties, specifically regarding nutrition and mental health. Farmers could implement some dietary and agricultural adaptation strategies (reduce meal size, frequency and variety, preemptive purchase of cereals, multi-cropping, crop rotation, modified seeds) but were unable to implement others (soil rehabilitation, water management). Barriers to implementation comprised financial and time constraints, material and labor shortages, and inaccessible information. Farmers did not understand, trust or utilize meteorological services, but appreciated and relied on agricultural extension services. They reported that social and governmental support was sporadic and inconsistent.

J,"Hall, N",,,,"Hall, Nina",,,What is adaptation to climate change? Epistemic ambiguity in the climate finance system,INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate finance; Adaptation; Ambiguity; Principal; agent theory; Delegation,INTERNATIONAL-ORGANIZATIONS; MONEY,"Over the past decade developed states have committed significant public financing for climate change adaptation. Much of this public financing flows through international development organizations. States have delegated the implementation and monitoring of adaptation to existing international organizations such as the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Scholars have noted that states delegate discretion to specialized organizations to perform a task on their behalf, but have not explored how uncertainties about the nature of the task affect delegation. This article addresses this gap by distinguishing the concept of epistemic ambiguity (when states are uncertain about the exact nature of a task) from strategic ambiguity (when states do not reach consensus over a task due to political differences) in order to address the question: how have states and international organizations defined and implemented adaptation activities? The question is answered through case studies of: (1) adaptation projects administered by the United Nations Development Programme and the International Organization for Migration in Kenya; and (2) states' and international organizations' attempts to develop methodologies for reporting adaptation financing. The case studies are based on: primary documents published by states and international organizations, secondary literature on climate finance, and interviews with adaptation experts. This article argues that states have not precisely defined adaptation, and that this is substantially due to epistemic ambiguity. It then identifies two consequences of epistemic ambiguity: a proliferation of activities labelled as adaptation, and difficulties tracking and monitoring adaptation assistance.","[Hall, Nina] Hertie Sch Governance, 180 Friedrichstr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",,"Hall, N (corresponding author), Hertie Sch Governance, 180 Friedrichstr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",hall@hertie-school.org,"Hall, Nina/AAQ-2987-2020","Hall, Nina/0000-0002-6318-9029",,,,,54,23,23,2,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Myanmar's economy, which exclusively depends on agriculture, is increasingly at risk due to climate change. Since farmers are often the first to confront climate change, they must adapt to new climatic conditions. Local adaptation practices, the possible starting points in developing new adaptation strategies, are currently occurring at a local scale, particularly based on the traditional knowledge. We used household survey, participatory histogram mapping and key-informant interviews to explore the farmers' perception and adaptation practices to climate change in the Myanmar Dry Zone. Ninety per cent of respondents perceived the changing climatic patterns in the Dry Zone, while increasing temperature and the erratic rainfall patterns were perceived as the predominant changes by 85% of the people. The farmers also perceived that there have already been several impacts of climate changes on agriculture. The common sesame/groundnut cropping pattern has been abandoned by the Dry Zone farmers in recent decades due to climate-change-driven agricultural production barriers. Farmers have been dealing with those barriers using their conventional agricultural practices, e.g. rainwater-collection, tube wells and water-harvesting techniques. They have also been using the traditional weather forecasting techniques to predict weather. Consequently, the study underlines the need to document existing agricultural practices that can prove to be successful adaptation measures, and it points out the crucial role of the extension strategy in disseminating agricultural techniques and weather information to support farmers to further adapt to climate-change impacts.","[Swe, Lwin Maung Maung] EcoDev, Burma, Myanmar; [Shrestha, Rajendra Prasad; Ebbers, Theo; Jourdain, Damien] Asian Inst Technol, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Jourdain, Damien] CIRAD, UMR G EAU, Montpellier, France",Asian Institute of Technology; AgroParisTech; CIRAD,"Swe, LMM (corresponding author), EcoDev, Burma, Myanmar.",lmms2007@gmail.com,"Jourdain, Damien/AAG-4446-2019; Shrestha, Rajendra/AAC-1443-2019","Jourdain, Damien/0000-0001-8707-5221; Shrestha, Rajendra/0000-0002-1010-1994",,,,,38,30,31,0,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This paper explores the preparedness of the Australian construction industry to adapt to climate change risks, through twenty-one key stakeholder interviews. The interviews addressed participants' perceptions of the industry's: climate change risk awareness, analytical capacity to address climate change risk, and current actions to address these risks. The main risk participants identified was extreme weather during construction (e.g. heat and wind) with impacts for occupational health and safety, supply chain reliability, project delivery delays, and profit. The impact of these risks was somewhat down played. While a high level of perceived analytical capacity to respond to climate change was observed, real action was limited by systemic, outdated regulations, lack of client motivation, and perceived costs. The climate change actions which were undertaken were predominantly climate change mitigation activities, largely focussing on organisational processes, rather than adaptations to built form. The results indicate that if Australia's built form is to be well adapted to climate change, greater preparedness to facilitate tangible and systemic actions to address climate change risk in the Australian construction industry is needed. Specifically, interviewees responses imply that increased awareness of the impacts of climate change, better translation of existing solutions into practice, and regulatory reform are needed.","[Hurlimann, Anna Catherine; Warren-Myers, Georgia; Browne, Geoffrey R.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Hurlimann, AC (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",anna.hurlimann@unimelb.edu.au,"Warren-Myers, Georgia/ABI-1819-2020; Browne, Geoffrey/ABA-3139-2020","Warren-Myers, Georgia/0000-0002-1453-8421; Browne, Geoffrey R/0000-0003-1990-3050; Hurlimann, Anna/0000-0001-9110-9340",'Multiplex Research Program Award' 2016-2017,'Multiplex Research Program Award' 2016-2017,"This work was supported by the 'Multiplex Research Program Award' 2016-2017.

In the current study, using theory from the organizational psychology domain, we examined whether individuals' attachment to their community and perceptions of their community's resilience were related to the extent to which individuals perceived norms related to pro-environmental action within close others, and in turn, whether these social norms are associated with perceptions of climate change risk and subsequent willingness to engage in pro-environmental behavior. Findings from 1,156 Canadian citizens or permanent residents supported the hypotheses. Mediation analyses indicated that, first, descriptive and prescriptive norms for pro-environmental behavior, and then perceptions of climate change risk, serially mediated the association between community attachment and resilience and willingness to engage in social advocacy and tax support to adapt to climate change in their community. In the face of a rapidly changing climate across Canadian communities, this contextual understanding of pro-environmental activism and influence, as well as implications pertaining to the importance of community identification, culture, norms, and leadership, has implications for future research and practice.","[Smith, Chelsie J.; Dupre, Kathryne E.; McEvoy, Amanda] Carleton Univ, Dept Psychol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Kenny, Shawn] Carleton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Carleton University; Carleton University,"Dupre, KE (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Psychol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",Kathryne.Dupre@carleton.ca,"Smith, Chelsie J./HMD-4018-2023","Smith, Chelsie J./0000-0002-8848-2088; Kenny, Shawn/0000-0002-3183-3908","Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs","Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs","This research was funded by a grant from the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs to Shawn Kenny under the New Directions Research Program.",,84,8,8,10,38,CANADIAN PSYCHOLOGICAL  ASSOC,OTTAWA,"141 LAURIER AVE WEST, STE 702, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1P 5J3, CANADA",0008-400X,1879-2669,,CAN J BEHAV SCI,Can.

A two-dimensional Bayesian probability calculation was applied to take account of uncertainties in debris-flow triggering. Precipitation quantities exceeding the 95th percentile of daily precipitation amounts were found to have a significantly higher probability to coincide with observed debris flows. A different relationship exists for extreme temperatures, however. Southerly air flows, weak horizontal pressure gradients over Europe, and westerly flows are mostly associated with observed debris flows and 95th precipitation percentile exceedances. These principal flow directions are well represented in the regional climate model (RCM) HIRHAM control simulations for events exceeding the 95th precipitation percentile and the 30th temperature percentile. Under the IPCC A2 emission scenario, westerly and southerly flows are mostly responsible for these precipitation and temperature conditions under the hypothesis of slow adaptation to climate change (HS1/HC1). Under the hypothesis of rapid adaptation to climate change (HS1/HS1), southerly flows and weak horizontal pressure gradients are likely to gain in importance. In both scenarios for the future, southeasterly flows are among the principal flow directions responsible for the joint exceedance of the 95th precipitation percentile and the 30th temperature percentile, while these were absent in observations and the control simulation.

The approach used allows for evaluating the interactions between climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies under low and high impact scenarios through 2050. Climate change impact projections of sixteen General Circulation Models indicate that a global high emissions trajectory scenario would likely yield more severe impacts on hydropower generation than a mitigation scenario. Adaptation modeling suggests that climate change impacts can be compensated by a wide range of alternatives, whose optimality will depend on the level of mitigation effort pursued. Our results show that climate change impacts would lead to even higher emissions in the absence of climate change mitigation policies. On the other hand, mitigation strategies to pursue lower emissions are maintained under climate change impacts, meaning that mitigation strategies are robust when faced with adaptation challenges. Mitigation efforts could yield a more diverse and less carbon intensive mix of technological options for adaptation. When analyzing investment costs to adapt to climate change impacts, in some cases mitigation can lead to a lower total investment level. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Experience shows us that weather is already a driving influence in forest management as extreme-weather events cause substantial damage. Biotic and abiotic disturbances create significant uncertainty for managers, and present a significant risk of loss to the growing stock. Forecasts of climate change indicate increasing average temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. These forecasts also suggest more extreme-weather events. Changing weather patterns mean changing interactions between forests and disturbance agents, likely resulting in unprecedented levels of damage. Research forest managers have developed an approach to managing this uncertainty and risk through forest management planning. If climate change will lead to more extreme weather, it is expected that adapting to climate change will equate to managing risk. A retrospective examination of the response to the mountain pine beetle outbreak (1991-2005) has enabled us to document our approach to managing the risk of damage and loss. Forest management planning provides a framework to establish priorities, set objectives and devise strategies to maintain the values that are important on research forests as they adapt to climate change.

J,"Surminski, S; Oramas-Dorta, D",,,,"Surminski, Swenja; Oramas-Dorta, Delioma",,,Flood insurance schemes and climate adaptation in developing countries,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Risk transfer; Climate adaptation; Flood risk; Insurance; Risk reduction,RISK,"Risk transfer, including insurance, is widely recognized as a tool for increasing financial resilience to severe weather events such as floods. The application of this mechanism varies widely across countries, with a range of different types and schemes in operation. While most of the analytical focus has so far been on those markets that have a long tradition of insurance, there is still a clear gap in our understanding of how this mechanism works in a developing country context. This paper assesses 27 insurance schemes that transfer the risk of economic losses arising from floods in low and middle income countries, focusing on the linkages between financial risk transfer and risk reduction. This aspect is important to avoid the effect of moral hazard and has gained particular relevance in the context of the climate change adaptation discourse, where some scholars and practitioners view insurance as a potential tool not just for current risks, but also to address projected future impacts of a changing climate by incentivizing risk reduction. We therefore look beyond the pure financial risk transfer nature of those 27 insurance schemes and investigate any prevention and risk reduction elements. Our analysis suggests that the potential for utilizing risk transfer for risk reduction is far from exhausted, with only very few schemes showing an operational link between risk transfer and risk reduction, while the effectiveness and implementation on the ground remains unclear. The dearth of linkages between risk reduction and insurance is a missed opportunity in the efforts to address rising risk levels, particularly in the context of climate change. Rising risk levels pose a threat to the insurability of floods, and insurance without risk reduction elements could lead to moral hazard. Therefore a closer linkage between risk transfer and risk reduction could make this a more sustainable and robust tool. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It explores the language used to discuss adaptation, what is known about resonant frames, drawing on adaptation discourses in policy, practice, and the media. Identifying trends and widely applicable insights is made challenging not only by the variety of words used to speak of adaptation, but by the fact that adaptation' language is often not used at all. A broad literature on perceptions and experiences of climate change impacts and how these experiences affect people's valuations and emotional responses to climate change offers crucial insights to the challenges and opportunities in communicating adaptation. It reveals much about people's interest in and acceptability and knowledge of adaptation, about preferred timing and who is thought to be responsible for enacting adaptive actions. Insights from the literature on place attachment and place identity are of particular relevance to public engagement on adaptation as it goes a long way toward explaining the quality of the adaptation debate to date while offering promising opportunities for dialogue.

Climatic changes have potentially serious implications for the historic environment, which is itself a non-renewable resource. Cultural heritage sites can be particularly sensitive to severe weather events and to changes in climate, both due to direct impacts on built structures, archaeology and designed landscapes, but also due to changes in visitor behaviour and the potentially adverse implications of adaptive measures on heritage significance. This research investigated the adaptive capacity of the management of cultural heritage sites in the UK. The research methodology and a final conceptual framework of adaptive capacity relevant for heritage management are presented in this paper. An initial framework of adaptive capacity was developed through an examination of key literature, a scoping study and a questionnaire survey. This was then tested and refined through the assessment of adaptive capacity at three UK World Heritage Sites, the analysis of national and international policy and interviews with stakeholders at the national and international level. The process of analysis and development of a revised conceptual framework gave insights into some of the challenges of investigating adaptive capacity. The key determinants of adaptive capacity in the final framework, found to affect the capacity to adapt to climate change at cultural heritage sites, are cognitive factors, leadership, learning capacity, access to information, authority and resources.

Attaining food and nutrition security goals is also a priority for the region, particularly in relation to improving dietary quality and reducing the incidence of non-communicable diseases. Addressing these challenges requires context-specific research that incorporates a realistic understanding of the links between drivers of change, food systems, and how these influence diets and health. Using a case study approach, this study explores links between climate hazards, food systems, and diets in remote coastal villages of Fiji. Livelihood transitions and climate hazards explain why households have become less reliant on local fisheries and agriculture for their dietary needs. Most households are routinely consuming only locally sourced food items from four food groups, meaning dietary diversity is low. In addition, diets are shifting and now include significant quantities of energy-dense processed (imported) foods with lower nutritional value. The study highlights the importance of increasing availability of fruits and vegetables, mainly through local production, and diversifying sustainable sources of animal protein as strategies to increase diet quality. These communities are already implementing strategies to adapt to climate change, yet this study underscores the need to link climate adaptation with changes to food systems and diets, in ways that allow livelihoods to be sustained and the quality of life of rural dwellers to improve.","[Medina Hidalgo, Daniela; Witten, Isaac; Nunn, Patrick D.; Burkhart, Sarah; Beazley, Harriot] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia; [Medina Hidalgo, Daniela; Bogard, Jessica R.; Herrero, Mario] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Hidalgo, DM (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia.;Hidalgo, DM (corresponding author), Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",daniela.medina@research.usc.edu.au; idw001@student.usc.edu.au; pnunn@usc.edu.au; sburkhar@usc.edu.au; Jessica.Bogard@csiro.au; hbeazley@usc.edu.au; Mario.Herrero@csiro.au,"Nunn, Patrick D./C-7864-2011; Hidalgo, Daniela Medina/AAP-6674-2020; Herrero, Mario/A-6678-2015; Bogard, Jessica/A-7161-2018; Burkhart, Sarah/H-1459-2016","Nunn, Patrick D./0000-0001-9295-5741; Hidalgo, Daniela Medina/0000-0002-7064-0455; Herrero, Mario/0000-0002-7741-5090; Bogard, Jessica/0000-0001-5503-5284; Burkhart, Sarah/0000-0003-2635-4299",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Postgraduate Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Postgraduate Scholarship",We would like to thank the communities of Ono Island for their support and involvement in this study.

While everyone in the Pacific Islands should participate in climate change adaptation activities, it is the young people, given they are the generation likely to not only bear the burden of climate change, but to lead and live effective climate change adaptation activities and strategies specific to their region, the involvement of youth is critical. Pacific Island youths are often marginalised within traditional decision-making hierarchies, therefore they are typically excluded from participating in meaningful discussions at community and government levels. Discussions were held with 30 adolescents aged 14-18years in Fiji to explore knowledge and experiences regarding climate change. Participants revealed their dismay at their inability to talk to family - who they consider are not doing enough - about what they consider as appropriate responses to climate change, recommending the help of an authoritative outsider who could speak to their community leaders and family. Discussions also revealed that Fijian youth could not distinguish between changes in the climate and normal weather events, attesting to the importance of climate-change education and awareness-raising efforts within the Pacific Islands more generally.","[Scott-Parker, Bridie] Sunshine Coast Mind & Neurosci Thompson Inst, Adolescent Risk Res Unit, 12 Innovat Pkwy, Birtinya, Qld 4575, Australia; [Scott-Parker, Bridie; Kumar, Roselyn] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Birtinya, Australia; [Scott-Parker, Bridie; Kumar, Roselyn] Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Arts Business & Law, Birtinya, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast; University of the Sunshine Coast,"Scott-Parker, B (corresponding author), Sunshine Coast Mind & Neurosci Thompson Inst, Adolescent Risk Res Unit, 12 Innovat Pkwy, Birtinya, Qld 4575, Australia.;Scott-Parker, B (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Birtinya, Australia.;Scott-Parker, B (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Arts Business & Law, Birtinya, Australia.",bscottpa@usc.edu.au,,"Scott-Parker, Bridie/0000-0002-3702-8723; Kumar, Roselyn/0000-0002-3940-0488",Fiji Teachers' Union; Fiji Ministry of Education; National Health and Medical Research Council Research Fellowship; University of the Sunshine Coast FAB Publication Completion Grant [PCG15/24],Fiji Teachers' Union; Fiji Ministry of Education; National Health and Medical Research Council Research Fellowship(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); University of the Sunshine Coast FAB Publication Completion Grant,"The authors are grateful to the students and staff of Yat-Sen Secondary School, Nadroga Arya College, Sangam Sadhu Kuppuswamy Memorial College and the youth and people of Drauniivi village (Ra).

The aim is twofold: (i) to introduce an innovative method that translates the complexity of water-related conflicts into a dialogical tool, aimed at enhancing social learning by adopting theatrical techniques; and (ii) to report the outcomes that emerged from the application of this method in Arborea, the main dairy cattle district and the only nitrate-vulnerable zone in Sardinia, to mediate contrasting positions between local entrepreneurs and representatives of the relevant institutions. We discuss our results in the light of four pillars, adopted as research lenses in the International research Project CADWAGO (Climate Change Adaptation and Water Governance), which consider the specific social-ecological components of the Arborea system, climate change adaptability in water governance institutions and organizations, systemic governance (relational) practices, and governance learning. The combination of the four CADWAGO pillars and La Rasgioni created an innovative dialogical space that enabled stakeholders and researchers to collectively identify barriers and opportunities for effective governance practices. Potential wider implications and applications of La Rasgioni process are also discussed in the paper.","[Ruiu, Maria Laura; Maurizi, Sante; Seddaiu, Giovanna; Roggero, Pier Paolo] Univ Sassari, Nucleo Ric Desertificaz, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Ruiu, Maria Laura] Northumbria Univ, Dept Social Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [Maurizi, Sante] Cinearena, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Sassu, Simone] Prosecutors Off Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Seddaiu, Giovanna; Roggero, Pier Paolo] Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Agr, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Zuin, Olga] Council Baltic Sea States Secretariat, Baltic Unit 2030, S-10311 Stockholm, Sweden; [Blackmore, Chris] Open Univ, Appl Syst Thinking Practice Grp, Sch Engn & Innovat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",University of Sassari; Northumbria University; University of Sassari; Open University - UK,"Ruiu, ML (corresponding author), Univ Sassari, Nucleo Ric Desertificaz, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.;Ruiu, ML (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Dept Social Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",marialauraruiu@gmail.com; maurizis@gmail.com; simonesassu@yahoo.it; gseddaiu@uniss.it; z-olga@hotmail.com; chris.blackmore@open.ac.uk; pproggero@uniss.it,"Ruiu, Maria Laura/AAK-7321-2020; Roggero, Pier Paolo/D-2580-2012","Ruiu, Maria Laura/0000-0003-1136-0389; Roggero, Pier Paolo/0000-0002-7269-4334","Climate Change Adaptation and Water Governance (CADWAGO) project from Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Volkswagen Stiftung; Compagnia di San Paolo through the Europe and Global Challenges program; Italian Ministry of Agricultural Food and Forestry Policies [D.M. 8608/7303/2008, D.M. 2660/7303/2012]",Climate Change Adaptation and Water Governance (CADWAGO) project from Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Volkswagen Stiftung(Volkswagen); Compagnia di San Paolo through the Europe and Global Challenges program(Compagnia di San Paolo); Italian Ministry of Agricultural Food and Forestry Policies,"We gratefully acknowledge funding for this work, as part of the Climate Change Adaptation and Water Governance (CADWAGO) project, from Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, the Volkswagen Stiftung, and Compagnia di San Paolo through the Europe and Global Challenges program.

This is, partly, because agricultural productivity in SSA is highly dependent on rainfall. Thus, the slightest variation in climatic conditions has the potential of subjecting a large proportion of the rural poor to increased poverty and misery as the ability to obtain their livelihoods can be compromised. Despite the effects of climate variability on rural livelihoods, the rural poor are not passive actors. They are actively and consistently involved in adapting and modifying their asset portfolios to reduce the impacts of climate variability, and consequently, build their adaptive capacity and resilience. Drawing on a recent field-based research conducted in the Delta State of Nigeria and using the participatory climate change adaptation appraisal, this paper discusses the various asset adaptation strategies employed by the rural poor in building their adaptive capacity and resilience to climate variability. These issues have been explored in the broader theoretical debates revolving around climate change adaptation and food security in countries of the developing South.","[Ebhuoma, Eromose] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Bernard Price Bldg, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Simatele, Danny] Univ Witwatersrand, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Ctr Water Res & Dev CiWaRD, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, P-B 1, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand,"Ebhuoma, E (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Bernard Price Bldg, Johannesburg, South Africa.",Eromose2012@yahoo.com; Danny.Simatele@wits.ac.za,"Simatele, Mulala Danny/AAS-9958-2020","Simatele, Mulala Danny/0000-0002-2161-1586",National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences-Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (NIHSS-CODESRIA),National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences-Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (NIHSS-CODESRIA),"This work was supported by the National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences-Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (NIHSS-CODESRIA).

This paper draws on a unique longitudinal dataset to measure progress in adaptation by local authorities in Britain, comparing results from a national-scale survey and follow-up interviews conducted in 2003 with a second wave of research completed a decade later. Whereas a decade ago local authority staff were unable to find scientific information that they could understand and use, we find that these technical-cognitive barriers to adaptation are no longer a major problem for local authority respondents. Thanks to considerable Government investment in research and science brokerage to improve the quality and accessibility of climate information, local authorities have developed their adaptive capacity, and their staff are now engaging with the 'right' kind of information in assessing climate change risks and opportunities. However, better knowledge has not translated into tangible adaptation actions. Local authorities face substantial difficulties in implementing adaptation plans. Budget cuts and a lack of political support from central government have sapped institutional capacity and political appetite to address long-term climate vulnerabilities, as local authorities in Britain now struggle even to deliver their immediate statutory responsibilities. Local authority adaptation has progressed farthest where it has been rebranded as resiliency to extreme weather so as to fit with the focus on immediate risks to delivering statutory duties. In the current political environment, adaptation officers need information about the economic costs of weather impacts to local authority services if they are to build the business case for adaptation and gain the leverage to secure resources and institutional license to implement tangible action. Unless these institutional barriers are addressed, local government is likely to struggle to adapt to a changing climate. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Attention was focused solely on humans. However, animals, including wildlife, livestock and pets, may also be impacted by climate change. Complementary to the high relevance of awareness rising for protecting humans against climate change, here we present a One Health approach, which aims at the simultaneous protection of humans, animals and the environment from climate change impacts (climate change adaptation). We postulate that integrated approaches save human and animal lives and reduce costs when compared to public and animal health sectors working separately. A One Health approach to climate change adaptation may significantly contribute to food security with emphasis on animal source foods, extensive livestock systems, particularly ruminant livestock, environmental sanitation, and steps towards regional and global integrated syndromic surveillance and response systems. The cost of outbreaks of emerging vector-borne zoonotic pathogens may be much lower if they are detected early in the vector or in livestock rather than later in humans. Therefore, integrated community-based surveillance of zoonoses is a promising avenue to reduce health effects of climate change.","[Zinsstag, Jakob; Crump, Lisa; Schelling, Esther; Hattendorf, Jan; Maidane, Yahya Osman; Ali, Kadra Osman; Muhummed, Abdifatah; Umer, Abdurezak Adem; Aliyi, Ferzua; Nooh, Faisal; Abdikadir, Mohammed Ibrahim; Ali, Seid Mohammed; Hartinger, Stella; Mausezahl, Daniel; Gonzalez de White, Monica Berger; Tschopp, Rea; Probst-Hensch, Nicole; Cisse, Gueladio] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Zinsstag, Jakob; Crump, Lisa; Schelling, Esther; Hattendorf, Jan; Maidane, Yahya Osman; Ali, Kadra Osman; Muhummed, Abdifatah; Umer, Abdurezak Adem; Aliyi, Ferzua; Nooh, Faisal; Abdikadir, Mohammed Ibrahim; Ali, Seid Mohammed; Hartinger, Stella; Mausezahl, Daniel; Gonzalez de White, Monica Berger; Tschopp, Rea; Probst-Hensch, Nicole; Cisse, Gueladio] Univ Basel, Peterspl 1, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Maidane, Yahya Osman; Ali, Kadra Osman; Muhummed, Abdifatah; Umer, Abdurezak Adem; Aliyi, Ferzua; Nooh, Faisal; Abdikadir, Mohammed Ibrahim; Ali, Seid Mohammed] Univ Jigjiga, Jigjiga Univ One Hlth Initiat, POB 1020, Jigjiga, Ethiopia; [Hartinger, Stella] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Publ Hlth Sch, Lima 15102, Peru; [Gonzalez de White, Monica Berger; Cordon-Rosales, Celia; Alvarez Castillo, Danilo; McCracken, John] Univ Valle Guatemala, Guatemala City 01015, Guatemala; [Abakar, Fayiz] Inst Rech Elevage Dev, BP 433, Ndjamena, Chad; [Cercamondi, Colin] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Emmenegger, Sandro; Maier, Edith] Univ Appl Sci, Inst Informat & Proc Management, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Karanja, Simon] Jomo Kenyatta Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Nairobi 00200, Kenya; [Bolon, Isabelle; de Castaneda, Rafael Ruiz] Univ Geneva, Inst Global Hlth, Fac Med, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland; [Bonfoh, Bassirou] Ctr Suisse Rech Sci Cote dIvoire, 01 BP 1303, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire; [Tschopp, Rea] Armauer Hansen Res Inst, POB 1005, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",University of Basel; Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute; University of Basel; Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia; Universidad del Valle de Guatemala; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology; University of Geneva,"Zinsstag, J (corresponding author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",jakob.zinsstag@swisstph.ch,"Schelling, Esther/K-7990-2015; Cissé, Guéladio/U-7235-2018; Umer, Abdurezak/ABC-1091-2021; Bolon, Isabelle/O-8676-2019; Hattendorf, Jan/F-5371-2010","Schelling, Esther/0000-0001-6444-0898; Cissé, Guéladio/0000-0002-6286-976X; Umer, Abdurezak/0000-0001-6806-5378; Bolon, Isabelle/0000-0001-5940-2731; Hattendorf, Jan/0000-0002-1176-401X; Zinsstag, Jakob/0000-0002-8899-6097; Nooh, Faisal/0000-0002-3176-3356; Cercamondi, Colin/0000-0002-8943-5216; Crump, Lisa/0000-0002-4406-0238; Muhummed, Abdifatah Muktar/0000-0002-1966-729X; Hartinger, Stella/0000-0003-3523-1725",Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation JOHI project; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation PADS project; Swiss National Science Foundation r4d project in Guatemala; Swiss Universities SUDAC-COFER program; Afrique One Aspire,Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation JOHI project; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation PADS project; Swiss National Science Foundation r4d project in Guatemala; Swiss Universities SUDAC-COFER program; Afrique One Aspire,"This work has been supported by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation JOHI and PADS projects, the Swiss National Science Foundation r4d project in Guatemala, the Swiss Universities SUDAC-COFER program and Afrique One Aspire.",,82,52,54,17,70,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0378-1097,1574-6968,,FEMS MICROBIOL LETT,FEMS Microbiol.

This study examined existing knowledge on anticipated biophysical changes and, through primary research (stakeholder interviews and social learning workshops), gauged the expected adaptive approaches of destination communities and the tourism sector to these changes for 2020, 2050 and 2070. The facilitated workshops generated a common set of adaptation strategies across a diverse set of tourist destinations. A key finding from the workshops is that the tourism sector is not yet ready to invest in climate change adaptation because of the perceived uncertainties. Ongoing leadership for such measures were seen to rest with the public sector, especially local authorities.

We found widespread belief in climate change (94.7 % of respondents), and no significant difference between current and future managers. Based on intended responses to climate-induced ecosystem changes, we distinguished four groups: highly sensitive managers (27.7 %), those mainly sensitive to changes in growth and regeneration processes (46.7 %), managers primarily sensitive to regeneration changes (11.2 %), and insensitive managers (14.4 %). Experiences and beliefs with regard to disturbance-related tree mortality were found to particularly influence a manager's sensitivity to climate change.

Debates on climate change advocate that urban areas not only contribute to climate change by emitting huge amounts of carbon-dioxide gas into the atmosphere, but also play a vital role in addressing climate change. This research investigates whether local urban planning policies in master plans target climate change mitigation and adaptation. Accordingly, this research undertook a qualitative content analysis of the policy framework of master plans that are involved in the sample and developed climate change mitigation indexes for all the sampled master plans by assessing urban policies against climate change mitigation evaluation protocols. This research significantly contributes to the field of urban planning and public policy by developing empirical evidence that analyzes the relationship between urban planning policies and climate change mitigation and adaptation. This research supports the use of master plans as an effective tool in mitigating and adapting to climate change and has an implication for mainstreaming climate change mitigation and adaptation in urban planning.","[Raparthi, Kiranmayi] Anna Univ, Sch Architecture & Planning, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",Anna University; Anna University Chennai,"Raparthi, K (corresponding author), Anna Univ, Sch Architecture & Planning, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",kiranmayiar@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,0,0,6,10,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",2254-2035,,,IBEROAM J DEV STUD,Iberoam.

At the same time there is a disconnect between knowledge and action on climate change. The salience of adaptation to climate change may be a precondition for action, but this issue has so far been neglected in the adaptation literature. This indicates a missing link between perception, values and world-views, on one side, and policy formation on the other. The article analyses how actors in three occupational groups in a natural resource dependent community in northern Norway perceive and respond to changes in weather and resource conditions, as well as projections for future climate. The results indicate that the need to adapt is perceived differently, if at all, amongst different actors. By drawing on concepts from governance literatures and cultural theory of risks (CTR), the paper seeks to explain this divergence in perceptions and responses amongst different actors, which can help policy-makers understand when and why autonomous actors are willing to adapt. We find that adaptation to climate change cannot readily be expected among actors who fit the individualist category of CTR, who do not directly utilize scientific knowledge when in their work.","[Dannevig, Halvor] Western Norway Res Inst, POB 183, Sogndal, Norway; [Hovelsrud, Grete K.] Univ Nordland, Nordland Res Inst, POB 1490, N-8049 Bodo, Norway",Nord University,"Dannevig, H (corresponding author), Western Norway Res Inst, POB 183, Sogndal, Norway.",hda@vestforsk.no,"Dannevig, Halvor/P-3477-2019","Dannevig, Halvor/0000-0002-7648-4166",Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"The research for this paper has been funded by the Norwegian Research Council through the CAVIAR project (2007-2010), the PLAN-project (2006-2010), the CAVIAR II project (2011-2014) and the PITCH-project (2014-2018).

This study maps 17 transnational city networks that primarily work on climate governance, assesses whether they formally embrace urban water management as a field of activity, and analyzes the extent to which they influence local climate action regarding water-related issues. Our descriptive analysis reveals that the great majority of transnational city networks has embraced goals related to urban water management, mostly framed from the perspective of adaptation to climate change.

It is projected that the changing climatic conditions in Germany and Thuringia in particular will lead to a higher frequency of drought events. Thus, it is vital to develop local adaptation strategies to mitigate the effects of droughts on agriculture to ensure future crop production. Water resource infrastructure has a critical role in planning future climate change adaptation measures that are sustainable. As the construction of new dams and reservoirs is controversial, it is preferable to use existing infrastructures, if they are suitable. Small-scale water management reservoirs built in Thuringia during the GDR (German Democratic Republic) and decommissioned after the German reunification were examined in this study to determine whether their reuse could be considered as a potential adaptation strategy. For this purpose, three reservoirs in Thuringia were selected. The impact of climate change on soil moisture, water availability and crop production, and the use of water from the reservoirs to meet future irrigation needs were modeled using the Water Evaluation and Planning system (WEAP). The modeled climatic changes have direct effects on the soil moisture status, leading to a higher water demand of the local agriculture. The results show that the crop water needs could double between near future (2020-2040) and distant future (2071-2100). However, predicted declines in yields can be mitigated by irrigation; modeling results indicate that supplemental irrigation with reservoir water mitigates projected losses and even allows 6.2-13.5% more crop production. Hence, the reuse of the reservoirs is worth to be considered as an adaptation strategy by policymakers. In addition to a cost-benefit analysis for future evaluation of the reservoirs, local user interests and demands need to be included avoiding conflicts about water. In general, WEAP as a modeling tool and the findings of the study show, that this research approach could be used to investigate the potential adaptive capacity of other small-scale water infrastructures.","[Heinzel, Christine; Hoellermann, Britta] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Bonn, Germany; [Fink, Manfred] Thuringer Fernwasserversorgung, Erfurt, Germany; [Hoellermann, Britta] Univ Osnabruck, Dept Geog, Osnabruck, Germany",University of Bonn; University Osnabruck,"Heinzel, C (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Bonn, Germany.",christine.heinzel@uni-bonn.de,"Hoellermann, Britta/AFU-1213-2022","Hoellermann, Britta/0000-0001-5545-3515",,,,,87,0,0,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9375,,FRONT WATER,Front.

Also, architect identity and contextual factors were more important in architects' sensemaking than features of the climate adaptation issue itself. Most important among the identity-related element of architects' sensemaking was the conception of architects' expertise as holistic-encompassing both aesthetic-creative and technical-craft-related dimensions.

However, the adaptation literature emphasizes that because the impacts of climate change and vulnerability are locally specific, adaptation is inevitably local. In this paper, in order to inform the design of institutions that can encourage and support effective local-level adaptation, the authors derive principles for their design theoretically and use a case study to explore how these principles could be practically implemented. Ten design principles are synthesized from principles derived from reviews of the literatures on local-level adaptation, usable science, and boundary organizations. Bringing these three literatures together highlights the characteristics of boundary organizations that make them particularly valuable for addressing the challenges of local-level adaptation. The case study then illustrates how an existing boundary organization, The University of Arizona Cooperative Extension, of the U.S. Cooperative Extension System (CES), implements these principles in its organizational structure and in the daily practice of Extension professionals. It also highlights the significance of the CES's existing social networks and social capital for facilitating their implementation. From the case study it is concluded that the CES is uniquely positioned to serve an important role in a national adaptation strategy for the United States in supporting local-level adaptation in urban and rural communities across the country.","[Brugger, Julie] Univ Arizona, Inst Environm, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Crimmins, Michael] Univ Arizona, Dept Soil Water & Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Brugger, J (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Inst Environm, 715 North Pk Ave,POB 210156, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.",julieb@uw.edu,,,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Program Office [NA07OAR4310382]; U.S. Global Change Research Program's National Climate Assessment,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); U.S. Global Change Research Program's National Climate Assessment,The authors would like to thank the UACE faculty members who participated in this research.

The RCM results suggest an increase in mean annual temperature, averaged over the Ganges basin, in the range 1-4 degrees C over the period from 2000 to 2050, using the SRES A1B forcing scenario. Projections of precipitation indicate that natural variability dominates the climate change signal and there is considerable uncertainty concerning change in regional annual mean precipitation by 2050. The RCMs do suggest an increase in annual mean precipitation in this region to 2050, but lack significant trend. Glaciers in headwater tributary basins of the Ganges appear to be continuing to decline but it is not clear whether meltwater runoff continues to increase. The predicted changes in precipitation and temperature will probably not lead to significant increase in water availability to 2050, but the timing of runoff from snowmelt will likely occur earlier in spring and summer. Water availability is subject to decadal variability, with much uncertainty in the contribution from climate change. Although global social-economic scenarios show trends to urbanization, locally these trends are less evident and in some districts rural population is increasing. Falling ground-water levels in the Ganges plain may prevent expansion of irrigated areas for food supply. Changes in socio-economic development in combination with projected changes in timing of runoff outside the monsoon period will make difficult choices for water managers. Because of the uncertainty in future water availability trends, decreasing vulnerability by augmenting resilience is the preferred way to adapt to climate change. Adaptive policies are required to increase society's capacity to adapt to both anticipated and unanticipated conditions. Integrated solutions are needed, consistent at various spatial scales, to assure robust and sustainable future use of resources. For water resources this is at the river basin scale. At present adaptation measures in India are planned at national and state level, not taking into account the physical boundaries of water systems. To increase resilience adaptation plans should be made locally specific. However, as it is expected that the partitioning of water over the different sectors and regions will be the biggest constraint, a consistent water use plan at catchment and river basin scale may be the best solution. A policy enabling such river basin planning is essential. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This indicates that crop insurance may have an unintended crowding-out effect as an option of risk management and may inhibit societies' long-run capacity to adapt to climate change.","[Miao, Ruiqing] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Miao, RQ (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",miaorong@auburn.edu,,"Miao, Ruiqing/0000-0003-2936-6105","NIFA, USDA","NIFA, USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","I thank Colin Cameron, Gregory Graff, Jason Murray, Denis Nadolnyak, Michael Roberts, Jian Rong, Aditi Sengupta, Gilad Sorek, Henry Thompson, Pravin Trivedi, and seminar participants at Auburn University, Colorado State University, University of Georgia, the 15th Occasional Workshop in Environmental and Resource Economics, the 1st CHESS Workshop on Coupled Human-Earth System Solutions for Global Sustainability, the 2017 Annual Meeting of SCC-76, the 74th Professional Agricultural Workers Conference, and the sponsored session Adaptation to Climate in the 5th Annual Association of Environmental and Resource Economists Summer Conference for useful comments.

As the frequency and severity of extreme weather events increases, the impacts on both natural and human systems are becoming difficult to manage with the current policies. In Canada, one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change is the Arctic, where temperatures are rising at a rate two to three times that of the global average. Warmer seasonal temperatures have led to melting permafrost and increased variability in sea ice conditions, which has contributed to a rise in coastal erosion. The ongoing resilience of Arctic communities will depend heavily on their ability to implement successful long-term adaptation policies. The development and implementation of any action on climate change adaptation should involve collaboration with local stakeholders in order to reflect the views and experience of those living in the Arctic.","[MacDonald, Seghan; Birchall, S.

Case studies frequently document positive results. Systematic assessment of processes can provide important benefits, including justification for action and expenditures, promotion of learning and adaptive management, accountability, and ensuring fit with other goals. There are very few such assessments in the context of climate adaptation planning, despite of the emphasis on the development and use of planning tools by federal and state agencies, university researchers, and non-profit organizations. We undertook an effort to assess the outcomes resulting from fourteen applications of the Vulnerability, Consequences, and Adaptation Planning Scenarios (VCAPS) process, which we helped develop and implement. VCAPS is designed to facilitate information exchange, co-production of knowledge, and stakeholder collaboration while helping communities appraise climate change-related risks and devise strategies to manage them. Using qualitative interviews we explored the perceived value and the measurable performance outcomes of VCAPS at both individual and community scales occurring 3-10 years after the processes were conducted, allowing participants to take a broader view of success and reflect on how different forms of success emerged over time. Although the assessment of each case is based on a small number of interviews, we learned that VCAPS informed plans and decisions of municipalities, informed actions and decisions of other public and private actors, generated broader support for subsequent actions, helped efforts to secure/seek funding for climate adaptation actions, developed material resources to support planning, and promoted learning among participants. This assessment also reinforces prior work showing that deliberative planning tools/processes are conducive to developing adaptive capacities; processes should be closely coordinated with regular governance activities to impact policy and action; adequate time for deliberation needs to be budgeted; participants need support to think outside the box and consider adaptation strategies that are both incremental and transformational as well as highlight potential undesirable consequences of adaptation; and processes, like VCAPS, produce actionable outcomes when participants agree on the immediacy of the issue. We conclude with observations about the need for evaluation of participatory processes and the challenges of defining success of tools to support municipal climate change adaptation planning.","[Tuler, Seth P.] Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Integrat & Global Studies, Worcester, MA 01609 USA; [Dow, K.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Geog, Callcott Bldg,709 Bull St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Webler, T.] Keene State Coll, Dept Environm Studies, 229 Main St, Keene, NH 03431 USA",Worcester Polytechnic Institute; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University System Of New Hampshire; Keene State College,"Tuler, SP (corresponding author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Integrat & Global Studies, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.",STuler@wpi.edu; KDow@sc.edu; Thomas.webler@keene.edu,"Webler, Thomas/ABE-3201-2021",,"NOAA [NA160AR4310163, NA090AR4310151, NA120AR4310106, NA15NOS4190165, NA100AR4170098, NA130AR4170151]; MIT Sea Grant, Massachusetts Institute of Technology [NA100AR4170086]; North Carolina Sea Grant, North Carolina State University [NA140AR4170073]; Alabama and Mississippi Sea Grant Program; Mobile Bay National Estuary Program","NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); MIT Sea Grant, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; North Carolina Sea Grant, North Carolina State University; Alabama and Mississippi Sea Grant Program; Mobile Bay National Estuary Program","We would like to acknowledge the many colleagues and community members who have participated in VCAPS processes with us.

It specifically investigates the Integrating Climate Change Risks into Resilient Island Planning in the Maldives Program, or ICCR, a four-year $9.3 million adaptation project being funded by the Least Developed Countries Fund, Maldivian Government and the United Nations Development Program, and nationally executed by the Ministry of Housing, Transport and Environment of the Maldivian Government. The article asks: what is the perception of coastal adaptation in the Maldives, and what are the potential contributions from the ICCR project? To answer this question, the article summarizes eight primary sectors vulnerable to climate change in the Maldives: human settlements, critical infrastructure, tourism, fisheries, health systems, water, food security, and coral reef biodiversity. It then describes the genesis and background behind the ICCR, which addresses many of these vulnerabilities by demonstrating coastal protection measures. Benefits to the ICCR include improving physical resilience by deploying soft infrastructure, institutional resilience by training policymakers and enhancing good governance, and community resilience by strengthening community assets and awareness. Challenges include ensuring that adaptation efforts are enough to truly respond to climate vulnerability, lack of coordination, and short-term thinking among business and community leaders.","Vermont Law Sch, Inst Energy & Environm, S Royalton, VT 05068 USA",,"Sovacool, BK (corresponding author), Vermont Law Sch, Inst Energy & Environm, POB 96,164 Chelsea St, S Royalton, VT 05068 USA.",Bsovacool@vermontlaw.edu,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403",,,,,33,52,53,6,178,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

This paper analyses how mid-twentieth-century planning discourses regarding Cold War urban dispersal in the USA might help us understand contemporary conversations about urban climate change adaptation. We apply Kingdon's Multiple Streams Analysis and his concept of policy entrepreneurs to show how planners frame problems and shape policy agendas. We propose a subtype of design-policy entrepreneurs' who use the spatial and visual tools of planning and design to advocate for preferred policies. By analysing the rhetoric and visual representations made by planners and designers from 1945 to 1965, we examine how they repurposed long-standing ideas about urban deconcentration into dispersal for defence' proposals. Such proposals for dispersing urban settlements into separated and self-contained' units received a dysfunctional partial acceptance: housing and transportation legislation embraced the dispersal part but resisted the complementary elements aimed at limiting damages from nuclear attack by concentrating development into distinct nodes. We conclude by asking how the perils of such partial policy-making success might play out on the terrain of climate change adaptation.","[Lamb, Zachary; Vale, Lawrence J.] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Vale, LJ (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",ljvale@mit.edu,,,,,,,88,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0266-5433,1466-4518,,PLAN PERSPECT,Plan.

Festinger's theory of Cognitive Dissonance helps understand the constraints to the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies. For this purpose, a survey was applied to explore the relationship between the perception, attitude, and behavior of beekeepers in the face of climate change in Mexican territory. It was noted that: 1) Beekeepers identified climate change as the main problem for beekeeping; 2) They exhibit dissonance between their attitude and their behavior regarding adaptation strategies, and 3) Cognitive dissonance is reduced through justifications for their behavior. Thus, the present state of dissonance is a limitation for adopting climate change adaptation actions, evidencing the need to modify the behavior of beekeepers, through training to inform and explain the nature of climate change and its impacts; to place the beekeepers within this context, where they can contribute technical elements that may allow them to reorient their work, promoting an objective and constructive perception, which will generate a positive attitude in the face of the challenges that climate change represents, so that they may modify their behavior as much as necessary in order to keep the activity profitable in Mexico.","[Gallardo-Lopez, Felipe; Perez-Vazquez, Arturo; Landeros-Sanchez, Cesareo] Colegio Postgrad, Campus Veracruz, Manlio Fabio Altamirano, Veracruz, Mexico; [Patricia Castellanos-Potenciano, Blanca] Inst Nacl Invest Forestales Agr & Pecuarias, Ctr Invest Reg Pacifico Sur, Valles Centrales De Oaxa, Mexico; [Diaz-Padilla, Gabriel] Inst Nacl Invest Forestales Agr & Pecuarias, Ctr Invest Reg Golfo Ctr, Teocelo, Veracruz, Mexico; [Sol-Sanchez, Angel] Colegio Postgrad, Campus Tabasco, Cardenas, Tabasco, Mexico",Colegio de Postgraduados - Mexico; Colegio de Postgraduados - Mexico,"Castellanos-Potenciano, BP (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Invest Forestales Agr & Pecuarias, Ctr Invest Reg Pacifico Sur, Valles Centrales De Oaxa, Mexico.",castellanos.blanca@inifap.gob.mx,"Sol Sánchez, Angel/AAT-5173-2020","Sol Sánchez, Angel/0000-0001-9138-641X",,,,,30,0,0,5,12,INIFAP-CENID PARASITOLOGIA VETERINARIA,JIUTEPEC C P,"CARRETERA FEDERAL CUERNAVACA-CUAUTIA NO 8534, COL PROGRESSO, JIUTEPEC C P, 06300 D F, MEXICO",2007-1124,2448-6698,,REV MEX CIENC PECU,Rev.

This study examines the question: how do networked organisations build capacity for anticipatory governance through project-based interactions? We analyse a global network of organisations that mobilise climate and hydrological modelling technologies into the Chao Phraya and Ayeyarwaddy deltas. The methodology innovatively combines ethnographic data with policy analysis and social network analysis. Findings suggest that organisations consolidate technology and knowledge transfer through a global network. However, their governance effect in enhancing anticipatory decision making is found to be marginal at the local level. We argue that anticipatory governance practices need a balancing of foresight tools and techniques with local institutional arrangements in order to be effective. We further demonstrate that technology transfer projects need to be backed up with social and strategic capacity building in order to nurture consistent anticipatory governance in different cultural contexts. We conclude that preventive actions, together with transparent operational response frameworks, could significantly improve resilience and adaptability of local knowledge systems and institutions dealing with climate change adaptation. Such integration could enable anticipatory response measures to better manage risk, as well as increase institutional cooperation for long term environmental planning.","[Croxatto, Lucas Somavilla; Hogendoorn, Daniel; Petersen, Arthur C.] UCL, Dept Sci Technol Engn & Publ Policy STEaPP, Euston House,8th Floor,,24 Eversholt St, London NW1 1BS, England",University of London; University College London,"Croxatto, LS (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Sci Technol Engn & Publ Policy STEaPP, Euston House,8th Floor,,24 Eversholt St, London NW1 1BS, England.",lucas.somavilla@ucl.ac.uk,"Petersen, Arthur C/B-7198-2009","Petersen, Arthur C/0000-0003-0706-5635; Croxatto, Lucas Somavilla/0000-0003-3995-0241",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) of the United Kingdom [ES/N018834/1]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [464-15-086]; ESRC [ES/N018834/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) of the United Kingdom(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors would like to thank the participants in the project and the research team.

Climigration refers to community relocation undertaken in response to climate change impacts. This paper adds to early but critical scholarly discussions by providing a land-use planning framework for organising and responding to the governance, policy, institutional and cultural implications of climigration. This paper argues that land-use planning will be increasingly required to manage climigration events over the coming decades and will rely on input and guidance from other disciplines to do so effectively. Climigration is conceptualised as an end-point of climate change adaptation in this paper. Empirical content derives from a multidisciplinary systematic quantitative literature review of international case studies of community relocations. Planning factors with critical, moderate or negligible influences on relocation success are synthesised. These are linked to the roles and functions of land-use planning systems to provide a framework for approaching climigration. The paper provides three interlinked conclusions. The first is that spatial planning systems have potential and capacity to respond to climigration as an extreme form of climate change adaptation. The second is that anticipatory policy frameworks offer the greatest advantages for successful climigration planning. The third conclusion is that maladaptation is a potential but avoidable threat connected to climigration planning.","[Matthews, Tony] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Potts, Ruth] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning Sci & Engn, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales",Griffith University; Cardiff University,"Matthews, T (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",t.matthews@griffith.edu.au; pottsr1@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Matthews, Tony/0000-0003-0838-5462",,,,,44,10,10,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The ice stupa intertwines ambitious goals for environmental management and economic development with social, cultural, and religious values and practices. Early design prototypes appeared to offer a host of social, economic, and environmental benefits to the community of Phyang. Additional contextual considerations and unexpected challenges surfaced later, providing a more nuanced evaluation of the ice stupa as a design strategy. Today, ice stupa adherents aspire to harness a constellation of integrative co-benefits in project prototypes and to demonstrate the broader value of the design to other communities. Beyond simply addressing a discrete environmental adaptation in Ladakh, the ice stupa project highlights the tensions and possibilities in novel design partnerships and the challenge of producing integrated climate adaptive projects.","[Clouse, Carey] Univ Massachusetts, Architecture & Landscape Architecture, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Clouse, C (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Architecture & Landscape Architecture, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,12,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0277-2426,1553-2704,,LANDSC J,Landsc.

While debates continue over how to mitigate emissions, it is evident that many parts of the world will need to adapt to an increasingly unstable climate. However, the persistence of climate denial presents a significant barrier to climate change response; if a future in which the climate has dramatically changed cannot be imagined, there is little motivation to act. Using qualitative interview data, our research investigates community responses to climate change adaptation planning in a coastal region of Australia identified as highly vulnerable to future sea level rise. While the local council engaged in extensive consultation to develop an adaptation plan, community opposition to proposed development changes ultimately resulted in a 'wait and see' response. We show how the community's local understandings of place informed temporalities that led to a practice of climate denial. We outline three processes by which climate denial is socially organised: anchoring the past via historical reference; projecting continuity through a nostalgic lens of managing disaster; and enclosing the present by prioritising existing economic value. We show how these processes result in the social organisation of climate denial, and an inability to plan for a climate changed future.","[Bowden, Vanessa; Nyberg, Daniel] Univ Newcastle, Business Sch, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Wright, Christopher] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Newcastle; University of Sydney,"Wright, C (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",christopher.wright@sydney.edu.au,"Nyberg, Daniel/ABE-2371-2021","Nyberg, Daniel/0000-0002-7144-1343; Bowden, Vanessa/0000-0002-6642-2826; Wright, Christopher/0000-0001-8624-9605",University of Sydney Business School; Sydney Environment Institute,University of Sydney Business School; Sydney Environment Institute,Funding for this research was provided by the University of Sydney Business School and the Sydney Environment Institute.,,57,20,20,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

Discourse can also be de-scribed; the script unpicked to reveal the contingency of what it includes and excludes. The discourse of adaptation to climate change is one such description. This article uses critical discourse analysis to describe and de-scribe the discourse of adaptation as (re)produced through one UK Climate Impacts Programme report. It identifies within the report a core, techno-scientific problematization of adaptation and a series of supplementary moments that are in ontological and epistemological tension with the core problematization, particularly regarding the conceptualization of knowledge and uncertainty, actors and agency, and the practices and politics that are understood to constitute adaptation. This tension is used to de-scribe the discourse; the supplementary moments highlight the limits of the core problematization, revealing points of extension or departure for the discourse. This is particularly apparent when these moments are articulated together into a supplementary, socio-systemic problematization. This demonstrates significant conceptual resonances with systems and complexity-based accounts of adaptation, including the discourse of sustainable adaptation, all of which offer further discursive resources for the extension or replacement of the discourse as produced in the report.","Univ Lancaster, Div Geog, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",Lancaster University,"Oppermann, E (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Div Geog, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",e.oppermann@lancaster.ac.uk,"Oppermann, Elspeth/N-2181-2013","Oppermann, Elspeth/0000-0001-9775-8763",Natural Environment Research Council [ceh010010] Funding Source: researchfish,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,46,28,28,0,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

However, each field does so through different actors and institutions, andwith different time horizons, policy frameworks and patterns inmind. Recently, dialogue between the adaptation and disaster risk-reduction communities has focused on creating stronger links between the two by putting greater effort into learning from each other and collaborating conceptually and practically. In part, this common interest has come from a simultaneous recognition that risk reduction requires a farmore holistic approach than has previously been applied. Both adaptation and disaster risk reduction require the same underlying aims, namely, to reduce vulnerability and create sustainable and flexible long-term strategies to reduce the risk of adverse impacts. However, neither is able to address these single-handedly. In both adaptation and disaster risk reduction, there is an implicit acknowledgement that risk is part of everyday life, and thus social development plays a vital role. An outstanding question for these communities to address is whether a convergence of the two tracks is desirable. Furthermore, if such a convergence were to occur, what forms would it take and what outcomes could be expected.","254 Chulalongkorn Univ, Stockholm Environm Inst, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University,"Schipper, ELF (corresponding author), 254 Chulalongkorn Univ, Stockholm Environm Inst, 15th Floor,Witthyakit Bldg,Chulalongkorn Soi 64,P, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",lisa.schipper@sei.se,"Schipper, Emma Lisa F/D-3050-2016; Schipper, Emma Lisa/O-1352-2019","Schipper, Emma Lisa F/0000-0001-6228-9178; Schipper, Emma Lisa/0000-0001-6228-9178",,,,,28,83,84,1,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Women are disempowered in rural households. This affects household's adaptive capacity to climate change negatively. Household survey, focus group discussion, key informant interview and workshop were used to track stake-holders'opinions on gender disparity in agriculture and policy issues. The objective of the study was to assess the gender parity index in agriculture, resource governance patterns and how these impact the capacity to climate change adaptation. The results show wives were imparity with their husbands. The parity gap on ownership, access to, and decision-making power over agricultural equipment was as wide as 59% and this affects women's adaptation capacity to climate change impacts. Indeed, 94% of the coupled households have got their land by redistribution and inheritance land acquisition forms by which both forms of acquiring land favored the husband. Half of the respondent households acknowledged that they have already acquired certification for their farmlands. However, the certification was mostly given by the names of husbands and in few cases by both. Certification of farmlands by the name of a wife and a husband has built confidence on ownership and manage their farmlands. This has helped a household to better adapt climate change impacts. Gender disparity in agricultural productive resources combined with policy and cultural distortions could exacerbate household's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. This indicates the need for gender mainstreaming in climate change policy reforms and formulation so as to empower women and build their adaptive capacity.","[Mekonnen, Zenebe] Ethiopian Environm & Forest Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",,"Mekonnen, Z (corresponding author), Ethiopian Environm & Forest Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",zenebemg2014@gmail.com,"Mekonnen, Zenebe/CAG-3033-2022",,"Ethiopian Environment and Forest Research Institute (EEFRI); African Forest Forum (AFF), Kenya","Ethiopian Environment and Forest Research Institute (EEFRI); African Forest Forum (AFF), Kenya","This work was supported by Ethiopian Environment and Forest Research Institute (EEFRI) and the African Forest Forum (AFF), Kenya.",,84,2,2,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,FEB,2022,8,2,,,,,,,e08908,10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08908,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08908,,FEB 2022,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,ZQ6PR,35198773,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000767225100073,View Full Record in Web of Science

Semi-structured qualitative interviews with informal settlement households (n = 57) and institutional representatives (n = 26) were used to identify informal modes of resilience, with secondary analysis of institutional projects and spatially-differentiated socio-economic data being integrated with these primary datasets. Findings demonstrate important distinctions in sub-city scales of resilience relating to values and equity within socio-ecological resilience research that have not been extensively studied to date. These case study observations have implications for understandings of 'core' systems functions, which are critical for planning communities when conceptualising resilience at a metropolitan level. Sub-city analysis also highlights aspects of urban resilience not previously identified in practice elsewhere, with informal maintenance of ecosystem services, use of kinship and familial networks, and translocation of traditional knowledge providing opportunities for enhancing urban climate change adaptation and climate resilient development initiatives.","[Trundle, Alexei] Univ Melbourne, Australian German Climate & Energy Coll, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Trundle, Alexei] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Trundle, A (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Design, Melbourne Sustainable Soc Inst, Level 3,Bldg 133,Masson Rd, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",alexei.trundle@unimelb.edu.au,"Trundle, Alexei/D-5762-2018","Trundle, Alexei/0000-0002-7076-4626","University of Melbourne's Faculty of Architecture, Building, and Planning; Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute; Australian-German Climate Energy College","University of Melbourne's Faculty of Architecture, Building, and Planning; Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute; Australian-German Climate Energy College","The author wishes to acknowledge the community members and organisational representatives in Port Vila and Honiara that contributed their time and expertise to take part in this research.

Fortunately, a growing body of literature-much of it dealing with climate change adaptation-has emerged which can help address these challenges. This narrative review of academic and grey literature reviews various monitoring and evaluation methods that can assess the inputs, processes, outputs, outcomes, and impacts that result from climate resilience planning and action. Since there is no commonly accepted monitoring and evaluation approach, the literature stresses the importance of acknowledging the context in which resilience is being evaluated, in order to ensure that appropriate methods are chosen. This context includes the ways that the resilience framework and definition chosen for a project constrain and determine the monitoring and evaluation approaches which can be adopted. As a result of this, a blend of quantitative and qualitative approaches is often recommended, with sufficient evidence suggesting that qualitative approaches (e.g., outcome harvesting) are essential. Nuanced approaches to monitoring and evaluation give evaluators additional means of reporting progress, and of demonstrating success, which is especially important as cities begin to implement resilience initiatives in the coming years.","[Brown, Craig] Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Enterprise & Dev, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Shaker, Richard R.] Ryerson Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Das, Runa] Ryerson Univ, Environm Appl Sci & Management, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada",University of Waterloo; Toronto Metropolitan University; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Brown, C (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Enterprise & Dev, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",craig.brown@uwaterloo.ca; rshaker@ryerson.ca; rras@ryerson.ca,,"Das, Runa/0000-0002-0692-5253; Brown, Craig/0000-0003-1140-306X",,,,,89,27,27,7,81,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

The survey comprised 15 questions assessing national progress on CCA for public health and the effects of various institutional, economic/financial, technical and sociopolitical barriers on national adaptive capacity. Findings Survey responses from 11 countries indicated that national commitments to CCA for public health have increased markedly since prior assessments but significant shortcomings remain. The largest apparent barriers to progress in this domain were poor government coordination, lack of political will and inadequate adaptation finances. Originality/value This study is unique in relation to the prior literature on the topic in that it effectively captures an array of country-specific yet cross-cutting adaptation constraints across diverse national contexts.

Their livelihoods and coffee production are facing major challenges due to projected climate change, requiring adaptation decisions that may range from changes in management practices to changes in crops or migration. Since management practices such as shade use and reforestation influence both climate vulnerability and carbon stocks in coffee, there may be synergies between climate change adaptation and mitigation that could make it advantageous to jointly pursue both objectives. In some cases, carbon accounting for mitigation actions might even be used to incentivize and subsidize adaptation actions. To assess potential synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation in smallholder coffee production systems, we quantified (i) the potential of changes in coffee production and processing practices as well as other livelihood activities to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, (ii) coffee farmers' climate change vulnerability and need for adaptation, including the possibility of carbon markets subsidizing adaptation. We worked with smallholder organic coffee farmers in Northern Nicaragua, using workshops, interviews, farm visits and the Cool Farm Tool software to calculate greenhouse gas balances of coffee farms. From the 12 activities found to be relevant for adaptation, two showed strong and five showed modest synergies with mitigation. Afforestation of degraded areas with coffee agroforestry systems and boundary tree plantings resulted in the highest synergies between adaptation and mitigation. Financing possibilities for joint adaptation-mitigation activities could arise through carbon offsetting, carbon insetting, and carbon footprint reductions. Non-monetary benefits such as technical assistance and capacity building could be effective in promoting such synergies at low transaction costs.","[Rahn, Eric] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Cali 6713, Colombia; [Laederach, Peter; Baca, Maria] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Managua, Nicaragua; [Cressy, Charlotte] Flo Cert, Bonn, Germany; [Malin, Daniella] Sustainable Food Lab, Hartland, VT USA; [van Rikxoort, Henk] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr WUR, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Shriver, Jefferson] Catholic Relief Serv, Managua, Nicaragua",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Wageningen University & Research,"Rahn, E (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol EAWAG, Dubendorf, Switzerland.",rahn_eric@yahoo.com; p.laderach@cgiar.org; m.g.baca@cgiar.org; c.cressy@flo-cert.net; Goetz.schroth@gmail.com; daniella@sustainablefood.org; henk.vanrikxoort@gmail.com; Jefferson.shriver@crs.org,,,Green Mountain Coffee Roasters,Green Mountain Coffee Roasters,"This research was conducted under the CGIAR research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

Urban planning to minimise adverse impacts of climate change at the city level can establish a climate-resilient city. Mitigation strategies to reduce CO2 emissions would lead to a climate-friendly city. Integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation into sustainable city planning should not be merely added as a single level of sustainable city planning, but requires a wide range of multi-level cooperation. Lijiang City has experienced climatic change during the last half century, and its CO2 emissions have increased faster than the GDP growth. Nearby glaciers on Yulong Snow Mountain have been retreating and losing mass since the early twentieth century. In this paper, we identify economic sectors that are vulnerable to climate change, including tourism, agriculture and water supply, and propose mitigation and adaptation strategies to cope with climate change in this tourism city. As energy use is the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energy has enormous CO2 reduction potential. Land use practices, a sectoral approach and public participation are all considered adaptive in climate planning. The proposals outlined are valuable as they provide an understanding of how to implement integrated climate planning and integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation into sustainable city planning.","[Xiao, Lishan; Li, Xinhu; Wang, Run] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Lishan; Li, Xinhu; Wang, Run] Xiamen Key Lab Urban Metab, Xiamen, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS","Wang, R (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",rwang@iue.ac.cn,"CAS, KLUEH/T-5743-2019; Wang, Run/GXZ-5369-2022; Li, Xinhu/A-1479-2011; Li, Xinhu/AAS-6125-2020","Wang, Run/0000-0002-7054-5650; Li, Xinhu/0000-0003-0920-6673; Xiao, Lishan/0000-0001-7090-4599","Chinese Academy of Sciences [08I4071D10, D-2009-02, KZCX2-YW-450-1]",Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),This research was supported by One Hundred Talents Program and Innovation Projects of Chinese Academy of Sciences (08I4071D10; D-2009-02; KZCX2-YW-450-1).

In this paper, the authors offer a cultural evolutionary perspective, where these terms are mapped onto the terminology of triple-inheritance theory, which clarifies how risks arise through the complex interplay of social and ecological feedbacks. Studies of past risk, vulnerability and resilience are often conducted within a historical ecological framework. As both ecological (synchronic) and evolutionary (diachronic) understandings of human culture ultimately derive from the same source of inspiration - Darwinian evolutionary theory - they are, the authors argue, readily integrated. They take steps towards such an integration, which not only offers a unified theoretical and conceptual framework for studies of past and present vulnerability and resilience, but also provides explicit mechanisms for how issues of future vulnerability and resilience can be approached.","[Brewer, Joe] Oregon Res Inst Community & Evaluat Serv, Ctr Appl Cultural Evolut, Eugene, OR USA; [Riede, Felix] Aarhus Univ Moesgard, Dept Archaeol & Heritage Studies, LAPADIS Lab Disaster Sci, Moesgard Alle 20, DK-8270 Hojbjerg, Denmark",,"Riede, F (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ Moesgard, Dept Archaeol & Heritage Studies, LAPADIS Lab Disaster Sci, Moesgard Alle 20, DK-8270 Hojbjerg, Denmark.",f.riede@cas.au.dk,"Riede, Felix/N-5990-2019","Riede, Felix/0000-0002-4879-7157",Det Frie Forskningsrad [6107-00059B],Det Frie Forskningsrad(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),This work was supported by the Det Frie Forskningsrad [6107-00059B].,,101,13,13,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0043-8243,1470-1375,,WORLD ARCHAEOL,World Archaeol.,AUG 8,2018,50,4,,,SI,,554,569,,10.1080/00438243.2018.1527246,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00438243.2018.1527246,,,16,Archaeology,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Archaeology,IG2JE,,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000473622300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Within this body of knowledge, two omissions are notable: first, while adaptation and coping responses of agricultural communities to climate variability and extremes are discussed extensively in rural planning, pastoral and agro-pastoral communities are neglected, homogenized, or considered ancillary to sedentarized agriculture. The mechanisms used by these communities to confront socio-economic and institutional limitations to climate adaptation remain relatively unexamined. Second, not much is known about pastoral women's perceptions of climate adaptation and coping. This article examines the socially situated perspective of women in the Maldhari pastoral community in Gujarat, Western India. Findings reveal that climate adaptation pathways traditionally utilized by the Maldharis are constrained by the institutional, policy and social context in which the community is placed, with specific impacts on women. The lack of recourse to traditional adaptation pathways in the face of climate vulnerability triggers coping responses for survival, livelihoods and food security, which produce gendered burdens especially in terms of women's work. Local perspectives thus shed light on how constraints to climate adaptation impact women in marginalized pastoral communities.","[Ramnarain, Smita] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Econ, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",University of Rhode Island,"Ramnarain, S (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Econ, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",kalpanasa@gmail.com; sramnarain@uri.edu,,"Ramnarain, Smita/0000-0003-1487-8415","Pre-dissertation Travel Award (2010) from the Climate and Social Policy at Rutgers University, USA; Research Travel Award Competition (2010) from the South Asia Studies Program at Rutgers University, USA; Research Travel Award Competition (2012) from the South Asia Studies Program at Rutgers University, USA","Pre-dissertation Travel Award (2010) from the Climate and Social Policy at Rutgers University, USA; Research Travel Award Competition (2010) from the South Asia Studies Program at Rutgers University, USA; Research Travel Award Competition (2012) from the South Asia Studies Program at Rutgers University, USA","This article is based on PhD dissertation field research by Kalpana Venkatasubramanian.

We propose a synthesised framework that can be used to either inform or analyse the practice of RSD, then examine an Australia-wide program that was designed to link research with strategic regional planning for climate change adaptation in natural resource management. Cross scale lessons from this endeavour at national (program), and regional (project) scales suggest that framing RSD in opposition to linear or deficit approaches that hinge on delivery of scientific information presents an incomplete view. RSD engages with pre-existing institutionalised practices and understandings and in doing so changes both the supply (research) and demand (policy/practice) side. In the case examined here, scientific information products were initially prioritised by funders over processes for collective knowledge generation. However a widely aclmowledged need for capacity building and co-creation ultimately informed project activities. We argue that in taking RSD seriously, programs and projects will often need to actively shift their focus from the delivery of information products towards prioritising less visible processes and outcomes. Combined process- and outcome-orientation, in turn, must pay attention to expert legitimization, and how knowledge can have a bearing on (and potentially change) established institutions and practices of decision-making.","[Leith, Peat] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Private Bag 98, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Warman, Russell; Harwood, Andrew] Univ Tasmania, Sch Technol Environm & Design, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Bosomworth, Karyn] RMIT, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Wallis, Phillip] Victorian Catchment Management Council, East Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Leith, P (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Private Bag 98, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia.",peat.leith@utas.edu.au,"Leith, Peat/ABB-2829-2021; Warman, Russell/AAH-7126-2020; Bosomworth, Karyn/A-6435-2016","Bosomworth, Karyn/0000-0001-9907-0858; Warman, Russell/0000-0002-9802-8604",,,,,37,14,14,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Maria D.",,,Agroecological Practices as a Climate Change Adaptation Mechanism in Four Highland Communities in Ecuador,JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; gender; agroecology; Ecuador,AGRICULTURE; GENDER,"Recently, public programs in highland Ecuador have promoted agroecology as an adaptation mechanism to climate change. Agroecology has been well studied in terms of its ability to increase food sovereignty, agricultural productivity, and community well-being. The effects of agroecological practices on environmental and socioeconomic conditions, however, have received little attention. This paper examines the different experiences of men and women in several Andean communities in Pedro Moncayo, Ecuador, focusing on their reaction to the changes seen in their communities due to the use of agroecological practices. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, this study shows that agroecology is a meaningful intervention for these communities. Farmers perceive agroecological practices as culturally relevant approaches to agriculture that respond to a variety of specific environmental concerns. Agroecology also challenges the gendered dimensions of traditional agriculture in highland Ecuador, providing women with a welcome mechanism to ensure the health of their families as well as their own personal development. The possibility of generating and controlling income has improved self-esteem in women, while also empowering them to make decisions inside the family, participate in community organizations, and assume leadership roles. This transition of women from private to public spaces is a major step toward gender equality, and it simultaneously indicates that adaptive capacity to climate change has increased. The study thus concludes that a meaningful program to improve climate change adaptation also has the potential to challenge traditional gender inequities and improve socioeconomic conditions for rural communities.","[Caceres-Arteaga, Natali] Univ Cent Ecuador, Quito, Ecuador; [Lane, K.

All the plans were written according to the six-step process outlined in Sectoral Planning Guidelines for Climate Change Adaptation produced by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE, 2018) which is also the government department charged with coordinating the NAF. This article will summarise the application of the methodology to heritage resources in Ireland, the issues encountered and the results achieved. Design/methodology/approach The plan was informed by existing research and incorporated expert, stakeholder and public consultation throughout the process. It also closely considered published plans from other sectors in order to aid consistency within the NAF and to ensure cross-cutting issues were highlighted. Findings Of the many potential impacts of climate change, those identified as priorities for adaptation planning in Ireland were flooding (inland and coastal), storm damage, coastal erosion, soil movement (landslip or erosion), changing burial preservation conditions, pests and mould, wildfires and maladaptation. Goals, objectives and an action plan were developed commensurate with the five-year term of the plan, but also initiating a long-term strategic vision. A monitoring strategy was developed to monitor progress, identify problems and inform improvements to the adaptation plan as part of an iterative process.

Recognizing this, there is a growing movement to develop and deliver tools, resources, and services to support local communities' climate adaptation initiatives. There is, however, limited understanding of what specific types of resources exist and how well these resources match the needs of local practitioners. To bring clarity to these questions, we: 1) assessed the current landscape of climate-adaptation resources and services; 2) surveyed community practitioners to learn how well these resources align with their needs; and 3) convened leading service providers and local practitioners to identify strategic opportunities for moving the adaptation field forward. Findings demonstrate that existing services and resources are meeting the early phases of local adaptation efforts such as conducting vulnerability assessments and creating adaptation plans, but are failing to meet the needs associated with implementing, monitoring, and evaluating adaptation activities. Additionally, a lack of funding and staff time to support adaptation, as well as inaccessible resource formats are barriers impeding local climate adaptation efforts. The mismatch between the types and formats of services being provided and the needs of local governments means that more work is needed to ensure that climate adaptation resources are responsive to the existing and future needs of local governments. Moreover, our research finds that there is a strong and growing need to organize and streamline the climate adaptation resource and service landscape so that practitioners can easily, effectively, and efficiently access the resources they need to build more resilient local communities.

Hence, there is the need to undertake mitigation actions aimed at slowing down the uncontrolled development of negative effects. Within this work, the goal is to analyze the role of urban green infrastructures in the complex panorama of the climate change fight, through the ability to restore ecological functions. A quantification study of the Ecosystem Services (ES) offered by Le Vallere Park, a green area of about 340 thousand square meters in the Turin metropolitan area (North Italy), was conducted. The project combines the complex ES theme of urban adaptation to climate change, through i-Tree, a software suite born to evaluate the benefits provided by vegetation. Particularly, through i-Tree Hydro, the quantity and quality of runoff rainwater are analyzed considering the comparison between different scenarios: we analyze a present case (2019) and future cases (2071-2100), with reference to climate projections for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 scenario (considering climate change mitigation actions) and RCP 8.5 scenario (no actions) of the COSMO-CLM regional climate model, produced by the Euro-Mediterranean Center for Climate Change (CMCC). The discussion focuses on comparing the results obtained in the different scenarios, deepening the role of a medium-sized urban green infrastructure on the surrounding environment as the climate and vegetative conditions vary.","[Busca, Francesco; Revelli, Roberto] Politecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct ngn, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Revelli, Roberto] Politecn Torino, FULL Future Urban Legacy Lab, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; Polytechnic University of Turin,"Busca, F (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct ngn, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",roberto.revelli@polito.it; roberto.revelli@polito.it,"Busca, Francesco/GLV-3540-2022","Busca, Francesco/0000-0003-2216-2281",,,,,49,1,1,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2022,14,13,,,,,,,8091,10.3390/su14138091,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14138091,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2V9YA,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000824190800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Quantitative, indicator-based assessments are typically applied to evaluate resilience by combining various indicators of performance into a single composite index. Building upon extensive research on social vulnerability and coping/adaptive capacity, we first develop an original, comprehensive disaster resilience index (CDRI) at municipal level across Italy, to support the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. As next, we perform extensive sensitivity and robustness analysis to assess how various methodological choices, especially the normalisation and aggregation methods applied, influence the ensuing rankings. The results show patterns of social vulnerability and resilience with sizeable variability across the northern and southern regions. We propose several statistical methods to allow decision makers to explore the territorial, social and economic disparities, and choose aggregation methods best suitable for the various policy purposes. These methods are based on linear and non liner normalization approaches combining the OWA and LSP aggregators. Robust resilience rankings are determined by relative dominance across multiple methods. The dominance measures can be used as a decision-making benchmark for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management strategies and plans.","[Marzi, Sepehr; Mysiak, Jaroslav; Essenfelder, Arthur H.; Amadio, Mattia] Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Via Liberta, Venice Marghera, Italy; [Marzi, Sepehr; Mysiak, Jaroslav; Essenfelder, Arthur H.; Amadio, Mattia] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Via Liberta, Venice Marghera, Italy; [Giove, Silvio] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, Venice, Italy; [Fekete, Alexander] Univ Appl Sci, TH Koln, Inst Rescue Engn & Civil Protect, Betzdorfer Str 2, Cologne, Germany",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Marzi, S (corresponding author), Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Via Liberta, Venice Marghera, Italy.;Marzi, S (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Via Liberta, Venice Marghera, Italy.",sepehr.marzi@cmcc.it,"Mysiak, Jaroslav/A-8683-2019; Essenfelder, Arthur Hrast/AAK-1790-2021; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Fekete, Alexander/C-4071-2017","Mysiak, Jaroslav/0000-0001-9341-7048; Essenfelder, Arthur Hrast/0000-0001-9396-6928; Fekete, Alexander/0000-0002-8029-6774; Marzi, Sepehr/0000-0002-8318-3767",European Union [730482],European Union(European Commission),This publication is part of the project CLARA Climate forecast enabled knowledge services that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Grant Agreement No 730482.,,125,23,23,11,23,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,SEP 16,2019,14,9,,,,,,,e0221585,10.1371/journal.pone.0221585,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0221585,,,23,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,LM4NC,31525230,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000532225700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, this article seeks to evaluate two propositions. The first proposition is that the administration's climate adaptation and extreme weather policies have largely focused on resilience, as conceptualized and mainstreamed within the institutions of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and national security. The second proposition is that federal institutions that have incorporated resilience planning have done so with a focus on extreme events and social effects and have given little attention to long-term transformative adaptation by and between social and natural systems. These propositions are evaluated through a mixed-methods sequential research design that centers on both a policy narrative and an analysis of a sample of federal resilience measures classified by a taxonomy originally developed by the National Security Council. The findings support an affirmation of the first proposition and a partial affirmation of the second proposition. Overall, this article provides empirical evidence that suggests a broader federal government transition away from transformational socioecological adaptation to climate change in favor of a focus on DRR for extreme events. This article advances a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the development of resilience and adaptation policies across a broad spectrum of federal policy regimes.

A database of six different sustainable flood retention basin (SFRB) types with varying flood control potential has been developed. In Scotland, there are a relatively high number of current and former large drinking water reservoirs which could contribute to flood management control. In comparison, purpose-built and relatively small SFRB, which are predominantly used for flood control, dominate the landscape in Baden. Moreover, 13 out of 149 SFRB have recently been upgraded, and 11 new SFRB have been built since 2006. Both the estimated hazard and risk are small in comparison to those found in the flood infrastructure in Scotland. The study assesses a rapid screening tool developed to estimate the Dam Condition and the corresponding Dam Failure Hazard and Dam Failure Risk. Most SFRB in Baden have a relatively poor Dam Condition, high Dam Failure Hazard but low Dam Failure Risk compared to those in Scotland. Findings show that Baden is more advanced in flood defence management as well as adaptation to climate change.","[Scholz, Miklas] Univ Salford, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Civil Engn Res Ctr, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England; [Scholz, Miklas; Yang, Qinli] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Inst Infrastruct & Environm, Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Salford; University of Edinburgh,"Scholz, M (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Civil Engn Res Ctr, Newton Bldg, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England.",m.scholz@salford.ac.uk; Q.Yang-7@sms.ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,16,1,1,4,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2011,3,11,,,,,2200,2216,,10.3390/su3112200,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su3112200,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,V29QV,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000208763800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, recent scientific literature addressing overheating analysis is only focussing on individual countries. In this article, we discuss how different design of representative apartment buildings in two countries influences the overheating risk or cooling demand and what conclusions can be drawn from it. This is done for a low-rise apartment building located in Germany and a high-rise building in South Korea applying building performance simulation. Both countries are located in the moderate climate zone, but regional differences in frequency of tropical nights and radiant summer days lead to significant differences in overheating intensity (800 Kh/a for the German and 5100 Kh/a for the Korean) or cooling demand (1800 kWh for the German to 1300 kWh for the Korean). The lower cooling demand but much higher overheating intensity of the Korean building compared to the German is mainly caused by the different solar heat gain due to the glazed balcony design of the Korean building where these balcony rooms are not actively cooled. On the contrary, the common internal facade insulation of Korean buildings results in a higher overheating risk compared to the German building and in addition the lower potential of passive cooling by natural ventilation due to the necessity of insect screens in Korea. The large effect of implementing heat adaptation measures on overheating risk reduction or cooling demand (up to 90%) clearly demonstrates that both buildings are far away from a heat resilient design and that heat adaptation measures can address both climate change adaptation and mitigation.","[Schuenemann, Christoph; Son, Seoyeon; Ortlepp, Regine] Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, Weberpl 1, D-01217 Dresden, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung,"Schunemann, C (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, Weberpl 1, D-01217 Dresden, Germany.",c.schuenemann@ioer.de,"Ortlepp, Regine/C-2861-2008","Ortlepp, Regine/0000-0002-2109-7468; Schunemann, Christoph/0000-0002-1214-8593",Leibniz Institute of Ecological and Regional Development (IOER) within the scope of the project Assessment of resilience and adaptation to climate change of residential buildings focussing heavy rain and summer heat (ResAdBuildings); Projekt DEAL,Leibniz Institute of Ecological and Regional Development (IOER) within the scope of the project Assessment of resilience and adaptation to climate change of residential buildings focussing heavy rain and summer heat (ResAdBuildings); Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

The adoption of new technologies could provide specific capabilities to confront vulnerabilities associated with fishing and hunting activities, but it could also accentuate existing vulnerabilities of the communities and undermine the generic (i.e., non-specific) adaptive capacities to respond to rapid environmental and socioeconomic changes. We investigated the role of technology for building capacity to respond to challenges posed by climate change in three remote communities in northwest Arctic Alaska. We refer to technology as tools used to change how people engage or relate to landscape or society. We interviewed 35 Inuit subsistence users and used Q-sort methodologies to examine their attitudes toward technology and climate change adaptation. Communication technologies and new ways of transport have allowed harvesters to travel faster and further, and 89% of the interviewees underscored the role of technology for enhancing the specific capacity to cope with extreme weather (77%), foggy conditions (60%), and environmental changes (89%). Despite of the role technology plays in enhancing the capacity to respond to climate threats, just over half viewed technology as generally favorable for the community (54%), although most admitted there are downsides (60%), including higher financial costs (34%), increased vulnerability (23%), and time spent on maintenance (9%).

Beijing is facing multiple challenges such as coping with climate change, urbanization, and population aging, which puts huge decision-making pressure on decision maker. However, few studies that systematically consider the health effects of climate change, urbanization, and population aging for China. Based on the distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) and 13 global climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), this study obtained the temporal and spatial distribution of surface temperature through statistical downscaling methods, and comprehensively explored the independent and comprehensive effects of urbanization and population aging on the projection of future temperature-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the context of climate and population change. The results showed that only improving urbanization can reduce future temperaturerelated CVD mortality by 1.7-18.3%, and only intensified aging can increase future temperature-related CVD mortality by 48.8-325.9%. Taking into account the improving urbanization and intensified aging, future temperature-related CVD mortality would increase by 44.1-256.6%, and the increase was slightly lower than that of only intensified aging. Therefore, the intensified aging was the biggest disadvantage in tackling climate change, which would obviously magnify the mortality risks of temperature-related CVD in the future. Although the advancement of urbanization would alleviate the adverse effects of the intensified aging population, the mitigation effects would be limited. Even so, Urbanization should be continued to reduce health risks for residents. These findings would contribute to formulate policies related to mitigate climate change and reduce baseline mortality rate (especially the elderly) in international mega-city - Beijing. In addition, relevant departments should improve the medical health care level and optimize the allocation of social resources to better cope with and adapt to climate change.","[Tao, Yan; Xing, Qian] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst, Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Sun, ZhaoBin; Xing, Qian; Shang, Jing; Miao, Shiguang] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Urban Meteorol, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China; [Sun, ZhaoBin] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Joint Int Res Lab Atmospher & Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Chan] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Canjun] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University; China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention,"Tao, Y (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst, Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.;Sun, ZB (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Inst Urban Meteorol, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China.;Sun, ZB (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Joint Int Res Lab Atmospher & Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",zbsun@ium.cn; taoyan@lzu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [42175184]; Innovation Team and Talents Cultivation Program of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine [ZYYCXTD-D-202208]; Institute for Disaster Risk Management in Nanjing University of Information Science and Tech-nology,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation Team and Talents Cultivation Program of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Institute for Disaster Risk Management in Nanjing University of Information Science and Tech-nology,This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No: 42175184) and Innovation Team and Talents Cultivation Program of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (No: ZYYCXTD-D-202208) .

The fact that climate has been changing in the past and will change in the future emphasises the need to understand how farmers perceive climate change and adapt to it in order to guide strategies for adaptation in the future. This study examines perception and adaptation to climate change of maize-based farmers in three agro-ecological zones of Nigeria using data from a cross sectional survey of 346 farming households selected through a multistage sampling technique. The study re-affirmed male dominance in maize production with about 90.8% of the farmers being male, while about 54.6% were between the productive ages of 41 - 60 years with a mean age of 45 years. About 47.4% of the farmers had no formal education, while the average number of years of formal education was 6.5. Results showed that 81.5% of the sampled maize farmers had perceived changes in climatic variables and 68.5% had employed adaptation measures. Econometric estimation of Heckman probit model revealed that the likelihood of farmers perceiving changes in climate was positively and significantly influenced by farming experience, access to extension agents, farm income and agro-ecological settings, while farming experience, distance to market centre, access to extension agents and farm income increase the probability of adapting to climate change. Policy focus should be awareness creation as well as improved farmers' knowledge through extension agents, social network and NGOs and strengthening of credit institutions.","[Coster, A.

Based on survey data from interviews with rural residents in Chongqing, China, this study investigated residents' purchase intention, behavior, and intention-behavior gap with respect to energy-saving refrigeration appliances, including air conditioners and refrigerators. Econometric models were employed to identify the gap and explore its influencing factors from the aspects of rural residents' climate change perceptions and personal experiences. The results demonstrate that there is an intention-behavior gap. Among the rural residents inter-viewed, approximately 84.19% had intention, but only 20.99% exhibited consistent behavior. The findings indicate that the influencing factors on rural residents' purchase intention and actual behavior are different. One's perception of the possibility of climate change and the self-efficacy and family efficacy of climate change adaptation positively promote his or her intention, behavior, and intention-behavior conversion. However, one's perception of inefficacy and affective impression hinder intention, behavior, and intention-behavior conversion. Cost perception impedes behavior and intention-behavior consistency, while a broad and direct perception of relationships between climate change and energy use behavior can facilitate them, although this perception fails to influence intention. Climate hazards suffered and experiences of climate change adaptation can promote intention but hinder actual behavior, resulting in negative intention-behavior consistency. Based on these findings, some effective policy implications were put forward to enhance intention-behavior transformation and sustainable household carbon reduction in relation to energy-saving refrigeration appliances.","[He, Rui; Jin, Jianjun; Qiu, Xin; Zhang, Chenyang] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol E, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [He, Rui; Jin, Jianjun; Qiu, Xin; Zhang, Chenyang] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Sch Nat Resources, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jubo] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Social Sci, 48 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639818, Singapore",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Jin, JJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol E, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",201621190023@mail.bnu.edu.cn; jjjin@bnu.edu.cn,,,Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China;  [2019QZKK0608];  [41671170],Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ; ,This work was financially supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (No. 2019QZKK0608) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41671170) .,,70,1,1,24,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0195-9255,1873-6432,,ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES,Environ.

J,"Patashnik, J",,,,"Patashnik, Jeremy",,,THE TROLLEY PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE: SHOULD GOVERNMENTS FACE TAKINGS LIABILITY IF ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES CAUSE PROPERTY DAMAGE?,COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LAW,"Faced with potentially staggering human and economic costs, governments around the world are beginning to plan and implement adaptive measures designed to stem the effects of climate change. Some of these adaptations will likely benefit certain property owners and communities at the expense of others. For example, seawalls intended to save valuable parcels of land from sea-level rise could wind up forcing seawater onto neighboring parcels that would not have flooded otherwise. One day in the not-too-distant future, societies will have to grapple with the question of whether the government is responsible for harms it causes in its attempts to save livelihoods and land threatened by climate change. This Note seeks to address that question by analyzing the extent to which a government in the United States would face takings liability if its adaptive measures to address sea-level rise-one of the most salient property harms that will result from climate change-save certain parcels but harm others. Despite a long line of case law under which the government is liable for a taking when it intentionally floods private property, this Note concludes that, under certain circumstances, climate change adaptations could present the type of emergency situation that American courts have frequently held exempts the government from takings liability. This Note nonetheless argues that broader government takings liability may lead to more efficient and equitable climate change adaptation. It also considers some undesirable outcomes that could result from broader government takings liability and discusses potential solutions to minimize those problems.","[Patashnik, Jeremy] Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Patashnik, J (corresponding author), Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,75,4,4,0,0,COLUMBIA JOURNAL TRANSNATIONAL LAW ASSOC,NEW YORK,"COLUMBIA UNIV, SCHOOL LAW, 435 W 116TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA",0010-1958,1945-2268,,COLUMBIA LAW REV,Columbia Law Rev.,JUN,2019,119,5,,,,,1273,1309,,,,,,37,Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,IT3KM,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000482751800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our study explores citizen perceptions on wood usage as a building material under expected mitigation and adaptation measures aimed at a changing climate and extreme weather events. The data are founded on an internet-based survey material collected from a consumer panel from Finland and Sweden during May-June 2021, with a total of 2015 responses. By employing exploratory factor analysis, we identified similar belief structures for the two countries, consisting of both positive and negative views on wood construction. In linear regression models for predicting these beliefs, the perceived seriousness of climate change was found to increase positive views on wood construction but was insignificant for negative views. Both in Finland and Sweden, higher familiarity with wooden multistory construction was found to connect with more positive views on the potential of wood in building, e.g., due to carbon storage and material properties. Our findings underline the potential of wood material use as one avenue of climate change adaptation in the built environment. Future research should study how citizens' concerns for extreme weather events affect their future material preferences in their everyday living environments, also beyond the Nordic region.","[Vehola, Anni; Hurmekoski, Elias; Toivonen, Ritva; Toppinen, Anne] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki 00100, Finland; [Hurmekoski, Elias; Toivonen, Ritva; Toppinen, Anne] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, Yliopistonkatu 3, Helsinki 00100, Finland; [Lahtinen, Katja] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Ruokamo, Enni] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Latokartanonkaari 11, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Roos, Anders] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Econ, Almas Alle 8, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Finnish Environment Institute; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Toppinen, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki 00100, Finland.;Toppinen, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, Yliopistonkatu 3, Helsinki 00100, Finland.",anne.toppinen@helsinki.fi,,"Hurmekoski, Elias/0000-0001-8717-7287; Ruokamo, Enni/0000-0002-2896-4800; Toppinen, Anne/0000-0003-0910-1505","DECARBON-HOME - Strategic Research Council; Academy of Finland [335241, 335245, 335252]",DECARBON-HOME - Strategic Research Council; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"We thank two reviewers and Associate Editor for their helpful comments on our manuscript.

The analysis of the schools has resulted in the identification of 20 passive strategies, eight parameters related to sustainability and six related to environmental ergonomics. The results show that the most used passive strategies are natural ventilation, green roofs, low thermal transmittance windows and solar shading. In contrast, the least used strategies are ventilated facades and evaporative cooling systems. In terms of sustainability, energy efficiency is present in most case studies; in contrast, the circular economy is hardly considered in schools. In terms of environmental ergonomics, thermal comfort is present in most case studies, while acoustic comfort is not assessed. Furthermore, the results show an absence of optimisation of acoustic and visual comfort, climate change adaptation measures and involvement of the educational community. This work provides a detailed understanding of the status quo for researchers, practitioners and policymakers and predicts the dynamic directions of the field. It highlights the need to incorporate passive design protocols explicitly applied to schools to achieve a sustainable and climate-resilient educational building stock within the principles of the circular economy.","[Diaz-Lopez, Carmen] Univ Granada, Dept Civil Engn, Campus Fuentenueva S-N, Granada 18071, Spain; [Diaz-Lopez, Carmen; Serrano-Jimenez, Antonio; Barrios-Padura, Angela] Univ Seville, Dept Bldg Construct 1, Ave Reina Mercedes 2, Seville 41012, Spain; [Verichev, Konstantin] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Civil Engn, Fac Engn Sci, Ave Gen Lagos, Valdivia 2050, Chile",University of Granada; University of Sevilla; Universidad Austral de Chile,"Diaz-Lopez, C (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Civil Engn, Campus Fuentenueva S-N, Granada 18071, Spain.",carmendiaz@ugr.es; aserrano5@us.es; konstantin.verichev@uach.cl; abarrios@us.es,"Serrano-Jiménez, Antonio/F-6130-2019; Verichev, Konstantin/AAC-9438-2019; Díaz-López, Carmen/AAF-8921-2019","Serrano-Jiménez, Antonio/0000-0002-8585-857X; Verichev, Konstantin/0000-0001-6523-1238; Díaz-López, Carmen/0000-0002-6378-6624","Spanish Ministry of Universities - European Union; University of Granada; Andalusian Government [POST-DOC_21_00575, FEDER-US-15547]; Eco-efficiency in educational centres: Innovation, Rehabilitation and regeneration within ERDF [US.20-06]","Spanish Ministry of Universities - European Union; University of Granada; Andalusian Government; Eco-efficiency in educational centres: Innovation, Rehabilitation and regeneration within ERDF","This work was supported through funds, materials, and measuring equipment as part of the Eco-efficiency in educational centres: Innovation, Rehabilitation and regeneration (FEDER-US-15547) research projects within the ERDF2014-2020 funds and regulations for the Andalusian region, aiming to proof and test its application to implement this innovation as a passive measure to promote in existing schools and multi-family buildings; and the (Re)programa-tool: Digital tool for optimised decision-making in housing renovation strategies (Andalusian Government - US.20-06).

The interviewees expressed a lack of clarity around expected climate change impacts, which did not prevent them from saying that they were already experiencing the effects of a changing climate.

However, institutions like the World Bank are positioning themselves for a transformation in adaptation finance, seeking to provide substantially more adaptation finance as distinct from financial support for greenhouse gas mitigation. This article explores the recent emergence of adaptation as a higher priority and how a longer-term time horizon is necessary if a transformation in climate change governance is to occur which places greater emphasis on sustainable development goals relating to improvement of circumstances of citizens in the most climate-vulnerable nations, mostly in the Global South. The article also considers the important debate in the climate change policy literature over the extent to which funds supporting adaptation are going to lower-income nations or people, as might be anticipated given the view that the poor are more vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Data linking World Bank project funding to climate change adaptation and mitigation, derived from a keyword-matching approach, show that from 2010 to 2018, the share of climate-change-related finance devoted to adaptation in World Bank projects increased considerably. The data indicate that adaptation funding tends to be directed more to more climate-vulnerable nations and those with greater state fragility, but not to low-income countries versus high-income countries. Implications are considered for how this change might be scaled up  to achieve a transformational status.","[Eisenstadt, Todd A.] Amer Univ, Ctr Environm Policy CEP, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Olawole, Ifeoluwa] Amer Univ, Dept Govt, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Toman, Michael A.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA",American University; American University; Resources for the Future,"Eisenstadt, TA (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Ctr Environm Policy CEP, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",eisensta@american.edu; ifeoluwaolawole@yahoo.com; toman@rff.org,,"Olawole, Ifeoluwa/0000-0003-2146-2207",World Banks Development Research Group,World Banks Development Research Group,"The project was funded in part through a grant from The World Banks Development Research Group, where co-author Toman was project manager in 20182020.

In Navarre, North of Spain, ongoing adaptive management practices were identified and promoted in the framework of a regional adaptation strategy. Most include practices aiming to increase topsoil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural land. In this work, the effectiveness of these practices (conservation agriculture, crop rotations, additions of organic matter, irrigation, and controlled grazing management) was assessed by means of monitoring SOC in a network of 159 agricultural fields across the region. These fields were selected across bioclimatic zones, where soil vulnerabilities and land-uses were previously assessed, to represent the most widespread conditions in the region. A sampling protocol designed to compare SOC stocks in plots with equal soil conditions within each zone, and with or without adaptive practices, allowed the determination of their effect size (measured as response ratios, RR). Exogenous organic matter addition was the most effective practice for SOC storage (RR 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.25-1.37]) across the region. Controlled grazing also resulted in net SOC gains (RR CI [1.13-1.42]) in temperate and semiarid grasslands. Conservation agriculture seemed to be more effective in the driest zone (RR CI [1.30-1.53]) than in the more humid ones (RR CI [0.98-1.21]). Irrigation also displayed a net positive effect (RR CI [1.17-1.34]), modulated by irrigated crop management, whereas crop rotations had an overall negative impact vs. monoculture (RR CI [0.84-0.96]), likely by their interaction with irrigation. These results confirm the variability in SOC responses to changes in management, and SOC as an indicator for assessing regional adaptation practices, although other biophysical, agronomic, and socio-economic factors also need to be accounted for.","[Anton, Rodrigo; Arricibita, Francisco Javier; Ruiz-Sagaseta, Alberto; Enrique, Alberto; de Soto, Isabel; Zaragueta, Armelle; Virto, Inigo] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Ciencias, IS FOOD, Navarra 31006, Spain; [Orcaray, Luis; Zaragueta, Armelle] Inst Navarro Tecnol & Infraestruct Agroalimentatr, Secc Sistemas Sostenibles, Area Innovac, Villava 31610, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Virto, I (corresponding author), Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Ciencias, IS FOOD, Navarra 31006, Spain.",rodrigo.anton@unavarra.es; arricibita@unavarra.es; alberto.ruiz@unavarra.es; alberto.enrique@unavarra.es; isabelsonsoles.desoto@unavarra.es; lorcaray@intiasa.es; azaragueta@intiasa.es; inigo.virto@unavarra.es,"Virto, Inigo/L-9915-2015; de Soto García, Isabel Sonsoles/M-4063-2015; Echeverría, Luis Orcaray/Q-2810-2019","Virto, Inigo/0000-0002-7682-4570; Echeverría, Luis Orcaray/0000-0002-9832-1448; Anton, Rodrigo/0000-0002-7005-1423; de Soto Garcia, Isabel Sonsoles/0000-0002-4681-5892",European Commission LIFE program [LIFE 16 IPC/ES/000001]; Universidad Publica de Navarra,European Commission LIFE program; Universidad Publica de Navarra,"This work was funded by the European Commission LIFE program (Project LIFE Nadapta, LIFE 16 IPC/ES/000001).

The study is conducted by integrating results from the dynamic global vegetation model IBIS and the computable general equilibrium model GRACE-IN, which estimates macroeconomic implications for six zones of India. By comparing a reference scenario without climate change with a climate impact scenario based on the IPCC A2-scenario, we find major variations in the pattern of change across zones. Biomass stock increases in all zones but the Central zone. The increase in biomass growth is smaller, and declines in one more zone, South zone, despite higher stock. In the four zones with increases in biomass growth, harvest increases by only approximately 1/3 of the change in biomass growth. This is due to two market effects of increased biomass growth. One is that an increase in biomass growth encourages more harvest given other things being equal. The other is that more harvest leads to higher supply of timber, which lowers market prices. As a result, also the rent on forested land decreases. The lower prices and rent discourage more harvest even though they may induce higher demand, which increases the pressure on harvest. In a less perfect world than the model describes these two effects may contribute to an increase in the risk of deforestation because of higher biomass growth. Furthermore, higher harvest demands more labor and capital input in the forestry sector. Given total supply of labor and capital, this increases the cost of production in all the other sectors, although very little indeed. Forestry dependent communities with declining biomass growth may, however, experience local unemployment as a result.","[Aaheim, Asbjorn; Wei, Taoyuan] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, CICERO, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Gopalakrishnan, Ranjith; Chaturvedi, Rajiv Kumar; Ravindranath, N.

Climate change will exacerbate the existing threats to vulnerable communities, such as the poor, and threaten the food security of populations in coastal areas through the effects of flooding due to coastal inundation. Indonesia is an Archipelagic State of over 17,000 islands and is vulnerable to climate change impacts in its coastal areas and especially in its highly populated low lying delta areas, such as Jakarta and Semarang, where vulnerability to sea level rise is evident. The adequacy of the legal adaptation framework in Indonesia to respond to this climate vulnerability is assessed and it is found to have limited consideration of the community burden arising from these climate and SLR uncertainties. A more inclusive social justice approach could assist government to respond to the impacts from these issues and to their implications for vulnerable groups. The nation can improve adaptive legal measures to address climate change impacts and increase the involvement of local people in climate change adaptation decision making. Funding is required to assist policy makers to further incorporate adaptation into decision making, and this could improve social justice outcomes for vulnerable Indonesian coastal communities.","[Nurhidayah, Laely] Indonesian Inst Sci PMB LIPI, Res Ctr Soc & Culture, Gd Widya Graha Lt 6 Jl Gatot Subroto 10, Jakarta, Indonesia; [McIlgorm, Alistair] Univ Wollongong, ANCORS, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",National Research & Innovation Agency of Indonesia (BRIN); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI); University of Wollongong,"Nurhidayah, L (corresponding author), Indonesian Inst Sci PMB LIPI, Res Ctr Soc & Culture, Gd Widya Graha Lt 6 Jl Gatot Subroto 10, Jakarta, Indonesia.",lae1003@lipi.go.id,,"Mcilgorm, Alistair/0000-0001-6625-5573; Nurhidayah, Laely/0000-0002-9903-0239",Australian Government's Endeavour Research Fellowship 2017,Australian Government's Endeavour Research Fellowship 2017,"This research was supported by Australian Government's Endeavour Research Fellowship 2017 with host institution at Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security (ANCORS), The University of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia.",,47,21,21,5,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,APR 1,2019,171,,,,,,11,18,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.01.011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.01.011,,,8,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Oceanography; Water Resources,HP1CU,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000461403800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data were collected from more than 100 scientific articles, reliable organizations, and industry resources to a concise explanation and novel perspective on how seaweed can contribute considerably to the newly emerging blue carbon economy and revolutionary tools to combat climate change in the long term. According to the findings, seaweed has all the features required to be classified as a blue carbon habitat and a massive carbon sink. Besides its function in climate change adaptation and mitigation, seaweed is also a prelude to attaining a bioeconomy by lowering the reliance on fossil fuel. Documented evidence supports various applications in sectors as diverse as human meals, livestock feed, biofuels, and renewable feedstocks. However, the literature also identifies barriers to the implementation of seaweed farming operations. This review provides evidence that seaweed farming and industries are potential alternatives for future energy, decarbonization, and food security, mitigating global climate change and attaining economic growth and sustainable livelihoods.","[Yong, Wilson Thau Lym; Rupert, Rennielyn; Rodrigues, Kenneth Francis] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Biotechnol Res Inst, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia; [Yong, Wilson Thau Lym] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Seaweed Res Unit, Fac Sci & Nat Resources, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia; [Thien, Vun Yee] Xiamen Univ Malaysia, Innovat Ctr, Jalan Sunsuria, Sepang 43900, Selangor Darul, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Sabah; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Malaysia Sabah; Xiamen University Malaysia Campus,"Yong, WTL (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Sabah, Biotechnol Res Inst, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia.;Yong, WTL (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Sabah, Seaweed Res Unit, Fac Sci & Nat Resources, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia.",wilsonyg@ums.edu.my,"Yong, Wilson Thau Lym/B-7058-2012","Yong, Wilson Thau Lym/0000-0001-8431-8486",UK Research and Innovation - Global Challenges Research Fund (UKRI-GCRF) under the GlobalSeaweedSTAR Programme [GSS/RF/025]; Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education under the Prototype Development Research Grant Scheme [PRGS/2/2019/STG05/UMS/02/1],UK Research and Innovation - Global Challenges Research Fund (UKRI-GCRF) under the GlobalSeaweedSTAR Programme; Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education under the Prototype Development Research Grant Scheme,The authors are grateful for funding from the UK Research and Innovation -Global Challenges Research Fund (UKRI-GCRF) under the GlobalSeaweedSTAR Programme (Grant Ref.: GSS/RF/025) and the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education under the Prototype Development Research Grant Scheme (Grant Ref.: PRGS/2/2019/STG05/UMS/02/1).,,147,14,14,36,65,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

It combines institutional data and semi-structured interviews with policymakers to elucidate the process of implementation of these instruments, with a focus on the enabling factors and (missing) connections in the policy mix. Coordination gaps between the enabling instruments and climate adaptation instruments, caused by institutional and political factors, resulted in implementation issues and a policy mix inclined to promote social vulnerability goals rather than sustainable production and climate risk management. The analysis provides insights into the challenges of achieving a coherent policy framework. It also contributes to the policy mix literature by defining criteria for a typology of interactions between policy instruments and by unpacking the functional ties of instruments in the policy mix. Key policy insights Policy coordination is a political rather than technical process. The policy mix includes climate adaptation instruments, enabling instruments, and complementary instruments, each of which play different functional roles. Both formal and informal mechanisms connect policy instruments. A policy mix analysis must be specific to both context and time. A network analysis of instrument interactions can provide methods and comparative outlooks that are more robust. Implementation gaps between the enabling instruments and climate adaptation instruments influence the resulting policy mix, which tends to promote achievement of social vulnerability goals rather than sustainable production and climate risk management.","[Milhorance, Carolina; Sabourin, Eric; Mendes, Priscylla] Univ Brasilia CDS Unb, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Sabourin, Eric; Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Agr Res Ctr Int Dev CIRAD UMR Art Dev, Montpellier, France; [Sabourin, Eric; Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Montpellier Univ Excellence MUSE, Montpellier, France; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT CGIAR, Cali, Colombia",Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier; CGIAR,"Milhorance, C (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia CDS Unb, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",cmilhorance@gmail.com,"Milhorance, Carolina/AAY-4743-2020","Milhorance, Carolina/0000-0002-3290-8596; SABOURIN, Eric/0000-0002-1171-2535; Le Coq, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-1084-1973; Mendes, Priscylla/0000-0001-7074-680X",CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico); CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior); FAP-DF (Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal) under the project INCT [162014 ODISSEIA]; ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) [ARTIMIX ANR-17-CE03-0005],CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); FAP-DF (Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal) under the project INCT(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This work was supported by CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico); CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior); FAP-DF (Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal) under the project INCT n degrees 162014 ODISSEIA, and by the ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche), under project ARTIMIX ANR-17-CE03-0005.",,65,14,14,10,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Mainstreaming adaptation concerns in urban development and redevelopment projects is commonly propagated as an effective policy strategy. Adaptation mainstreaming research often studies public actors. This article investigates the adaptation practices by housing associations, in the institutional and discursive developments of the social housing domain in which they are embedded. The analytical concepts of mainstreaming and adaptation barriers are combined with the discursive-institutional policy arrangement approach to answer the question: what factors influence the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation measures in development and renovation projects in the social housing domain in the Netherlands? We conclude that anticipatory and deliberate adaptation action to date was very scarce and attention limited in the social housing domain. On the project implementation level, factors that hampered adaptation mainstreaming in housing development were limited awareness, low priority in relation to other issues, financial constraints, regulatory constraints, lacking cooperation, and no materialisation of adaptation concerns in procedures and performance agreements. On the level of the policy arrangement, adaptation is weakly institutionalized in the Dutch social housing domain. The institutionalisation of a competing 'core activities' discourse hampered the legality of climate adaptation measures and eroded financial resources, dispersing the power to mobilise them over the arrangement. Uncertainty over the meaning of the new regulations, in combination with the absence of a comprehensive regulatory framework for adaptation and the self-identified culture of risk aversion by housing associations, delimits adaptation action becoming a standard operating procedure of social housing associations.","[Boezeman, Daan; de Vries, Thijs] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res Geog Planning & Environm, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Boezeman, Daan] Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy PBL, The Hague, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Boezeman, D (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res Geog Planning & Environm, Nijmegen, Netherlands.;Boezeman, D (corresponding author), Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy PBL, The Hague, Netherlands.",d.boezeman@fm.ru.nl,,,Spatial Adaptation Incentive Programme (Deltaprogramme) of the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment,Spatial Adaptation Incentive Programme (Deltaprogramme) of the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment,"The authors thank the Spatial Adaptation Incentive Programme (Deltaprogramme) of the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment for hosting and supporting the research.

To this end, this study applied the theory of reasoned action and the norm activation model as well as these two models in combination. A descriptive quantitative research study was designed and conducted using cross-sectional survey methods among 250 farmers in Khuzestan province in southwestern Iran, selected through multistage sampling methods. Research data were collected through a structured questionnaire whose validity was confirmed by a panel of experts; scale reliability of the questionnaire was approved through a pilot study. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that the norm activation model, the theory of reasoned action, and a model integrating the two can predict 32, 42, and 47%, respectively, of changes in farmers' intention toward performing climate-change adaptation activities. In the combined model, personal norm, subjective norm, and attitude were able to influence the farmers' intention to perform adaptive behaviors. Attitude towards adaptation is the most powerful predictor in explaining intention to adaptation. Subjective norm is the most important predictors of moral norms which is the logical confirmation behind the combination of the two models. In addition, the combined model has better predicting powerful that each model separately.

The current study explores the adaptation of wheat farmers to climate change, its determinants and its impact on food productivity and crop income in rural Pakistan. This study is based on a primary dataset of 442 wheat farmers conducted through face-to-face structured interviews from 65 villages across three agro-ecological zones of Punjab Province, Pakistan. The study employs logistic regression analysis to find adaptation determinants and uses the propensity score matching technique to estimate the causal impact of adaptation on food productivity and crop income. The results of the study suggest that wheat farmers were well aware of climate change, but for various reasons did not adapt accordingly. The major adaptation strategies implemented by wheat farmers include changing planting dates, crop varieties and fertilizer types. Moreover, education, farming experience, access to agricultural extension, weather forecasting and marketing information were the factors that significantly affected farmers' adaptation decisions. Adapting wheat crops to climate change significantly and positively affects wheat productivity and net crop,income and hence indirectly improves the farmers' wellbeing and local food security. More benefits were achieved by farmers who used a combination of different adaptation strategies. The study suggests to focus on farmers' education, easy access to farm advisory services and information on new adaptation methods for sustainable food production and local food security.

Soil and Water Bioengineering (SWB or SWBE) is a hazard mitigation and restoration discipline formally established and structured since the aftermath of World War II, but finding its roots in age old applications, which have many objectives in common with NBS. However, a structured comparison of SWB and NBS terminologies and objectives is lacking, and this is much needed to highlight that SWB are amenable to the concept of NBS in the context of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DRR). This work presents a comparison between the definition of SWB, NBS, and other terminologies that fall under the NBS concept. A matrix was created to compare NBS and NBS-related terminologies with the three main aspects of the SWB practice: main aims, fields of application and other objectives. Results from the comparison confirm that NBS is a unifying concept to prioritise nature to integrate climate change adaptation, mitigation, and disaster reduction efforts, embracing also many aspects of SWB criteria and applications. Thus, SWB can and should be recognized as having always been an NBS.","[Preti, Federico] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forest Sci & Technol DAGR, Via Cascine 5, I-50144 Florence, FI, Italy; [Capobianco, Vittoria] NGI, Nat Hazards Div, Norwegian Geotech Inst, POB 3930, N-3930 Oslo, Norway; [Preti, Federico; Capobianco, Vittoria] Assoc Italiana Ingn Naturalist AIPIN, Via San Bonaventura 13, I-50145 Florence, Italy; [Preti, Federico; Sangalli, Paola] European Federat Soil & Water Bioengn EFIB, Valencia, Spain; [Sangalli, Paola] Sngalli Coronel & Asociados SCIA S L, Paseo Lugaritz 25 Bajo, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain","University of Florence; Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, NGI","Capobianco, V (corresponding author), NGI, Nat Hazards Div, Norwegian Geotech Inst, POB 3930, N-3930 Oslo, Norway.",vittoria.capobianco@ngi.no,,,"Norwegian Research Council [315552, 326122]",Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"The Authors are grateful to (in alphabetic order): Paolo Cornelini (AIPIN), Giulio Castelli (UniFi-Universit`a di Firenze, Italy); Alessandro Errico (UniFi), Giacomo Goli (UniFi), Amy Oen (NGI), Donatella Paffetti (uniFi), Daniele Penna (UniFi), Gianluigi Pirrera, (AIPIN) Riccardo Santolini (AIPIN & UniUrb) and Marco Uzielli (UniFi), for the precious comments provided on the topic during the proof reading of this contribution.

Where heterogeneity exists within these groups which impacts climate change adaptation efforts and outcomes, an understanding of such intersectionalities is vital to the design of effective and equitable policy. The objective of this study is to investigate whether interaction effects among socio-economic factors are meaningful drivers of observed differences among female farmers in their adoption of climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, as well as their use of climate information and financial services. This study employs data from farmer surveys in three Climate-Smart Villages in Latin America, analyzed using ordinal logistic regression and canonical correspondence analysis. The results indicate that important interaction effects are present: the relationship between higher educational attainment and increased adoption of CSA practices, for example, is conditional on the degree of livelihood diversification. The relationship between greater educational attainment and increased use of climate forecasts is likewise conditional on age. These results suggest the need for researchers and policymakers to anticipate potential intersectionalities when designing research efforts and development interventions.","[Acosta, Mariola; Bonilla-Findji, Osana; Martinez-Baron, Deissy; Howland, Fanny; Castellanos, Andrea; Martinez, Jesus David; Chanana, Nitya] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Apartado Aereo, Cali 6713, Colombia; [Riley, Simon] Univ Florida, Agron Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Riley, Simon] Univ Florida, IFAS Stat Consulting Unit, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Bonilla-Findji, Osana; Martinez-Baron, Deissy; Huyer, Sophia; Castellanos, Andrea; Martinez, Jesus David; Chanana, Nitya] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Huyer, Sophia] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; CGIAR; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Acosta, M (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Apartado Aereo, Cali 6713, Colombia.",acfra.mariola@gmail.com; simon.riley@ufl.edu; o.bonilla@cgiar.org; d.m.baron@cgiar.org; f.c.howland@cgiar.org; s.huyer@cgiar.org; a.e.castellanos@cgiar.org; j.d.martinez@cgiar.org; n.chanana@cgiar.org,,"Castellanos Quintero, Andrea Estefania/0000-0002-2701-3632; Howland, Fanny/0000-0002-0778-2741; Riley, Simon/0000-0002-4833-2026; Acosta, Mariola/0000-0003-4456-1283; Bonilla-Findji, Osana/0000-0002-6098-000X","International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada (IDRC) [108809-001]; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Fund Donors","International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada (IDRC); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR)","This research was funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada (IDRC Project Number: 108809-001) and the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

The four components of the model are (i) awareness of and concern about the potential impacts of climate change, (ii) adaptation strategy, (iii) the concept of an adaptation space from which options are selected, and (iv) the notion that three groups of factors influence awareness, strategy and option selection: susceptibility to change, internal characteristics of the organisation, and regulatory and market context. Public water supply in England and Wales is provided by private sector companies, subject to environmental and economic regulation. Hydrological simulations suggest that climate change has the potential to reduce the reliability of supply sources over the next few decades. The industry in December 2004 completed a review of investment requirements over the next five years. Awareness of climate change is high in the water industry, but by developing assessment procedures and incorporating them into the investment review the regulators forced companies to consider explicitly the potential impacts of climate change in a consistent and rigorous manner. These analyses combined climate change with other pressures on water resources, and in practice companies did not attribute specific investment decisions or proposals to climate change or indeed any other individual drivers. The broad strategy adopted by all water supply companies - to maintain standards of service - is determined by regulatory controls and market considerations, but the degree of concern about the impacts of climate change and precise adaptation options necessary to address supply-demand imbalances varied between water supply companies, reflecting local geographic conditions. The water supply companies and regulators have different perspectives on the relative merits of supply-side and demand-side measures, reflecting different organisational priorities. The 2004 investment review determined that no specific actions were necessary to deal with future climate change, but that measures set in place - in terms of methodologies and investment in investigations into specific resource developments - provided a sound foundation for more specific actions in the next investment review in five years time. The paper concludes by summarising the factors assisting and constraining adaptation over the next few decades.","Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; Univ Southampton, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton; University of Southampton,"Arnell, NW (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",n.w.arnell@soton.ac.uk,"Arnell, Nigel/AAC-7331-2020",,,,,,62,133,134,1,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

However, at present, there is dearth of research examining the adaptation practices by the urban poor in African cities. Focusing on Ghana's capital, Accra, the purpose of this study is fourfold: (i) to explore climate change literacy among the urban poor and local planning institutions; (ii) to examine the urban poor's perceptions on climatic events in Accra; (iii) to analyze autonomous adaptation measures to climate change impacts; and (iv) to assess planned adaptation measures to climate change impacts. This paper uses household surveys, secondary data analysis and agency interviews in two informal communities - Nima and Chorkor - in Accra as case studies. Underpinned by the social exclusion theory, the results show limited climate literacy despite widespread experience of climate change impacts by the urban poor. Most adaptation measures were community driven and autonomous while the limited institutional responses were both planned and autonomous. However, both community and institutional planning responses were ad-hoc, reactionary and unsustainable. The paper recommends consideration of community-based selforganizing adaptation measures into city plans to ensure that autonomous measures are complemented with planned adaptation strategies. In addition to stakeholder participation, collaborations and partnerships in climate change adaptation, pro-poor adaptation measures - both autonomous and planned remain imperative as they can contribute to inclusive and just climate change policy.","[Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Asibey, Michael Osei; Boakye, Angela Achiaa] Kwame Nkruamah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana; [Addaney, Michael] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Planning & Sustainabil, Sunyani, Ghana",University of Melbourne,"Asibey, MO (corresponding author), Kwame Nkruamah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana.",patrick.cobbinah@unimelb.edu.au; asibeymichael@yahoo.com; michael.addaney@uenr.edu.gh,"Asibey, Michael Osei/P-2396-2016","Asibey, Michael Osei/0000-0002-5534-2695; Addaney, Michael/0000-0003-4351-1241",,,,,47,2,2,1,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

The objective of this paper was to examine the extent to which the approach, in particular the use of the supports in workshops with farmers and advisors, helped to stimulate learning about adaptation options of livestock systems to climate change and the way in which workshop discussions can improve researchers' conceptual models of livestock systems. We show that the use of supports can generate incremental adaptation options (interpreted as single-loop learning) and sometimes more radical ideas for change (interpreted as double-loop learning). Subsequent analysis of workshops provides new insights into livestock systems (e.g. considerations used by farmers for key decisions). We demonstrate that this modelling and participatory approach avoids the trade-off often found between the credibility of livestock- system adaptations to climate change and their relevance in practice.","[Duru, Michel; Felten, Benoit; Theau, Jean Pierre; Martin, Guillaume] INRA, UMR AGIR 1248, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Martin, Guillaume] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, Crop Sci Res Grp, Bonn, Germany",INRAE; University of Bonn,"Duru, M (corresponding author), INRA, UMR AGIR 1248, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",mduru@toulouse.inra.fr,,"Martin, Guillaume/0000-0003-1875-0777","French ANR VMC programme, VALIDATE project (Vulnerability Assessment of LIvestock and grasslanDs to climAte change and exTreme Events) [ANR-07-VULN-011]; PSDR project Climfourel INRA-Midi-Pyrenees region","French ANR VMC programme, VALIDATE project (Vulnerability Assessment of LIvestock and grasslanDs to climAte change and exTreme Events)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); PSDR project Climfourel INRA-Midi-Pyrenees region(Region Occitanie)","This study was partly funded by the French ANR VMC programme as part of the VALIDATE project (Vulnerability Assessment of LIvestock and grasslanDs to climAte change and exTreme Events, ANR-07-VULN-011) and of the PSDR project Climfourel INRA-Midi-Pyrenees region.

Notwithstanding, the member states comprising the Southern African Development Community (SADC) are among the most vulnerable to the trans boundary effects of global climate change. Existing SADC climate change policy documents highlight the important role of the energy sector in climate change mitigation. Furthermore, various international, African Union and SADC legal instruments stress the crucial role of harmonised law and policy as climate change adaptive measure. It is the central hypothesis of this paper that harmonised sub-regional law and policy aimed at regulating SADC member states' mitigation efforts in the energy sector is a crucial climate change adaptive strategy. This hypothesis is based on the mandates for the formulation of a SADC climate change action plan and for mitigation in the energy sector. These mandates are contained in the texts of the SADC-CNGO Climate Change Agenda, 2012 and the Southern Africa Sub - Regional Framework on Climate Change, 2010 respectively. It is the main aim of this paper to investigate recent developments in the formulation of harmonised SADC law and policy on climate change in general and law and policy pertaining to mitigation in the energy sector specifically. In achieving the stated aim, themes to be investigated by means of a literature study are those of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change and harmonised sub-regional policy on mitigation in the energy sector as adaptive measure in the SADC.","North West Univ, Fac Law, ZA-2526 Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Barnard, M (corresponding author), North West Univ, Fac Law, POB 431, ZA-2526 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",Michelle.Barnard@nwu.ac.za,,,,,,,28,4,5,0,5,"UNIV CAPE TOWN, ENERGY RES CENTRE",CAPE TOWN,"LIBRARY RD, MENZIES BLDG, 6TH FLR ROOM 6 41 PRIVATE BAG X3, RONDEBOSCH, CAPE TOWN, WESTERN CAPE 7701, SOUTH AFRICA",1021-447X,,,J ENERGY SOUTH AFR,J.

It is important to understand this relationship because it will compound the already significant burden of diseases on national economies and public health. Authorities need to be able to assess, anticipate, and monitor human health vulnerability to climate change, in order to plan for, or implement action to avoid these eventualities. Environmental health indicators (EHIs) provide a tool to assess, monitor, and quantify human health vulnerability, to aid in the design and targeting of interventions, and measure the effectiveness of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. Our aim was to identify the most suitable framework for developing EHIs to measure and monitor the impacts of climate change on human health and inform the development of interventions. Using published literature we reviewed the attributes of 11 frameworks. We identified the Driving force-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) framework as the most suitable one for developing EHIs for climate change and health. We propose the use of EHIs as a valuable tool to assess, quantify, and monitor human health vulnerability, design and target interventions, and measure the effectiveness of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for the future development of EHIs as a multidisciplinary approach to link existing environmental and epidemiological data and networks. Analysis of such data will contribute to an enhanced understanding of the relationship between climate change and human health.","[Hambling, Tammy; Slaney, David] Inst Environm Sci & Res Ltd, Porirua 5022, New Zealand; [Hambling, Tammy; Weinstein, Philip] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Herston, Qld 4600, Australia; [Weinstein, Philip; Slaney, David] Univ S Australia, Barbara Hardy Inst, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia",Institute of Environmental Science & Research (ESR) - New Zealand; University of Queensland; University of South Australia,"Hambling, T (corresponding author), Inst Environm Sci & Res Ltd, 34 Kenepuru Dr, Porirua 5022, New Zealand.",tammy.hambling@esr.cri.nz; philip.weinstein@unisa.edu.au; david.slaney@esr.cri.nz,"Weinstein, Phil/C-9805-2011","Weinstein, Philip/0000-0001-9860-7166","New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science Technology [C03X0801]; New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE) [C03X0801] Funding Source: New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)","New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science Technology(New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology); New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE))","This work was supported by funding from the New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science & Technology (contract C03X0801).",,58,67,74,4,39,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

It is based on a comparative analysis of online survey results conducted among government officials working on climate adaptation in six countries of the region: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Paraguay and Uruguay. The article addresses four key issues. First, it identifies some of the critical knowledge deficits (missing or incomplete information) that affect climate adaptation policy making and implementation. Second, it addresses the obstacles and difficulties facing collaborative processes of knowledge production (co-production) between scientists and public policy actors. Third, it analyzes factors affecting knowledge uptake and use by policymakers. Finally, it identifies some of the main knowledge deficits specifically affecting the monitoring and assessment of climate adaptation policies and measures. Overall, the article provides a diagnosis of the main knowledge gaps facing climate adaptation policy in the Latin American countries studied. The results of this diagnosis can serve as input for a research and action agenda aiming to strength the interaction between science and policy on climate adaptation in Latin American countries. Key policy insights The countries covered by the study suffer strong knowledge deficits related to the design, implementation and evaluation of adaptation policy. Collaborative modes of knowledge production in the field of climate adaptation do not tend to sustain over time. Climate change co-production processes tend to be project based, linked to specific initiatives rather than to institutionalized long-term policymaking or planning processes. The fragmentation and lack of integration of the knowledge available on the different aspects of climate adaptation issues deeply affect their usability in policy processes. Weak state capabilities to co-produce, manage and use knowledge in the policy process constitute a main barrier affecting the science-policy interface on climate adaptation issues.","[Ryan, Daniel] ITBA, Dept Invest & Doctorado, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Bustos, Eduardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Cambio Global, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Ryan, D (corresponding author), 25 Mayo 444,CI002ABJ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",dryan@itba.edu.ar,,"Ryan, Daniel/0000-0003-4699-5448; Bustos Sandoval, Eduardo/0000-0001-5913-663X",International Development Research Center (IDRC),International Development Research Center (IDRC),This work was supported by International Development Research Center (IDRC).,,45,8,8,4,28,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

It is beneficial to develop integrated approaches to evaluate, and provide scientific assessments of, potential climate change adaptation measures to inform risk management related to climate and weather events. To this end, a risk modeling framework was created to facilitate estimations of the impact of weather and climate change on public health risks from biological hazards in food and water and to compare potential adaptation and risk mitigation strategies. The framework integrates knowledge synthesis methods, data storage and maintenance, and stochastic modeling. Risk assessment models were developed for food and water safety case studies for demonstrative purposes. Scenario analyses indicated that implementing intervention measures to adapt to changing climate impacts might mitigate future public health risks from pathogens to varying degrees. The framework brings a generic approach to allow for comparison of relative public health risks and potential adaptation strategies across hazards, exposure pathways, and regions to assist with preventive efforts and decision-making.

Local knowledge is key to help smallholder farmers to cope with climate change and variability to attain sustainable forest management. However, there is limited understanding of what shapes human adaptation to climate change in various sectors at local level including forestry in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, this study explored the awareness, knowledge and perception of forest-dependent communities on climate change and variability around Phirilongwe and Mchinji forest reserves in Malawi. Empirical data was collected using household surveys (n = 422), key informant interviews (16), and focus group discussions (8). Results suggest that 60% of respondents in Mchinji were aware of climate change as compared to only 35% in Mangochi. Results record that respondents perceived increased erratic rainfall, high temperatures and strong winds and changes in seasons. The main factors influencing their climate perception includes possession of farming skills (p = .002), Education (P = .04), gender (P = .002) and possession of livestock keeping skills (p = .02). However, the cube root stratification method indicates that their level of knowledge falls in the low-level category. Although negligible proportion of climate skepticisms was exposed, a strong belief in anthropogenic causes of climate change and willingness to adopt environmental friendly intervention measures were revealed. However, the presence of the believers in the cultural and spiritual causes of climate change in the study area presents a challenge to mobilize them toward implementation of climate intervention measures and forest management. We therefore recommend their participation in the climate adaptation intervention designs and multiple use of various strategies and methods that will help to address their livelihoods at the same time improve their climate information and knowledge.","[Chisale, Harold L.

However, very little of this work has occurred in islands, which may have different vulnerabilities and capacities for adaptation. Data of surveyed farmers throughout Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria (n = 405, 87% response rate) were used in a structural equation model to explore the extent to which their adoption of agricultural practices and management strategies was driven by perceptions of motivation, vulnerability, and capacity as a function of their psychological distance of climate change. Our results show that half of farmers did not adopt any practice or strategy, even though the majority perceived themselves capable and motivated to adapt to climate change, and understood their farms to be vulnerable to future extreme events. Furthermore, adoption was neither linked to these adaptation perceptions, nor to their psychological distance of climate change, which we found to be both near and far. Puerto Rican farmers' showed a broad awareness of climate change's impacts both locally and globally in different dimensions (temporal, spatial, and social), and climate distance was not linked to reported damages from Hurricane Maria or to previous extreme weather events. These results suggest that we may be reaching a tipping point for extreme events as a driver for climate belief and action, especially in places where there is a high level of climate change awareness and continued experience of compounded impacts. Further, high perceived capacity and motivation are not linked to actual adaptation behaviors, suggesting that broadening adaptation analyses beyond individual perceptions and capacities as drivers of climate adaptation may give us a better understanding of the determinants to strengthen farmers' adaptive capacity.","[Rodriguez-Cruz, Luis Alexis; Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Food Syst Grad Program, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Rodriguez-Cruz, Luis Alexis; Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Niles, Meredith T.] Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Burlington, VT USA",University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Rodriguez-Cruz, LA (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Food Syst Grad Program, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;Rodriguez-Cruz, LA (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",lrodrig2@uvm.edu,,"Rodriguez-Cruz, Luis Alexis/0000-0002-2229-8448; Niles, Meredith/0000-0002-8323-1351",College of Agriculture and Life Science; Food Systems Graduate Program of the University of Vermont,College of Agriculture and Life Science; Food Systems Graduate Program of the University of Vermont,"MTN allocated funding from this study, which came from the College of Agriculture and Life Science and the Food Systems Graduate Program of the University of Vermont.

Differential human vulnerability to environmental hazards results from a range of social, economic, historical, and political factors, all of which operate at multiple scales. While adaptation to climate change has been the dominant focus of policy and research agendas, it is essential to ask as well why some communities and peoples are disproportionately exposed to and affected by climate threats. The cases and synthesis presented here are organized around four key themes (resource access, governance, culture, and knowledge), which we approach from four social science fields (cultural anthropology, archaeology, human geography, and sociology). Social scientific approaches to human vulnerability draw vital attention to the root causes of climate change threats and the reasons that people are forced to adapt to them. Because vulnerability is a multidimensional process rather than an unchanging state, a dynamic social approach to vulnerability is most likely to improve mitigation and adaptation planning efforts.

Yet, the experience of the insurance sector in dealing with climatic hazards, particularly flooding, has been highly varied. Drawing from the experience of the US National Flood Insurance Program (NFEP), the purpose of this paper is to identify opportunities and challenges associated with using insurance as an adaptation strategy for climate change. Design/methodology/approach - This article critically reviews the history and recent performance of the NFIP and considers lessons for climate change adaptation through insurance. Findings - The US NFIP offers government-subsidized flood insurance for firms and residences. Over its 40-year history, the NFIP has struggled with financial instability and low levels of public participation in the program. The experience of the NFIP offers several lessons regarding the viability of insurance as an adaptation strategy: increasing insurance premiums to account for new climatic risks may mean that a growing segment of the population is unable or unwilling to purchase insurance, absent some other form of subsidization; educating the public on levels of risk and promoting appropriate risk mitigation are highly effective means for reducing damages from current and emerging weather-related risks; and close public-private cooperation is likely to be needed to prevent withdrawal of private insurers from high-risk areas and to ensure that insurance coverage continues to be widely available. Originality/value - Examination of past experience with insurance as a mechanism for climate adaptation offers lessons and insights that can inform development of effective strategies to address climate change.","[Thomas, Adelle; Leichenko, Robin] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geog, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Thomas, A (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geog, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",adelle@eden.rutgers.edu,"Leichenko, Robin M./C-6047-2013","Leichenko, Robin M./0000-0003-0607-5874; Thomas, Adelle/0000-0002-0407-2891",,,,,42,35,35,3,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

But how should that money be allocated within those countries? A popular and intuitively plausible answer, in line with the strong standing of the norm of ownership in development aid circles, is that this is for the recipient country to decide. The paper investigates the three most important types of ethical arguments for such 'recipient control': the epistemic argument, the entitlement argument, and the legitimacy argument. It is argued that there is a good case for recipient control in democratic countries, because such countries can be expected to act in the name of the people to whom adaptation finance is ultimately owed. However, the three arguments do not support, even if taken jointly, recipient control in nondemocratic countries. This is a significant result seeing as the majority of the most vulnerable countries are nondemocratic.","[Duus-Otterstrom, Goran] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Box 711, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Duus-Otterstrom, G (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Box 711, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",goran.duus-otterstrom@pol.gu.se,"Duus-Otterstrom, Goran/ABC-3942-2021","Duus-Otterstrom, Goran/0000-0001-9133-7300",Swedish Research Council and Formas,Swedish Research Council and Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"Previous versions of this paper have been presented at the 6th Uppsala Forum Workshop on Climate Change, at the Centre for Global Democratic Governance at the University of St. Gallen, and at the 17th Nordic Political Science Association congress at the University of Gothenburg.

California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) samples along the US West Coast and is one of the world's longest-running and most comprehensive time series, with hydrographic and biological data collected since 1949. The pairing of ecological and physical measurements across this long time series informs our understanding of how the California Current marine ecosystem responds to climate variability. By providing a baseline to monitor change, the CalCOFI time series serves as a Keeling Curve for the California Current. However, challenges remain in connecting the data collected from long-term monitoring programs with the needs of stakeholders concerned with climate change adaptation (i.e., resource managers, policy makers, and the public), including for the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. We use the CalCOFI program as a case study to ask: how can long-term ocean observing programs inform ecosystem based management efforts and create data flows that meet the needs of stakeholders working on climate change adaptation? Addressing this question and identifying solutions requires working across sectors and recognizing stakeholder needs. Lessons learned from CalCOFI can inform other regional monitoring programs around the world, including those done at a smaller scale in developing countries.","[Gallo, Natalya D.; Drenkard, Elizabeth; Koslow, J.

In the USA, much energy is devoted to conserving rural coastal ecosystems by promoting their adaptation to climate change. However, these areas are also home to vulnerable and underserved communities who can be challenging to engage in climate adaptation discussions. Churches-as trusted social institutions-may offer a structure through which government decision-makers and rural residents can engage to improve the resilience of these rural coastal regions. We employed collaborative learning to engage government decision-makers and rural church members on the topic of climate impacts on Maryland's Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay. We analyzed the collaborative learning process and its outcomes using ethnographic methods. In this paper, we present our approach and discuss the benefits and challenges of collaborative learning with rural churches. We found that this approach yielded major benefits including greater understanding of capacities and limitations in addressing environmental challenges, increased trust and social networks, expanded engagement with a greater diversity of stakeholders, increased opportunities for new conversations, new pathways toward interventions, and stakeholder empowerment. Collaborating with churches is not without challenges though; it requires considerable time and effort and presents difficulties in navigating social hierarchies and specialized language, identifying common goals, grappling with the newness of climate change, and overcoming institutional barriers. Despite these challenges, we conclude that collaborative learning with churches is a valuable approach for information exchange and network-building toward more resilient rural coasts.","[Miller Hesed, Christine D.; Van Dolah, Elizabeth R.; Paolisso, Michael] Univ Maryland, Dept Anthropol, 4302 Chapel Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Miller Hesed, CD (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Anthropol, 4302 Chapel Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",christinedm@gmail.com,"Hesed, Christine Miller/AAP-9583-2021; Miller Hesed, Christine D./HCH-2956-2022","Paolisso, Michael/0000-0001-6921-3985; Miller Hesed, Christine/0000-0003-1644-1962; Van Dolah, Elizabeth/0000-0001-7520-8269",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal and Ocean Climate Application Program [NA17OAR4310248],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal and Ocean Climate Application Program,This research was financially supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal and Ocean Climate Application Program (grant no.

Climate adaptation planning is generally regarded as separate from traditional urban planning practices. Globally and in Europe, however, cities are increasingly integrating climate adaptation planning into their traditional urban planning instruments and processes. Recent research indicates that the scope of such integration is at varying stages. The City of Rotterdam (Netherlands) and the City of Antwerp (Belgium) have been identified as two European cities that face similar climate impacts and risks given their proximity to a large river delta. Both cities aim to integrate climate adaptation into their respective urban planning policies, but the scope of their integration differs. This paper critically analyses the urban planning policies of these two cities to distil key lessons learnt that cities with similar climate impacts and approaches to urban planning may potentially face in integrating climate adaptation planning into urban planning policies. The paper finds that identifying and evaluating the synergies, co-benefits or trade-offs of adaptation measures is a key challenge to integrating climate adaptation into urban planning policy. It is a potential stumbling block for long-term sustainable development and climate resilience.","[van der Berg, Angela] Univ Western Cape, Fac Law, Global Environm Law Ctr GELC, ZA-7550 Cape Town, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"van der Berg, A (corresponding author), Univ Western Cape, Fac Law, Global Environm Law Ctr GELC, ZA-7550 Cape Town, South Africa.",avanderberg@uwc.ac.za,,"van der Berg, Angela/0000-0001-8204-0679",,,,,101,0,0,15,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1867-299X,2190-8249,,EUR J RISK REGUL,Eur.

We conducted a survey to identify current farm-level land use strategies driven by climate change and their underlying socioeconomic determinants. Our study involved primary data collected on 336 maize producers randomly selected in 8 villages. We find that crop association/rotation, land reallocation/change of cropping patterns, water and soil conservation strategies, and field relocation are the main land use strategies driven by climate change at the farm-level. Farmers' socioeconomic characteristics such as such as experience in agriculture, participation in off-farm activity, availability of farmland, organization membership, access to credit, contact with extension and household size have significant but differential effects on the choices of land use strategies. As a recommendation, extension services need to be revisited to better support smallholder farmers in adopting crops association/rotation and water and soil conservation methods. Policymakers can also tap into the opportunity of changes in cropping patterns to promote crops that are suitable for new climate conditions and have additional benefits for household food and nutritional security.","[Yegbemey, Rosaine N.] Univ Parakou, Lab Anal & Rech Dynam Econ & Sociales LARDES, Dept Econ & Sociol Rurales, Fac Agron, BP 104, Parakou, Benin",,"Yegbemey, RN (corresponding author), Univ Parakou, Lab Anal & Rech Dynam Econ & Sociales LARDES, Dept Econ & Sociol Rurales, Fac Agron, BP 104, Parakou, Benin.",rosaine.yegbemey@fa-up.bj,"Yegbemey, Rosaine Nérice/AAV-1497-2020","Yegbemey, Rosaine Nérice/0000-0003-2051-0289",,,,,55,2,2,2,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

We undertook a systematic literature review to assess which facets of ILA provide climate resilience, the quality of the evidence base used to undertake such assessments, and which analytical approaches were used. We reviewed in detail 386 studies. We found 16 peer-reviewed studies presenting 48 cases of ILA-livelihood-climate interactions that analysed the climate moderating effect of ILA. With such a small sample, discerning a reliable signal of climate resilience from ILA or from facets of ILA is challenging. Most studies focused on the plot or farm level as opposed to higher or multiple spatial scales. This is at odds with the holistic notion of ILA which emphasises the multi-scalar nature of landscapes and their constituent human and environmental systems. However, we highlight the potential for combining the results of multiple individual studies that focus on facets of ILA to detect if a signal of ILA driven climate resilience exists. Only one study focused on how multi-stakeholder governance and institutional arrangements affect climate resilience. This omission within the evidence base precludes empirically grounded insights into the mechanisms through which different governance and institutional arrangements within ILA influence climate response capacity.","[Duncan, John M.

Normative instruments such as Strategies, Policies, and Plans are among the principal ways that Local Governments (LGs) use to promote CCA & DRR integration. To understand how CCA & DRR integration is promoted into Strategies, Policies, and Plans by Australian LGs, the paper performs a content analysis of documents in Singleton, Newcastle, and Lake Macquarie -three LGs located in the Hunter region, New South Wales (NSW). Findings indicate that: (i) the three selected LGs recognize that climate change exacerbates frequency and intensity for hazards; (ii) some documents include common goals for promoting CCA, showing synergies among different topics; (iii) documents recommend CCA measures for several aspects of the built environment, including land-use, building standards, and infrastructure and asset materials; and, (iv) public participation mechanisms were proposed to enact CCA measures. While these measures are important, understanding how CCA will be implemented is still necessary. Fragmentation exists between CCA goals in these LGs and future programs by the NSW government for the built environment in the Hunter region. Additionally, efforts are required to understand how public participation mechanisms can contribute to addressing vulnerabilities to climate changerelated hazards. Finally, the initial evidence shows that the Lake Macquarie LG shows greater commitment in CCA & DRR integration than Newcastle and Singleton LGs. The paper demonstrates that a focus on how LGs promote CCA & DRR integration into Strategies, Policies, and Plans can extend our understanding of climate change response by LGs.","[Forino, Giuseppe; von Meding, Jason; Brewer, Graham] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [van Niekerk, Dewald] North West Univ, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Potchefstroom, South Africa",University of Newcastle; North West University - South Africa,"Forino, G (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",g.forino@gmail.com,"van Niekerk, Dewald/H-6134-2012","van Niekerk, Dewald/0000-0002-4571-4205; forino, giuseppe/0000-0001-6659-0742",University of Newcastle,University of Newcastle,"Giuseppe Forino is supported by a PhD scholarship from the University of Newcastle.

A growing number of studies have paid attention to mitigating carbon emission and adapting to climate change. Very few studies, however, have investigated farmers' health risk management associated with climate change. This study, therefore, proposed a hybrid theoretical model to explore the roles of farmers' climate risk perceptions and facilitating conditions in farmers' health risk management, both theoretically and empirically. Using a sample of 1499 rice farmers in China, the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was adopted for empirical analysis, and the Multi-group Analysis (MGA) was employed to examine the heterogeneity among farmers' socio-economic status. This study found that farmers' perceived severity of climate change and perceived benefits of addressing climate change have significant impacts on their resources and technical facilitating conditions, in turn, those two types of facilitating conditions significantly impact their health risk management intentions. Subjective norms are also identified as predictors of resources facilitating condition and technical facilitating condition. In addition, farmers with lower income are more likely to suffer from health risks induced by climate change. They have fewer resources for resilience and maintaining health. Based on the findings identified above, strategies for coping with the negative impacts of climate change on farmers' health were proposed for climate adaptation from the perspective of health risk management.","[Li, Wenjing; Yue, Meng; Zhang, Lu] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Li, Wenjing; Yue, Meng; Zhang, Lu] Int Joint Lab Climate Change Response & Sustainab, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Li, Wenjing] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Li, Wenjing] FERA Sci Ltd, Inst Agri Food Res & Innovat, Natl Agri Food Innovat Campus, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England; [Yuan, Kai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Wuhan Childrens Hosp, Wuhan 430014, Peoples R China; [Huang, Fubin] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University; Newcastle University - UK; Food & Environment Research Agency; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; China University of Geosciences,"Zhang, L (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",luzhang@mail.hzau.edu,"Huang, Fubin/GLR-1972-2022","Huang, Fubin/0000-0002-8685-2217","National Natural Science Foundation of China [72003075, 42071157]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019T120736, 2020T130231, 2018M640790, 2019M652672]; Philosophy and Social Sciences by Ministry of Education [20YJC630065]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662017PY045, 2662020JGPYG11]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Philosophy and Social Sciences by Ministry of Education; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72003075; 42071157); the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019T120736; 2020T130231; 2018M640790; 2019M652672); the Philosophy and Social Sciences by Ministry of Education (20YJC630065), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2662017PY045; 2662020JGPYG11).",,57,9,9,13,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Climate change adaptation and ozone regulation have been identified as important strategies to safeguard food production(5,6), but little is known about how climate and ozone pollution interact to affect agriculture, nor the relative effectiveness of these two strategies for different crops and regions. Here we present an integrated analysis of the individual and combined effects of 2000-2050 climate change and ozone trends on the production of four major crops (wheat, rice, maize and soybean) worldwide based on historical observations and model projections, specifically accounting for ozone-temperature co-variation. The projections exclude the effect of rising CO2, which has complex and potentially offsetting impacts on global food supply(7-10). We show that warming reduces global crop production by >10% by 2050 with a potential to substantially worsen global malnutrition in all scenarios considered. Ozone trends either exacerbate or offset a substantial fraction of climate impacts depending on the scenario, suggesting the importance of air quality management in agricultural planning. Furthermore, we find that depending on region some crops are primarily sensitive to either ozone (for example, wheat) or heat (for example, maize) alone, providing a measure of relative benefits of climate adaptation versus ozone regulation for food security in different regions.","[Tai, Amos P.

This research investigates the factors that affect farm management adaptation strategies to climate change in west of Lake Tana and Beles river watersheds of Northwest Ethiopia. A survey was conducted collecting data from 338 households through a semi-structured interview schedule. To analyze the data, the multivariate probit model was used. The results indicated that market distance, frequency of extension services and oxen ownership have highly influenced the choice of crop management adaptation strategies to climate change. The likelihood of adopting short-mature crops, high yielding crop variety, and crop compost preparation was relatively higher (95%) as compared to the probability of adopting other strategies. The joint probabilities of success of the adaptation of the crop management adaptation strategies were 15%. Hence, households are more likely to jointly adopt the crop management climate change strategies. Similarly, age of household head, market distance, and oxen ownership were important characteristics affecting the farmers' choice of animal management as climate change adaptation strategy. The likelihood of adopting hay preparation (89.4%), cut and carry system (77.4%), herd size determination (69.6%) and rotational grazing (67%) were also relatively higher as compared to other strategies. The joint probabilities of adaptation of animal management as climate change adaptation strategy was more likely to be applicable if adoption of the technologies (16.8%) were made jointly compared to their failure to jointly adopt them. Therefore, promoting complementary farm management adaptation practices and considering the socioeconomic factors are crucial to mitigate climate change vulnerability in the study area.","[Takele, Astewel] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Agr Econ, POB 5501, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Abelieneh, Assefa; Wondimagegnhu, Beneberu A.] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Rural Dev & Agr Extens, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia",Bahir Dar University; Bahir Dar University,"Takele, A (corresponding author), Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Agr Econ, POB 5501, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.",astewelt@gmail.com; benassefa1998@gmail.com,,,Bahir Dar University,Bahir Dar University,We highly acknowledge Bahir Dar University for providing the funds for the research work.,,34,1,1,1,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1843,,,COGENT ENVIRON SCI,Cogent Environ.

Thus, capturing, systemizing, and prioritizing factors contributing to climate risks are essential for developing cause-oriented climate risk and vulnerability assessments (CRVA). Impact chains (IC) are conceptual models used to capture hazard, vulnerability, and exposure factors that lead to a specific risk. IC modeling includes a participatory stakeholder phase and an operational quantification phase. Although ICs are widely implemented to systematically capture risk processes, they still show methodological gaps concerning, for example, the integration of dynamic feedback or balanced stakeholder involvement. Such gaps usually only become apparent in practical applications, and there is currently no systematic perspective on common challenges and methodological needs. Therefore, we reviewed 47 articles applying IC and similar CRVA methods that consider the cause-effect dynamics governing risk. We provide an overview of common challenges and opportunities as a roadmap for future improvements. We conclude that IC should move from a linear-like to an impact web-like representation of risk to integrate cause-effect dynamics. Qualitative approaches are based on significant stakeholder involvement to capture expert-, place-, and context-specific knowledge. The integration of IC into quantifiable, executable models is still highly underexplored because of a limited understanding of systems, data, evaluation options, and other uncertainties. Ultimately, using IC to capture the underlying complex processes behind risk supports effective, long-term, and sustainable climate change adaptation.","[Menk, Linda; Kienberger, Stefan] Paris Lodron Univ Salzburg, Dept Geoinformat, Salzburg, Austria; [Menk, Linda] Univ Salzburg, Dept Geoinformat, Christian Doppler Lab Geospatial & EO Based Humani, Salzburg, Austria; [Terzi, Stefano; Zebisch, Marc] Eurac Res, Inst Earth Observat, Bolzano, Italy; [Terzi, Stefano] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, Bonn, Germany; [Rome, Erich; Lueckerath, Daniel; Milde, Katharina] Fraunhofer Inst Intelligent Anal & Informat Syst, St Augustin, Germany; [Kienberger, Stefan] Zentralanstalt Meteorol & Geodynam, Vienna, Austria",Salzburg University; Salzburg University; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Menk, L (corresponding author), Paris Lodron Univ Salzburg, Dept Geoinformat, Salzburg, Austria.;Menk, L (corresponding author), Univ Salzburg, Dept Geoinformat, Christian Doppler Lab Geospatial & EO Based Humani, Salzburg, Austria.",linda.menk@plus.ac.at,"Zebisch, Marc/GQQ-9291-2022","Zebisch, Marc/0000-0002-3530-7219; Terzi, Stefano/0000-0003-0491-6772; Luckerath, Daniel/0000-0002-4988-5511; Milde, Katharina/0000-0002-8140-0617; Kienberger, Stefan/0000-0002-4800-4516","EU; FFG [872000]; BMBF [FKZ 01LS1908]; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development; Christian Doppler Research Association; Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Austria; AquaMount project","EU(European Commission); FFG; BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development; Christian Doppler Research Association; Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Austria; AquaMount project","This research deriving from the UNCHAIN project is funded through a collaboration between the EU funding mechanisms Joint Programming Initiative (JPI) and Assessment of Cross (X)-sectoral climate Impacts and pathways for Sustainable transformation (AXIS).

However, the precise impacts depend to a large degree on the nature of adaptations which take place. But, little is known about whether adaptation practices adopted by farmers in less-developed countries support farm productivity. To this end, this study first identifies the actual adaptation practices adopted by farming households. This is done by linking farmers' perception of changes in local climatic conditions, its impact on agricultural production, and the adjustments they have made in response to climate change impacts. Simultaneous equation models are then employed together with the endogenous switching regression methodology to examine the factors that influence farmers' decisions to adopt different climate change adaptation strategies. How the adoption of these strategies impact food productivity is also examined. Based on a survey of 720 farming households in Nepal, our results show that adoption of adaptation strategies has significantly increased food productivity. Among the adaptation strategies, soil and water management are shown to have the largest impact on food productivity followed by adjustments to the timing of farm operations and crop and varietal adjustment. Factors influencing adoption of adaptation strategies include age and education of the household head (the decision-maker of adaptation strategies), family size, households' distance to market, farmers' association with agricultural-related institutions, number of farm plots under cultivation, past climate change experience, access to climate information, belief in climate change, and attitudes towards adaptation. The findings of this study provide insights into designing agricultural adaptation strategies and integrating them in climate change programs and policies.","[Khanal, Uttam; Wilson, Clevo; Lee, Boon L.; Viet-Ngu Hoang] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Khanal, U (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",utkhanal@gmail.com,"Lee, Boon/K-5178-2019","Lee, Boon/0000-0002-3594-0575; Hoang, Viet-Ngu/0000-0002-9742-2378; Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495","Australia Endeavour Postgraduate Scholarship; QUT Business School, Queensland University of Technology, Australia","Australia Endeavour Postgraduate Scholarship; QUT Business School, Queensland University of Technology, Australia","We thank the editor and the referees of this journal for their useful suggestions.

Here we quantified the synergistic contributions of climate and management intensifications to maize yield trends from 1961 to 2017 in Iowa (United States) using a process-based modeling approach with a detailed climatic and agronomic observation database. We found that climate (management intensifications) contributes to approximately 10% (90%), 26% (74%), and 31% (69%) of the yield trends during 1961-2017, 1984-2013, and 1982-1998, respectively. However, the climate contributions show substantial decadal or multi-decadal variations, with the maximum decadal yield trends induced by temperature or radiation changes close to management intensifications induced trends while considerably larger than precipitation induced trends. Management intensifications can produce more yield gains with increased precipitation but greater losses of yields with increased temperature, with extreme drought conditions diminishing the yield gains, while radiation changes have little effect on yield gains from management intensifications. Under the management condition of recent years, the average trend at the higher warming level was about twice lower than that at the lower warming level, and the sensitivity of yield to warming temperature increased with management intensifications from 1961 to 2017. Due to such synergistic effects, management intensifications must account for global warming and incorporate climate adaptation strategies to secure future crop productions. Additional research is needed to understand how plausible adaptation strategies can mitigate synergistic effects from climate and management intensifications.","[Medina, Hanoi; Tian, Di] Auburn Univ, Dept Crop Soil & Environm Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Medina, Hanoi] RiceTec Inc, Alvin, TX USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Tian, D (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Crop Soil & Environm Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",tiandi@auburn.edu,,"Tian, Di/0000-0001-7752-947X",National Science Foundation CAREER award [EAR-2144293]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Foundational and Applied Science program [USDA-2019-67021-29937]; NIFA Hatch program [1012578],National Science Foundation CAREER award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Foundational and Applied Science program; NIFA Hatch program,"AcknowledgmentsThis work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation CAREER award (EAR-2144293), the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Foundational and Applied Science program (USDA-2019-67021-29937), and NIFA Hatch program (Accession No. 1012578).",,54,0,0,5,5,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The aims of this study were to understand how different cultivars in different regions are responding to changes in climate, in order to inform future cultivar selections. Methods and Results Trends in the day of year maturity (DOYM) between 1999 and 2018 were analysed for 23 grape cultivars (covering at least 7 years) and four Victorian vineyard regions against vintage year, seasonal growing degree day (GDD(Sep-Mar)) and Spring Index. In most cases there were significant trends in DOYM advancement as a function of GDD(Sep-Mar) and spring index. Temporal advancement of DOYM was more variable. One cultivar showed a significant advancement at two of three sites and another showed a significant delay. Different cultivars advanced DOYM at significantly different rates at a given site, later ripening cultivars advanced DOYM faster than earlier ripening cultivars and for a cultivar grown across several sites, the DOYM advancement was faster at cooler sites. Conclusions Grapevine cultivars respond to warming temperature differently and the advancement of grape maturity is predicted to slow as temperature further increases. Significance of the Study The study showed diversity in the phenological response of cultivars to temperature, which may be utilised to better adapt to climate change.","[Cameron, W.; Barlow, E. W.

Enhancing understanding of factors underlying the emergence of these efforts can help strengthen incentives for action, address implementation challenges, and anticipate inequities. This paper uses survey responses from 287 cities and logistic regression analyses to explore conditions and policy actions associated with potential climate compatible development efforts when economic development, sustainability, climate change mitigation, and climate change adaptation considerations overlap. It finds evidence that potential climate compatible development efforts were present in 10% of the cities studied. Adaptation was the issue most likely to act as the missing link when each of these other issues influenced city policy actions, and mitigation was the least likely. Contextual factors associated with these efforts included budget stress, leadership from a policy entrepreneur, higher college degree attainment rates, having an environmental department or commission, and the area of the city composed of water versus land. Examining factors associated with these issues acting as missing links revealed contradictions that highlight the necessity of further exploration of processes affecting the pursuit of climate compatible development.","[Kalafatis, Scott E.] Coll Menominee Nation, Sustainable Dev Inst, Keshena, WI 54135 USA; [Kalafatis, Scott E.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Kalafatis, SE (corresponding author), Coll Menominee Nation, Sustainable Dev Inst, Keshena, WI 54135 USA.;Kalafatis, SE (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",skalafatis@menominee.edu,,,,,,,56,7,7,1,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2017,9,9,,,,,,,1642,10.3390/su9091642,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9091642,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI0MT,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000411621200141,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, classic vulnerability indices do not consider cross-border effects and global interconnections. We attempt to reconcile this need for a broader perspective by developing a global index of exposure to transnational climate impacts, which we define as impacts that are transferred via flows between countries. The index integrates traditional climate vulnerability indicators with spatially-explicit teleconnections between specific countries and constitutes a first approximation of the distribution of such exposure globally. Our results indicate that even though climate risks emerging from within a country's borders are highly correlated with economic development and geography, the distribution of exposure to transnational climate impacts provides a much more complex picture of global vulnerabilities, which neither geography, nor economic development alone can explain sufficiently. This highlights the need to take a cross-scale and multidimensional perspective of climate risk. In order to support more robust adaptation planning, risk assessments should consider both transboundary and far-reaching teleconnected interdependencies between countries.","[Hedlund, Johanna] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Fick, Stephen; Carlsen, Henrik; Benzie, Magnus] Stockholm Environm Inst, Box 24218, SE-10451 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; Stockholm Environment Institute,"Hedlund, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",johanna.hedlund@su.se; stephen.fick@sei.org; henrik.carlsen@sei.org; magnus.benzie@sei.org,,"Carlsen, Henrik/0000-0003-1054-6747; Hedlund, Johanna/0000-0002-8137-050X","European Commission Seventh Framework Programme [603416]; MISTRA GEOPOLITICS - MISTRA The Swedish Foundation For Strategic Environmental Research [DIA 2016/11, 5]",European Commission Seventh Framework Programme(European Commission); MISTRA GEOPOLITICS - MISTRA The Swedish Foundation For Strategic Environmental Research,"The authors wish to thank Asa Persson, Toby Gardner, Tim Carter, Alexander Bisaro, Hans-Martin Fussel, Alex de Sherbinin, Martina Florke, Niki Frantzeskaki, Elena Dawkins and Chris West for constructive discussions in relation with the research presented here.

In order to encourage the adoption of climate change adaptation and mitigation practices by farmers, it is critical to understand their perspectives on the risks they face and actions they are taking. However, very few empirical studies have considered how farmers are interpreting and responding to climate impacts, risks and opportunities in the Northeast. This study investigates farmer views and decisions related to climate change using data from six farmer focus groups conducted across New York and Pennsylvania. The study examined how farmers perceived climate impacts on their farms, the practices they are willing to adopt, and how perceived risks and vulnerability affect farmers' decision-making related to adaptation and mitigation strategies. Although farmers articulated concern regarding climate impacts, they also made clear that other business pressures, such as profitability, market conditions, labor availability or government regulations were often more critical issues that affected their decision-making. Decisions about adopting climate change adaptation and mitigation practices vary widely, and personal experience with extreme weather and changing seasons affected decision-making. The findings from this study provide improved understanding of farmers' needs and priorities, which can help guide land-grant researchers, extension and policymakers in their efforts to develop and coordinate a comprehensive strategy to address climate change impacts on agriculture in the Northeast.","[Lane, David; Chatrchyan, Allison] Cornell Univ, Cornell Inst Climate Smart Solut, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Tobin, Daniel] Univ Vermont, Community Dev & Appl Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Thorn, Kaila; Radhakrishna, Rama] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Allred, Shorna] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; University of Vermont; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Cornell University,"Lane, D (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Cornell Inst Climate Smart Solut, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",del97@cornell.edu,,,"USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Multistate Research Project [1011252]; USDA Agricultural Research Service; Cornell University [58-1902-4-010]","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Multistate Research Project; USDA Agricultural Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service); Cornell University","This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Multistate Research Project (Accession Number 1011252) and a USDA Agricultural Research Service Cooperative Agreement with Cornell University (58-1902-4-010) for the Cornell Northeast Climate Hub Risk Assessment and Capacity Building Project.

This is essential if an informed society is to achieve the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. Women, due to the type of activities they perform in the household, may have a prominent and leading role in this sphere and thus constitute a group holding great potential to support policies to deal with adaptation to climate change. The purpose of the present study is to assess gender-related awareness of climate change issues and the engagement of citizens in climate change mitigation based on eco-feminism theory to the socio-cultural features of citizen households in Iran. To this end, 310 residents of Quemshahr in Mazandaran province (Iran) were selected with a random sampling method. The results show that while women's behavioral engagement in tackling climate change is high, men exhibit a high level of cognitive dimension of engagement in tackling climate change. Furthermore, the results show that the level of citizens' engagement varies by education and age. Based on the research findings, activities to promote environmental education and understanding of climate change mitigation policies are proposed to increase the level of knowledge of the target group.

As a result, women and men may have different levels of participation in-and reliance upon-informal seed systems for sourcing preferred planting material and accessing new crop varieties over time. We use network analysis to explore differences in seed networks accessed by women and men for three major food security crops-beans, finger millet, and sorghum-in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Drawing on data from an original survey of 1001 rural farm households across five study sites, we find that women, on average, have fewer connections to experts and farmers' groups than men but are relatively better connected in farmer-to-farmer social networks across different farming systems. We further find women's and men's networks are clustered by gender (i.e., women's networks include more women, and men's networks include more men)-and that men's networks are more likely to exchange improved seed. Women's networks, though sometimes larger, are less likely to exchange improved varieties that might help farmers adapt to climate change. Women farmers across contexts may also be more reliant on farmer-to-farmer networks than men due to their relative isolation from other seed and information sources. Findings emphasize the need for careful attention to the different implications of seed policies, market interventions, and other seed system reforms to support gender-equitable food security options for women and men in sub-Saharan Africa.","[Otieno, Gloria] Alliance Biovers Int & CIAT, Kampala 24384, Uganda; [Zebrowski, Wesley Mlsna] Univ Indiana, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 46202 USA; [Recha, John] Climate Change Agr & Food Secur CCAFS, Int Livestock Res Inst, CGIAR Res Program, Nairobi 3070900100, Kenya; [Reynolds, Travis William] Univ Vermont, Dept Community Dev & Appl Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); University of Vermont,"Otieno, G (corresponding author), Alliance Biovers Int & CIAT, Kampala 24384, Uganda.;Reynolds, TW (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Community Dev & Appl Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",g.otieno@cgiar.org; wzebrows@iu.edu; j.recha@cgiar.org; twreynol@uvm.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Recha, John/0000-0002-1146-7197; Zebrowski, Wesley/0000-0001-9974-1519; Reynolds, Travis/0000-0002-1323-4960",International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture through the Benefit Sharing Fund; CGIAR Trust Fund; National Science Foundation [SMA-1950766],International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture through the Benefit Sharing Fund; CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was funded by the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture through the Benefit Sharing Fund.

Rising temperatures due to climate change are aggravating these risks in a context of fast urbanization, population growth and societal ageing. However, environmental heat-related health effects are largely preventable through adequate preparedness and responses. Public health adaptation to climate change will often require the implementation of heat wave warning systems and targeted preventive activities at different levels. While several national governments have established such systems at the country level, municipalities do not generally play a major role in the prevention of heat disorders. This paper analyzes selected examples of locally operated heat-health prevention plans in Japan. The analysis of these plans highlights their strengths, but also the need of local institutions for assistance to make the transition towards an effective public health management of high temperatures and heat waves. It can also provide useful elements for municipal governments in vulnerable areas, both in planning their climate change and health adaptation activities or to better protect their communities against current health effects from heat.","[Sanchez Martinez, Gerardo] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Bilbao Vizcaya 48008, Spain; [Imai, Chisato] World Hlth Org Ctr Hlth & Dev, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6510073, Japan; [Masumo, Kanako] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); World Health Organization; University of Tokyo,"Martinez, GS (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change, 4 Alameda Urquijo, Bilbao Vizcaya 48008, Spain.",gerardo.sanchez@bc3research.org; imaic@wkc.who.int; masunok@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Azkarate, Ainhoa/K-9087-2013; Imai, Chrissy/AAJ-7789-2021","Azkarate, Ainhoa/0000-0003-0471-3094; Imai, Chisato/0000-0002-0080-1487; Sanchez Martinez, Gerardo/0000-0002-3290-6195",,,,,40,28,30,3,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The institutional changes that follow the introduction of a CCA measure affect certain areas of governance, including social, political, policy, and other domains that are already exposed to prevailing institutions. Thus, understanding CCA necessitates analysis of the interplays between and among institutions that exist within a hierarchical structure, as well as the examination of how institutions across different scales define the challenges in CCA implementation. This article contributes to this discussion by investigating the challenges in mainstreaming CCA into local land use planning in Albay, Philippines. It applies a four-stage mixed methodology and uses a modified Institutional Analysis and Development framework as its primary analytical guide. Its findings imply that: (1) mainstreaming CCA is a multi-scale, multi-setting endeavour; (2) mainstreaming CCA operationalization involves networks of interacting institutions and institutional arrangements; and (3) addressing the challenges in mainstreaming needs extensive institutional transformations that reach across the various institutional settings within these networks.POLICY RELEVANCEThis article advocates that, in designing strategies to address the challenges in mainstreaming CCA, analysts, planners, and policy makers must understand that the challenges exist within a network of institutional settings, and that these challenges encompass a chain of institutional interactions or interplays within this network. Accordingly, overcoming these challenges necessitates broad institutional reforms that go beyond the institutional setting where CCA is to be mainstreamed. Moreover, this article suggests that CCA policy making and analysis must focus on the vertical, horizontal, and network linkages and relationships created by institutional arrangements, as well as on the interplays facilitated by these arrangements. More importantly, there is a need to determine whether the institutional interplays between and among existing and planned institutions are complementary, counterproductive, conflicting, overlapping, neutral, or coexisting. Such knowledge will assist policy makers and analysts to understand the existing and potential barriers to, as well as identify opportunities for, adaptation. Consequently, the solutions to address the barriers, and the strategies that can take advantage of the opportunities, can be formulated effectively.","[Cuevas, Sining C.] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Chamberlain Bldg 35, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Cuevas, SC (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Chamberlain Bldg 35, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",sining.cuevas@gmail.com,,,Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation-University of Queensland Integrated Natural Resource Management PhD Scholarship [3018293],Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation-University of Queensland Integrated Natural Resource Management PhD Scholarship,This work was supported by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation-University of Queensland Integrated Natural Resource Management PhD Scholarship [3018293].,,58,6,6,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Little is known about national climate change policies in the region. This systematic review identifies and analyses climate change policy documents in all 16 West African countries: (1) What are the existing climate change adaptation policies publicly available? (2) Which topics are addressed? (3) How are agriculture and food security framed and addressed? Following PRISMA guidelines, PubMed and Google scholar as key databases were searched with an extensive grey literature search. Keywords for searches were combinations of Africa, Climate Change, and National Policy/Plan/Strategy/Guideline. Fifteen countries have at least one national policy document on climate change in the frame of our study. Nineteen policy documents covered seven key sectors (energy, agriculture, water resources, health, forestry, infrastructure, and education), and eight thematic areas (community resilience, disaster risk management, institutional development, industry development, research and development, policy making, economic investment, and partnerships/collaboration). At the intersection of these sectors/areas, effects of changing climate on countries/populations were evaluated and described. Climate change adaptation strategies emerged including development of local risk/disaster plans, micro-financing and insurance schemes (public or private), green energy, and development of community groups/farmers organizations. No clear trend emerged when analysing the adaptation options, however, climate change adaptation in the agriculture sector was almost always included. Analysing agriculture, nutrition, and food security, seven agricultural challenges were identified: The small scale of West African farming, information gaps, missing infrastructure, poor financing, weak farmer/community organizations, a shifting agricultural calendar, and deteriorating environmental ecology. They reflect barriers to adaptation especially for small-scale subsistence farmers with increased climate change vulnerabilities. The study has shown that most West African countries have climate change policies. Nevertheless, key questions remain unanswered, and demand for further research, e.g., on evaluating the implementation in the respective countries, persists.","[Sorgho, Raissa; Quinonez, Carlos A.

The IIM is applied in Tianjin to explore its dilemmas facing the increased demand for electricity, water, and public health service sectors under the RCP2.5, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 climate scenarios. The results indicated that the inoperability ranking of all economic sectors is the same under the three climate scenarios.

Although reservoir operation is a potential adaptation option, earlier studies explicitly demonstrated only its historical quantitative effects. Therefore, this article evaluated the possibility of reservoir operation from an adaptation viewpoint for regulating the future flow using the H08 global hydrological model with the Chao Phraya River basin as a case study. This basin is the largest river system in Thailand and has often been affected by extreme weather challenges in the past. Future climate scenarios were constructed from the bias-corrected outputs of three general circulation models from 2080 to 2099 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The important conclusions that can be drawn from this study are as follows: (i) the operation of existing and hypothetical (i.e., construction under planning) reservoirs cannot reduce the future high flows below the channel carrying capacity, although it can increase low flows in the basin. This indicates that changes in the magnitude of future high flow due to climate change are likely to be larger than those achieved by reservoir operation and there is a need for other adaptation options. (ii) A combination of reservoir operation and afforestation was considered as an adaptation strategy, but the magnitude of the discharge reduction in the wet season was still smaller than the increase caused by warming. This further signifies the necessity of combining other structural, as well as non-structural, measures. Overall, this adaptation approach for assessing the effect of reservoir operation in reducing the climate change impacts using H08 model can be applied not only in the study area but also in other places where climate change signals are robust.","[Gopalan, Saritha Padiyedath; Hanasaki, Naota] Natl Inst Environm Studies NIES, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Champathong, Adisorn] Royal Irrigat Dept, Bangkok, Thailand; [Tebakari, Taichi] Toyama Prefectural Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Imizu, Toyama, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Toyama Prefectural University,"Gopalan, SP (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies NIES, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",charu666@gmail.com,"Hanasaki, Naota/C-2932-2009; GOPALAN, SARITHA PADIYEDATH/AAB-5484-2019","Hanasaki, Naota/0000-0002-5092-7563; GOPALAN, SARITHA PADIYEDATH/0000-0002-6226-092X",Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA),Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA),This study was carried out as a part of the research project entitled Advancing Co-Design of Integrated Strategies with Adaptation to Climate Change in Thailand (ADAP-T) supported by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).,,69,9,9,3,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-6087,1099-1085,,HYDROL PROCESS,Hydrol.

As a result, many efforts are underway to define whether any given water project decreases or further increases water users' vulnerability to climate change, especially in the agricultural sector. A number of challenges in making these assessments have been routinely discussed, including a lack of yardsticks, varying local circumstances, and the role of subjective judgment. However, their common assumption is that maladaptation constitutes, at least in theory, a phenomenon that can ultimately be fully objectified and agreed upon through scientific data. By contrast, our qualitative comparative analysis advances a non-positivist conception of maladaptation. By comparing three water projects aiming at climate change adaptation in South Africa (Western Cape), Spain (Andalusia) and France (Occitanie), we argue that qualifying (mal)adaptation is an inescapably political process as much as a scientific endeavour. As a consequence, we advocate for putting more scholarly emphasis on the governance of adaptation projects, especially the capacity of governance arrangements to produce legitimate compromises between multiple policy domains and actors; to enhance higher level conflict management when necessary; and to ensure regular policy evaluation with an effective bearing on subsequent policy decisions.","[Boutroue, B.; Bourblanc, M.; Mayaux, P-L; Ghiotti, S.] CIRAD, Dept Environm & Soc, Montpellier, France; [Hrabanski, M.] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, UMR ARTDEV, Montpellier, France",CIRAD; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier,"Hrabanski, M (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, UMR ARTDEV, Montpellier, France.",marie.hrabanski@cirad.fr,,"Boutroue, Betina/0000-0002-6791-1808",TYPOCLIM Project -'Typology and assessment of policy instruments to promote agricultural adaptation to climate change' - MUSE (Montpellier University of Excellence); French National Research Agency under the Investments for the Future Programme [ANR-16-IDEX-0006],TYPOCLIM Project -'Typology and assessment of policy instruments to promote agricultural adaptation to climate change' - MUSE (Montpellier University of Excellence); French National Research Agency under the Investments for the Future Programme(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This article is supported by the TYPOCLIM Project -`Typology and assessment of policy instruments to promote agricultural adaptation to climate change', funded by MUSE (Montpellier University of Excellence) and the French National Research Agency under the Investments for the Future Programme (ANR-16-IDEX-0006).

In response, many cities have adopted climate change adaptation strategies, which is also the case in the Czech Republic. Although adaptation planning should be prospective, requiring long-term, future-oriented ap-proaches, the use of future scenarios have not been fully acknowledged yet. In this methodo-logical paper, we introduce a combined approach for delivering spatially explicit future land use/ land cover (LULC) scenarios developed as supporting tools for adaptation planning in three major Czech cities-Prague, Brno, and Ostrava. The methodological approach consists of (1) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) downscaled to city level, to capture underpinning social, envi-ronmental, and economic dynamics; (2) collaborative processes with stakeholders; and (3) computer modelling of LULC scenarios. While collaborative process collects the perceptions of local needs, challenges, and opportunities, spatially explicit modelling of LULC changes allows for an easy-to-read visualization of the plausible futures. Nesting the scenarios in SSPs makes them consistent with global socioeconomic drivers. The introduced methodological approach can support adaptation planning by engaging stakeholders directly in the scenario building process, to elaborate on plausible future urban developments while considering an array of different stakes and challenges.","[Sucha, Lenka; Vano, Simeon; Duchkova, Helena; Lorencova, Eliska Krkoska] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Vano, Simeon; Jancovic, Martin] Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Tr A Hlinku 1, Nitra 94974, Slovakia; [Jancovic, Martin] State Nat Conservancy Slovak Republ, Tajovskeho 323, Banska Bystrica 97401, Slovakia; [Aubrechtova, Tereza] Univ Ostrava, Dept Phys Geog & Geoecol, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71200, Czech Republic; [Basta, Petr] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic; [Duchkova, Helena] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Humanities, Patkova 2137-5, Prague 18200 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra; University of Ostrava; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Charles University Prague,"Sucha, L (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.",sucha.l@czechglobe.cz,"Duchkova, Helena/HCH-9218-2022; Suchá, Lenka/AFS-1548-2022","Suchá, Lenka/0000-0002-8183-0473; Vano, Simeon/0000-0001-8676-9459; Rumanova, Tereza/0000-0002-1181-4224; Duchkova, Helena/0000-0002-5022-8180",Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [TL01000238],Technology Agency of the Czech Republic,"We would like to thank our partners at municipal bodies of Prague, Brno and Ostrava and to all stakeholders in pilot cities who were part of the participatory process.

The sector is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. This study aims to examine the determinants of adaptation strategies to climate change among the smallholder farmers in Adama District, Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect quantitative data using questionnaire with 351 randomly selected smallholder farmers. To collect qualitative data focus group discussions, key informant interviews and field observations were also used. Triangulated with thematic analysis, descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression model were used for the analysis. Findings The result indicated that the majority of the smallholder farmers use at least one climate change adaptation strategy in their local areas though the strategy is generally weak. In this regard, some of the dominant climate change adaptation activities identified in the study area are using improved crop varieties, planting trees, watershed management, adjusting planting date and terracing. The result from binary logistic regression model showed that age and sex of household head, as well as their education, family size, access to agricultural extension services and training on climate change significantly influence the practices of adaptation measures.

We introduce a modelling framework that addresses these issues. To illustrate our approach, we simulate a group of farms representing a catchment in the East Anglian region of England, with and without water trading (spatially multi-scale). Different modelling approaches are used to represent weather (year-to-year variation) and climate effects (predicted crop yields for the 2020s and 2050s). Dynamics are introduced by (i) allowing the outcome of previous years' decisions to inform decision making in subsequent years and (ii) by modelling large investment decisions (buildings and irrigation), as longer term commitments. Variability and uncertainty are captured by running the framework multiple times with inputs drawn at random. Example results demonstrate that farm-level allocation of abstraction licences constrains water abstraction at the catchment level-with water trading summer water abstraction increased from 66.4% (compared to 62.2% with no trading) for the baseline period, through 75.6% (65.9%), for the 2020s, to 93.2% (72.5%) for the 2050s. Hence, modelling the catchment as a single unit would have over-estimated water abstraction. Under the model assumptions investment in winter abstraction capacity was not justified. Due to their high value, irrigation levels were maintained on potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), resulting in relatively stable crop areas over time; in contrast, for the lower value sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) yields and areas were more variable due to their dependence on variable weather and surplus water availability. There was no major shift from native cropping to exotic crops (oilseed rape [Brassica napus L.] to sunflowers [Helianthus annuus L.]) in either the 2020s or 2050s. We conclude that omitting farm-level constraints in regional models may overestimate the degree of adaptation possible and underestimate the negative effects of climate change. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It follows that we also find that input demand functions are climate sensitive. Efforts to intensify farming in undeveloped regions should focus on places with suitable soils and especially climate.

Water law has thus become one vehicle of climate change adaptation. Legal research into the intersections between climate change and water law in the United States must contend with the facts that: (a) climate change affects different parts of this large country differently; and (b) U.S. water law is itself a complicated subject, with each state having its own laws for surface water and groundwater and the federal government playing a significant role in interstate and international waters, in building and managing large water infrastructure, and in creating water rights for Native American tribes and other federal reservations. Within this complexity, legal research to date has tended to focus on the law governing surface water in the American West, enumerating various problems with the prior appropriation doctrine as the West grows hotter and drier and offering multiple suggestions to increase legal flexibility so that western water can be re-allocated to reflect changing social-ecological realities. These suggestions extend to new, more comprehensive, and more adaptive water governance approaches. Far less legal scholarship has focused on eastern riparian rights, the various groundwater doctrines at play in the United States, or the increasing role of tribes in managing water resources, but these areas warrant future attention.

It is based on document analysis and stakeholder questionnaires. The questionnaires targeted three stakeholder groups, all engaged in the communication and the use of climate scenario information: climate scenario producers; impact, adaptation and vulnerability (IAV) experts; and policy-makers. The respondents were asked to identify issues associated with the communication of scenarios and other needs pertaining to the usefulness and availability of such information. Despite the relatively long history of climate change adaptation in the three countries, climate scenarios are not utilised to their full potential. Climate scenarios have been used in awareness raising, problem understanding and strategy development. However, far less examples can be found on adaptation actions, particularly on harnessing the benefits of climate change. The communication between climate scenario producers and IAV experts functions well; however, communication between climate researchers and policy-makers is less efficient. Each country has developed boundary services to enhance dissemination of the climate scenario information to policy-makers. They are cost-efficient but do not necessarily enhance the comprehension of the information and encourage the actual dialogue between scenario producers and the end-users. Further translation of scenario information to impact and vulnerability estimates together with established boundary work could improve the use of climate research information. As adaptation policy in these countries further progresses towards implementation, there are increasing expectations of support from research, further challenging the communication of climate scenarios.","[Pilli-Sihvola, Karoliina; Tuomenvirta, Heikki] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Pilli-Sihvola, Karoliina; Ollikainen, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Helsinki, Finland; [van Oort, Bob] CCICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo Sente, Oslo, Norway; [Hanssen-Bauer, Inger] Telemark Univ Coll, Hallvard Eikas Plass, Porsgrunn, Norway; [Hanssen-Bauer, Inger] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Oslo, Norway; [Rummukainen, Markku] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Lund, Sweden",Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Helsinki; University College of Southeast Norway; Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Lund University,"Pilli-Sihvola, K (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland.",karoliina.pilli-sihvola@fmi.fi,"van Oort, Bob/J-8617-2016","van Oort, Bob/0000-0001-9508-1162; Ollikainen, Markku/0000-0003-3333-4683",Academy of Finland; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Research Council of Norway through CIRCLE-Nordic call; Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (Mistra); Nessling Foundation,Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Research Council of Norway through CIRCLE-Nordic call(Research Council of Norway); Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (Mistra); Nessling Foundation,"This paper is a result of the CARePol project, which was supported by the Academy of Finland, The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and the Research Council of Norway through CIRCLE-Nordic call.

We worked with a sample of towns situated in the eastern regions of the Czech Republic and employed the national classification of adaptation priority areas and related threats. Using the analysis we detected substantial differences in approaches employed in adaptation among individual towns. We also ascertained that the majority of towns studied have not yet formulated adaptation strategies and are unprepared for upcoming changes. At the same time, it is demonstrated that existing adaptation strategies have clearly supported and increased the extent of planned adaptation measures. Studied towns have focused their principal attention on water management as a key adaptation priority, and sufficient reflection has not been given to population health, agriculture, forestry and tourism. To this extent, the towns selected do not follow either national or European adaptation strategies and a rather path-dependent logic prevailed.

A range of 'international best practice' approaches have been proposed to address these, including concepts such as inte-grated coastal zone management, ecosystem-based management and managed retreat. However, such supposedly mobile and transferable approaches often fail to properly account for the differences between local contexts, leading to implementation failures. In response, this paper mobilises the conceptual lenses of 'situated practices' and 'path dependencies' to demonstrate how the emergence and evolution of approaches to planning in coastal communities can generate policy trajectories that constrain the latitude for alternative options. The paper ex-plores the trajectories of coastal planning on the island of Sylt in Germany and Castlemaine Harbour in Ireland. It identifies important path dependencies associated with institutional inertia, collective memories of past hazards and management strategies, the legacies of previous coastal management measures and of coastal development, and the importance of property relations. Overall, the analysis highlights the importance of appreciating the local and historical distinctiveness of coastal areas and communities. It shows that critical attention to context and creating inclusive fora for debate is required to advance climate change adaptation measures that offer oppor-tunities to unlock historically anchored path dependencies which hamper flexibility and reduce resilience.","[Tubridy, Fiadh] Maynooth Univ, Dept Geog, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Lennon, Mick; Scott, Mark] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Architecture Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin, Ireland",Maynooth University; University College Dublin,"Lennon, M (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Architecture Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin, Ireland.",michael.lennon@ucd.ie,,,Irish Centre for Applied Geo-sciences/Science Foundation Ireland under Science Foundation Ireland [13/RC2092],Irish Centre for Applied Geo-sciences/Science Foundation Ireland under Science Foundation Ireland,Funding statement This work was supported by the Irish Centre for Applied Geo-sciences/Science Foundation Ireland under Science Foundation Ireland Grant 13/RC2092,,95,0,0,5,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,APR 1,2022,220,,,,,,,,106095,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106095,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106095,,FEB 2022,11,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,0O9QD,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000783857400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

It exemplifies the assessment of urban vulnerability to climate change by an integrated approach. The results indicate that Beijing is highly exposed to multiple climate threats in the context of global climate change, specifically urban heat waves, urban drainage floods and drought. Vulnerabilities to the climatic threats of heat waves, drainage floods and droughts have increased by 5%-15% during the period of 2008-2016 in Beijing.

However, it is important to recognise that knowledge has always been contested and contingent. This is particularly salient concerning climate change, where multiple truth claims compete in the media, politics, and social movements. One means of addressing this is through deliberation, where it is argued that emotional interpretations of information and lack of trust in authority can be alleviated through transparent democratic processes. Investigating a case study of climate change adaptation in a regional Australian community, we argue that while deliberation may be the preferred method of building community support, emotions can also be employed to undermine scientific authority and build a shared truth among those who see themselves as victims of the process. To this end, we suggest that more radically democratic models are needed to address climate change.","[Bowden, Vanessa; Nyberg, Daniel] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Wright, Christopher] Univ Sydney, Sydney Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Newcastle; University of Sydney,"Bowden, V (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.",vanessa.bowden@newcastle.edu.au,"Nyberg, Daniel/ABE-2371-2021","Nyberg, Daniel/0000-0002-7144-1343; Wright, Christopher/0000-0001-8624-9605; Bowden, Vanessa/0000-0002-6642-2826",,,,,49,2,2,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

Such changes in land use affect the provision of various ecosystem goods and services. Therefore, it is likely that adaptation measures may result in synergies and trade-offs between a range of ecosystems goods and services. An integrative land use modelling approach is presented to assess such impacts for the European Union. A reference scenario accounts for current trends in global drivers and includes a number of important policy developments that correspond to on-going changes in European policies. The reference scenario is compared to a policy scenario in which a range of measures is implemented to regulate flood risk and protect soils under conditions of climate change. The impacts of the simulated land use dynamics are assessed for four key indicators of ecosystem service provision: flood risk, carbon sequestration, habitat connectivity and biodiversity. The results indicate a large spatial variation in the consequences of the adaptation measures on the provisioning of ecosystem services. Synergies are frequently observed at the location of the measures itself, whereas trade-offs are found at other locations. Reducing land use intensity in specific parts of the catchment may lead to increased pressure in other regions, resulting in trade-offs. Consequently, when aggregating the results to larger spatial scales the positive and negative impacts may be off-set, indicating the need for detailed spatial assessments. The modelled results indicate that for a careful planning and evaluation of adaptation measures it is needed to consider the trade-offs accounting for the negative effects of a measure at locations distant from the actual measure. Integrated land use modelling can help land use planning in such complex trade-off evaluation by providing evidence on synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services, different policy fields and societal demands.","[Verburg, Peter H.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koomen, Eric] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koomen, Eric] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Business Adm, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hilferink, Maarten] ObjectVis BV, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Perez-Soba, Marta; Lesschen, Jan Peter] Alterra, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Wageningen University & Research,"Verburg, PH (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Peter.Verburg@ivm.vu.nl,"Verburg, Peter H/Z-1582-2019; Hilferink, Maarten/A-8933-2014; Verburg, Peter h./A-8469-2010","Verburg, Peter h./0000-0002-6977-7104; Lesschen, Jan Peter/0000-0003-1535-8294; Koomen, Eric/0000-0002-0676-1252",,,,,49,33,33,4,96,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

An understanding of perceptions, adaptation strategies, and their determinants including a gender analysis can benefit vulnerable farmers and policy makers. Using a survey of 360 farming household heads and their spouses, this study identified the intra-household perceptions and their determinants, the major strategies adopted by the farmers to adapt to climate change, and the factors that affect their adaptation decision and choice of strategies including the role of intra-household decision making in a drought prone environment of Bangladesh. The adaptation methods identified include short-duration and drought-tolerant rice varieties, supplementary irrigation for crop production, non-rice winter and horticultural crops, and improved channels for irrigation and water harvesting. Discrete choice model results indicate that age, household size, membership in any organization, access to credit, drought severity, amount of cultivated land, and agricultural subsidy significantly influence farmers' adaptation decision and choices. Results reveal that climate change perceptions of husbands and spouses within the same households differ significantly and intra-household decision making plays a significant role in adaptation decision and selection of alternative adaptation strategies. The results would improve our understanding of farms and farming households and their climate change perceptions and adaptation choices by location and gender, thereby enabling us to outline better strategies to adapt to the changing climate.","[Al-Amin, A.

Are the drivers of these two strategies different? Do the outcomes and drivers vary according to farmland holding size? We investigated these unanswered questions, inspired primarily by a widespread but unverified suggestion that stepping out of farming can be a better option for smallholders. We utilised recent survey data from over eight hundred smallholder households located in climatic hazard-prone areas in Bangladesh. We applied a holistic Driver-Strategy-Outcome analytical framework and rigorous statistical methods, including index-based data aggregation, and Structural Equation Modelling with 'mediation' and 'moderation' analyses. Contrary to widespread spec-ulations, we found that Stepping Out had a large negative effect on smallholders' livelihood Outcomes; while Stepping Up had a moderate, but positive effect. The natural-environmental Drivers of Stepping Up and Stepping Out were similar; however, the psychological-institutional Drivers of each differed, with the same factor acting as a driver for one strategy whilst as a deterrent for the other. We found significant 'mediatory' effects of both the adaptation Strategies on Outcomes as well as significant 'moderation' effects of farmland holding size on the Drivers and Outcomes, with the positive effect of Stepping Up observed for smallholders owing lands of <2.5 acres only. We call for relevant policies and interventions to exercise caution in promoting smallholders' exit from agriculture, and to adopt appropriate mitigating measures to manage such a transition. Moreover, smallholder agricultural development initiatives should not discount even the 'smallest of smallholders' and support them through 'diverse and complementary innovations' as well as 'tailored' institutional support services, especially for those living in proximity to hazard hotspots.

Small and low-lying islands are particularly exposed to natural disasters, and many countries have limited access to water resources. Anthropogenic climate change is expected to further increase these environmental pressures. Any associated engineering response needs to consider the cultural, societal and historical context, and prioritise the agency of local communities to determine their preferred outcomes. It follows that Humanitarian Engineering, a discipline centred around strengths-based and context-appropriate solutions, has an important role to play in climate change adaptation. In this review, the interplay between hydroclimatology, geography and water security in the Pacific Islands is described and projected climate shifts summarised to highlight future adaptation challenges. A key source of uncertainty relates to the dynamics of two convergence zones that largely drive weather patterns. A broad overview of societal factors that present challenges and opportunities for Humanitarian Engineers is given. Finally, actions are recommended to inform climate change adaptation given the scientific uncertainty around hydrologic risks, and outline lessons for best practice Humanitarian Engineering in the Pacific. Enhancing data sharing, building resilience to climate variability and integrating traditional knowledge with convention engineering methods should be key areas of focus.","[Johnson, Fiona; Higgins, Philippa; Stephens, Clare] UNSW Sydney, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Water Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Johnson, F (corresponding author), UNSW Sydney, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Water Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",f.johnson@unsw.edu.au,"; Johnson, Fiona/B-4864-2010","Stephens, Clare/0000-0002-7387-0563; Higgins, Philippa/0000-0002-6626-1401; Johnson, Fiona/0000-0001-5708-1807",,,,,160,2,2,6,16,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",2040-2244,2408-9354,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

Three main categories are examined. First, climate change affecting disaster risk and disasters, demonstrating too much emphasis on the single hazard driver and diminisher of climate change. Second, cross-sectoral approaches, for which the SFDRR treads carefully, thereby unfortunately entrenching artificial differences and divisions, although appropriately offering plenty of support to other sectors from disaster risk reduction. Third, implementation, for which climate change plays a suitable role without being overbearing, but for which other hazard influencers should have been treated similarly. Overall, the mentions of climate change within the SFDRR put too much emphasis on the hazard part of disaster risk. Instead, within the context of the three global sustainable development processes that seek agreements in 2015, climate change could have been used to further support an all-vulnerabilities and all-resiliences approach. That could be achieved by placing climate change adaptation as one subset within disaster risk reduction and climate change mitigation as one subset within sustainable development.","[Kelman, Ilan] UCL Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kelman, Ilan] UCL, Inst Global Hlth, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kelman, Ilan] Norwegian Inst Int Affairs NUPI, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Kelman, I (corresponding author), UCL Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, London WC1E 6BT, England.",ilan_kelman@hotmail.com,,"Kelman, Ilan/0000-0002-4191-6969",,,,,44,104,107,5,70,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2095-0055,2192-6395,,INT J DISAST RISK SC,Int.

Generally, the research on this tends to focus on assessing how decision-makers navigate elements of risk and uncertainty in deciding to what extent they should adapt their practice if at all, however, scientific researchers also have a key role to play in supporting these adaptation decisions. Given the applied nature of adaptation research, we argue that an examination of the roles and responsibilities of researchers is critical to understanding the ethical aspects of professional research practice in the adaptation context. This includes identifying how researchers can best support adaptation, and exploring the responsibilities that researchers have, not only to decision-makers but also to the broader membership of the adaptation community. In this paper we examine the ethical responsibility of researchers in supporting decision-makers to adapt to climate change, using agricultural producers as a case-study and focal group. Specifically, in undertaking this examination of risk and responsibility in adaptation research and decision-making, we use the lens of professional ethics to outline how research might better contribute to informed adaptation. We argue that clarifying the distinction between the research and operational aspects of agricultural adaptation, and how the interface between the two is disclosed, is critical. We also describe and explore the ethical considerations of researchers associated with stakeholder engagement in relation to adaptation science, and identify the need for institutional innovation for more effective engagement. In doing so, we seek to demonstrate how ethical research practice can support greater alignment of science and public values in agricultural adaptation, thus increasing the likely success of decisions.

However, there is limited understanding about potential complementarity between management practices that promote adaptation and mitigation, and limited basis to account for greenhouse gas emission reductions in this sector. The good news is that the global research community could provide the support needed to address these issues through further research linking adaptation and mitigation. In addition, a small shift in strategy by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and ongoing assistance from agricultural organizations could produce a framework to move the research and development from concept to reality.

Although there is a growing scientific consensus about the impact of climate change, efforts so far in Nigeria to deal with these impacts are still rudimentary and not properly coordinated. There is little evidence of any pragmatic approach towards tracking climate change in order to develop an evidence base on which to formulate national adaptation strategies. Although Nigeria is not alone in this regard, the paper asserts that National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy could help address this situation by guiding the integration of climate change adaptation into government policies, strategies, and programs, with particular focus on the most vulnerable groups and the agricultural sectors. There is an urgent need to adopt abatement strategies that will provide economic incentives to reduce the risk from disasters, such as developing agricultural practices that are more resilient to a changing climate.","[Onyekuru, N.

Building on the base of existing climate projections, scenarios, and economic and social science literature, we form an assessment of the capacity of each forest owner typology to influence their solution spaces into the future. Different management structures have strengths in different areas - while industrial forest managers may be able to utilise emerging technologies better than their smaller scale counterparts for example, they may be less agile and flexible. The sector as a whole may benefit from working collectively to draw on the respective strengths of each typology.

We first select 12 of the country's most exposed coastal municipalities using a Municipal Exposure Index (MEI). Then, we conduct a content analysis of the communal regulatory plans (CRPs) using a presumed exposure analysis, which assumes that the inventory of assets within LECZ, according to the 2017 census, is a proxy of the exposure. Then, we conduct a more refined hazard exposure analysis by comparing changes in flooding levels between a historical period (1985-2004) and the RCP8.5 scenario (2026-2045). Using the latter approach, we show that flooding could affect large portions of the municipalities' housing areas (3.7%), critical facilities (14.6%), and wetlands (22.7%) in the period 2026-2045. In the presumed exposure analysis, these percentages rise to 7.5%, 23.9%, and 24.9%, respectively. We find that CRPs also allow for a densification of exposed residential areas, whose density would increase by 9.2 times, on average, between the historical period and the RCP8.5 scenario. Additionally, only four municipalities define floodable zones as risk areas. Lastly, the difficulty in updating CRPs and their antiquity -21.25 years old on average could explain their ineffectiveness in implementing climate change adaptation strategies.","[Leon, Jorge] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria UTFSM, Dept Arquitectura, Ave Espana 1680, Valparaiso 2390123, Chile; [Winckler, Patricio] Univ Valparaiso, Escuela Ingn Civil Ocean, Ave Brasil 1786, Valparaiso 2362844, Chile; [Winckler, Patricio; Vicuna, Magdalena] Res Ctr Integrated Disaster Risk Management CIGID, Vicuna Mackena 4860, Macul 7820436, Chile; [Winckler, Patricio] Ctr Observac Marino Estudios Riesgo Ambiente Cost, Valparaiso 2362844, Chile; [Vicuna, Magdalena; Guzman, Simon] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile UC, Inst Estudios Urbanos & Territoriales, Comendador 1916, Providencia 7520245, Chile; [Larraguibel, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Geog, Ave Brasil 2241, Valparaiso 2362807, Chile",,"Vicuna, M (corresponding author), Res Ctr Integrated Disaster Risk Management CIGID, Vicuna Mackena 4860, Macul 7820436, Chile.;Vicuna, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile UC, Inst Estudios Urbanos & Territoriales, Comendador 1916, Providencia 7520245, Chile.",mvicunad@uc.cl,,,CIGIDEN [ANID/FONDAP/1522A0005],CIGIDEN,"J.L., P.W. and M.V. were funded by the Research Center for Integrated Disaster Risk Management (CIGIDEN), ANID/FONDAP/1522A0005.

Similarly, adaptation research can inform the understanding of the role of disturbance and disasters in transitions, and increase attention to vulnerabilities, inequality and uneven impacts of transitions.

Our indicator-based approach used a multicriteria decision-making technique and drew from the vulnerability concept of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes components of adaptive capacity, exposure, and sensitivity. To conduct a vulnerability assessment in the Han River basin, South Korea, datasets for the selected indicators from the IPCC vulnerability concept were used in conjunction with simulation results obtained from a hydrologic model. The datasets includes the existing national statistical database, climate change scenarios from representative concentration pathways (RCPs), scenarios for climate change adaptation, and mitigation strategies from shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). With six plausible combinations of the RCPs and SSPs, hydrological simulations using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) were carried out. The results for the Han River basin indicate that, of the three components of vulnerability, the greatest differences between scenarios were associated with the exposure component, which is influenced by physical climate and environmental changes. Furthermore, it was shown that vulnerability can vary with different SSPs as much as it can with different RCPs. The vulnerability results obtained with the plausible SSP scenarios markedly differed from those with the historical socioeconomic data (i.e., no SSP).

Inter-institutional networks that enable institutions to adapt and the factors that hinder smooth coordination are poorly understood. Using water governance in India as an example of a complex top-down bureaucratic system that requires effective networks between all key institutions, this research unravels the barriers to adaptation by combining quantitative Internet data mining and qualitative analysis of interviews with representatives from twenty-six key institutions operating at the national level. Institutions online presence shows a disconnect in the institutional discourse between climate change and water with institutions such as the Ministries of Water Resources, Earth Sciences and Agriculture, indicating a lesser involvement compared to institutions such as the Ministries of Finance, External Affairs, Planning Commission. The online documents also indicate a more centralised inter-institutional network, emanating from or pointing to a few key institutions including the Planning Commission and Ministry of Environment and Forests. However, the interviews suggest more complex relational dynamics between institutions and also demonstrate a gap between the aspirational ideals of the National Water Mission under the National Action Plan on Climate Change and the realities of climate change adaptation. This arises from institutional barriers, including lengthy bureaucratic processes and systemic failures, that hinder effective inter-institutional networks to facilitate adaptation. The study provides new understanding of the involvement and barriers of complex multi-layered institutions in climate change adaptation.","[Azhoni, Adani; Holman, Ian] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Jude, Simon] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Inst Resilient Futures, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Cranfield University; Cranfield University,"Holman, I (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",a.azhoni@cranfield.ac.uk; i.holman@cranfield.ac.uk,"Holman, Ian/A-7108-2010; Azhoni, A./S-6803-2017","Holman, Ian/0000-0002-5263-7746; Azhoni, A./0000-0001-9198-3273; Jude, Simon/0000-0001-6737-7476",Government of India [11016/10/2010]; UK-Irrigation Association for the Jack Wright Travel Scholarship; UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/1022329/1]; EPSRC/ESRC International Centre for Infrastructure Futures (ICIF) grant [EP/K012347/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K012347/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I022329/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K012347/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/I022329/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Government of India; UK-Irrigation Association for the Jack Wright Travel Scholarship; UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); EPSRC/ESRC International Centre for Infrastructure Futures (ICIF) grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We acknowledge the Government of India for sponsoring this research (No.11016/10/2010), and the UK-Irrigation Association for the Jack Wright Travel Scholarship and the UK Natural Environment Research Council (grant number NE/1022329/1) for supporting the fieldwork.

This could lead to chaos and extensive socioeconomic loss caused by climate change-related disasters in the rapidly expanding urban areas of the Middle East. The main scope of this study is to review the key impacts of climate change in urban areas of the Middle East, the vulnerability of critical urban infrastructure and systems, and to develop climate change adaptation strategies to create more robust urban environments that are resilient to both gradual climate change-driven events and extreme events. By efficiently preparing for the imminent threats posed by climate change, social and economic stability can be preserved, enabling growth in a changing environment.

Many climate adaptation science organizations and agencies now focus on actionable science, a model that aims to have greater impacts on policy and practice than traditionally produced and distributed science. However, evaluations of research projects are needed to examine and verify the impact of climate science on adaptation and society. Better understanding the types and mechanisms of impact will allow organizations to design, fund, and facilitate more useful climate adaptation science. Many existing actionable science evaluation approaches are qualitative in nature and take considerable time and effort for funders and administrators to implement. Quantitative methods could provide a valuable option for evaluation, specifically for making com-parisons across many projects. Thus, we have designed a quantitative survey instrument for measuring the use of climate adaptation science. We designed the survey using best practices and iterative input from social scientists as well as climate adaptation scientists and practitioners. We then distributed the survey to a sample of users of climate adaptation science and analyzed those responses to further refine the survey. Quantitative and quali-tative results show that use of climate adaptation science may be described as either individual use or organi-zational use, which contrasts with popular models of use in existing evaluation literature. The survey is made available for future efforts to evaluate and improve climate adaptation science and to advance efforts to measure different kinds of use.","[Courtney, Steph L.; McNeal, Karen S.] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Hyman, Amanda A.; Armsworth, Paul R.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN USA; [Maudlin, Lindsay C.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Iowa State University,"Courtney, SL (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",stephcourtneyphd@gmail.com; ahyman2@vols.utk.edu; ksm0041@auburn.edu; maudlin@iastate.edu; p.armsworth@utk.edu,,"Courtney, Stephanie/0000-0001-9411-1278","National Science Foundation [DGE-1414475, DGE-1922687]; United States Geological Survey [G20AC00121]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); United States Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey),"Funding The lead author was supported by the National Science Foundation, grants DGE-1414475 and DGE-1922687, and the study was funded by the United States Geological Survey, grant No. G20AC00121.",,49,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

This issue has been identified as a major barrier to successful climate change adaptation outcomes and is emphasised within the water resource management and agricultural sectors because of high uncertainty surrounding precipitation projections. This paper details the outcomes of a survey and workshop aimed at better understanding this gap. To bridge the gap, it is recommended that communication and packaging of climate information be improved via a formalised 'knowledge broker'. It is also suggested that a 'terms of reference' for key climate change-related terms be developed and agreed upon by both climate science providers and end users to reduce the misuse of terminology and subsequent confusion. Further, it is recommended that additional research be conducted into natural variability and baseline risk to provide a realistic background on which climate change projections and associated uncertainties are assessed. Finally, for successful climate change adaptation, new tools and methods are needed that deal explicitly with end user needs and the practical limitations end users face (e.g. time, funding, human resources, politics) when attempting to make robust decisions under climate change-related uncertainty.","[Kiem, Anthony S.; Verdon-Kidd, Danielle C.; Austin, Emma K.] Univ Newcastle, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, CWCL, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Kiem, AS (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, CWCL, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",anthony.kiem@newcastle.edu.au,"VERDON-KIDD, DANIELLE CHERIE/G-7688-2013; Kiem, Anthony/D-9307-2013","VERDON-KIDD, DANIELLE CHERIE/0000-0001-5334-4251; Kiem, Anthony/0000-0002-3994-6958",Australian government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency); NCCARF,Australian government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency)(Australian Government); NCCARF,This work was carried out with financial support from the Australian government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) and NCCARF.

It argues that mainstreaming operationalization necessitates a methodology that focuses on the challenges in applying the approach and an analytical framework that can examine the mainstreaming process from an institutional perspective. Design/methodology/approach - This paper applied triangulation by data method (i.e. document review, interview, survey and key informant consultations) and incorporated the scorecard approach in developing the four-stage mixed methodology. It used a modified Institutional Analysis and Development framework as primary analytical guide and applied the case study methodology for structure and focus in relation to data collection activities. Findings - This paper devised the four-stage mixed methodology and successfully applied it in examining the challenges in mainstreaming CCA into local land use planning in Albay, Philippines. Using the methodology, this paper developed 20 quantitative mainstreaming indicators and generated qualitative analyses to assess the state of play of the challenges in local mainstreaming of CCA. Results suggest that mainstreaming challenges exist within a certain spectrum, with one end composed of barriers to, and the other, opportunities for CCA. Furthermore, the challenges occur at varying degrees of severity depending on the conditions that surround them. Research limitations/implications - This paper is limited to illustrating the process involved in developing the four-stage mixed methodology and presents only a brief discussion of the quantitative and qualitative results. Practical implications - Although the methodology is at its initial stages of development, it generated results that can help analysts, planners and decision-makers: determine the nature of the challenges in mainstreaming CCA, thereby understand the mainstreaming process; prioritize the mainstreaming challenges to address; and design strategies that will maximize the use of limited resources (i.e. utilizing the opportunities to overcome the existing barriers), among others. Originality/value - The four-stage mixed methodology was developed to aid analysts, planners and decision-makers determine the state-of-play of the challenges in mainstreaming CCA and make informed decisions in overcoming these challenges. Thus, the mixed method can be a useful tool in advancing the operationalization of the mainstreaming approach.","[Cuevas, Sining C.; Peterson, Ann] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Morrison, Tiffany] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Robinson, Catherine] CSIRO, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland; James Cook University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Cuevas, SC (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",sining.cuevas@uq.net.au,"Robinson, Cathy/D-3349-2011; Morrison, Tiffany/D-4460-2012","Robinson, Cathy/0000-0002-3453-572X; Morrison, Tiffany/0000-0001-5433-037X",CSIRO-UQ INRM PhD Scholarship,CSIRO-UQ INRM PhD Scholarship,Financial support of the CSIRO-UQ INRM PhD Scholarship is gratefully acknowledged.,,71,5,5,0,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Coastal small towns of less than 10,000 are therefore at a significant disadvantage compared to larger settlements when it comes to adaptation. One way to begin to overcome this disadvantage is to compare coastal small towns in order to identify efficiencies and support knowledge sharing. In this article we present and analyse five case studies of coastal small towns: Fuvemeh, Ghana; Kiyu, Uruguay; Hanko, Finland; Lemvig, Denmark; and Nome, Alaska, USA. A number of key outcomes and lessons were identified which highlights the need for a formal network of international coastal small towns to encourage and develop knowledge sharing practices going forward. A further lesson is the importance of using a range of indicators in order to establish the regional/national importance of a town. Basing this solely on population size can result in an erroneous interpretation of the significance (and therefore adaptive capacity) of a coastal small town. Finally, despite many barriers to adaptation in coastal small towns, being small offers some potential advantages, such as the possibility of being able to form a community consensus more easily, using 3D visualisations for adaptation planning, and having managed realignment as a realistic management option. It is imperative that climate change resilience in coastal small towns is increased by focussing on overcoming barriers and developing appropriate adaptation approaches by governments, non-governmental organisations, business, and researchers.","[Fitton, James M.; Zhang, Ting-Ting] Aalborg Univ, Dept Planning, Aalborg, Denmark; [Fitton, James M.] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI, Ringaskiddy, Cork, Ireland; [Addo, Kwasi Appeaning; Jayson-Quashigah, Philip-Neri] Univ Ghana, Inst Environm & Sanitat Studies IESS, Accra, Ghana; [Nagy, Gustavo J.; Gutierrez, Ofelia; Panario, Daniel; Verocai, Jose E.] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, IECA, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Carro, Inti] Minist Ambiente, Direcc Nacl Cambio Climat, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Seijo, Leo] OPP, Programa Desarrollo & Gest Subnac, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Segura, Carolina] Ministerio Ambiente, Direcc Nacl Biodiversidad Serv & Ecosistem, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Luoma, Samrit; Klein, Johannes] Geol Survey Finland, Espoo, Finland; [Birchall, Jeff] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Stempel, Peter] Penn State Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Aalborg University; University College Cork; University of Ghana; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Geological Survey of Finland (GTK); University of Alberta; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Fitton, JM (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, ERI, MaREI, Ctr Beaufort Bldg,Haulbowline Rd, Ringaskiddy, Cork, Ireland.",james.fitton@ucc.ie,"Birchall, S Jeff/HOF-3329-2023; Gutiérrez, Ofelia/C-5763-2016; Panario, Daniel/D-3998-2016","Gutiérrez, Ofelia/0000-0002-1210-9658; Panario, Daniel/0000-0001-7018-8289; Klein, Johannes/0000-0003-0721-4063; Stempel, Peter/0000-0002-0000-4154; Jayson-Quashigah, Philip-Neri/0000-0003-0901-4575; Luoma, Samrit/0000-0002-2309-1916",Aalborg University via the International Postdoctoral Researcher Fund,Aalborg University via the International Postdoctoral Researcher Fund,The Corresponding Author acknowledges support from Aalborg University via the International Postdoctoral Researcher Fund.

Social learning approaches vary, but commonly include cycles of knowledge sharing and joint action to co-create knowledge, relationships, and practices among diverse stakeholders. This results in learning and change that goes beyond the individual into communities, networks, or systems. Many authors have focused on analysis of case studies to better understand the contexts in which such learning occurs. In this paper, we look across this literature to draw out lessons for international development practice. To support those looking to purposively design social learning interventions for adaptation, we focus on four areas: lessons learned and the principles adopted when using a social learning approach, examples of tools and methods used, approaches to evaluating social learning, and examples of its impact. While we identify important lessons for practice within each of these areas, three cross-cutting themes emerge. These are: the importance of developing a shared view among those initiating learning processes of how change might happen and of how social learning fits within it, linking this locus of desired change to the tools employed; the centrality of skilled facilitation and in particular how practitioners may shift toward being participants in the collective learning process; and the need to attend to social difference, recognizing the complexity of social relations and the potential for less powerful actors to be co-opted in shared decision making.

This structure generates a wide cascade of uncertainties that accumulate with each analytical step, consequently resulting in a wide range of risk estimates. This cascade of uncertainties can suggest that climate change risk assessments are not very useful in the context of decision-making regarding climate adaptation. However, many of the uncertainties revealed in traditionally structured climate risk assessments are not equally relevant to specific decisions, and presenting wide cascades of uncertainties can mask key decision-making parameters. In this paper, we show how the cascade of uncertainty relevant to decision-making can be reduced by applying an uncertainty decomposition approach, which, in study design, initially identifies the uncertainty cascade elements of particular relevance to the focal decision-making context. We compare the full cascade of uncertainties that emerge in a traditional risk assessment based on linked climate scenarios, impact modeling, and damage cost assessment with the uncertainty cascade generated by a detailed assessment of urban flooding risks where the focus is on key uncertainties in decision-making on climate change adaptation. A case study on flooding from extreme precipitation in the Danish city of Odense is used to decompose major sources of uncertainties in the climate modeling, the hydrological modeling, and the damage cost assessment. The decomposition approach reduces the focal range of damage cost estimates by 7-9 M EUR, which corresponds to a 20-24% reduction in the full uncertainty range without the application of the decomposition approach. Assuming that damage cost assessments can provide an indication of how much society should be willing to spend on climate adaptation, a decomposition approach as presented here could assist decision-makers in increasing the economic effectiveness when investing in protective measures.","[Halsnaes, Kirsten; Kaspersen, Per Skougaard] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev CCSD Res Grp, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Kaspersen, PS (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev CCSD Res Grp, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",pskk@dtu.dk,"Kaspersen, Per Skougaard/T-1677-2017; Halsnaes, Kirsten/E-8722-2017","Kaspersen, Per Skougaard/0000-0002-1709-0183; Halsnaes, Kirsten/0000-0001-9106-9190",,,,,41,5,5,2,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Yet, detailed knowledge about whether and how firms take adaptation action against flood hazards, including potential adaptation barriers, is surprisingly thin. We respond to this gap by offering an empirical analysis of small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), one of the front lines of future environmental risk. Drawing on qualitative interviews, our study has two main aims: first, to understand if adaptive action occurs more intensively among firms that previously faced high direct impacts, and second, to shed light on other internal firm characteristics as well as external conditions that determine firm decisions to undertake flood adaptation measures. We find that the majority of firms cope reactively to prevent severe flooding effects. Interestingly, experience with past events, including those of high impact, do not directly lead to long-term strategic adaptation. A lack of business capabilities and financial capacity, combined with insufficient support systems, largely hamper proactive adaptation. This leads to increased risks and selfreinforcing effects, which quickly endanger the future business viability of firms. Future research on adaptation to climate change should seek to improve understanding of adaptive capacities among SMEs, which are quite different from those of large international corporations.","[Leitold, Roxana; Diez, Javier Revilla] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Garschagen, Matthias] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Tran, Van] Univ Econ & Law, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Tran, Van] Vietnam Natl Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",University of Cologne; University of Munich; VNUHCM - University of Economics & Law; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City,"Leitold, R (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",r.leitold@uni-koeln.de; m.garschagen@lmu.de; vantq@uel.edu.vn; j.revilladiez@uni-koeln.de,"Revilla Diez, Javier/J-2392-2019","Revilla Diez, Javier/0000-0003-2065-1380; Leitold, Roxana/0000-0002-2946-6774; Tran, Van Quang/0000-0002-5407-5038","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LZ1703D, 01LZ1703A]; University of Economics and Law, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); University of Economics and Law, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","The contribution to this research by Roxana Leitold, Matthias Garschagen, and Javier Revilla Diez was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (grant numbers 01LZ1703D, 01LZ1703A).

This causality is accompanied by the fact that long-term impacts of climate change are connected with a high-level of uncertainty: complex interactions, feedback loops and underlying nonlinear effects that describe the consequences in this dynamic context. Special modelling approaches are required to increase understanding of these connections with climate change and related global issues, like environmental, social, economic and political matters. Resilience is a concept that can be used when tackling climate change impacts and decrease vulnerabilities. The holistic concept goes parallel with the understanding of managing risks instead of managing disasters! This contribution elaborates now this line of thought and characterizes a risk-oriented modelling and design-oriented perspective. We present overviews on climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR), respectively, and the related frameworks and methods. Finally, we consider the links between the ESPREssO project with the PLACARD experience as coordination action. Similarities and differences are characterized in detail. Based on this specific comparison, we propose a solution-oriented approach which might overcome the distinctions regarding the different approaches of the projects towards a transformational resilience management perspective, summarizing synergies and gaps as an example for integrative risk assessment beyond ESPREssO. We conclude with a comprehensive framework based on the 5 priority areas (referred as mission, terminology introduced in the Horizon Europe Framework) included in the final document of ESPREssO, which could be seen as an example for an integrative risk management combining quantitative and qualitative approaches.","[Hemmers, J.; Pickl, S.; Schwarze, R.; Thiebes, B.] Deutsch Komitee Katastrophenvorsorge eV DKKV, German Comm Disaster Reduct, Kaiser Friedrich Str 13, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Pickl, S.; Loreth, T.] Univ Bundeswehr Munchen, Werner Heisenberg Weg 39, D-85579 Neubiberg, Germany; [Schwarze, R.] Helmholtz Zentrum Umweltforsch UFZ, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Zuccaro, G.] Univ Naples Federico II, PLINIVS Study Ctr, Via Toledo 402, I-80134 Naples, Italy",Bundeswehr University Munich; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Naples Federico II,"Thiebes, B (corresponding author), Deutsch Komitee Katastrophenvorsorge eV DKKV, German Comm Disaster Reduct, Kaiser Friedrich Str 13, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",Benni.Thiebes@dkkv.org,,"Zuccaro, Giulio/0000-0001-8572-067X","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [700342, 653255]",European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme,The work presented in this paper was undertaken as part of the ESPREssO (grant agreement 700342) and PLACARD (grant agreement 653255) projects supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme.,,28,0,0,1,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

The case study demonstrated that current policy instruments were largely unsuccessful, as they focus on post-disaster impacts rather than mitigating the sources of vulnerability which amplify disaster risk. This is a major deterrent in the current integration of schemes due to the failure to incorporate the relevant actors, appropriate strategies, cost-effective financial structures, and suitable institutional arrangements. Without sustained funding, timely information, and community-level support, implementation on the ground will be difficult. Knowing this, there is a need to change the decision-making structure of the proposed integrated system to include three main aspects: (1) addressing underlying factors of vulnerability as a common, integrated policy objective, (2) recognizing a more meaningful inclusion of informal responses, and (3) taking into account future uncertain climate conditions and pending impacts.","[de Leon, E.

With a focus on the Asia-Pacific region, it summarizes the projected biological and socio-economic effects of increased emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) for coastal fisheries and illustrates how all the important dimensions of climate change and ocean acidification can be integrated into the steps involved in the EAFM planning process. The activities required to harness the full potential of an EAFM as an adaptation to climate change and ocean acidification are also described, including: provision of the necessary expertise to inform all stakeholders about the risks to fish habitats, fish stocks and catches due to climate change; promotion of trans-disciplinary collaboration; facilitating the participation of all key stakeholders; monitoring the wider fisheries system for climate impacts; and enhancing resources and capacity to implement an EAFM. By channeling some of the resources available to the Asia-Pacific region to adapt to climate change into an EAFM, developing countries will not only build resilience to the ecological and fisheries effects of climate change, they will also help address the habitat degradation and overfishing presently reducing the productivity of coastal fisheries.

Almost all Indonesian regions are exposed to floods, landslides, soil erosion, drought, and heavy rains. In response to these challenges, the Government of Indonesia has determined integrated watershed management (IWM) to be one of the key programs to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as stated in the updated Indonesian nationally determined contribution (NDC). This paper intends to review Indonesia's efforts in mitigating and adapting to climate change through an IWM approach, and its attempts to realize a decent life and environment for all communities. Improvement of the IWM can be conducted by strengthening the synergy between the responsible institutions for watershed management and the responsible institutions for handling mitigation and adaptation of climate change impacts. In addition, it is important to prioritize coordination, participation, and collaboration not only at the national government level but also at the international level, since numerous problems may exist in the transboundary between countries, and finding solutions should involve planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Implementing the micro watershed model (MWM), supported by culture, local wisdom, and traditional knowledge in communities, can be used to improve the current IWM.","[Basuki, Tyas Mutiara; Nugroho, Hunggul Yudono Setio Hadi; Indrajaya, Yonky; Nugroho, Nunung Puji; Supangat, Agung Budi; Savitri, Endang; Wahyuningrum, Nining; Purwanto; Cahyono, Sigit Andy; Putra, Pamungkas Buana; Adi, Rahardyan Nugroho; Nugroho, Agung Wahyu; Auliyani, Diah; Riyanto, Heru Dwi; Hanindityasari, Luthfi; Nada, Firda Maftukhakh Hilmya] Natl Res & Innovat Agcy, Res Ctr Ecol & Ethnobiol, Jalan Raya Jakarta Bogor Km 46, Cibinong 16911, Indonesia; [Pramono, Irfan Budi; Wuryanta, Agus] Natl Res & Innovat Agcy, Res Ctr Limnol & Water Resources, Jalan Raya Jakarta Bogor Km 46, Cibinong 16911, Indonesia; [Indrawati, Dewi Retna; Yudilastyantoro, Casimerus; Simarmata, Daniel Pandapotan] Natl Res & Innovat Agcy, Res Ctr Populat, Jalan Gatot Subroto Kav 10, Jakarta 12710, Indonesia; [Harjadi, Beny] Natl Res & Innovat Agcy, Res Ctr Geol Disaster, Jalan Sangkuriang,Kompleks BRIN, Bandung 40135, Indonesia",,"Basuki, TM (corresponding author), Natl Res & Innovat Agcy, Res Ctr Ecol & Ethnobiol, Jalan Raya Jakarta Bogor Km 46, Cibinong 16911, Indonesia.",tyas.mutiara.basuki@brin.go.id,,"Simarmata, Daniel Pandapotan/0000-0002-1361-4779; Indrajaya, Yonky/0000-0003-1064-3643; Nugroho, Hunggul Yudono Setio Hadi/0000-0001-9165-0305; Nugroho, Nunung/0000-0002-4000-2778; Supangat, Agung Budi/0000-0002-2093-456X; Savitri, Endang/0000-0002-3974-9700",,,,,324,3,3,15,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2022,14,16,,,,,,,9997,10.3390/su14169997,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14169997,,,41,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4A9JK,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000845407700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is little empirical evidence to guide national planners on how to adapt to climate change, and less still on how to build on past adaptation experiences. The paper investigates the construction of institutional resilience and the process of adaptation to tropical storm risk by the Cayman Islands' Government from 1988 to 2002. It explains the roles of persuasion, exposure and collective action as key components in developing the ability to buffer external disturbance using models of institutional economics and social resilience concepts. The study finds that self-efficacy, strong local and international support networks, combined with a willingness to act collectively and to learn from mistakes appear to have increased the resilience of the Cayman Islands' Government to tropical storm risk. The lessons learned from building resilience to storm risk can contribute to the creation of national level adaptive capacity to climate change, but climate change has to be prioritised before these lessons can be transferred.

Several modifications and adaptations are being made in agricultural practices to cope-up with the declining soil fertility and changing climate scenarios across the world. However, the development and adoption of a single agricultural practice may not help in the holistic mitigation of the impacts of climate change and may result in economic vulnerability to farmers. Therefore, it is high time to develop and recommend a group of agricultural practices i.e., package-based agriculture system having some compatibility for one another in the long term. In this article, a viewpoint has been given on some emergent agronomic practices adopted in the tropical agro-ecosystems which have potential to be developed as compatible agricultural package in combination. Moreover, we also emphasized on exploring some key indicators/environmental factors to assess the compatibility of different agronomic practices. For identifying the research transition from single to combined agricultural practices, a bibliometric analysis was performed by using conservation agriculture (CA), the system of rice intensification (SRI), organic agriculture and soil (biochar) amendment as the major agronomic practices being used for improving agro-ecological services such as improving nutrient cycling, soil fertility and crop productivity as well as climate change mitigation. The results revealed that scientific communities are now paying attention to exploring the role of combined agricultural practices for agro-ecological balance and climate change adaptation. Moreover, the limitations of the adoption of agronomic packages under different agro-climatic zones have also been highlighted. The recommendations of the study would further help the environmental decision-makers to develop potential measures for climate change mitigation without compromising the agro-ecological balance.

Specifically, this paper developed 20 quantitative mainstreaming indicators to assess the state-of-play and the challenges for local mainstreaming. These indicators were classified under three groupings, namely, the information, institutional, and resource capacities of systems. Qualitative analysis of the indicator scores suggested that developing the institutional capacities of local governments is crucial in the local mainstreaming process. Likewise, the results highlighted the institutional issues indicator as the primary barrier in operationalizing the approach. These institutional issues are: fragmented laws and regulations; overlapping policy requirements; and the lack of guidelines for mainstreaming CCA into the local land use plans. Meanwhile, the leadership indicator, as signified by a climate change champion in Albay, was evaluated as an opportunity for local mainstreaming. The champion effectively led the CCA efforts because the existing institutional mechanisms supported the champion's capacity to influence the behavior of people and produce collective action towards CCA.","[Cuevas, Sining C.; Peterson, Ann] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Chamberlain Bldg 35,Rm 541, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Robinson, Catherine] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Dutton Pk, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Morrison, Tiffany H.] James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); James Cook University,"Cuevas, SC (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Chamberlain Bldg 35,Rm 541, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",s.cuevas@uq.edu.au; a.peterson@uq.edu.au; Catherine.Robinson@csiro.au; tiffany.morrison@jcu.edu.au,"Robinson, Cathy/D-3349-2011; Morrison, Tiffany/D-4460-2012","Robinson, Cathy/0000-0002-3453-572X; Morrison, Tiffany/0000-0001-5433-037X",CSIRO-UQ INRM PhD Scholarship,CSIRO-UQ INRM PhD Scholarship,Financial support of the CSIRO-UQ INRM PhD Scholarship is gratefully acknowledged.,,73,13,14,0,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

In the case of India, the rapid urbanization since the end of the twentieth century has exacerbated the impact of climate change at significant environmental, social, and economic costs. Coastal cities in India commonly face climate change related hazards of flooding, rise in sea level, and urban heat islands. This article has assessed the usefulness of scientific information and community knowledge in planning, reviving, and maintaining BGI to make it a successful climate adaptation practice in coastal cities. The existing waterways and water bodies in India's coastal cities are a network linked to the green infrastructure that has been altered by sprawling urbanization. In response to Sustainable Development Goals 11 and 13, the cities of Kochi and Chennai have begun a process of recovering their BGI for greater resilience. This research has detected a shift in the social and administrative perception of BGI as a valuable resource for climate adaptation in recent times. Actions in backwaters and canals, promoted by Chennai and Kochi municipal corporations, present new steps toward mainstreaming adaptation of BGI into the local regulatory framework.","[Sanchez, Francisco Garcia] Univ Cantabria, Dept Geog, Urbanismo & Ordenacio Terr, Avda Castros, S-N, Santander 39005, Cantabria, Spain; [Govindarajulu, Dhanapal] D-37 Sunnyvale Apt, Chennai 600023, India",Universidad de Cantabria,"Sanchez, FG (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Dept Geog, Urbanismo & Ordenacio Terr, Avda Castros, S-N, Santander 39005, Cantabria, Spain.",franciscojose.garcia@unican.es; dhanapal.cws@gmail.com,,,,,,,81,1,1,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,JAN,2023,124,,,,,,,,106455,10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106455,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106455,,,10,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8B9XO,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000917272600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using c. 9000 farm surveys, spatial logit models were applied to explain observed agricultural system choices by climate variables after accounting for soils, geography and other household characteristics. The results reveal that strong neighbourhood effects exist and a spatial re-sampling and bootstrapping approach can remove them. The crops-only system is adopted most frequently in the lowland humid forest, lowland sub-humid, mid-elevation sub-humid Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) and in the highlands in the east and in southern Africa. Integrated farming is favoured in the lowland dry savannah, moist savannah and semi-arid zones in West Africa and eastern coastal zones. A livestock-only system is favoured most in the mid/high-elevation moist savannahs located in southern Africa. Under a hot and dry Canadian Climate Centre (CCC) scenario, the crops-only system should move out from the currently favoured regions of humid zones in the lowlands towards the mid-/high elevations. It declines by more than 5% in the lowland savannahs. Integrated farming should increase across all the AEZs by as much as 5%, but less so in the deserts or in the humid forest zones in the mid-/high elevations. A livestock-only system should increase by 2-5% in the lowland semi-arid, dry savannah and moist savannah zones in the lowlands. Adaptation measures should be carefully scaled, up or down, considering geographic and ecological differentials as well as household characteristics, as proposed in the present study.","Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Nat Resources, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Seo, SN (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Nat Resources, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",niggol.seo@sydney.edu.au,,"Seo, S.

While the need to adapt to the impacts of climate change on biodiversity is widely acknowledged, and the extant literature has identified numerous adaptation options, much less is known about the institutional preconditions that enable or inhibit adaptation in resource management systems. We address this gap by presenting a framework that assesses the readiness of protected area organizations to adapt to climate change. Specifically, using a mixed methods approach including a literature review, online survey, and workshop, we: (1) adapt a framework to assess organizational adaptation readiness in protected areas organizations; (2) use the framework to assess organizational adaptation readiness in Bruce Peninsula National Park (BPNP) and Fathom Five National Marine Park (FFNMP) in Ontario, Canada, and (3) identify ways to strengthen the readiness of protected area organizations to respond to climate change. Results indicate that BPNP/FFNMP have low to moderate overall organizational adaptation readiness, with higher readiness in terms of understanding social-ecological systems (e.g., mapping and monitoring social and ecological values) and lower readiness in terms of collaboration, knowledge management and exchange. Recommendations to increase the organizational adaptation readiness of protected area organizations include increasing collaboration and knowledge exchange with partners, local residents, and Indigenous communities, and educating staff and visitors about climate change impacts.

The intensification of climate-connected impacts requires municipalities and communities to undertake adaptation measures and plans. These interventions should be capable of reducing negative climatic effects on human habitat and regional bioregions. On the one hand, the international scientific community recognized the supported adaptation planning approach as the more suitable to cope with local needs and criticalities. On the other hand, there is a lack of practical guidelines and examples that can be used to implement the theory. From a perspective of growth of global awareness and sensitivity to the climatic emergency, it is necessary to develop a practical methodology able to link together impacts perception and public decision process at the local scale. The paper aims to fill the gap between the theoretical approach and the practice, through a replicable experience of integration among climate change adaptation concepts and decision-making processes. The proposed methodology is described in a 4-step process to support decision-makers in selecting tailored adaptation policies and measures. The article is based on the experience developed within the Interreg It-Hr project iDEAL - Decision support for Adaptation pLan project. The research combines a quantitative and qualitative methodology in local participation processes. The approach is tested on five Mediterranean coastal cities and allowed to support the development of tailored adaptation measures. Furthermore, the interaction with local actors during the process led to an acceptance of the implemented measures, designing each measure to stakeholders' ambitions and expectations.","[Lucertini, Giulia; Di Giustino, Gianmarco; Dall'Omo, Carlo Federico; Musco, Francesco] Univ Iuav Venezia, Dept Architecture & Arts, Planning & Climate Change Lab, S Croce 1957, I-30135 Venice, Italy",IUAV University Venice,"Lucertini, G (corresponding author), Univ Iuav Venezia, Dept Architecture & Arts, Planning & Climate Change Lab, S Croce 1957, I-30135 Venice, Italy.",glucertini@iuav.it; gdigiustiono@iuav.it; cfdallomo@iuav.it; francesco.musco@iuav.it,"lucertini, giulia/ABB-4250-2020","lucertini, giulia/0000-0002-5824-6666; Di Giustino, Gianmarco/0000-0003-2728-726X",INTERREG IT-HR-iDEAL project [10042641],INTERREG IT-HR-iDEAL project,"Funding This research was funded by INTERREG IT-HR-iDEAL project, project number 10042641.",,57,2,2,0,2,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Over the last decades, the ridge-furrow-plastic-mulching (RFM) farming system has been widely used as an on-site (in-situ) rain-harvesting farming strategy, providing a partial solution to the supply-demand mismatch of rainwater. The off-site rain-harvesting system (ex-situ water cistern) for supplemental irrigation has been little used. We established an integrated ex-situ rain-harvesting system incorporated into maize RFM in a semiarid site of northwest China from 2018 to 2019. Five treatments were designed as: (1) CK-1, flat planting without mulching and irrigation, (2) CK-2, RFM without irrigation, (3) RFM60, RFM with 60 mm irrigation, (4) RFM105, RFM with 105 mm irrigation, and (5) RFM150, RFM with 150 mm irrigation. We found that supplemental irrigation treatments significantly increased grain yield, total biomass, and crop water productivity compared to CK-1 and CK-2 (P < 0.05) across two growing seasons, suggesting that ex-situ rain-harvesting irrigation can significantly promote field productivity based on widely used RFM system. The differences mentioned above were the greatest in RFM105 and RFM150, significantly greater than those of RFM60. No significant difference was observed between RFM150 and RFM105. Greater output in RFM150 and RFM105 was closely associated with improved soil water storage and thermal state in two growing seasons. Particularly, RFM150 and RFM105 harvested the highest soil organic carbon and total nitrogen after the second fallow period. The highest economic benefit was found in RFM105, followed by RFM150 and RFM60, the least in the two control groups. Our findings provided a critical case to solve the rainfall supply-demand mismatch. The ex-situ rainwater-harvesting supplemental irrigation can act as a promising solution to upgrade the current widely-used RFM farming system for better adaptation to climate change in the semiarid region.","[Munyasya, Alex Ndolo; Koskei, Kiprotich; Liu, Shu-Tong; Indoshi, Sylvia Ngaira; Wang, Wei; Cheruiyot, Wesly Kiprotich; Xiong, You-Cai] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Arid Agroecol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Rui] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xu-Cheng] Gansu Acad Agr Sci, Dingxi Res Stn, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China; [Cheruiyot, Wesly Kiprotich; Mburu, David Mwehia; Nyende, Aggrey Bernard] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, POB 62000, Nairobi 00200, Kenya",Lanzhou University; Yunnan University; Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology,"Xiong, YC (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Arid Agroecol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",xiongye@lzu.edu.cn,"Xiong, You-Cai/HDL-8596-2022","Xiong, You-Cai/0000-0002-4394-8331",National Natural Science Foundation of China [32161143012]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [lzujbky-2022-kb07]; Open Funding Project of State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystems; Key Research and Development Program of Gansu Province [20YF8WA083],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Open Funding Project of State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystems; Key Research and Development Program of Gansu Province,"We would like to thank Professor Neil C.

The policy challenge is further exacerbated when rural livelihood opportunities depend on multiple land use practices within shared social-ecological systems and adaptation actions related to one practice affects the others. In such cases, it becomes likely that national and regional-level adaptation plans will result in maladaptive trajectories if local context and properties are not carefully considered. This review highlights the importance of this issue to public policy using the case of climate change adaptation planning in Bangladesh to highlight how national and regional-level planned adaptation processes could bene fit from paying closer attention to the autonomous adaptation processes occurring at local levels. Focussing on the northeastern floodplain region, an area dominated by wetland ecosystems, high climate vulnerability, and diverse and complex land use practices, we examine some of the community-level adaptation actions that are being undertaken in response to climate change and contrast these with national-level adaptation planning strategies and actions. We then analyze how the planned adaptation actions taken by government may actually end up being maladaptive, either by shifting or rebounding vulnerability. We conclude that government adaptation planning would bene fit from a greater focus on learning and scrutinizing the autonomous adaptation of communities to climate stress before making significant resource allocation decisions.","[Rahman, H.

More often than not, such infrastructure building is legitimized as an urgent technical intervention-while less attention is paid to the distribution of costs and benefits among the affected population. However, as this article shows, adaptation interventions may directly or indirectly result in the relocation or even eviction of households or communities, thereby increasing vulnerabilities for some while intending to reduce long-term climate vulnerabilities for all. We argue that this raises serious, if underappreciated, ethical issues that need to be more explicitly addressed in adaptation policy making. We illustrate our conceptual argument with the help of three examples of infrastructural 'climate buffers': Space for the River projects in the Netherlands, the Diamer-Bhasha dam in Pakistan and the coastal protection plan in Jakarta, Indonesia.","[Warner, Jeroen Frank; Wiegel, Hanne] Wageningen Univ, Social Sci Grp, Sociol Dev & Change Chair Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-7606 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wiegel, Hanne] Wageningen Univ, Social Sci Grp, Environm Policy Chair Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-7606 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Warner, JF (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Social Sci Grp, Sociol Dev & Change Chair Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-7606 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",jeroen.warner@wur.nl; hanne.wiegel@wur.nl,,"Wiegel, Hanne/0000-0003-1587-7721",,,,,91,2,2,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2021,13,16,,,,,,,9160,10.3390/su13169160,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13169160,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UH7WQ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000690136400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

By examining outcomes in cases of water shortage, legal mechanisms promoting adaptation can be identified and suggestions made for improving those which potentially increase vulnerability. Design/methodology/approach - This paper explores several case studies situated in Western Canada, identified during interviews relating to a broader theme of water governance adaptation as part of the Institutional Adaptation to Climate Change (IACC) Project as well as other case studies carried out in the larger IACC project relating to the institutional adaptation to climate change in Canada and Chile. The outcomes of these case studies are examined in relation to their effect on vulnerability and their inter-relationship to established principles of water law. Findings - This examination provides insight into the actual workings of water law in resolving water conflicts and important modifications in the institution of water law which will increase adaptive capacity. These cases illustrate that legal provisions which facilitate timely engagement of civil society to water shortages in an all inclusive participatory process provides optimal conflict resolution. Originality/value - These case studies provide important insights for the development of law and policy which reduces vulnerability and assists people in adapting to climate change in a resilient, effective manner.","[Hurlbert, Margot] Univ Regina, Dept Justice Studies, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Hurlbert, Margot] Univ Regina, Dept Sociol & Social Studies, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada",University of Regina; University of Regina,"Hurlbert, M (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Dept Justice Studies, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",margot.hurlbert@uregina.ca,,,,,,,31,7,7,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Using three case studies (flood risk management in the Dutch polders, urban-rural teleconnections driving the Bolivian quinoa market, and spatial diversity in the adaptive capacity of Kampala slums),((1)) we draw out significant insights related to scales and sustainability, which will push urban resilience research forward. The key move is to consider both spatial and temporal interactions, in order to shift from the mainstreaming of the resilience-building paradigm toward a critical understanding and management of resilience trade-offs. While urban resilience emerges not necessarily as a normatively positive concept anymore, we argue that addressing multi-scale and temporal aspects of urban resilience will allow greater understanding of global sustainability challenges.","[Chelleri, Lorenzo] Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Urban Studies Unit, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Waters, James J.] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Olazabal, Marta] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Spain; [Minucci, Guido] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy",Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI); University of East Anglia; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Polytechnic University of Milan,"Chelleri, L (corresponding author), Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Urban Studies Unit, Viale F Crispi 7, I-67100 Laquila, Italy.",Lorenzo.chelleri@gssi.infn.it; jjj.waters@gmail.com; marta.olazabal@bc3research.org; guido.minucci@polimi.it,"Minucci, Guido/O-2018-2019; Minucci, Guido/G-1175-2016; Olazabal, Marta/C-3027-2008; Olazabal, Marta/AFT-6957-2022","Minucci, Guido/0000-0001-7195-0239; Minucci, Guido/0000-0001-7195-0239; Olazabal, Marta/0000-0002-3381-0654; Olazabal, Marta/0000-0002-3381-0654; Chelleri, Lorenzo/0000-0003-0229-5028; Waters, James/0000-0001-9821-8080",,,,,84,206,210,68,343,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

The framework is then used to carry out a survey of community managed forest organisations to measure their adaptive capacity and establish the characteristics that enable their adaptation. The research finds that adaptive organisations spend a substantial amount of time on community consultation and involvement, and prioritize environmental considerations over other aspects of their organisation. The effort invested in creating and maintaining links with the wider community by adaptive organisations may give them a legitimacy which enables adaptive changes to be made with community support. Reflecting calls for values based approaches to climate change, the article discusses the role that different values play in adaptation, and the 'transcendent' values that adaptive organisations tend to hold.

To stem this tide, it is imperative to systematically assess the unplanned urbanization trend from a socio-economic perspective and distill the broader implication for sustainable urban farming within the context of climate change in the region. The potentials of digitalization as a tool for transformative adaptation to climate change and enabler of sustainable development in different domains, including agriculture, are beginning to emerge. However, most studies are based on data from Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania. There is minimal documentation of current applications and prospects of digitalization for sustainable agricultural practices in Africa, particularly in an increasingly urbanized era. Thus, this study addresses this need by evaluating the potentials of digitalization to enable sustainable farming in the face of unprecedented climate change constraints in Africa and minimize the negative impacts of urbanization on agriculture. Through a desk research approach, the present study explores the challenges to digital farming in Africa despite its successful implementation in the global North. Drawing lessons from successful case-studies worldwide, we suggest possible pathways to overcome the challenges and implement localized digitalization approaches to strengthen preventive action against climate risks, enhance disaster preparedness, and aid effective planning and management of agriculture practices. Integrating agriculture into the city via digital urban farming is crucial for long-term food security and creating appealing clean-tech jobs for a large number of new immigrants, thereby supporting African cities' resilience and sustainable development.","[Balogun, Abdul-Lateef; Adebisi, Naheem; Tella, Abdulwaheed] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Geospatial Anal & Modelling GAM Res Grp, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Balogun, Abdul-Lateef] Esri Australia, Profess Serv Dept Resources, 613 King St, West Melbourne, Vic 3003, Australia; [Dano, Umar Lawal] Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ, Univ Dammam, Coll Architecture & Planning, Dammam, Saudi Arabia; [Tella, Abdulwaheed] Foresight Inst Res & Translat, Earth Environm & Space Div, Ibadan, Nigeria",Universiti Teknologi Petronas; Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University,"Balogun, AL (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Geospatial Anal & Modelling GAM Res Grp, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.",geospatial63@gmail.com,"Abubakar, Ismaila Rimi/A-4417-2015; Adebisi, Naheem/GPF-8462-2022; Dano, Umar Lawal/V-2148-2019","Abubakar, Ismaila Rimi/0000-0002-7994-2302; Dano, Umar Lawal/0000-0002-6786-5223; Tella, Abdulwaheed/0000-0002-4380-3343; Balogun, Abdul-Lateef/0000-0002-0418-3487",,,,,91,1,1,4,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1943-815X,1943-8168,,J INTEGR ENVIRON SCI,J.

In this study, we will analyze this issue against the phenomenon of climate change in order to estimate the vulnerability of Iran, and to this end, we will use the CVI vulnerability index on the provincial scale. By utilizing the results of this research, it will be clear those suitable solutions to increase adaptation to climate change conditions. The results of this research indicate that Hamadan and Alborz provinces have the highest vulnerability and therefore have the least adaptability to climate change compared to other provinces. On the other hand, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces have the lowest degree of relative vulnerability due to rich water resources, literacy rate and industry's GDP.

Wine quality will also be affected, which will raise economic issues. Possible adaptations may result from changes in plant material, viticultural techniques, and the wine-making process. Relocation of vineyards to cooler areas and increased irrigation are other options, but they may result in potential conflicts for land and water use. Grapes are currently grown in many regions around the world, and growers have adapted their practices to the wide range of climatic conditions that can be found among or inside these areas. This knowledge is precious for identifying potential adaptations to climate change. Because climate change affects all activities linked to wine production (grape growing, wine making, wine economics, and environmental issues), multidisciplinary research is needed to guide growers to continue to produce high-quality wines in an economical and environmentally sustainable way. An example of such an interdisciplinary study is the French LACCAVE (long-term adaptation to climate change in viticulture and enology) project, in which researchers from 23 institutes work together on all issues related to the impact of climate change on wine production.

To provide updated information for targeted climate change adaptation measures, we modeled hotspots of climate change and related extreme events in an integrative manner. This was achieved by constructing a spatial composite indicator of cumulative climate change impact, which integrates four climate- and hazard-related subindicators: seasonal temperature trends, seasonal precipitation trends, drought occurrences, and major flood events. The analysis is based on time-series of freely available continuous, gridded geo-spatial datasets, including remote sensing data. The aggregation of the four subindicators was performed by making use of a regionalization approach, based on segmentation techniques widely used in the remote sensing community in the field of object-based image analysis. Following the approach presented in this paper, 19 hotspots with most severe climatic changes were identified, evaluated, and mapped. The method enables not only the prioritization of intervention areas, but also allows decomposing the identified hotspots into their underlying subindicators, and thus additional information for effective climate change adaptation measures can be provided.","[Hagenlocher, Michael; Lang, Stefan; Hoelbling, Daniel; Tiede, Dirk; Kienberger, Stefan] Salzburg Univ, Interfac Dept Geoinformat Z GIS, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Hagenlocher, Michael] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Salzburg University; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Changes in farming practices are necessary to reduce emissions and to adapt to climate change. However, such modifications to common practices depend, to a large extent, on farmers' knowledge and attitudes towards climate risks. An empirical study of farmers' attitudes and knowledge of climate change mitigation and adaptation practices is useful to understand how farmers' knowledge influences their attitudes and practices towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. Based on a case study characterised by four agricultural fanning systems (extensive dairy sheep, intensive dairy cattle, horticultural farming, and rice farming) in the Province of Oristano in Italy, this study contains an investigation of (i) farmers' knowledge of climate change causes and effects, how they construct such knowledge, and how they adapt to the phenomenon; (ii) what and how are farmers' attitudes towards climate change causes are shaped under their contextual social interests and values; and (iii) if their practices in responding to climate variability are influenced by their constructed knowledge. The research results showed that farmers' declarative knowledge of climate change did not affect their adaptation practices but directed farmers' attitudes towards climate change causes. The findings also underscore the necessity of facilitating social learning spaces for enhancing virtuous behaviours towards climate change mitigation and the sharing and co-production of procedural knowledge for developing shared sustainable climate adaptation practices at the farm level.","[Thi Phuoc Lai Nguyen] AIT, Sch Environm Dev & Resources, Dept Dev & Sustainabil, 58 Moo 9,Km 42,POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand; [Seddaiu, Giovanna; Roggero, Pier Paolo] Univ Sassari, NRD, Viale Italia 39, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Seddaiu, Giovanna; Roggero, Pier Paolo] Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Agr, Viale Italia 39, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",Asian Institute of Technology; University of Sassari; University of Sassari,"Nguyen, TPL (corresponding author), AIT, Sch Environm Dev & Resources, Dept Dev & Sustainabil, 58 Moo 9,Km 42,POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand.",phuoclai@ait.asia,"Roggero, Pier Paolo/D-2580-2012","Roggero, Pier Paolo/0000-0002-7269-4334; Nguyen, Thi Phuoc Lai/0000-0003-2827-5762; Seddaiu, Giovanna/0000-0001-6043-1134","Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies, Italy [D.M. 2660/7303/2012, D.M. 24064/7303/2015, D.M. 8608/7303/2008]","Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies, Italy","The authors acknowledged the Agroscenari project (D.M. 8608/7303/2008 -www.agroscenari.it) and the FACCE JPI knowledge hub MACSUR (D.M. 2660/7303/2012; D.M. 24064/7303/2015 -www.macsur.eu) funded by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies, Italy.

Scholars have long called for integrating local knowledge in the design and implementation of climate change adaptation policy responses. Yet integrating local knowledges requires addressing issues related with power and authority, and critically examining which knowledge counts and at which scale. In this regard, a relatively under-explored research area is to assess how local representations and experiences of vulnerability fit with or disrupt dominant policy discourses. This is the focus of our study, conducted in the Tarai-Madhesh region of Nepal. We relied on an original methodology, combining participatory video research with a discourse analysis of national policy documents and of the films produced by farmers. Our analysis shows that farmers' discourses appear on the surface congruent with some features of national policy story-lines. Yet their underlying narratives seriously challenge several core assumptions of national and international climate change adaptation policies, rooted in ecological modernization, technocentrism and neoliberalism. This seeming contradiction indicates both knowledge co-production and performance, underlying the need to closely under -stand the context in which local knowledges on climate change vulnerability are produced. We conclude with a few promising research areas to explore strategies to increase the authority of local knowledge into political arenas across scales.","[Clement, Floriane] Univ Toulouse, UMR DYNAFOR, INRAE, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Sugden, Fraser] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",INRAE; University of Birmingham,"Clement, F (corresponding author), INRAE, UMR DYNAFOR, 24 Chemin Borde Rouge, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",floriane.clement@inrae.fr,"CLEMENT, Floriane/F-8459-2017","CLEMENT, Floriane/0000-0003-4195-222X","CGIAR Research Programme on Climate Change Adaptation and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Research Programme on Water, Land, and Ecosystems (WLE)","CGIAR Research Programme on Climate Change Adaptation and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Research Programme on Water, Land, and Ecosystems (WLE)(CGIAR)","The research was conducted while the authors worked at (anonymous for blind review).

Overall, local perception of climate change and its impacts corresponds to the patterns of observed climate change revealed by climate records. The intensity of climate change perception shows a highly significant correlation with residents' age and villages' elevation gradient. Most respondents did not believe that climate change affected crop growing and their yields, but the number of crop insect pests was thought to be increasing slightly and the crop growth period to be extending. Nearly all respondents believed that climate change seriously affects the mountain tourism economy, and their way of life and spiritual world. Persistent drought in recent years has forced mountain dwellers to adjust industrial structure, save water in the agricultural economy, participate in mountain tourism and work outside the home in order to adapt to climate change impacts and supplement their meager farm incomes.

This study was carried out by Center for International Forestry Research and aimed to understand how people with professional interest in adaptation and REDD+ in Central Africa comprehend key concepts of climate change. Questionnaires on basic knowledge of key climate change concepts were answered by 138 stakeholders from several Central African countries. These tests were intended to establish a baseline from which a programme of capacity-building could be developed. The results demonstrated that: (1) although workshops on REDD+ and adaptation to climate change are held with increasingly frequency in Central Africa, stakeholders in the region are still struggling to understand the key concepts of climate change, (2) the issues of climate change are evolving so quickly that those who are called upon to defend the interests and positions of the central Africa region are lagging behind the discourses, hence the need for continuous capacity-building, (3) decision-makers in the Congo Basin need frequently updated information and knowledge to be up to the task of supporting the regional position held by Central African Forestry Commission and to defend national interests.","[Tiani, Anne Marie; Bele, Mekou Youssoufa; Sonwa, Denis Jean] Ctr Int Forestry Res, Yaounde, Cameroon",,"Bele, MY (corresponding author), Ctr Int Forestry Res, POB 2008, Yaounde, Cameroon.",b.youssoufa@cgiar.org,,,,,,,42,6,6,1,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The main research goal is to provide evidence on how impactful public policies on environmental sustainability in Portugal are at the regional level, in various policy areas. In this context, this paper analyses the main impacts of the Portuguese Operational Programme for Sustainability and Efficient Use of Resources (PO SEUR 2014-20). The research uses a territorial impact assessment (TIA) methodology (TARGET_TIA) to assess these impacts in five analytic dimensions (economy with low emissions, adaptation to climate change, risk prevention and management, environmental protection and resource efficiency) in the five mainland Portuguese NUTS 2. It concludes that, in overall terms, PO SEUR produced low to moderate positive impacts in all NUTS II and analysed dimensions, but it was particularly positive in measures fostering adaptation to climate change, and less impactful in measures supporting an economy with low emissions and resource efficiency in Portugal. Despite data limitations, the research provided adequate evidence that key public policies supporting environmental sustainability in Portugal are largely ineffective and inefficient in view of their policy goals and allocated funding. To turn this scenario around, the process of project selection needs to undergo significant improvements to better adjust the regional needs on environmental sustainability-related issues to the available funding. Moreover, on a policy strategic level, there needs to be support for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy in Portugal via concrete actions exploring environmental capital and a green economy in urban areas.","[Medeiros, Eduardo; Goncalves, Vasco] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIA CET IUL, Portugal Ave Forcas Armadas,Edificio Sedas Nunes, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; [Valente, Bernardo; Castro, Paula] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, CIS Iscte, Ave Forcas Armadas,Edificio Sedas Nunes,Sala 2W08, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Medeiros, E (corresponding author), Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIA CET IUL, Portugal Ave Forcas Armadas,Edificio Sedas Nunes, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",eduardo.medeiros@iscte-iul.pt; valente.berna@gmail.com; vasco.goncalves@iscte-iul.pt; paula.castro@iscte-iul.pt,"Valente, Bernardo Costa/GWU-7308-2022; Valente, Bernardo/HJY-3024-2023; Medeiros, Eduardo/F-7046-2016","Valente, Bernardo Costa/0000-0001-8332-7639; Medeiros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8877-5606", [2020-POAT];  [POAT-01-6177FEDER000063],; ,"This research was funded by the Portugal 2020-POAT, grant number [POAT-01-6177FEDER000063].",,60,4,4,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2022,14,13,,,,,,,7917,10.3390/su14137917,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14137917,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2Y0RI,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000825601400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate change-induced increases in temperature, rainfall variation (both spatial and time) and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are adding to pressure on the global agriculture systemwhich is already struggling to respond to the rising demands of the growing population for food. This paper specifies a spatial econometric model to determine the major drivers of land use change, with emphasis on climate variables, in three bordering provinces of Iran during 2004-2016. Results indicate that changes in the usage of land and adaptation to climate change occur through time, but these changes have a major locative dependence on the nearby areas. In most of the regions under study, the increase in temperature exerts negative impacts on the proportion of lands devoted to grass and agriculture. Cropland value and farmer income have indirect and direct impact on the share of agricultural lands, respectively. Land slope is also indirectly related to urban and agricultural land allocation. Provision of more supports to farmers through direct payment and price support policies aiming at preserving of agricultural lands is recommended.

This is promoted by the 4 per 1000 Initiative, a multi-stakeholder platform aiming at increasing SOC storage through sustainable practices. The scientific and technical committee of the Initiative is working to identify indicators, research priorities and region-specific practices needed for their implementation. The Initiative received its name due to the global importance of soils for climate change, which can be illustrated by a thought experiment showing that an annual growth rate of only 0.4% of the standing global SOC stocks would have the potential to counterbalance the current increase in atmospheric CO2. However, there are numerous barriers to the rise in SOC stocks and while SOC sequestration can contribute to partly offsetting greenhouse gas emissions, its main benefits are related to increased soil quality and climate change adaptation. The Initiative provides a collaborative platform for policy makers, practitioners, scientists and stakeholders to engage in finding solutions. Criticism of the Initiative has been related to the poor definition of its numerical target, which was not understood as an aspirational goal. The objective of this paper is to present the aims of the initiative, to discuss critical issues and to present challenges for its implementation. We identify barriers, risks and trade-offs and advocate for collaboration between multiple parties in order to stimulate innovation and to initiate the transition of agricultural systems toward sustainability.","[Rumpel, Cornelia] CNRS, Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, Thiverval Grignon, France; [Amiraslani, Farshad] Univ Tehran, Fac Geog, Dept RS GIS, Tehran, Iran; [Chenu, Claire] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, UMR Ecosys, Thiverval Grignon, France; [Garcia Cardenas, Magaly] Univ Mayor San Andres, Fac Engn, La Paz, Bolivia; [Kaonga, Martin] Cambridge Ctr Environm, Cambridge, England; [Koutika, Lydie-Stella] CRDPI, Av Ma Loango Moe Poaty,BP 1291, Pointe Noire, Rep Congo; [Ladha, Jagdish] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Madari, Beata] Brazilian Agr Res Corp, Natl Rice & Bean Res Ctr Embrapa Arroz & Feijao, Santo Antonio De Goias, Brazil; [Shirato, Yasuhito] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Smith, Pete] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Soudi, Brahim] Inst Agron & Vet Hassan II, Rabat, Morocco; [Soussana, Jean-Francois] INRA, Paris, France; [Whitehead, David] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Wollenberg, Eva] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT USA; [Wollenberg, Eva] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Burlington, VT USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); University of Tehran; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Universidad Mayor de San Andres; University of California System; University of California Davis; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan; University of Aberdeen; INRAE; Landcare Research - New Zealand; University of Vermont; CGIAR,"Rumpel, C (corresponding author), CNRS, Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, Thiverval Grignon, France.",cornelia.rumpel@inra.fr; ls_koutika@yahoo.com,"Rumpel, Cornelia/A-2001-2015; Madari, Beata Emoke/A-1188-2013; Madari, Beata Emoke/ABG-5831-2020; GARCIA, MAGALI/HMO-6797-2023; Amiraslani, Farshad/AAF-4024-2020; Smith, Pete/G-1041-2010; Soussana, Jean-Francois/P-2094-2016","Rumpel, Cornelia/0000-0003-2131-9451; Madari, Beata Emoke/0000-0002-6242-6619; Madari, Beata Emoke/0000-0002-6242-6619; Smith, Pete/0000-0002-3784-1124; Soussana, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-1932-6583; Koutika, Lydie-Stella/0000-0001-8223-3032; Shirato, Yasuhito/0000-0002-4918-6454", [NE/P019455/1]; NERC [NE/P019455/1] Funding Source: UKRI,; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Authors would like to acknowledge the executive secretariat of the 4p1000 initiative, Charlotte Verger and Claire Weill for their valuable contributions during the preparation of this manuscript.

However, making decisions on the most appropriate long-term intervention investments can be challenging; this is primarily because of the uncertainties associated with future climate change and socioeconomic development. Real Options analysis is a widely recognised approach for encouraging appropriate climate change adaptation and mitigation investment decisions. To date, however, there has only been limited use of Real Options Analysis Techniques within the Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management community. In this paper, a methodology is described that has the capability to assess the most appropriate set of interventions to make in a flood system, given the future uncertainties. The methodology captures the concepts of Real Options and has the capability to value the flexibility associated with potential flood risk management intervention options across a range of future climate change and socioeconomic scenarios. The novel Real Options approach has been tested and verified on a real-life case study situated in the Thamesmead area of the Thames Estuary. The results obtained demonstrate the potential for substantial cost savings under future uncertainties when Real Options are used instead of more traditional, precautionary approaches.","[Woodward, M.] HR Wallingford, Dept Flood Management, Wallingford OX10 8BA, Oxon, England; [Woodward, M.; Kapelan, Z.] Univ Exeter, Sch Engn Math & Phys, Exeter, Devon, England; [Khu, S. -T.] Univ Surrey, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England",HR Wallingford Limited; University of Exeter; University of Surrey,"Woodward, M (corresponding author), HR Wallingford, Dept Flood Management, Howbery Pk, Wallingford OX10 8BA, Oxon, England.",m.woodward@hrwallingford.co.uk,"Kapelan, Zoran/A-3103-2009","Gouldby, Ben/0000-0003-0415-5897","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/F020511/1]; Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs/Environment Agency (DEFRA/EA); United Kingdom Water Industry Research (UKWIR); Office of Public Works (OPW) Dublin; Northern Ireland Rivers Agency (DARDNI); EPSRC [EP/F020511/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/F020511/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs/Environment Agency (DEFRA/EA); United Kingdom Water Industry Research (UKWIR); Office of Public Works (OPW) Dublin; Northern Ireland Rivers Agency (DARDNI); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","The research work presented here was completed as part of the Knowledge Transfer Partnership project between HR Wallingford and University of Exeter (KTP Programme No. 6780), which is gratefully acknowledged.

The present article set out to analyse the existing literature on Asian farmers' adaptation practices towards the impacts of climate change. Guided by the PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) review method, a systematic review of the Scopus and Web of Science databases identified 38 related studies. Further review of these articles resulted in six main themes crop management, irrigation and water management, farm management, financial management, physical infrastructure management and social activities. These six themes further produced a total of 35 sub-themes. Several recommendations are highlighted related to conducting more qualitative studies, to have specific and a standard systematic review method for guide research synthesis in context of climate change adaptation and to practice complimentary searching techniques such as citation tracking, reference searching, snowballing and contacting experts.

We present an exploratory case study of the purposeful use of an emerging values-based approach to first assist local communities to articulate and confirm their own, in-situ, shared values-in-action, as a pre-process to participatory vulnerability risk assessments (VRA). We separately engaged four Village Development Committees (VDCs) from the North East District in Botswana, where a widespread programme of local VRAs is taking place. Results clearly demonstrate very significant and meaningful engagement by, ownership of, and relevance to, participants in the VRA process, evident through the bespoke and tailored considerations of local vulnerabilities and responses, and post-event focus group interviews. We conclude that the values-based process, known as the WeValue InSitu shared values crystallization process, has potential for a step-wise shift in effectiveness of VRAs and local adaptation planning, and that a new agenda is needed to develop and test WeValue's replicability and effectiveness in other international contexts.","[Sethamo, Obakeng A.; Harder, Marie K.] Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, 2005 Songhu Rd, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Masika, Rachel J.] Univ Brighton, Ctr Teaching & Learning, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Harder, Marie K.] Univ Brighton, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England",Fudan University; University of Brighton; University of Brighton,"Harder, MK (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, 2005 Songhu Rd, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.;Harder, MK (corresponding author), Univ Brighton, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England.",m.k.harder@brighton.ac.uk,"Masika, Rachel/D-6754-2014; harder, marie/D-3157-2013","Masika, Rachel/0000-0002-7505-528X; harder, marie/0000-0002-1811-4597",European Union [212237]; AHRC [AH/L013142/1] Funding Source: UKRI,European Union(European Commission); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"This work builds directly on research funded by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme, grant number 212237 named ESDinds, under the 'Research for the Benefit of Specific Groups: Civil Society Organizations' category.",,36,9,9,1,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

It is a phenomenon, however, from which there are few examples to learn. This paper examines relocation processes underway in three low-lying coastal villages in Fiji, each affected by coastal erosion and flooding. Drawing on the concept of everyday agency, it considers how environmental changes and planned relocation initiatives are resisted, accommodated, or shaped through daily activities and decision-making. For residents of these three villages, climate change adaptation is not only a matter of adapting to environmental changes, but a process of actively steering a way through unfolding dimensions of planned relocation. The findings respond to increasingly audible calls to recognise the agency of people living in climate-vulnerable places, and to highlight everyday responses to climate impacts and adaptation initiatives.","[McMichael, Celia] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Powell, Teresia] Univ South Pacific, Suva, Fiji",University of Melbourne; University of the South Pacific,"McMichael, C (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Carlton, Vic, Australia.",celia.mcmichael@unimelb.edu.au,"mcmichael, celia/ABD-3118-2020","mcmichael, celia/0000-0002-4572-602X",,,,,67,27,27,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0016-7398,1475-4959,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

In doing so, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for Nepal has been developed, incorporating the allocation of land for several agricultural crops, including the major staple foods, with specification of a nested set of constant elasticity of transformation (CET) functional forms. The set of land transformation elasticities facilitates switching from one crop to another; based on their agronomic characteristics and degree of climate change impacts. Using Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) data and Living Standard Survey (LSS) data, a social accounting matrix (SAM) for Nepal is developed and used to simulate three scenarios of climate change and land reallocation. The simulation results in the long run depict farmers as more likely to use land for crops that are comparatively less impacted by climate change, such as paddy.

Triggered by recent food crises around the world and climate change concerns, some governments have been trying to develop more robust and resilient food systems. One of the oldest options for many governments is to stockpile emergency food reserves for the purpose of food security and disaster preparedness. In the aftermath of the world food price crises in 2007-2008 and 2011, some governments in Asia have been maintaining emergency food reserves to ensure greater supply and price stability. Disasters and extreme climate events help governments to justify emergency food reserves. This research examined emergency food reserve policies in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Emergency food reserves emerged as a practice where the shared objectives of development, disaster risk reduction, and climate change adaptation have been demonstrated by governments. The findings suggest that most governments maintain the strong view that adequate emergency food reserves can buffer national food price shocks and shocks from disasters and climate change, and soften disruptions in trade due to export bans during times of disasters and climate emergencies.","[Lassa, Jonatan A.] Charles Darwin Univ, Emergency & Disaster Management Studies, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Teng, Paul] Natl Inst Educ, Nat Sci & Sci Educ, Singapore 637616, Singapore; [Caballero-Anthony, Mely; Shrestha, Maxim] Nanyang Technol Univ, S Rajaratnam Sch Int Studies RSIS, Ctr Nontradit Secur Studies, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Charles Darwin University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Lassa, JA (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Emergency & Disaster Management Studies, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia.",jonatan.lassa@cdu.edu.au,"Lassa, Jonatan/M-6112-2019; Caballero-Anthony, Mely/B-7592-2018; Lassa, Jonatan/D-2205-2017","Lassa, Jonatan/0000-0002-8432-842X; Caballero-Anthony, Mely/0000-0003-1064-745X; Lassa, Jonatan/0000-0002-8432-842X",S.

For this reason, since 2017, the Green Climate Fund placed gender among its key programming prerequisites, making it the first multilateral climate fund to do so worldwide. However, to date, no lessons to inform planned gender-responsive ecosystem-based interventions in Namibia have been drawn from community-based natural resource management. Thus, this paper aims to share key lessons regarding the way in which gender assessment is useful in enhancing equity in an ecosystem-based adaptation programme for the Green Climate Fund. To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews and group discussions in the 14 rural regions of Namibia with 151 participants from 107 community-based natural resource management organisations (73.5:26.5; male:female ratio). The results identified gender imbalances in leadership and decision-making due to intersecting historic inequalities, ethnicity and geography, as well as other socio-cultural factors in local community-based natural resource management institutions. We also identified income disparities and unequal opportunities to diversify livelihoods, gendered differentiated impacts of climate change and meaningful participation in public forums. Overall, the assessment indicates that considering gender analysis at the initiation of a community-based climate change adaptation project is crucial for achieving resilience to climate change, closing the gender gap, building capacity to increase equity and empowering women in resource-dependent environments in Namibia and Sub-Saharan Africa more broadly.","[Angula, Margaret Ndapewa] Univ Namibia, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Geog Hist & Environm Studies, P Bag 13301, Pioneerspark 10023, Windhoek, Namibia; [Mogotsi, Immaculate] Univ Namibia, Multidisciplinary Res Ctr, Gender Training & Res Programme, P Bag 13301, Pioneerspark 10023, Windhoek, Namibia; [Lendelvo, Selma] Univ Namibia, Multidisciplinary Res Ctr, Life Sci Div, P Bag 13301, Pioneerspark 10023, Windhoek, Namibia; [Aribeb, Karl Mutani; Iteta, Aina-Maria] Environm Investment Fund Namibia, POB 28157, Auas Valley 10018, Windhoek, Namibia; [Thorn, Jessica P.

Interest in ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is gaining importance due to its potential multiple benefits, including social and environmental aspects, when compared to more traditional approaches such as hard engineering interventions. When assessing EbA strategies, further understanding of the nature-society functions, processes, values, and benefits is needed to increase its application. This study contributes to better knowledge of EbA and other adaptation strategies by developing a systematic literature review of studies performing socio-economic assessments of climate-change adaptation in coastal areas. The analysis of 54 publications revealed that cost-benefit analysis was applied in most studies, followed by multi-criteria analysis and other techniques. Hybrid adaptation strategies based on different combinations of hard, soft, and EbA interventions were considered as potential optimal solutions in a significant part of the assessments. This study shows some potential co-benefits of EbA, such as livelihood diversification or biodiversity conservation, but also stresses the need for further research on this topic, as well as on evaluating how EbA performs in the long term under changing climate-condition scenarios.","[Riera-Spiegelhalder, Mar] UVEG Univ Valencia, Inst Local Dev, Local Sustainabil, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Riera-Spiegelhalder, Mar; Campos-Rodrigues, Luis] ENT Environm & Management, Econ & Environm Unit, Vilanova I La Geltru 08800, Spain; [Ensenado, Elena Marie; den Dekker-Arlain, Janneke] Erasmus Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Dev Studies, Urban Sustainabil & Climate Change Resilience, NL-3062 Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Papadopoulou, Olympia; Arampatzis, Stratos] Tero Monoprosopi Ike, Kalamaria 55132, Greece; [Vervoort, Koen] European Network Living Labs, Projects Dept, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",,"Riera-Spiegelhalder, M (corresponding author), UVEG Univ Valencia, Inst Local Dev, Local Sustainabil, Valencia 46010, Spain.;Riera-Spiegelhalder, M; Campos-Rodrigues, L (corresponding author), ENT Environm & Management, Econ & Environm Unit, Vilanova I La Geltru 08800, Spain.",mar.riera@uv.es; lcampos@ent.cat,,,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [101003534],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,This research was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 101003534.,,92,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

Partnerships offer the opportunity to link the actions of diverse actors operating at different scales and, thus, they may be flexible enough to deal with uncertain futures and changing development demands. However, simultaneously, partnerships may lack effectiveness in delivering action at the local level, and may constitute a strategy for some actors to legitimate their objectives in spite of the interests of other partners. Engaging with the specific example of urban governance in Maputo, Mozambique, the authors present an analysis of potential partnerships in this context, in relation to the actors that are willing and able to intervene to deliver climate change action. What, they ask, are the challenges to achieving common objectives in partnerships from the perspective of local residents in informal settlements? The analysis describes a changing context of climate change governance in the city, in which the prospects of access to international finance for climate change adaptation are moving institutional actors towards engaging with participatory processes at the local level. However, the analysis suggests a question about the extent to which local communities are actually perceived as actors with legitimate interests who can intervene in partnerships, and whether their interests are recognised.","[Broto, Vanesa Castan] UCL, Bartlett Dev Planning Unit, London WC1H 9EZ, England; [Macucule, Domingos Augusto] Univ Eduardo Mondlane, Fac Architecture & Phys Planning, Maputo, Mozambique; [Boyd, Emily] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England; [Ensor, Jonathan] Univ York, Stockholm Environm Inst, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of London; University College London; Eduardo Mondlane University; University of Reading; University of York - UK,"Broto, VC (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Dev Planning Unit, 34 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9EZ, England.",v.castanbroto@ucl.ac.uk; dommacucule@yahoo.com.br; Emily.boyd@reading.ac.uk; jon.ensor@york.ac.uk; charlotteallen249@gmail.com,"Ensor, Jonathan E/M-3313-2014; Broto, Vanesa Castan/AAF-4485-2021","Ensor, Jonathan E/0000-0003-2402-5491; ",,,,,48,19,19,0,32,PION LTD,LONDON,"207 BRONDESBURY PARK, LONDON NW2 5JN, ENGLAND",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

We argue that these processes - evictions and invisibilizations - create a heightened vulnerability to climate change impacts for these individuals. The paper uses secondary survey data on compact Roma groups in Romania and analyses qualitative and cartographic information collected by the authors (2019) in two mid-sized cities in Romania to flesh out the particular slum ecologies that emerge following evictions. The focus is also on the subtle processes of invisibilization that render displaced Roma vulnerable and rob them of the right to the city in terms of climate change adaptation. Our finding is that evicted Roma experience innumerable, routine weather-related impacts, such as floods, storms or cold. By exploring Roma's heightened exposure, sensitivity and reduced adaptive capacity, we show how these impacts increase their vulnerability to future extreme weather events. These findings are indicative of a broader process of fragmentation taking place in urban areas throughout Eastern Europe, which render invisible some very real barriers to climate change adaptation.","[Alexandrescu, Filip; Anghel, Ionut-Marian] Romanian Acad, Res Inst Qual Life, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest 050711, Romania; [Adorjani, Julia] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Sociol & Social Work, B Dul 21 Decembrie 1989 128, Cluj Napoca 400604, Romania; [Stefanescu, Lucrina] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Environm Sci & Engn, Str Fantanele 30, Cluj Napoca 400294, Romania; [Pop, Alina] Dimitrie Cantemir Christian Univ, Dept Commun Sci, Splaiul Unirii 176, Bucharest 040438, Romania; [Mihai, Anca] Univ Bucharest, Fac Sociol & Social Work, Bd Schitu Magureanu 9, Bucharest 010181, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; University of Bucharest,"Mihai, A (corresponding author), Univ Bucharest, Fac Sociol & Social Work, Bd Schitu Magureanu 9, Bucharest 010181, Romania.",filip.alexand@iccv.ro; ionut.anghel@iccv.ro; lucrina.stefanescu@ubbcluj.ro; alina.pop@ucdc.ro; anca.m@sas.unibuc.ro,"Mihai, Anca/AAO-2412-2020; Alexandrescu, Filip/Y-4594-2019; Stefanescu, Lucrina/B-6281-2012","MIHAI, ANCA/0000-0003-3155-3292; Stefanescu, Lucrina/0000-0002-7431-2117; Alexandrescu, Filip Mihai/0000-0002-3628-600X","Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI within PNCDI III [PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2016-2260]","Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI within PNCDI III(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI))","This work was supported by a grant of Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2016-2260, within PNCDI III.

One way of doing this is through the analysis of spatial data. We demonstrate how to apply GIS methods to spatially represent socioeconomic vulnerability in Grenada, a tropical small island developing state (SIDS) in the Eastern Caribbean. Our model combines spatial features representing variables of social sensitivity, community adaptive capacity, and community exposure to flooding in an integrated vulnerability index. We draw from the fields of climate change adaptation, disaster management, and poverty and development to select our variables enabling unique, cross sector, applications of our assessment. Mapping our results illustrates that vulnerability to flooding is not evenly distributed across the country and is not driven by the same factors in all areas of Grenada. This indicates a need for the implementation of different strategies in communities across Grenada to help effectively reduce vulnerability to climate and coastal hazards. The approach presented in this paper can be used to address national issues on climate change adaptation, disaster management, and poverty and development and more effectively utilize funds in order to reduce community vulnerability to natural hazards today and in the future.","[Weis, Shawn W.

The concept of sustainability is central to these efforts, as climate adaptation discussions are often framed within the context of economic resilience, environmental protection, and social vulnerability. For urban centers, the climate change issue presents unique challenges for each of these dimensions; however, its potential impacts on marginalized populations are extensive. This study draws from the 'just sustainabilities' (Agyeman, Bullard, and Evans 2003) framework and applies the concepts of distributive and procedural justice to examine whether, and to what extent, U.S. cities prioritize social equity concerns in adaptation plans. We perform a qualitative analysis of climate adaptation plans prepared by 22 of the 100 largest U.S. cities. We find that social equity concerns are particularly prominent in local-level climate adaptation discussions relative to those concerning environmental quality and economic development.","[Fiack, Duran] CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, 250 Bedford Pk Blvd W, Bronx, NY 10468 USA; [Cumberbatch, Jeremy; Sutherland, Michael] CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Macaulay Honors Coll, Bronx, NY 10468 USA; [Zerphey, Nadine] CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Bronx, NY 10468 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY),"Fiack, D (corresponding author), CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, 250 Bedford Pk Blvd W, Bronx, NY 10468 USA.",Duran.Fiack@lehman.cuny.edu,,"Sutherland, Michael/0000-0003-2950-0570",,,,,101,13,13,11,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,AUG,2021,115,,,,,,,,103235,10.1016/j.cities.2021.103235,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2021.103235,,APR 2021,11,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,TE6BB,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000670095100011,View Full Record in Web of Science

To assess the climatic vulnerability of a given territory, it is necessary to evaluate its exposure to climate change and its adaptive capacity. This study describes the development of an Action Plan for Adapting to Climate Change in the Tamega and Sousa Region, a mountainous inter-municipal community in the North of Portugal. The goals were to identify the main impacts of climate change on water resources, agriculture, forests, biodiversity, and socioeconomic sectors, as well as to develop a plan, merging local and scientific knowledge through a transdisciplinary lens. This study describes an approach that combines modelling methods, applied in the different sectors, and participatory methods, based on the analysis of the perceptions of local actors. Results indicate that the target region will experience a generalized increase in temperature and a decrease in precipita-tion, which will negatively impact all studied social-ecological dimensions. Overall, local business and institu-tional agents perceive the primary and tourism sectors as the most vulnerable in the region. The described framework demonstrates the engagement process between relevant scientific experts and local practitioners, as well as how it is critical to understand the impacts of climate change and to support the co-design of an adaptation plan, which in turn can guide political and economic decision-making towards effective implementation of the plan. In addition, the difficulties and challenges encountered during this process are discussed to support future plans and strategies for local adaptation. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Knowing how they perceive, react, and adapt to climatic changes and events is helpful in developing strategies to support adaptation to climate change. Mamberamo in Papua, Indonesia, is a sparsely populated watershed of 7.8 million hectares possessing rich tropical forests. Our study compares scientific and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) on climate, and analyzes how local people in Mamberamo perceive and react to climatic variations. We compared meteorological data for the region with local views gathered through focus group discussions and interviews in six villages. We explored the local significance of seasonality, climate variability, and climate change. Mamberamo is subject to strikingly low levels of climatic variation; nonetheless local people highlighted certain problematic climate-related events such as floods and droughts. As our results illustrate, the implications vary markedly among villages. People currently consider climate variation to have little impact on their livelihoods when contrasted with other factors, e.g., logging, mining, infrastructure development, and political decentralization. Nonetheless, increased salinity of water supplies, crop loss due to floods, and reduced hunting success are concerns in specific villages. To gain local engagement, adaptation strategies should initially focus on factors that local people already judge important. Based on our results we demonstrate that TEK, and an assessment of local needs and concerns, provide practical insights for the development and promotion of locally relevant adaptation strategies. These insights offer a foundation for further engagement.","[Boissiere, Manuel; Locatelli, Bruno] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Boissiere, Manuel; Locatelli, Bruno; Sheil, Douglas; Padmanaba, Michael] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia; [Sheil, Douglas] Inst Trop Forest Conservat, Kabale, Uganda; [Sheil, Douglas] So Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Management, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia; [Sadjudin, Ermayanti] Conservat Int, Arlington, VA USA",CIRAD; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); Southern Cross University; Conservation International,"Boissiere, M (corresponding author), Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, Montpellier, France.",,"Locatelli, Bruno/C-9957-2009; Sheil, Douglas/N-3291-2019; Sheil, Douglas/A-3867-2015","Locatelli, Bruno/0000-0003-2983-1644; Sheil, Douglas/0000-0002-1166-6591; Sheil, Douglas/0000-0002-1166-6591; BOISSIERE, Manuel/0000-0002-2552-7664",Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD); U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID),Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD); U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)(Australian Aid (AusAID)),"This paper was presented during the 13th Congress of the International Society of Ethnobiology, 21-25 May 2012.

The evidence generated by the other articles of the special issue were interpreted using social justice reasoning in light of additional literature, to draw out the key implications of health and social inequalities for health outcomes of climate change. Exposure to heat and cold, air pollution, pollen, food safety risks, disruptions to access to and functioning of health services and facilities, emerging infections and flooding are examined as the key impacts of climate change influencing health outcomes. Age, pre-existing medical conditions and social deprivation are found to be the key (but not only) factors that make people vulnerable and to experience more adverse health outcomes related to climate change impacts. In the future, climate change, aging population and decreasing public spending on health and social care may aggravate inequality of health outcomes related to climate change. Health education and public preparedness measures that take into account differential exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of different groups help address health and social inequalities to do with climate change. Adaptation strategies based on individual preparedness, action and behaviour change may aggravate health and social inequalities due to their selective uptake, unless they are coupled with broad public information campaigns and financial support for undertaking adaptive measures.","[Paavola, Jouni] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, CCCEP, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Paavola, J (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, CCCEP, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",j.paavola@leeds.ac.uk,"Paavola, Jouni/A-5413-2010","Paavola, Jouni/0000-0001-5720-466X",UK Living With Environmental Change (LWEC) Network; ESRC Centre of Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Living With Environmental Change (LWEC) Network; ESRC Centre of Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Publication of this article was funded by the UK Living With Environmental Change (LWEC) Network.

The study was motivated by the limited understanding about how indigenous communities are using ecosystems to adapt to climate change. A qualitative research paradigm involving focus group interactions with purposively selected respondents informed the case study. Results show that indigenous practices have significant conservation potential. The motivation behind ecosystem management stems from recognition of diverse ecosystem services, which exist as: provisioning; regulatory and supporting; and spiritual and informative benefits. The participants attribute the perpetuation of these diverse benefits to keeping strong ties with their ancestors, a system that requires them to maintain their traditional ecosystem conservation practices, which has fairly withstood exogenous pressures of colonial and post-colonial legacies in Zimbabwe. Many of these practices exist as local ways of adapting to climate change through ecosystem-based practices. Indigenous communities have a collective obligation to protect ecosystems, which are inhabited by the spirits, whom they believe have powers to influence the local climate system. These observations reverberate the critical role of indigenous communities in ecosystem management and shed more insights to the design of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) interventions in communities endowed with rich indigenous forests and biodiversity.","[Chanza, Nelson; Musakwa, Walter] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Chanza, N (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Johannesburg, South Africa.",nchanza@gmail.com,,,German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment of the University of Johannesburg,German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment of the University of Johannesburg,"We are grateful to the people of Binga and Mbire districts who willingly and generously shared their knowledge about their local environments and spent their much-valued time with us.

In this study, the current literature on how fisheries, fisheries management and fishing communities react and adapt to projected climate impacts is reviewed. First, a brief background on adaptation research, including definitions of key terms and concepts is provided. Secondly, available frameworks and tools to assess and foster adaptation to climate change are outlined and discussed. Thirdly, case studies illustrating several key aspects (political, legal, economic, and social) influencing adaptation at the level of fisheries, communities and households worldwide are presented and compared. Finally, a brief synthesis of the main issues and their implications for adaptation within fisheries and fisheries management at large are identified and discussed. In summary, the study illustrates that while a great wealth of local and regional knowledge, as well as tools and approaches to foster adaptation exists, examples of concrete adaptation actions and measures are surprisingly few. This emphasizes the need to increase the general awareness of climate change impacts and to build a solid political, legal, financial and social infrastructure within which the available knowledge, tools and approaches can be set to practical use in implementing adaptation to climate change.","[Lindegren, Martin] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Ctr Ocean Life, Bygning 202, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Brander, Keith] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Technical University of Denmark,"Lindegren, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Ctr Ocean Life, Bygning 202, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",mli@aqua.dtu.dk,"Brander, Keith/AAN-6278-2021","Lindegren, Martin/0000-0002-9185-951X; Brander, Keith/0000-0001-9927-9600",Villum Fonden; H Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions,Villum Fonden(Villum Fonden); H Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions,Villum Fonden.

In this light, this study analyzed the effects of climate adaptation strategies on technical efficiency of maize farmers in Northern Ghana. This involved a total of 619 maize farmers that were selected through a multistage sampling procedure. A Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier was fitted to the data. From the result, the major climate adaptation strategies adopted by the farmers include row planting, changing planting date, mixed farming, refilling, and intercropping. The frontier result shows that while climate adaptation significantly leads to higher maize outputs, only crop rotation and row planting significantly improve technical efficiency of maize farmers. Other factors that significantly influence maize output are farm size, labor, seed, and chemicals. The study concludes that climate adaptation, particularly, crop rotation and row planting, remains essential adaptation strategies for sustainable food production in the region. However, further understanding of mechanisms through which majority of the climate adaptation strategies significantly reduce technical efficiency is required.","[Adzawla, William] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, WASCAL, Climate Change Econ, Dakar, Senegal; [Alhassan, Hamdiyah] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tamale, Ghana",University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar; University for Development Studies,"Adzawla, W (corresponding author), Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, WASCAL, Climate Change Econ, Dakar, Senegal.",adzawlawilliam@gmail.com,"Alhassan, Hamdiyah/HDN-2338-2022",,,,,,39,5,5,2,7,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2193-7532,,AGR FOOD ECON,Agric.

However, in-depth, evidence-based investigations of the relationships among individual perceptions, climatic disaster experiences, and daily behaviors regarding adaptation to climate change remain to be conducted. We obtained survey data from 488 respondents in southwestern China, a region prone to frequent and severe droughts, to assess factors that influence adaptive behaviors and to identify their pathways. We applied Construal Level Theory (CLT) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to differentiate between respondents' high-level abstract construals and their low-level concrete construals. We analyzed the influences of these two levels of perception, combined with drought experiences on water-saving behaviors. We developed a structural equation model to estimate the correlation coefficients of the latent and observed variables in the structural process linked to the respondents' adaptive behaviors. The results found that a concrete perception of saving water plays a more significant part than an abstract perception of climate change in prompting specific adaptive behaviors. Improving public perceptions of climate change might increase the desirability of adaptation, whereas improving perceptions of water saving might increase the feasibility of implementing adaptive measures. Experience influenced individual behaviors, but that influence was indirect through its effects on perceptions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, we used the microscale urban climate model (MUKLIMO_3), in conjunction with the cuboid method, to calculate climate indices such as the average number of summer and hot days per year. For the baseline simulation, we used meteorological measurements from 1981 to 2010 from the weather station located at Klagenfurt Airport. Individual building structures and canopy cover from several land monitoring services were used to derive accurate properties for land use classes in the study domain. To characterize the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies, we compared changes in the climate indices for several (future) climate adaptation scenarios to the reference simulation. Specifically, we considered two major adaptation pathways: (i) an increase in the albedo values of sealed areas (i.e., roofs, walls and streets) and (ii) an increase in green surfaces (i.e., lawns on streets and at roof level) and high vegetated areas (i.e., trees). The results indicate that some climate adaptation measures show higher potential in mitigating hot days than others, varying between reductions of 2.3 to 11.0%. An overall combination of adaptation measures leads to a maximum reduction of up to 44.0%, indicating a clear potential for reduction/mitigation of urban heat loads. Furthermore, the results for the future scenarios reveal the possibility to remain at the current level of urban heat load during the daytime over the next three decades for the overall combination of measures.","[Oswald, Sandro M.; Hollosi, Brigitta; Zuvela-Aloise, Maja] Zentralanstalt Meteorol & Geodynam ZAMG, Vienna, Austria; [See, Linda] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Guggenberger, Stefan; Hafner, Wolfgang] Klagenfurt Lake Worthersee GmbH IPAK, Int Project Management Agcy, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Prokop, Gundula; Storch, Alexander; Schieder, Wolfgang] Environm Agcy UBA, Vienna, Austria; [Oswald, Sandro M.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Meteorol, Vienna, Austria","International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Oswald, SM (corresponding author), Zentralanstalt Meteorol & Geodynam ZAMG, Vienna, Austria.",sandro.oswald@zamg.ac.at,"Oswald, Sandro M./AAH-3635-2019","Oswald, Sandro M./0000-0001-9491-7175",ADAPT-UHI project [KR17AC0K13693]; Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP) as part of the ADAPT-UHI project [KR17AC0K13693],ADAPT-UHI project; Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP) as part of the ADAPT-UHI project,"The first author named is lead and corresponding author.

This involved 300 farmers from two districts of Ghana and the data analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results showed severer climate impacts on the livelihoods of females than males in Ghana. On the contrary, the adaptive capacity of males was found to be higher than that of females. This was supported by the observed differences in gender climate adaptation where both male heads and male household members had higher mean climate adaptations than both female heads and female household members. Overall, the climate adaptation strategies mostly adopted by both males and females include changing planting dates, row planting, planting early maturing and drought tolerant seed varieties, mixed farming, intercropping and refiling of farm plots. Except for zero tillage and intercropping, male farmers had high adoption levels than female farmers. It is concluded that the observed gender adaptation differences were due to the levels and intensity of adoption other than differences in the type of strategies adopted by the different gender groups.

The present research was carried out to expand the limited knowledge on the minor varieties Arcos and Forcallat in comparison with three other more widespread traditional Mediterranean cultivars (Bobal, Garnacha, and Monastrell). An ampelographic characterization was carried out and provided with the characteristics for the cv. Arcos, which have not been previously described, as well as traits that are useful for differentiating it from the cv. Forcallat. Both varieties maintained low stomatal conductance, having the highest number of small stomata in comparison to the rest of varieties. Arcos and Forcallat also showed the highest intrinsic water use efficiency in addition to being late ripening, a characteristic that could be of interest in the context of water scarcity and warm climates for better coupling of technological and phenolic maturity. In parallel, we analyzed Veremeta plants considered a synonym of Monastrell, which were growing in the same field. The synonymy was confirmed by SSR markers, but phenotypic differences between plant materials were determined in relation to their ampelographic, agronomical, and physiological traits. Indeed, both accessions are very interesting as materials to be studied in agronomic trials under different watering regimes in order to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the drought tolerance of the evaluated Mediterranean varieties.","[Gisbert, Carmina; Pico, Belen; Torrent, Daniel; Peiro, Rosa] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Conservac & Mejora Agrodiversidad Valencia, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Soler, Jaume X.] Bot Mediterranea SL, Gata de Gorgos 31, Alicante 03740, Spain; [Fos, Mariano] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Prod Vegetal, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Intrigliolo, Diego S.] Ctr Invest Desertizac CSIC UV GVA, Valencia 46113, Spain; [Yuste, Alberto] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Tecnol Alimentos, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Intrigliolo, DS (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Desertizac CSIC UV GVA, Valencia 46113, Spain.",diego.intrigliolo@csic.es,"Gisbert, Carmina/H-4424-2015","Gisbert, Carmina/0000-0002-4620-1065","regional government of Valencia (Generalitat Valenciana) through the Conselleria d'Agricultura, Desenvolupament Rural, Emergencia Climatica i Transicio Ecologica [2020/VALORIZA/VSC/015, 2021/VALORIZA/VSC/015]; AEI-FEDER [AGL2017-83738-C3-3-R, PID2021-123305OB-C31]","regional government of Valencia (Generalitat Valenciana) through the Conselleria d'Agricultura, Desenvolupament Rural, Emergencia Climatica i Transicio Ecologica; AEI-FEDER","This research was mainly funded by the regional government of Valencia (Generalitat Valenciana; GVA) projects 2020/VALORIZA/VSC/015 and 2021/VALORIZA/VSC/015 through the Conselleria d'Agricultura, Desenvolupament Rural, Emergencia Climatica i Transicio Ecologica.

Adaptive capacity reflects directly on the ease or difficulty of the current and future adaptation processes of a system. In this study, the adaptive capacity in mountain agriculture is weighed in 4 different zones of Mount-Lebanon on the East coast of the Mediterranean Sea, one of the most vulnerable hot spots to climate change worldwide. The assessment was based on a multi-criteria analysis of the key indicators of local adaptive capacity, assisted by a survey conducted on 378 farmers (apple growers) in the study area consisting of 24 villages grouped in 4 clusters. Results show that, while presenting a variation between the 4 clusters, the local adaptive capacity is weak and less than the average for the concerned area of study in general. None of the considered zones concurrently had the highest score for all the assessed criteria and each cluster had its own strong potency indicators. The overall comparative approach reveals that the local potential for adaptation to climate change in agriculture, specifically apple growing, is the highest in the Bcharreh cluster area compared to the three other clusters of Aqoura, Mayrouba and Jouar el Hoz.","[Mahfoud, Charbel; Adjizian-Gerard, Jocelyne] St Joseph Univ, Dept Geog, Ctr Rech Environm Espace Mediterranee Orientale C, Human Sci Campus CSH,Rue Damas,BP 17-5208, Beirut, Lebanon",,"Mahfoud, C (corresponding author), St Joseph Univ, Dept Geog, Ctr Rech Environm Espace Mediterranee Orientale C, Human Sci Campus CSH,Rue Damas,BP 17-5208, Beirut, Lebanon.",Charbel.Mahfoud@net.usj.edu.lb,,,,,,,55,0,0,2,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

The yield prediction accuracy is significantly improved by our proposed recalibration algorithm on the simulated canopy cover (CC) using Sentinel-2 NDVI product. A developed mobile app provides an intuitive interface for collecting farm-scale inputs and providing timely feedbacks to farmers to make informed decisions. We show that RiceSAP could predict yields 2 months before harvest with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 14.8%, in the experimental field. Further experiments on randomly selected 20 plots with various soil series showed comparable results with an average MAPE of 16.7%.

Despite their potential, forecasts are not widely used, in part due to poor performance and lack of relevance to specific users' decision problems, and in part due to a variety of economic and behavioural factors. In this paper a theoretical model of perceived forecast value is proposed and applied to a stylized portfolio-type decision problem with wide applicability to actual forecast users, with a view to obtaining a more complete picture of the determinants of perceived value. The effects of user wealth, risk aversion, and perceived forecast trustworthiness, and presentational parameters, such as the position of forecast parameter categories, and the size of probability categories, on perceived value is investigated. Analysis of the model provides several strong qualitative predictions of how perceived forecast value depends on these factors. These predictions may be used to generate empirical hypotheses which offer the chance of evaluating the model's assumptions, and suggest several means of improving understanding of perceived value based on qualitative features of the results.

The Initiative underlines the role of soil organic matter (SOM) in addressing the three-fold challenge of food and nutritional security, adaptation to climate change and mitigation of human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. It sets an ambitious aspirational target of a 4 per 1000 (i.e. 0.4%) rate of annual increase in global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, with a focus on agricultural lands where farmers would ensure the carbon stewardship of soils, like they manage day-to-day multipurpose production systems in a changing environment. In this paper, the opportunities and challenges for the 4 per 1000 initiative are discussed. We show that the 4 per 1000 target, calculated relative to global top soil SOC stocks, is consistent with literature estimates of the technical potential for SOC sequestration, though the achievable potential is likely to be substantially lower given socio-economic constraints. We calculate that land-based negative emissions from additional SOC sequestration could significantly contribute to reducing the anthropogenic CO2 equivalent emission gap identified from Nationally Determined Contributions pledged by countries to stabilize global warming levels below 2 degrees C or even 1.5 degrees C under the Paris agreement on climate. The 4 per 1000 target could be implemented by taking into account differentiated SOC stock baselines, reversing the current trend of huge soil CO2 losses, e.g. from agriculture encroaching peatland soils. We further discuss the potential benefits of SOC stewardship for both degraded and healthy soils along contrasting spatial scales (field, farm, landscape and country) and temporal (year to century) horizons. Last, we present some of the implications relative to non-CO2 GHGs emissions, water and nutrients use as well as co-benefits for crop yields and climate change adaptation. We underline the considerable challenges associated with the non-permanence of SOC stocks and show how the rates of adoption and the duration of improved soil management practices could alter the global impacts of practices under the 4 per 1000 initiative. We conclude that the 4 per 1000 initiative has potential to support multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. It can be regarded as no-regret since increasing SOC in agricultural soils will contribute to food security benefits that will enhance resilience to climate change. However, social, economic and environmental safeguards will be needed to ensure an equitable and sustainable implementation of the 4 per 1000 target.","[Soussana, Jean-Francois; Lutfalla, Suzanne; Ehrhardt, Fiona] INRA, Paris, France; [Rosenstock, Todd; Lamanna, Christine] CGIAR, Nairobi, Kenya; [Havlik, Petr] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Richards, Meryl; Wollenberg, Eva (Lini)] Univ Vermont, CGIAR, CCAFS, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Chotte, Jean-Luc] IRD, Montpellier, France; [Torquebiau, Emmanuel] CIRAD, UR 115, Montpellier, France; [Ciais, Philippe] IPSL, LSCE, Paris, France; [Smith, Pete] Univ Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Lal, Rattan] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",INRAE; CGIAR; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); CGIAR; University of Vermont; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); CIRAD; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Aberdeen; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Soussana, JF (corresponding author), INRA, Paris, France.",jean-francois.soussana@inra.fr,"Smith, Pete/G-1041-2010; Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011; CHOTTE, Jean-Luc/A-5813-2009; Lal, Rattan/D-2505-2013; Soussana, Jean-Francois/P-2094-2016","Smith, Pete/0000-0002-3784-1124; Ciais, Philippe/0000-0001-8560-4943; Soussana, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-1932-6583; Havlik, Petr/0000-0001-5551-5085",French Ministry for Research and Higher Education; NERC [NE/P019455/1] Funding Source: UKRI,French Ministry for Research and Higher Education; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),S.L. and F.E. acknowledge the financial support of the French Ministry for Research and Higher Education (4 per 1000 international research program2016-2017 grant).,,112,155,157,24,326,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-1987,1879-3444,,SOIL TILL RES,Soil Tillage Res.,MAY,2019,188,,,,SI,,3,15,,10.1016/j.still.2017.12.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2017.12.002,,,13,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,HM5MV,,Green Published,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000459520700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is because they have the advantages of high energy utilization efficiency and lower pollution emissions. However, there are many influencing factors, complicated structures, and fluctuations in renewable energy sources, which led to ineffective system scheme configurations. In particular, the fluctuations in meteorological elements, such as temperature and radiation under climate change, have increased the difficulty of forecasting user's load and estimating renewable energy output. This research used a five-star hotel in Shanghai, China, as a study case and established an improved version of operation optimization model of a solar hybrid CCHP system. There are two major innovations: (i) Regional climate simulation software PRECIS was applied to predict the temperature and radiation changes in this region over the next 80 years, and the predicted results were plugged as the inputs to the DeST software and solar system output calculation formulas to estimate the user load and the system output under climate change; (ii) the outputs from step (i) were incorporated into the operation optimization model of the hybrid system for generating appropriate operation schemes which could help adapt to climate change. The obtained results show that in the same RCP scenario, user-side cooling demand increases annually. In contrast, the heating demand decreases over time. Their variation degree in the RCP8.5 scenario exceeds those of the RCP4.5 scenario, which directly affect the system output. In addition to external meteorological elements, selected key parameters (such as step electricity price) and cascade utilization mechanism also affect equipments' output. Compared with traditional optimization model based on historical meteorological data, the optimal operational scheme under climate change could effectively avoid imbalance between energy supply and demand caused by the extremely high-temperature event, and also reduce excessive energy supply under warm winter condition.","[Wang, Xu; Xu, Ye; Bao, Zhe; Li, Wei] North China Elect Power Univ, MOE, Key Lab Reg Energy & Environm Syst Optimizat, Resources & Environm Res Acad, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Liu, Feng; Jiang, Yuntian] Univ Sci & Technol Liaoning, Sch Met & Mat, Anshan 114051, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University; University of Science & Technology Liaoning,"Xu, Y (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, MOE, Key Lab Reg Energy & Environm Syst Optimizat, Resources & Environm Res Acad, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",xuye@ncepu.edu.cn,"xu, ye/GQO-8972-2022",,Open Fund of Beijing Key Laboratory of Demand Side Multi-Energy Carriers Optimization and Interaction Technique [YDB 51201901516],Open Fund of Beijing Key Laboratory of Demand Side Multi-Energy Carriers Optimization and Interaction Technique,This research was supported by Open Fund of Beijing Key Laboratory of Demand Side Multi-Energy Carriers Optimization and Interaction Technique (YDB 51201901516).,,33,15,16,3,40,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0196-8904,1879-2227,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

Effective climate change adaptation requires that we acknowledge this complexity. Theoretical literature on sustainability transitions has highlighted this and called for deeper acknowledgment of systems complexity in our research practices. Are we heeding these calls for systems' research? We used hydrohazards (floods and droughts) as an example research area to explore this question. We first distilled existing challenges for complex human-nature systems into six central concepts: Uncertainty, multiple spatial scales, multiple time scales, multimethod approaches, human-nature dimensions, and interactions. We then performed a systematic assessment of 737 articles to examine patterns in what methods are used and how these cover the complexity concepts. In general, results showed that many papers do not reference any of the complexity concepts, and no existing approach addresses all six. We used the detailed results to guide advancement from theoretical calls for action to specific next steps. Future research priorities include the development of methods for consideration of multiple hazards; for the study of interactions, particularly in linking the short- to medium-term time scales; to reduce data-intensivity; and to better integrate bottom-up and top-down approaches in a way that connects local context with higher-level decision-making. Overall this paper serves to build a shared conceptualisation of human-nature system complexity, map current practice, and navigate a complexity-smart trajectory for future research.","[Bedinger, Melissa; Beevers, Lindsay; Visser, Annie] Heriot Watt Univ, Inst Infrastruct & Environm, Sch Energy Geosci Infrastruct & Soc, Water Resilient Cities, Edinburgh Campus, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Collet, Lila] Natl Res Inst Sci & Technol Environm & Agr IRSTEA, 1 Rue Pierre Gilles de Gennes, F-92160 Antony, Ile De France, France",Heriot Watt University; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Bedinger, M (corresponding author), Heriot Watt Univ, Inst Infrastruct & Environm, Sch Energy Geosci Infrastruct & Soc, Water Resilient Cities, Edinburgh Campus, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",m.bedinger@hw.ac.uk; L.Beevers@hw.ac.uk; lila.collet@irstea.fr; av96@hw.ac.uk,"Beevers, Lindsay C/I-1398-2016; Beevers, Lindsay/GOP-1006-2022; Bedinger, Melissa/GOP-1118-2022","Beevers, Lindsay C/0000-0002-1597-273X; Beevers, Lindsay/0000-0002-1597-273X; Bedinger, Melissa/0000-0001-6097-1595; Visser-Quinn, Annie/0000-0003-1787-6239; Collet, Lila/0000-0003-2569-1509",Water Resilient Cities project; EPSRC [EP/N030419]; EPSRC [EP/N030419/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Water Resilient Cities project; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This research was funded by the Water Resilient Cities project, granted by the EPSRC (EP/N030419).",,86,8,8,0,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 2,2019,11,4,,,,,,,1163,10.3390/su11041163,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11041163,,,34,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HO3JV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000460819100223,View Full Record in Web of Science

Less well understood are the vulnerabilities that air-conditioning use exacerbates, and conversely, the need for the promotion of alternative strategies for coping with heat wave conditions. This paper considers these issues with a focus on the role of air-conditioning in the everyday life of elderly public housing tenants living alone, a sector of the population that has been identified as being at high risk of suffering heat stress. Methods: A vulnerability analysis of domestic air-conditioning use, drawing on literature and policy on air-conditioning practices and ethnographic research with households. Results: Residential air-conditioning exacerbated existing inequities. Case studies of two specifically selected low-income elderly single person households revealed that such households were unlikely to be able to afford this 'solution' to increasing exposure to heat waves in the absence of energy subsidies. Residential air-conditioning use during heat waves caused unintended side-effects, such as system-wide blackouts, which, in turn, led to escalating electricity costs as power companies responded by upgrading infrastructure to cope with periods of excess demand. Air-conditioning also contributed to emissions that cause climate change. Conclusions: Residential air-conditioning is a potentially maladaptive technology for reducing the risk of heat stress.","[Farbotko, Carol] Univ Wollongong, Australian Ctr Cultural Environm Res, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Farbotko, C (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Australian Ctr Cultural Environm Res, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",carolf@uow.edu.au,"Farbotko, Carol/K-2592-2014; Farbotko, Carol/E-6289-2011","Farbotko, Carol/0000-0001-8257-2085; ",,,,,29,38,38,2,21,AUSTRALIAN HEALTH PROMOTION ASSOC,MAROOCHYDORE DC,"UNIV SUNSHINE COAST, MAROOCHYDORE DC, QLD 4558, AUSTRALIA",1036-1073,,,HEALTH PROMOT J AUST,Health Promot.

However, the issue of how to achieve resilient communities has received less attention. The present study aims to develop a framework for devising strategies in order to improve community resilience, particularly to slow-onset hazards such as drought. Hence, the relevant literature was reviewed in order to establish a conceptual framework. Afterwards, the researchers investigated the framework in the context of two local communities (Barazandeh and Abbas Abad neighborhood) in Iran, i.e., Isfahan, against drought as well as drying up of Zayandehrood River and its aqueducts using a qualitative research design and retroductive strategy. For data gathering, semi-structured in-depth interviews were used and data analysis was performed through qualitative content analysis using ATLAS-ti software. Totally, 32 interviews with authorities, experts, researchers, and other stakeholders were conducted in two local communities of Isfahan. Findings indicated that any policy making regarding community resilience should not be restricted to local community level and should be expanded to multiple scales of local, regional, urban, and national community levels, even considering the two major disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) categories.","[Amirzadeh, Melika; Barakpour, Naser] Univ Art, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Tehran, Iran",,"Amirzadeh, M (corresponding author), 56 Sakhai St,Hafez Ave, Tehran 1136813518, Iran.",melika.amirzadeh@gmail.com; barakpoo@art.ac.ir,"AMIRZADEH, MELIKA/HIR-9975-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Amirzadeh, Melika/0000-0002-5223-818X",,,,,91,3,3,2,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

It is therefore valuable to predict the drought conditions in China following the release of the CMIP6 (the phase six of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project). Thus, based on 20 global climate model simulations from CMIP6, we project China's drought conditions and its socioeconomic impacts using the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI). Four scenarios are considered in this analysis: SSP1-2.6 (the low-level development scenario), SSP2-4.5 (the middle-level development scenario), SSP3-7.0 (the medium to high-level development scenario) and SSP5-8.5 (the high-level development scenario). Under SSP1-2.6, we observed wetting trends over large areas of China except the arid region during 2020-2099; however, under SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, significant drying trends are detected in the humid and temperate semi-humid region, while in other areas there are significant wetting trends. The projected drought conditions are likely to be severe with more frequent monthly occurrences and higher probability of extreme drying conditions, especially in these humid and temperate semi-humid regions under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. Consequently, the population exposure to drought in most climatic regions will increase initially up to 2040s and gradually decrease under all the scenarios except SSP3-7.0; and the humid region will be a future hotspot where the impact of climate on population exposure to drought will be more significant. The economic exposure to drought will increase over the whole China under all four scenarios, especially in the humid and semi-humid region. Our results have important implications for future drought projections and provide a scientific evidence for developing climate change adaptation strategies and disaster prevention.","[Chen, Liqin; Wang, Guojie; Miao, Lijuan; Li, Shijie; Amankwah, Solomon Obiri Yeboah; Huang, Jinlong; Lu, Jiao; Zhan, Mingyue] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Miao, Lijuan] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ, Struct Dev Farms & Rural Areas Struct Change, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Gnyawali, Kaushal Raj] Himalayan Risk Res Inst, Nat Hazards Sect, Bhaktapur, Nepal",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Wang, GJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",gwang@nuist.edu.cn,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; Amankwah, Solomon Obiri Yeboah/ABG-3553-2021; Gnyawali, Kaushal/P-3326-2016",", IAMO/0000-0001-7922-9665; Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; Amankwah, Solomon Obiri Yeboah/0000-0002-1074-3719; Gnyawali, Kaushal/0000-0002-7165-9668","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFC1510203]; Sino-German Cooperation Group Project [GZ1447]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41850410492, 41875094]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Sino-German Cooperation Group Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2019YFC1510203; the Sino-German Cooperation Group Project, Grant/Award Number: GZ1447; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 41850410492, 41875094",,77,12,12,16,91,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Understanding how and what people around the world adapt to is, however, difficult. Climate change is often, if not always, only one of a multiplicity of exposures perforating local communities. In Biidi 2, a small Sahelian village in northern Burkina Faso, climate variability have had a great influence on inhabitants' lives since the major droughts of the early 1970s and 1980s. Tracing the intertwinement of drought, diminishing agricultural production and the need to buy food, this article explores how villagers attempt to attract development projects and negotiate with political parties in order to negate the impact of the global food crisis on their livelihoods. In doing so the article attempts to show how adaptation to climate variability is related to multiple, intersecting processes, and in this specific case is a matter of navigating changing socioeconomic factors. Using recent theory from social anthropology, adaptation is explored as a matter of social navigation. It is suggested that this theoretical approach might help nuance and elucidate how, and to what, local people around the world adapt. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is the result of local, traditional knowledge on slope management, and has adapted to social and environmental change. Agriculture is being affected by climate variability, i.e. random changes of inter-annual variation of temperature and precipitation. This variability has increased with climate change, affecting food security and increasing poverty over peasant communities that rely on rainfed agriculture. For agriculture adaptation to climate change, most research attention has been paid to agroecology and agrobiodiversity management, while the role of agriculture terracing has been less studied as an adaptation strategy. The objective of this paper was to determine how terrace management contributes to the agriculture adaptation to climatic variability in peasant communities in the Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca. Located in southeast Mexico, this is a very diverse region in terms of geology, landforms and biotic resources where terrace agriculture has been practiced for at least 3400-3500 BP. Mixteca Alta is higher than 2000 m.a.s.l., and the climate is temperate with seasonal summer rainfall. The research method was qualitative, ethnographic and participative, using semi structured interviews as primary tool. The results of interviews were grouped in four categories: climate changes and their impact on the agriculture calendar; productive systems; characteristics of terraces for agriculture; and social and economic problems of peasant communities. Interviewees indicated that the main changes have been on quality and quantity of the precipitation, specifically a decrease in total rainfall but an increase in rainfall intensity, a delayed onset of the rainy season and an early start of the midsummer heat. These changes have resulted in a delay in maize sowing and in an increase in the potential exposure of crops to frost. Early cultivation of traditional cajete maize (using residual soil moisture) in terraces was acknowledged as an efficient practice facing these changes. Interviewees recognized that terrace flat terrains, with deeper soils and higher residual soil moisture than sloping soils, allowed for coping with climatic changes and water scarcity. Cajete maize is part of the cultural heritage of the indigenous communities in this region, but is being negatively affected by a double exposure: to climate change and to adverse agricultural policies that favor large scale market agriculture and neglect family farming. However, in a context of intense climate change processes, this traditional farming practice is an important staple source for the rural population in this region.","[Bocco, Gerardo; Solis Castillo, Berenice] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Geog Ambiental, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Orozco-Ramirez, Quetzalcoatl] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Geog, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ortega-Iturriaga, Adrian] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Bocco, G (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Geog Ambiental, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",,"Verdinelli, Gerardo Bocco/O-7908-2018","Verdinelli, Gerardo Bocco/0000-0003-4542-3544",,,,,69,6,9,1,39,CONFERENCE LATIN AMER GEOGRAPHERS,TUCSON,"CONFERENCE LATIN AMER GEOGRAPHERS, TUCSON, AZ 00000 USA",1545-2476,1548-5811,,J LAT AM GEOGR,J.

It can be argued that most of this information is accessible at the community/regional level, and thus, the important challenges to adaptation are not information gaps, but constraints created by fragmented planning decisions and a sector-by-sector basis for financial and human resource allocations. To strategically address this through adaptation planning, we developed and tested a place-based decision-making framework that creates an integrated platform for considering regional and global sectoral drivers in Eastern Ontario, Canada. Using available socioeconomic and biophysical information from regional authorities, alternative future scenarios were used to describe the range of socioeconomic futures and their vulnerabilities to climate change. We found that: (1) integration of diverse sets of available data (rather than narrowly focused sectoral assessments) helped identify shared common objectives (maximizing the long-term environmental, economic, social well-being within the region), (2) a high degree of congruence existed as the key drivers of change, irrespective of sector, (3) exploring the future scenarios highlighted shared regional priorities and helped identify adaptation priorities requiring more integrated regional planning.","[Waldick, Ruth] Agr & Agri Food Canada, 960 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Waldick, Ruth] Carleton Univ, Dept Geog, 1100 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Bizikova, Livia] IISD, 75 Albert St,Suite 903, Ottawa, ON K1P 5E7, Canada; [White, Denis] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Geog Program, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Lindsay, Kathryn] Environm Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Wildlife & Landscape Sci, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; [Lindsay, Kathryn] Carleton Univ, Geomat & Landscape Ecol Res Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Carleton University; Oregon State University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; Carleton University,"Waldick, R (corresponding author), Agr & Agri Food Canada, 960 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON, Canada.;Waldick, R (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Geog, 1100 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",ruth.waldick@agr.gc.ca; lbizikova@iisd.ca; whitede@oregonstate.edu; Kathryn.Lindsay@glel.carleton.ca,,,Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada),"This research was supported by research funding through Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

Women are heavily plagued by climate change impacts than any other genders worldwide. This is attributed to their high dependence on the natural resources for survival, low adaptive capacity, illiteracy, social ascribed roles that limit their participation in climate change initiatives like men and high poverty levels. Despite the daunting fact of women's vulnerability to climate change and its vagary impacts, women are agents of social change who have not remained passive victims to climate change and its impacts. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a qualitative methodology guided by multi-case study design. A sample of 25 participants was selected through simple random and purposive sampling techniques. Data were collected using Focus Group Discussions and individual interviews and analysed thematically. Rural women and traditional leaders served as key informants and participated in the study. Findings The study established that the effects of climate change on rural women are real; however, there is a cocktail of strategies employed by women in Vhembe district in response to these effects. The strategies include livelihood and crop diversification, use of indigenous knowledge systems and harnessing of social capital among other household-based adaptation strategies. Originality/value The study recommends that the best way of assisting rural women in adapting to climate change is through the amelioration of poverty, enhancing capacity building for women and elimination of all systems that serve as barriers to effective adaptation.","[Nyahunda, Louis] Univ Free State, Unit Inst Change & Social Justice, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew] Univ Limpopo, Dept Res Adm & Dev, Polokwane, South Africa",University of the Free State; University of Limpopo,"Tirivangasi, HM (corresponding author), Univ Limpopo, Dept Res Adm & Dev, Polokwane, South Africa.",mathewtirivangasi@gmail.com,"Nyahunda, Louis F/W-4577-2018","Nyahunda, Louis/0000-0002-9352-4115; Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew/0000-0002-1353-6635",,,,,59,0,0,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1477-7835,1758-6119,,MANAG ENVIRON QUAL,Manag.

However, this relationship has not been adequately investigated in studies dedicated to climate vulnerability. This study identifies the typologies of development patterns within Lahore, Pakistan, investigates the heat vulnerability of residents at a neighborhood scale, and establishes a relationship between both of these factors. We identified urban clusters with diverse development patterns. Fourteen context- and site-specific indicators were selected to construct a human heat vulnerability index. Weighted sum, cluster analysis, and ANOVA test of variance were conducted to analyze the data. Our results demonstrate that development patterns significantly influence human vulnerability to heat stress, e.g., vulnerability is higher in older cities and undeveloped neighborhoods with less diverse land uses.

On the one hand, climate change puts pressure on food security. On the other hand, farming significantly contributes to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This calls for climate-smart agriculture-agriculture that helps to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Climate-smart agriculture measures are diverse and include emission reductions, sink enhancements, and fossil fuel offsets for mitigation. Adaptation measures include technological advancements, adaptive farming practices, and financial management. Here, we review the potentials and trade-offs of climate-smart agricultural measures by producers and consumers. Our two main findings are as follows: (1) The benefits of measures are often site-dependent and differ according to agricultural practices (e.g., fertilizer use), environmental conditions (e.g., carbon sequestration potential), or the production and consumption of specific products (e.g., rice and meat). (2) Climate-smart agricultural measures on the supply side are likely to be insufficient or ineffective if not accompanied by changes in consumer behavior, as climate-smart agriculture will affect the supply of agricultural commodities and require changes on the demand side in response. Such linkages between demand and supply require simultaneous policy and market incentives. It, therefore, requires interdisciplinary cooperation to meet the twin challenge of climate change and food security. The link to consumer behavior is often neglected in research but regarded as an essential component of climate-smart agriculture. We argue for not solely focusing research and implementation on one-sided measures but designing good, site-specific combinations of both demand-and supply-side measures to use the potential of agriculture more effectively to mitigate and adapt to climate change.","[Scherer, Laura; Verburg, Peter H.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Environm Geog, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Scherer, L (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Environm Geog, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",l.a.scherer@cml.leidenuniv.nl,"Verburg, Peter H/Z-1582-2019; Verburg, Peter/A-8469-2010","Scherer, Laura/0000-0002-0194-9942; Verburg, Peter/0000-0002-6977-7104",European Commission [652615]; ERA-Net FACCE SURPLUS project VITAL; NWO,European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); ERA-Net FACCE SURPLUS project VITAL; NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This research was financially supported by the European Commission under grant agreement 652615 and conducted in the context of the ERA-Net FACCE SURPLUS project VITAL with the national funder NWO.,,161,49,49,7,57,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1774-0746,1773-0155,,AGRON SUSTAIN DEV,Agron.

This research aims to assess the scope and applicability of climate change-related knowledge acquired in the management of summer rangeland, with a case study in Semirom, Isfahan Province, Iran. To do so, objective weather conditions (precipitation, minimum temperatures, and maximum temperatures) were evaluated using the Mann-Kendall nonparametric test and compared with subjective evaluations by nomad community members. Specifically, the study targeted a community of 7700 members of the Qashqai, a conglomeration of nomadic tribes in Iran. Their understanding of the weather was evaluated using focus groups and self-administered questionnaires, with a descriptive approach to data analysis. The findings of the climatic investigation revealed a possible shift in the climate in the study area, particularly in winter and autumn. The findings of subjective evaluation showed similar changes in wind, precipitation, and temperature to be the main characteristics of climate change in the region, with about 90% of informants directly citing decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature and wind speeds. The community evaluation also highlighted some adaptations to climate change, such as delays in beginning the seasonal migration, increased reliance on concrete homes, reservoir construction, decreasing livestock yields, and increasing diversification of resources to feed livestock.

This paper reports on the level of climate mainstreaming in EU regional development policy in the 2007-2013 programming period: first, we explore the normative commitment to climate change concerns through an analysis of the National Strategic Reference Frameworks (NSRFs) in which all 27 Member States specify their development and funding priorities. Second, we analyze the substantive commitments by mapping financial allocations from the SCF related to climate mitigation and adaptation. Based on this, we gain five main insights, which are relevant to future mainstreaming efforts and which may have important implications for the wider debate on the purpose of European regional policy: (1) mitigation appears well mainstreamed in EU cohesion policies, both in normative and financial terms, whereas adaptation is hardly considered. (2) Rhetorical commitment to climate concerns in the strategy documents does not necessarily match financial allocations to respective priorities. (3) Neither mitigation nor adaptation-relevant priorities and allocations in the NSRFs can be linked to the ambitious mitigation targets and low adaptive capacity, respectively. (4) There is ample potential to improve climate-relevant SCF support in the area of adaptation, particularly given that several existing priority areas for funding coincide with the climate adaptation agenda. (5) By conditioning a minimum percentage of funds to be spent on priority areas (earmarking), cohesion policy also gains meaning as a burden sharing instrument for adaptation to climate change.","[Hanger, Susanne] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Hanger, Susanne; Haug, Constanze; Bouwer, Laurens M.] Vrije Univ, Inst Environm Studies IVM, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lung, Tobias] IES, DG Joint Res Ctr JRC, European Commiss, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Bouwer, Laurens M.] Deltares, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Deltares,"Hanger, S (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",hanger@iiasa.ac.at,"Bouwer, Laurens/AAV-7628-2021; Bouwer, Laurens/ABE-7170-2021","Bouwer, Laurens/0000-0003-3498-2586; Hanger, Susanne/0000-0001-7223-9991",DG Research through the FP7 project European RESPONSES to Climate Change,DG Research through the FP7 project European RESPONSES to Climate Change,"The research for this study has been funded by DG Research through the FP7 project European RESPONSES to Climate Change.

On the topic of climate change, adapting urban settlements to face this growing demand is a priority issue, especially for fast-growing cities in developing countries such as Brazil. Planning the urban morphology of the built environment is a key issue in shifting to a climate adapted urban environment. This paper addresses an important threefold energy challenge of tropical cities: the major potential of harnessing solar energy as renewable resource for local electricity production and the energy-saving paradox of reducing the undesirable solar heat gains in buildings while providing satisfactory levels of daylight. It aims at measuring the effect size of urban form factors regarding these energy goals. This study applies the Design Of Experiments (DOE) approach. A DOE analysis is a statistical technique that provides a set measure of how design parameters are correlated and the effective contribution of each one to a given response of interest. This study proposes a fractional factorial DOE method coupled to a Simplified Radiosity Algorithm (SRA) aiming to evaluate the irradiation availability on building envelopes while taking a large representative sample of contrasted urban block geometries into account. The buildings' envelope solar irradiation availability assesses a set of energy-related morphological parameters. Results indicate a significant impact of the aspect ratio, the distance between buildings and the surface equivalent albedo. Establishing high values of street aspect ratio may cut solar irradiation on roofs by 130 kW h/m(2) year, while increasing the plot ratio may only yield 26 kW h/m2 year. The results also point out important first order interaction effects between certain variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework to explore how business-network dynamics affect risk perceptions and adaptive behaviours in business firms. The framework is empirically grounded in a comparative analysis of business-network dynamics from three agricultural value chains in Jamaica that are vulnerable to climate change impacts. The results illustrate how the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of value chain actors are influenced by business interdependencies and interfirm relationships. We find that the level of formality of business exchanges (contractual or noncontractual), the level of resource interdependency, and the ability to diversify access channels to critical resources can influence the propagation of climate-related risks and influence actors' exposure and sensitivity to those risks. The study also offers evidence of the role played by bonding and bridging relational ties on adaptive capacity. The framework and findings provide a foundation for a new research agenda exploring a relational view of firm adaptation strategy in response to climate risks.","[Canevari-Luzardo, Laura M.; Berkhout, Frans; Pelling, Mark] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Canevari-Luzardo, LM (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England.",laura.canevari@kcl.ac.uk,"Berkhout, Frans/N-4196-2013","Berkhout, Frans/0000-0001-8668-0470; Canevari-Luzardo, Laura M./0000-0001-6570-2669",Economic and Social Research Council; NERC [NE/P01609X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),Economic and Social Research Council,,89,13,12,7,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0964-4733,1099-0836,,BUS STRATEG ENVIRON,Bus.

However, it is unclear whether transnational support actually enables more authority over adaptation actions and whether outcomes address wide-ranging development needs. In this article, I compare experiences from three cities in IndiaSurat, Indore, and Bhubaneswarand link local political agency over adaptation with their supporting transnational funders. I find that adaptation governance involves powers of agency over directing bureaucratic practices, public finance, spatial strategies, and institutional culture. A city's ability to exert these powers then yields different patterns of adaptation. However, political agency is circumscribed by a combination of historical political economic constraints and emerging transnational resources that promote specific forms of political meaning and procedures. The presence of external support therefore paradoxically constrains the governance autonomy of cities. This opens up new opportunities for development dependencythat is, ones that mirror neoliberal critiques of foreign aidwithin the global marketplace for climate finance.","[Chu, Eric K.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Planning & Human Geog, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Chu, EK (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Planning & Human Geog, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,"Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615",David L.

Using a human ecology and systems thinking framework and data from the Climate Change Adaptation Project (CCAP), implemented in Akar Akar village, Indonesia, this study explores the drivers of challenges affecting CBA. Results demonstrate that challenges affecting CBA are numerous, interconnected, and can derive from the disconnect between the world views of implementors and the politics, social structures, and historical processes influencing local activities. Challenges encountered in the CCAP project, for example, were found to derive from the implementors' emphasis on agency, self-organization, and responsibilization of women as a way to alleviate community poverty and improve adaptive capacity and its failure to comprehend the sociopolitical position of women in Akar Akar. With these findings in hand, this study advocates the use of systems thinking in future CBA research and intervention design.","[Barrowman, Hannah M.] Univ Canberra, Ctr Deliberat Democracy & Global Governance, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Butler, James R.

Policies that cannot perform under such conditions run the risk of not achieving their intended purpose and hindering the ability of individuals, communities and businesses to cope with and adapt to change. To explore the principles of adaptive policies, a four-year empirical investigation was launched in Canada and India to extract practical insights from complex adaptive systems literature and to study the characteristics of policies that have been effective under changing socio-economic and environmental conditions. Seven core principles for creating adaptive policies were identified and a practical policy analysis tool was developed to help policy-makers translate the principles into tangible recommendations.

The method is currently considered as a potential tool for and climate change adaptation against increasing heat wave intensity and frequency. However, although water consumption necessary to implement this technique is an important aspect for decision makers, optimization of possible watering methods has only rarely been conducted. An analysis of pavement heat flux at a depth of 5 cm and solar irradiance measurements is proposed to attempt to optimize the watering period, cycle frequency and water consumption rate of a pavement-watering method applied in Paris over the summer of 2013. While fine-tuning of the frequency can be conducted on the basis of pavement heat flux observations, the watering rate requires a heat transfer analysis based on a relation established between pavement heat flux and solar irradiance during pavement insolation. From this, it was found that watering conducted during pavement insolation could be optimized to 30-min cycles and water consumption could be reduced by more than 80% while reducing the cooling effect by less than 13%.

The study covered firms in manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and accommodation and food services sectors. Bivariate probit regressions reveal that choice of finance coping mechanisms varies by firm-specific characteristics, sector and locational features. Sectors with predominantly informal firms reveal higher usage of informal finance, signalling vulnerabilities. Micro firms and female-owned firms show dependence on informal finance, while educational attainment of the firm's owner, location within urban clusters and larger firms are associated with use of formal finance in coping with droughts and floods. The findings reveal that firms' adaptations to climate change risks require measures to facilitate access to formal finance and promoting interventions tailored around firm-specific variables, sector characteristics and business environment.","[Shibia, Adan Guyo] Kenya Inst Publ Policy Res & Anal KIPPRA, Private Sect Dev Dept, Nairobi, Kenya; [Shibia, Adan Guyo] Kenya Inst Publ Policy Res & Anal KIPPRA, Private Sect Dev Dept, Bishops Garden Towers,2nd Floor,Bishops Rd,POB 564, Nairobi 00200, Kenya",,"Shibia, AG (corresponding author), Kenya Inst Publ Policy Res & Anal KIPPRA, Private Sect Dev Dept, Bishops Garden Towers,2nd Floor,Bishops Rd,POB 564, Nairobi 00200, Kenya.",ashibia@kippra.or.ke,,,,,,,89,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This paper focuses on farmers' perceptions and adaptation decisions in relation to climate change. A double hurdle model that includes a logit regression and a truncated negative binomial regression was developed using data from a survey of 200 farmers located in northern Benin. The results show that farmers' perceptions of climate change support the macro-level evidence. The econometric results reveal that the most effective ways to increase the probability of adaptation are to secure land rights and support the creation and strengthening of local farm organisations. The most effective ways to increase the intensity of adaptation are to improve access to agricultural finances and extension. The findings of this study have several public policy implications for creating an enabling environment for adaptation to climate change in Benin.,"[Diendere, Achille A.] Univ Ouaga II, Dept Econ & Management, Ouagadouga, Burkina Faso",,"Diendere, AA (corresponding author), Univ Ouaga II, Dept Econ & Management, Ouagadouga, Burkina Faso.",hchille@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,37,3,4,0,2,AFRICAN ASSOC AGRICULTURAL ECONOMISTS,NAIROBI,"PO BOX 62882-00200, NAIROBI, 00000, KENYA",1993-3738,,,AFR J AGRIC RESOUR E,Afr.

A large number of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), such as the European Union, the World Bank, or Food and Agriculture Organization, have already started to mainstream adaptation. Yet, despite a surge in scholarly interest in climate policy integration over the past decade, adaptation is still predominantly studied as a local issue and mainstreaming in IGOs remains poorly understood. In this article, we develop and test an innovative framework for examining adaptation mainstreaming practices in IGOs. Using quantitative and qualitative data derived from extensive fieldwork conducted between 2017 and 2020, we examine mainstreaming practices in a large number of IGOs and arrive at two key findings. First, adaptation has been mainstreamed within the procedures and outputs of IGOs across ten (nonclimate) issue areas, while there is also evidence of important issue-specific variation. Second, there is variation across mainstreaming practices in the sense that discursive mainstreaming is most common, whereas more concrete collaboration, policy change affecting projects and programs, and budget allocations are less common. We conclude with a discussion of how our framework can inform the theory and practice of global adaptation governance. Key Policy Insights IGOs have mainstreamed adaptation into a large array of issue areas, yet scholarly and practical debates remain siloed. Mainstreaming adaptation has advanced most in IGOs in the areas of food and development and least in the domain of migration and security. Discursive mainstreaming is more common than other types of adaptation mainstreaming in IGOs, regardless of the issue area. Global governance is a distinct setting in which powerful states, institutional complexity, and funding constraints strongly affect IGO practices to successfully mainstream adaptation.","[Dellmuth, Lisa Maria] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ Hist & Int Relat, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Gustafsson, Maria-Therese] Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; Stockholm University,"Dellmuth, LM (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ Hist & Int Relat, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",Lisa.dellmuth@su.se,"Dellmuth, Lisa/AFR-8126-2022","Dellmuth, Lisa/0000-0002-1298-8525",Mistra Geopolitics: Navigating a Secure and Sustainable Future era [5]; Glocalizing Climate Governance (GlocalClim) - Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (Formas) [2015-00948],Mistra Geopolitics: Navigating a Secure and Sustainable Future era; Glocalizing Climate Governance (GlocalClim) - Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (Formas)(Swedish Research Council Formas),"We thank Matilda Baraibar, Thomas Bernauer, Nina Hall, Eva Lovbrand, Malin Mobjork, Philipp Pattberg, Aseem Prakash, and Naghmeh Nasiritousi for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

This commitment hinges on the essential requirement that natural and cultural resource managers (science users) and scientists (science producers) work in unison with one another. This partnership may be illustrated by the conventional demand and supply relationship, where resource managers create the demand term by explicitly describing a priori top decisions or priority actions concerning the natural or cultural resources they administer, and scientists supply relevant research products and services. But an ideal interaction of users and producers is not trivial and presents challenges in the process of establishing an actionable science portfolio. A few practical suggestions are presented here to set up a productive dialogue between resource managers and scientists, and broker that conversation as they work side-by-side toward agreed-upon common objectives. These useful tips stem from working towards the goal of establishing actionable science portfolios within the CASC network and may prove valuable to similar entities committed to delivering climate adaptation science to address resource management concerns.","[Bisbal, Gustavo A.] US Geol Survey, Dept Interior, Natl Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Bisbal, GA (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Dept Interior, Natl Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USA.",gbisbal@usgs.gov,,"Bisbal, Gustavo/0000-0002-6674-9941",,,,,22,6,6,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0302-3427,1471-5430,,SCI PUBL POLICY,Sci.

During the major droughts of 2005 and 2010, a large epicenter was located in the southwestern Amazon over the Purus River Basin. In this sense, we conducted a hydrological simulation in this basin to assess the climate change impacts on its water resources throughout the 21st century. The water balance was simulated using the Distributed Hydrological Model (MHD-INPE). The future climate projections were simulated by the regional ETA-INPE model driven by a 4-member HadCM3 global model regarding the A1B-AR4/IPCC scenario of greenhouse gases emissions. As simulated by the ETA-INPE/HadCM3, the 4-members mean response for the A1B scenario represents a rainfall reduction of up to 11.1%, a temperature increase of up to 4.4 degrees C, and a wind speed increase of up to 8.4% in the Purus Basin by the end of 21st century. Under these conditions, the discharge projections represent an overall 27% decrease in the Purus Basin with different patterns between dry and wet season, as well as changes in seasonality trends. The consequences of projected climate change are severe and will probably have a great impact upon natural ecosystem maintenance and human subsistence. In a climate change adaptation process, the preservation of the natural forest cover of the Purus Basin may have great importance in water retention.","[Dalagnol, Ricardo] Natl Inst Space Res INPE, Remote Sensing Div DSR, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Borma, Laura de Simone; Rodriguez, Daniel Andres] Natl Inst Space Res INPE, Earth Syst Sci Ctr CCST, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Mateus, Pedro] Univ Lisbon, Dom Luiz Inst IDL, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); Universidade de Lisboa,"Dalagnol, R (corresponding author), Natl Inst Space Res INPE, Remote Sensing Div DSR, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil.",ricardo.silva@inpe.br,"Rodriguez, Daniel Andres/AAB-1422-2021; Borma, Laura S./D-7008-2018; RODRIGUEZ, Daniel/GWC-3563-2022; Rodriguez, Daniel Andres A/F-5581-2012; Dalagnol, Ricardo/O-8907-2014; Rodriguez, Daniel Andres/AAN-2381-2021; Mateus, Pedro/C-6317-2016","Rodriguez, Daniel Andres/0000-0002-1054-1252; Borma, Laura S./0000-0003-4496-0612; Rodriguez, Daniel Andres A/0000-0002-1054-1252; Dalagnol, Ricardo/0000-0002-7151-8697; Mateus, Pedro/0000-0001-8027-2142",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [302561/2014-5],Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),The first author thanks the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) for grant number 302561/2014-5.

Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) offers a robust methodological background as one of the approaches to achieving system analysis for a product along its lifecycle. On the other hand, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can perform state-of-art system analysis characterising its sustainability fronts as a compelling set of tools. Pork, as the most consumed meat across Europe (circa 34 kg per capita per year), compounded with the sector's contribution to global greenhouse gases (GHG) doubling over the past decade necessitated this research. Our objective was to map hotspots along the value chain and recommend the best available practices for realising the sectoral contribution to carbon neutrality and climate change adaptation. To achieve the objective, we compared organic and conventional production systems by basing our analysis on Recipe midpoint 2016 (H) V1.13 as implemented in OpenLCA 1.10.2 using AGRIBALYSE (R) 3.0 datasets for eleven indicators. We found that producing 1 kg of pig meat under an organic production system had almost double the environmental impact of conventional systems for land use, water consumption, acidification, and ecotoxicity. Feed production and manure management are the significant hotspots accounting for over 90% of environmental impacts associated with 1 kg pig meat Liveweight (LW) production. Similarly, efficient conventional systems were less harmful to the environment in per capita unit of production and land use compared with organic ones in ten out of the eleven impacts evaluated. Implementing increased efficiency, reduced use of inputs for feed production, and innovative manure management practices with technological potential were some of the best practices the research recommended to realise minimal impacts on the identified hotspots.","[Ndue, Kennedy; Pal, Goda] Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Doctoral Sch Reg & Business Adm Sci, H-9026 Gyor, Hungary",University of Istvan Szechenyi,"Ndue, K (corresponding author), Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Doctoral Sch Reg & Business Adm Sci, H-9026 Gyor, Hungary.",mutua.kennedy.ndue@sze.hu; goda.pal@sze.hu,,"Goda, Pal/0000-0002-1900-2175; NDUE, Kennedy/0000-0003-0406-9606",Doctoral Publications Support Program of Szechenyi Istvan University-Gyor (Hungary) [2022],Doctoral Publications Support Program of Szechenyi Istvan University-Gyor (Hungary),This research APC was supported by the Doctoral Publications Support Program of Szechenyi Istvan University-Gyor (Hungary) 2022.,,58,3,3,8,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,JUN,2022,11,6,,,,,,,827,10.3390/land11060827,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11060827,,,17,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2K6BX,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000816419900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we describe a web-based, geospatial decision support tool (DST) that provides an assessment of the potential flood risk for populated coastal lowlands arising from future sea-level rise, coastal storms, and high river flows. This DST has been developed to support operational and strategic decision making by enabling the user to explore the flood hazard from extreme events, changes in the extent of the flood-prone areas with sea-level rise, and thresholds of sea-level rise where current policy and resource options are no longer viable. The DST is built in an open-source GIS that uses freely available geospatial data. Flood risk assessments from a combination of LISFLOOD-FP and SWAB (Shallow Water And Boussinesq) models are embedded within the tool; the user interface enables interrogation of different combinations of coastal and river events under rising-sea-level scenarios. Users can readily vary the input parameters (sea level, storms, wave height and river flow) relative to the present-day topography and infrastructure to identify combinations where significant regime shifts or tipping points occur. Two case studies demonstrate the attributes of the DST with respect to the wider coastal community and the UK energy sector. Examples report on the assets at risk and illustrate the extent of flooding in relation to infrastructure access. This informs an economic assessment of potential losses due to climate change and thus provides local authorities and energy operators with essential information on the feasibility of investment for building resilience into vulnerable components of their area of responsibility.","[Knight, P.

Identifying the climatic threshold is critical to judge the impact and risk of climate change and proactively adapt agriculture. However, the climatic threshold of agriculture, especially crop production, remains unclear. To bridge this gap, taking winter wheat production from 1978 to 2017 in China as an example, this study clarified the definition of the climatic threshold of crop production and calculated it based on a mechanism model considering multiple factors and their synergies. The results showed that (1) the climate presented a warmer and wetter trend from 1978 to 2017, especially after 1996. (2) Water, fertilizer, and winter wheat yields increased significantly (22.4 mm/decade, 96.4 kg/ha center dot decade, and 674.2 kg/ha center dot decade, respectively, p < 0.01). (3) The average optimal temperature and water thresholds for winter wheat were 7.3 degrees C and 569 mm, respectively. The temperature rise was unfavorable for winter wheat production, and the water supply increase was beneficial to winter wheat production. (4) Increasing irrigation and fertilization could raise the optimal temperature threshold and adapt to climate warming in most provinces, while Shandong and Shaanxi both needed to reduce fertilization. We established a generalized method for calculating the climatic threshold of agricultural production and found that multifactor synergistic effects could influence the climatic threshold. The climatic threshold of winter wheat changed with different adaptation levels. However, considering the limitations in resource availability and environmental capacity, increasing the use efficiency of water and fertilizer is more important for adapting to climate change in the future.","[Huang, Na; Song, Yu; Wang, Jialin; Zhang, Ziyuan; Ma, Shangqian; Jiang, Kang; Pan, Zhihua] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Pan, ZH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",panzhihua@cau.edu.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China; Key R&D program of Inner Mongolia, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China;  [2018YFA0606300];  [2019GG016];  [41871086]","National Key R&D Program of China; Key R&D program of Inner Mongolia, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ; ; ","Funding This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFA0606300), Key R&D program of Inner Mongolia, China (2019GG016), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41871086).",,82,0,0,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

A Climate Change Adaptive Information Platform was also launched to promote understanding and cooperation by sharing information on climate risks. However, the literature on this topic lacks information related to the organization of requirements and challenges faced by municipal administrative officials that formulate adaptation plans. To address these issues, we examined the four municipal forums hosted at Hosei University to encourage administrative needs for new technological ideas in areas such as climate modeling and impact assessment. We used text mining on the transcripts of the various workshops conducted in these forums and attempted to understand the changes in discussions and to extract issues related to the formulation process. The results showed that various topics, such as creating adaptation promotion systems, assessing the impacts of climate change, formulating adaptation plans, communicating with related organizations and stakeholders, developing human resources, and capacity building, were discussed, and a need for information, procedures, and assistance was identified for the formulation of feasible adaptation plans.

The combined influence of rising mean sea level (MSL) and storm surges exacerbate the extreme sea level (ESL). Increasing ESL poses a major challenge for climate change adaptation of nearly 2.6 billion inhabitants in the Indian Ocean region. Yet, knowledge about past occurrences of ESL and its progression is limited. Combining multiple tide-gauge and satellite-derived sea-level data, we show that ESL has become more frequent, longer-lasting and intense along the Indian Ocean coastlines. We detect a 2-3-fold increase in ESL occurrence, with higher risk along the Arabian Sea coastline and the Indian Ocean Islands. Our results reveal that rising MSL is the primary contributor to ESL increase (more than 75%), with additional contribution from intensifying tropical cyclones. A two-fold increase in ESL along the Indian Ocean coastline is detected with an additional 0.5 degrees C warming of the Indian Ocean relative to pre-industrial levels. Utilizing the likely range (17th-83rd percentile as the spread) of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change MSL projections with considerable inter-model spread, we show that the Indian Ocean region will be exposed annually to the present-day 100 year ESL event by 2100, irrespective of the greenhouse-gas emission pathways, and by 2050 under the moderate-emission-mitigation-policy scenario. The study provides a robust regional estimate of ESL and its progression with rising MSL, which is important for climate change adaptation policies.","[Sreeraj, P.; Swapna, P.; Krishnan, R.; Nidheesh, A.

We interrelate concepts from recent research on the climate-heritage-nexus with contemporary coastal climate adaptation projects to reveal some of the complex realities and nuances that are apparent on the ground, and to raise heritage concerns for future practice. Questioning the role that heritage plays in specific climate adaptation projects from Denmark and the Netherlands, two low-lying countries with long coastlines facing climate risks, we show the wide range of roles that heritage can play in climate adaptation planning and we propose a framework to conceptualise heritage in this context. The study shows the important role that climate imaginaries (i.e. depictions, affect, and ways of apprehending the climate past) play in climate adaptation projects, and reveals national and local differences. Finally, we discuss the knowledge gained from climate adaption projects in terms of developing dynamic responses to climate change, of working with rather than against landscape processes, and the potential role of heritage in creating climate-resilient living environments.","[Riesto, Svava; Lund, Anna Aslaug; Jorgensen, Gertrud] Univ Copenhagen, IGN, Landscape & Planning, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Egberts, Linde] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Res Inst CLUE, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Copenhagen; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Egberts, L (corresponding author), De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",l.r.egberts@vu.nl,"; Jorgensen, Gertrud/B-1396-2015","Egberts, Linde/0000-0002-0076-1569; Jorgensen, Gertrud/0000-0003-3987-3098; Riesto, Svava/0000-0002-7949-7026",University of Copenhagen; Cities and Adaptation to Sea Level Rise -New Space for Solutions; philanthropic association Realdania,University of Copenhagen; Cities and Adaptation to Sea Level Rise -New Space for Solutions; philanthropic association Realdania,"The work on the Danish case studies was mainly funded by the University of Copenhagen, with some additional support from the grant Cities and Adaptation to Sea Level Rise -New Space for Solutions co-funded by the philanthropic association Realdania 2020-2023.

A theoretical model under uncertainty is proposed to highlight the effect, on adaptation decisions, of considering adaptation efforts in forest insurance contracts. Results show that insurance is relevant to increase adaptation efforts under some realistic conditions on forest owner's uncertainty and risk preferences, and on the observability or not of adaptation efforts. Context One of the challenges of forest adaptation to climate change is to encourage private forest owners to implement adaptation strategies. Aims We suggest the analysis of forest insurance contracts against natural hazards as a vector to promote the implementation of adaptation efforts by private forest owners. Methods We propose a theoretical model of insurance economics under risk and under uncertainty. Results Our results indicate that when climate change makes the probability of the occurrence of the natural event uncertain, then it may be relevant to include adaptation efforts in the insurance contract, leading to an increase in the adaptation efforts of risk- averse and uncertainty-averse forest owners. In addition, we show that the relevance of insurance as a vector to promote adaptation efforts is greater when the forest owner's effort is unobservable by the insurer as compared to a situation of perfectly observable effort. Conclusion Under some realistic assumptions, the forest insurance contract seems to be a relevant tool to encourage forest owners to adapt to climate change.","[Brunette, Marielle] INRA, AgroParisTech, LEF, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Couture, Stephane] INRA, UR Appl Math & Comp Sci 875, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Pannequin, Francois] CES Cachan, 61 Ave President Wilson, F-94230 Cachan, France; [Pannequin, Francois] Ecole Normale Super Paris Saclay, 61 Ave President Wilson, F-94230 Cachan, France",AgroParisTech; INRAE; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Brunette, M (corresponding author), INRA, AgroParisTech, LEF, F-54000 Nancy, France.",marielle.brunette@inra.fr; stephane.couture@inra.fr; pannequin@ecogest.ens-cachan.fr,,"Brunette, Marielle/0000-0001-8192-4819",ANR [ANR-12-AGRO-0007]; French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the  Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01],ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the  Investissements d'Avenir(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This work was supported by the ANR project FORWIND (ANR-12- AGRO-0007).

In Africa, an estimated 90 per cent of the entire continent's population uses wood as a source energy for heating and cooking. However, the unsustainable harvesting of trees for heating energy not only contribute to forest and environmental degradation, but it is also a significant contributor to ill health, air pollution and climate change. Reducing the resulting adverse of ecological and health consequences will have to involve a mix of adopting renewable fuels and natural resource sustainable strategies. To date, implementing this mix has shown significant challenges, especially in developing countries. We performed this systematic literature review (SLR) to help us better understand how research is approaching this mix in Africa. We screened 792 articles resulting in a final selection of 34 studies concerned with environmental sciences. The review drew on qualitative, quantitative, and regional studies and applying a standardized method for screening, data extraction and synthesis. The findings reveal that current research focuses dominantly in four key areas: (1) renewable technology transfer, (2) climate change-adaptability, (3) climate policy, and (4) technology adoption. However, we identified a literature gap on the thin literature concerned with the impact of clean technologies to improving the environment and people's wellbeing. We propose planning a tool that would facilitate this process and suggest further research to incorporate monitoring its effectiveness.","[Daka, Ephraim] Turku Univ, Dept Int Business, Turku, Finland",University of Turku,"Daka, E (corresponding author), Turku Univ, Dept Int Business, Turku, Finland.",ephraim.e.daka@utu.fi,,"Daka, Ephraim/0000-0002-1646-1309",University of Turku (UTU); Turku University Central Hospital,University of Turku (UTU); Turku University Central Hospital,Open Access funding provided by University of Turku (UTU) including Turku University Central Hospital.,,43,0,0,3,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

Although the health system has a key role to play in addressing these health effects, so too do those professions tasked with the development of the built environment (urban and regional planners, urban designers, landscapers and architects), through improvements to buildings, streets, neighbourhoods, suburbs and cities. This article reports on the ways in which urban planning and design, and architectural interventions, can address the health effects of climate change; and the scope of climate change adaptation and mitigation approaches being implemented by the built environment professions. Type of program or service: Built environment adaptations and mitigations and their connections to the ways in which urban planning, urban design and architectural practices are addressing the health effects of climate change. Methods: Our reflections draw on the findings of a recent review of existing health and planning literature. First, we explore the ways in which 'adaptation' and 'mitigation' relate to the notion of human and planetary health. We then outline the broad scope of adaptation and mitigation interventions being envisioned, and in some instances actioned, by built environment professionals. Results: Analysis of the review's findings reveals that adaptations developed by built environment professions predominantly focus on protecting human health and wellbeing from the effects of climate change. In contrast, built environment mitigations address climate change by embracing a deeper understanding of the co-benefits inherent in the interconnectedness of human health and wellbeing and the health of the ecosystem on which it depends. In the final section, we highlight the ethical transition that these approaches demand of built environment professions. Lessons learnt: Built environment interventions must move beyond simple ecological sustainability to encouraging ways of life that are healthy for both humans and the planet. There are key challenges facing this new approach.","[Prior, Jason H.; Connon, Irena L.

Understanding of these uncertainties will help the selection of appropriate adaptation policies. Methods: We made an inventory of conceivable health impacts of climate change, explored the type and level of uncertainty for each impact, and discussed its implications for adaptation policy. A questionnaire-based expert elicitation was performed using an ordinal scoring scale. Experts were asked to indicate the level of precision with which health risks can be estimated, given the present state of knowledge. We assessed the individual scores, the expertise-weighted descriptive statistics, and the argumentation given for each score. Suggestions were made for how dealing with uncertainties could be taken into account in climate change adaptation policy strategies. Results: The results showed that the direction of change could be indicated for most anticipated health effects. For several potential effects, too little knowledge exists to indicate whether any impact will occur, or whether the impact will be positive or negative. For several effects, rough 'order-of-magnitude' estimates were considered possible. Factors limiting health impact quantification include: lack of data, multi-causality, unknown impacts considering a high-quality health system, complex cause-effect relations leading to multi-directional impacts, possible changes of present-day response-relations, and difficulties in predicting local climate impacts. Participants considered heat-related mortality and non-endemic vector-borne diseases particularly relevant for climate change adaptation. Conclusions: For possible climate related health impacts characterised by ignorance, adaptation policies that focus on enhancing the health system's and society's capability of dealing with possible future changes, uncertainties and surprises (e. g. through resilience, flexibility, and adaptive capacity) are most appropriate. For climate related health effects for which rough risk estimates are available, 'robust decision-making' is recommended. For health effects with limited societal and policy relevance, we recommend focusing on no-regret measures. For highly relevant health effects, precautionary measures can be considered. This study indicated that analysing and characterising uncertainty by means of a typology can be a very useful approach for selection and prioritization of preferred adaptation policies to reduce future climate related health risks.","[Wardekker, J.

Recently, the climate change and disaster community have proposed that it may be able to facilitate climate change adaptation, but whether this is the case remains under-researched. Addressing this gap, this paper examines the question in relation to microcredit's ability to support adaptation strategies that effectively address vulnerability to climate shocks in three villages in the Bagerhat and Chattogram districts of coastal Bangladesh. The findings provide qualitative evidence that at-risk people often use microcredit as a response to climate shocks. However, the case study only finds evidence that microcredit supports coping and incremental adaptation. Findings suggest shocks (some climate-related and some not) can result in reduction in food consumption, erosion of assets, depletion of savings, increased debt, and debt default, 'trapping' at-risk people in indebtedness through a process of cumulative vulnerability.

We used an array of lake sediment pollen and charcoal records to determine how soils and landscape factors influenced the variability of forest composition change over the past 2000 years. The forests in this study are located in northwestern Wisconsin on a sandy glacial outwash plain. Soils and local climate vary across the study area. We used the Natural Resource Conservation Service's Soil Survey Geographic soil database and published fire histories to characterize differences in soils and fire history around each lake site. Individual site histories differed in two metrics of past vegetation dynamics: the extent to which white pine (Pinus strobus) increased during the Little Ice Age (LIA) climate period and the volatility in the rate of change between samples at 50-120 yr intervals. Greater increases of white pine during the LIA occurred on sites with less sandy soils (R-2 = 0.45, P < 0.0163) and on sites with relatively warmer and drier local climate (R-2 = 0.55, P < 0.0056). Volatility in the rate of change between samples was positively associated with LIA fire frequency (R-2 = 0.41, P < 0.0256). Over multi-decadal to centennial timescales, forest compositional change and rate-of-change volatility were associated with higher fire frequency. Over longer (multi-centennial) time frames, forest composition change, especially increased white pine, shifted most in sites with more soil moisture. Our results show that responsiveness of forest composition to climate change was influenced by soils, local climate, and fire. The anticipated climatic changes in the next century will not produce the same community dynamics on the same soil types as in the past, but understanding past dynamics and relationships can help us assess how novel factors and combinations of factors in the future may influence various site types. Our results support climate change adaptation efforts to monitor and conserve the landscape's full range of geophysical features.","[Tweiten, Michael A.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Climat Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Calcote, Randy R.] Univ Minnesota, Limnol Res Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Lynch, Elizabeth A.] Luther Coll, Dept Biol, Decorah, IA 52101 USA; [Hotchkiss, Sara C.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Schuurman, Gregor W.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Bur Nat Heritage Conservat, Madison, WI 53707 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Tweiten, MA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Climat Res, 1225 W Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",michael.tweiten@gmail.com,,"Hotchkiss, Sara/0000-0002-0383-0144","National Science Foundation [DEB-6760756, DEB-0816762, DEB-0816557]; Pittman-Robertson grant through the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Pittman-Robertson grant through the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources,"We thank Cat Hawkins Hoffman for thoughtful comments that helped improve the manuscript.

This paper compares contrasting policies and programs in two Canadian jurisdictions, Pointe Gatineau, Quebec and Constance Bay, Ontario-both of which experienced major flooding from the Ottawa River in 2017 and 2019. The floods highlighted the need for government interventions, including disaster recovery compensation and property buyouts, to support homeowners through the recovery process. This research adopts the Protect, Accommodate, Retreat and Avoid (PARA) framework to characterize and evaluate the different policy responses to the flood events in the two provinces in the broader context of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Through qualitative research methods, the study assessed the strengths and weakness of the provincial policy responses, explained why different policies were created in Ontario and Quebec (despite sharing a common river and flood risks), described how the policy deployment strategies evolved and examined how the programs prompted homeowners to make the decision to either retreat or rebuild. Both case studies involved reviewing flood timelines and recovery efforts, examining the disaster recovery policies implemented and assessing the application of property buyouts in flooded communities. The case studies were then compared to draw out cross-case insights. The paper concludes with lessons for designing effective property buyout programs. This study is intended to assist policymakers to make informed, evidence-based decisions that can protect communities from inundations risks and build long-term resilience against flood hazards.","[Cottar, Shaieree; Doberstein, Brent; Wandel, Johanna] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Henstra, Daniel] Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Doberstein, B (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",bdoberst@uwaterloo.ca,,"Cottar, Shaieree/0000-0001-6398-0307; Doberstein, Brent/0000-0001-8891-7400; Henstra, Daniel/0000-0003-0224-9152; Wandel, Johanna/0000-0002-5120-9432",Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR),Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR),This research is funded by the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR) under its Quick Response Program for 2019 Spring Flooding.,,45,3,3,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

We use the UK Climate Projections 2018 as an example of such information. Their probabilistic, global, and regional land projections exemplify some of the key methodologies that are at the forefront of constructing regional climate information for decision support in adapting to a changing climate. We assess the quality of the evidence and the methodology used to support their statements about future regional climate along six quality dimensions: transparency; theory; independence, number, and comprehensiveness of evidence; and historical empirical adequacy. The assessment produced two major insights. First, a major issue that taints the quality of UKCP18 is the lack of transparency, which is particularly problematic since the information is directed towards non-expert users who would need to develop technical skills to evaluate the quality and epistemic reliability of this information. Second, the probabilistic projections are of lower quality than the global projections because the former lack both transparency and a theory underpinning the method used to produce quantified uncertainty estimates about future climate. The assessment also shows how different dimensions are satisfied depending on the evidence used, the methodology chosen to analyze the evidence, and the type of statements that are constructed in the different strands of UKCP18.

This paper examines the use of climate change-related information for national adaptation planning and decision-making in the Pacific Islands region to better understand the use of, and demand for, such information. Using an appreciative inquiry approach, a situation analysis was undertaken to examine the information praxis of national governments in Papua New Guinea, Tonga and Tuvalu, as well as the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme. The study revealed that adaptation decisions are (i) driven by national strategies and priorities which are innately community-centred, (ii) largely made through collaborative structures involving multiple stakeholders within a specific governance or project setting, and (iii) informed by a range of climatic and nonclimatic information from domestic, regional and international sources. The study also affirmed the importance of information and knowledge management to national adaptation planning and decision-making, evidence of collaborative and multistakeholder decision-making processes, and the trend towards country-driven and user-centred information and knowledge production. The study recommends dedicated commitment to and investment in information and knowledge management for Pacific Islands, and the need for a holistic understanding of the complex environment in which climate change adaptation takes place.","[Morioka, Kate; McGann, Madeleine; Mackay, Samuel; Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Climate Act Beacon, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Morioka, K (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Climate Act Beacon, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",k.morioka@griffith.edu.au; m.mcgann@griffith.edu.au; samuel.mackay@griffith.edu.au; b.mackey@griffith.edu.au,,"Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064",Australian Government DFAT [68616],Australian Government DFAT,The study was carried out under the Pacific iCLIM Project funded by the Australian Government DFAT under Grant agreement 68616.,,46,2,2,2,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The study adopted a mixed methods approach, mainly drawing data from field observations, focus group discussions (FGDs) drawing representatives from a household survey and key informant interviews. Primary data were collected in April and August 2015 from FGDs whose participants were derived from household heads who had previously participated in a broader climate change study. Key informant interviews were also held with traditional leaders, local experts and managers in the wildlife sectors. This was supplemented with data from secondary sources. Findings from the study indicate that stakeholders in the biosphere reserve implement green economy and climate change-related programmes and projects. Results also indicate that the biodiversity- and/or wildlife-related laws and policies developed prior to 2010 do not directly mention the term green economy and climate change yet these indirectly address the green economy agenda. However, recent soft law documents (post 2010) such as the Zimbabwe's National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2013-2020) and local councils' strategic plans prioritise climate change adaptation, mitigation and green economy-related issues.

Additionally, there is a need to better understand the likely uptake of adaptations. For example, diversification is one adaptation that has been identified as a potential farm-level response to climatic variability and change, but its adoption by farmers for this reason is not well understood. This paper serves two purposes. The first is to document the adoption of crop diversification in Canadian prairie agriculture for the period 1994-2002, reflect upon its strengths and limitations for managing a variety of risks, including climatic ones, and gauge its likely adoption by producers in response to anticipated climate change. The second purpose is to draw on this case to refine our current understanding of climate change adaptation more generally. Based upon data from over 15 000 operations, it was determined that individual farms have become more specialized in their cropping patterns since 1994, and this trend is unlikely to change in the immediate future, notwithstanding anticipated climate change and the known risk-reducing benefits of crop diversification. More broadly, the analysis suggests that 'suitable' and even 'possible' climate change adaptations need to be more rigorously assessed in order to understand their wider strengths and limitations.","Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC V8W 3P5, Canada; Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",Simon Fraser University; University of Victoria; University of Guelph,"Bradshaw, B (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",bbradsha@sfu.ca,"Bradshaw, Ben/AAD-4358-2020","Bradshaw, Ben/0000-0001-7195-3974",,,,,77,213,225,2,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

They are operating agricultural activities under these climatic conditions that affect farm productivity. This study explores farmer perceptions of changes in farm productivity and perceptions of causes of decreased farm productivity (if any) over the past 10 years compared with more than 10 years back. We partitioned the causes of decreased farm productivity into climatic and non-climatic based on the primary data collected through household survey in ten coastal subdistricts along the coast of the Bay of Bengal. We visited 381 households during September-October 2018 using a pre-tested structured interview schedule. Average monetary farm productivity in the study area was 1.98. A small proportion (11%) of the sampled farmers mentioned that farm productivity had decreased over the past years. A majority (64%) of them believed that climate change was responsible for such decreases in farm productivity. The farmers who thought that climate change was causing the decreased farm productivity were characterized by greater education, more awareness of climate change, less communication with extension agents, stronger belief in decreased cyclone and salinity, and weaker belief in decreased flood. The farmers perceived that dry period salinity, flood and coastal inundations were the major products of climate change to adversely affect crop productivity. Since agricultural adaptation to climate change requires clear understanding of the climatic impacts on farm productivity, and more than one-third of the farmers failed to identify climatic impacts on decreased farm productivity, their improvement of climate change awareness is essential. Extension organizations and other agents should promote updated climate knowledge among farmers to make them more aware of climate change issues, so that they can adapt to climate change through their agricultural activities.","[Hasan, Md Kamrul; Kumar, Lalit] Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Hasan, Md Kamrul] Patuakhali Sci & Technol Univ, Dumki 8602, Patuakhali, Bangladesh",University of New England,"Hasan, MK (corresponding author), Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.;Hasan, MK (corresponding author), Patuakhali Sci & Technol Univ, Dumki 8602, Patuakhali, Bangladesh.",mhasan7@myune.edu.au,"Hasan, Prof Dr Md Kamrul/U-8711-2019; hasan, kamrul/HGV-0910-2022","Hasan, Prof Dr Md Kamrul/0000-0003-3567-2854; ",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)",This study is funded by the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.,,84,17,17,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In an effort to reduce damages from storm surges and sea-level rise, the City of Cape Town municipal government set out to establish a coastal set-back line. This paper describes the process and highlights the potential for unanticipated conflict and resistance when notions of 'best practice' fail to consider local institutional interests and pre-existing legislation. This insight is important as coastal municipalities in South Africa look to implement set-back lines in compliance with the Integrated Coastal Management Act (Act 24 of 2008). McKenna et al. [McKenna, J., Cooper, A., & O'Hagan, A.M., Managing by principle: A critical analysis of the european principles of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). Marine Policy, 32, 941-955. doi:10.1016/j.marpol.2008.02.005] elucidate the potential for conflicts and contradictions when applying the principles of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe. Developing and a applying a set-back line for Cape Town's coastline was anticipated to be difficult given that the city remains socio-economically unequal and spatially segregated and that the coastline provides multiple different communities with amenities, resources and opportunities at the same time. What was not anticipated was the encountered resistance from within public sector directorates operating under the same policies. The paper suggests that differences in mentalities, technologies and resources (following Wood, J., and Shearing, C., (2007) Imagining security. Devon: Willan Publishing) make for subjective policy interpretations and applications by local officials. Recognising and managing these differences is critical if notions of 'best practice' prescribed at higher governance levels are to prove useful to climate change adaptation measures at the local scale.","[Colenbrander, Darryl] City Cape Town Municipal, Cape Town, South Africa; [Cartwright, Anton; Taylor, Anna] Univ Cape Town, African Ctr Cities, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Colenbrander, D (corresponding author), City Cape Town Municipal, Cape Town, South Africa.",darryl.colenbrander@capetown.gov.za,"Taylor, Anna/GYU-1386-2022","Cartwright, Anton/0000-0002-2033-9162",,,,,36,14,14,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0373-6245,2151-2418,,S AFR GEOGR J,S.

This article examines the effects of climate change on the livelihood activities of the urban poor in Ibadan, Nigeria. Adopting a cross-sectional survey design, the research relied essentially on primary data. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain primary data from 481 purposively selected urban residents engaging in different livelihood activities. Data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. The Respondents' Agreement Index was used to measure the respondents' awareness of climate change and climate change adaptation strategies. Tobit Regression Model was used to analyse the factors influencing climate change adaptation strategies, while the effects of climate change on residents' livelihood were measured using Multinomial Logistic Regression. Findings revealed that respondents were involved in diverse livelihood activities, ranging from trading to civil service. Long dry seasons, excessive heat, irregular rainfall patterns, and frequent floods make respondents aware of climate change. Low patronage by buyers, low productivity, and reduction in income were the major effects of climate change on livelihood activities. Diversifying income sources was the main adaptation strategy. Strengthening the physical planning system to build the city's resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters was recommended.","[Ola, Akeem] Univ Ilorin, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria",University of Ilorin,"Ola, A (corresponding author), Univ Ilorin, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria.",olabayo2080@gmail.com,,,,,,,78,0,0,1,1,"UNIV FREE STATE, DEPT TOWN & REGIONAL PLANNING",BLOEMFONTEIN,"PO BOX 339, BLOEMFONTEIN, 9300, SOUTH AFRICA",1012-280X,2415-0495,,TOWN REG PLAN,Town Reg.

Because the impacts are most acutely felt in local communities, it is critical to improve understanding of the response options that are available for and being chosen by communities. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of case studies reporting community-based responses to climate change hazards. Based on content analysis of published case studies, we generated an emergent evidence-based typology of such responses according to their nature and goals. Using this typology, we quantitatively analysed more than 1500 response examples and determined the patterns with which community-level climate change adaptation and disaster mitigation strategies vary across world regions and across economic and governance conditions. Specifically, diversity of responses is lower in developing countries, and implementation of local-level policy and planning responses is less frequent in countries characterised by low governance quality. Our results confirm that, although there is much that local communities can do to respond to the challenges of climate change, there is also a need for increased support of local activities. By synthesising data from many local studies, our research provides a first global evidence base for local-level climate change adaptation policy.","[Paterson, Barbara; Charles, Anthony] St Marys Univ, Sch Environm, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada; [Paterson, Barbara; Charles, Anthony] St Marys Univ, Sch Business, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada; Saint Marys University - Canada,"Paterson, B (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Sch Environm, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.;Paterson, B (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Sch Business, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",Barbara.Paterson@smu.ca,,,Saint Mary's University; Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response (MEOPAR) Network of Centres of Excellence; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC),Saint Mary's University; Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response (MEOPAR) Network of Centres of Excellence; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This research was supported by Saint Mary's University and the Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response (MEOPAR) Network of Centres of Excellence.

'Adaptation pathways' have become widely recognised as an adaptation planning approach, but they have not been utilised for long-term planning for city-scale urban heat risk management. This paper applies adaptation pathway methodology to urban heat risk management. We use spatially coherent downscaled probabilistic climate change projections that account for changes in urban-land cover and the urban heat island to appraise adaptation pathways and inform long-term adaptation planning. We demonstrate that adaptation strategies focusing solely on urban greening or building level adaptation based on current best practice are unlikely to cope with the increasing levels of risk. Air-conditioning may play a growing role in managing heat-risk; however, increasing air-conditioning will exacerbate the urban heat island and further increase the risks of overheating.

Subsistence farmers are crucial for Africa's adaption. But it is unclear how those that qualify to receive adaptation finance actually perceive climate change, even though perceptions are reflected in adaptive behaviour. This paper aims to show how perceptions of climate-related hazards drive adaptation and provide recommendations for the climate change finance community to support subsistence farmer adaptation. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 227 households in rural Ghana and Botswana were surveyed and their answers statistically analysed. Findings - The respondents' perception of climate-related hazards is analogous to existing environmental degradation. In the complex environment in which farmers operate, high vulnerability and climate dependency do not necessarily result in autonomous adaptation. Experience, means and perceived successfulness are more important factors, but these hardly relate to individual adaptive measures. Practical implications - Recommendations for adaptation finance institutions: build on existing development plans and policies on climate-related environmental problems; adaptation is more than a collection of adaptive measures, so financing adaptation is more than financing adaptive measures; extremely vulnerable people do not necessarily adapt autonomously, indicating that ex post adaptation remains important too. Originality/value - This study shows that highly vulnerable subsistence farmers do not automatically adapt and that adaptation is more than implementing adaptive measures. The outcomes are linked to the adaptation finance institutions.","German Dev Inst DIE GDI, Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, Bonn, Germany",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE),"Pauw, P (corresponding author), German Dev Inst DIE GDI, Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, Bonn, Germany.",pieter.pauw@die-gdi.de,,"Pauw, Pieter/0000-0002-9323-2577",,,,,66,16,16,0,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

In recent decades, streamflow and snow accumulation in these mountains have decreased, and climate models predict that further reductions in water will threaten the sustainability of downstream regions. This article presents a cascading multi-model and multi-scenario approach to assess how future climate change may affect the hydrology and water management of Pyrenees-dependent systems. In particular, we combined future climate projections and management scenarios and applied them to the Gallego-Cinca River System in the Ebro River Basin of Spain. We developed a hydrologic model for the headwaters of this system (the source of most of the water), and then used a management model to simulate reservoir operation and water allocation among the different agricultural demand units of this system, the largest irrigated region in Spain. We assessed future headwater streamflow for 22 climate models, and translated this climate signal into a management model by using a delta change approach. Finally, we evaluated the performance and sustainability of the system with indicators based on the frequency, duration, and magnitude of the supply deficit. The results show that use of the current planned management scenarios will threaten to the system's future sustainability, especially for irrigated agriculture. These results indicate a need to revise current water resource planning strategies in this region, and to establish long-term, robust, and sustainable measures for adaptation to climate change.","[Haro-Monteagudo, David; Palazon, Leticia; Begueria, Santiago] CSIC, Estn Expt Aula Dei, Avda Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50059, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Experimental de Aula Dei (EEAD),"Haro-Monteagudo, D (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Expt Aula Dei, Avda Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.",dharo@eead.csic.es,"Beguería, Santiago/A-7269-2010","Beguería, Santiago/0000-0002-3974-2947; Haro-Monteagudo, David/0000-0002-7885-8248",European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Interreg V Spain-France-Andorre Programme (POCTEFA 2014-2020) of the European Union [EFA210/16/PIRAGUA]; project INNOMED - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of Spain; Fundacion Biodiversidad of the Spanish Ministerio para la Transicion Ecologica,European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Interreg V Spain-France-Andorre Programme (POCTEFA 2014-2020) of the European Union; project INNOMED - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of Spain; Fundacion Biodiversidad of the Spanish Ministerio para la Transicion Ecologica,"Funding for this research was provided by the project EFA210/16/PIRAGUA co-founded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Interreg V Spain-France-Andorre Programme (POCTEFA 2014-2020) of the European Union, by the project INNOMED co-funded by the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of Spain in the framework of the ERA-NET WaterWorks2015 Cofunded Call (project INNOMED).

In particular, there is limited evidence on (i) the degree to which measures of perception are sensitive to questionnaire design, (ii) the accuracy of recall methods for climate change, and (iii) the degree to which measures of adaptation based on recall from one-time surveys match the historical record. Using an established panel of farmers from across Kenya and a split sample method, I test both the sensitivity of stated perceptions of climate change to question format and the accuracy of recalled adaptations. In one treatment, farmers face open-ended questions about temperature and rainfall changes while in the other treatment, farmers are offered closed-end questions. Both approaches are common in the voluminous literature on climate change adaptation. Responses are highly sensitive to question format, both in the degree of perceived change and in the types of changes. Stated adaptations are not so sensitive to question format, but still diverge. Stated adaptations do not correspond well to the historical record of farming practices over the 15 years of the panel. Overall, the evidence suggests that researchers and policy-makers should be highly cautious in their use of subjective perceptions of climate change and the use of adaptation measures based on recall data.","[Munro, Alistair] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, Roppongi 7-22-1, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Munro, A (corresponding author), Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, Roppongi 7-22-1, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",alistair-munro@grips.ac.jp,"Munro, Alistair/A-3714-2009","Munro, Alistair/0000-0003-3918-8701",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; JSPS Kakenhi [25101002]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25101002] Funding Source: KAKEN,"National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; JSPS Kakenhi(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Thanks are due to Yoko Kijima, Tomoya Matsumoto, Chikako Yamauchi, and the REPEAT survey team led by Bbosa Davis for data collection and assistance on task design.

We estimate private values for a coastal protection option in an empirical setting subject to irreversible loss from coastal erosion and a land-use policy that provides identifying variation in the parcel-level option to invest in protection. Using postmatching regressions and accounting for potential spillovers, we find evidence that the value of the erosion protection option is between 13% and 22% of land price for parcels vulnerable to coastal hazards, implying that owners of oceanfront parcels have a subjective annual probability that they will experience an irreversible loss absent the option to protect between 0.7% and 1.3%. We also find that, because of altered shoreline wave dynamics, a parcel with a private protection option generates a spillover effect on protection-ineligible neighbors, lowering the value of neighboring land by 8%.","[Dundas, Steven J.; Lewis, David J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Dundas, Steven J.] Oregon State Univ, Coastal Oregon Marine Expt Stn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University; Oregon State University,"Dundas, SJ (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.;Dundas, SJ (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Coastal Oregon Marine Expt Stn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",steven.dundas@oregonstate.edu; lewisda@oregonstate.edu,"Lewis, David/AAH-4137-2022; Dundas, Steven/AAV-9779-2020; Lewis, David/AFQ-9010-2022; Lewis, David J/I-5700-2013","Lewis, David/0000-0002-2161-4189; Dundas, Steven/0000-0003-3000-3395; Lewis, David/0000-0002-2161-4189; Lewis, David J/0000-0002-2161-4189",,,,,46,9,9,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Even though most farms use 'water-saving' technologies, groundwater depletion continues at an alarming rate. We investigate how farmers' past experiences of physical water availability are related to their current behaviour, by examining the frequency of irrigation and how farmers determine irrigation needs. Data came from a primary survey of 414 commercial farms. Using the seemingly unrelated regression estimator, we find that respondents who perceived a reduction in physical water availability and agricultural losses in the past irrigated more frequently and were more likely to use self-judgement in determining irrigation needs. These relationships were more pronounced for smaller farms than larger farms, farms with sandy soil, mono-cropping farms, and owner-managed farms. These effects were lower for farms that preferred in-person approaches for receiving irrigation advice. While the frequency of irrigation was higher among stone fruit farms, the probability of using self-judgement in determining irrigation needs was higher in olive farms and vegetable farms. We argue that farmers' irrigation behaviour must be considered for groundwater management policy and planning in Jordan, an important component of the country's ability to adapt to climate change.","[Kafle, Kashi] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 600 John Kimbrough Blvd, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Balasubramanya, Soumya] World Bank, Environm Nat Resources & Blue Econ Global Practic, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; The World Bank,"Kafle, K (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 600 John Kimbrough Blvd, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",krkafle@tamu.edu,,"Balasubramanya, Soumya/0000-0001-8035-7306","United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [7200-ME-18-IO-00001]; Mercy Corps Jordan, through their USAID-funded program 'Water Innovations Technologies' [AID-278-A-17-00002, 98.001]; CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land, and Ecosystems (WLE)","United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIAR); Mercy Corps Jordan, through their USAID-funded program 'Water Innovations Technologies'; CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land, and Ecosystems (WLE)(CGIAR)","This work was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [grant number #7200-ME-18-IO-00001].

By means of a literature review and critical analysis of the legislation, other public policy instruments and jurisprudential precedents, we aimed to understand how this composition is aligned with initiatives to mitigate and adapt to climate change and to reduce socio-environmental vulnerabilities resulted from or aggravated by it, with a focus on the situation of populations that live precariously in risk areas. As a result, we have identified a complex and not very harmonious composition of norms applicable to these protected areas in the urban context.

To address issues arising in the Aquitaine region (south-west France, now administratively part of Nouvelle-Aquitaine), we listed possible measures for adaptation to climate change impacts at the regional level and focussing on coastal hazards. Then we assessed their effectiveness with respect to long-term climate change and to the coastal management practices they are designed for. The assessment is independent of the local context and is therefore valid in most coastal areas. For this purpose, we conducted a review of the literature to select 51 measures that are potentially applicable to the Aquitaine coast. We then classified these measures combining two approaches. The first was based on the regional management practices applied by the GIP Littoral Aquitain (a public interest group for coastal management in Nouvelle-Aquitaine) while the second drew on the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change) classification based on the physical-environmental, socio-economic or institutional characteristics of adaptation measures. In parallel, ten criteria were defined to assess the current and future efficiency of the measure independently of the local context. Finally, by providing an assessment of the adaptation measures using nine of these criteria, this method allowed objective and easy comparisons between measures. The results were analysed taking each criterion independently and also through a multi-criteria analysis. Overall, the measures performed well against all the binary criteria except self-sufficiency and synergy with mitigation. The more detailed analysis of the results highlight the main characteristics of the measures applied in each management approach. The multi-criteria analysis identified a set of essential measures for adaptation to coastal risks in the context of climate change. 19 measures were rated at once as no regrets, robust and reversible/flexible. In general, the study shows that there are many short and medium term possibilities for adaptation (2030-2050, 2080-2100) and emphasises the need to implement some of these as soon as possible. According to our study, measures that generate immediate benefits are overwhelmingly predominant (86%).","[Baills, Audrey; Garcin, Manuel] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, 3 Ave Claude Guillemin, F-45060 Orleans 2, France; [Bulteau, Thomas] BRGM Aquitaine, 24 Ave Leonard de Vinci, F-33600 Pessac, France",Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM),"Baills, A (corresponding author), Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, 3 Ave Claude Guillemin, F-45060 Orleans 2, France.",a.baills@brgm.fr; m.garcin@brgm.fr; t.bulteau@brgm.fr,"GARCIN, Manuel/K-7532-2012; Bulteau, Thomas/AAK-1905-2021","GARCIN, Manuel/0000-0001-9245-4170; Bulteau, Thomas/0000-0001-7572-1863","Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region; DREAL Nouvelle-Aquitaine; EU (ERDF); BRGM; OCA Technical Committee (BRGM); OCA Technical Committee (ONF); OCA Technical Committee (Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region); OCA Technical Committee (DREAL Nouvelle-Aquitaine); OCA Technical Committee (Gironde); OCA Technical Committee (Landes); OCA Technical Committee (Pyrenees-Atlantiques departements, Intermunicipal agency for the Arcachon Basin); GIP Littoral Aquitain; GIP ATGeRi (Regional Planning and Risk Management); DDTM5 (Gironde); DDTM5","Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region(Region Auvergne-Rhone-AlpesRegion Bourgogne-Franche-ComteRegion Hauts-de-FranceRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine); DREAL Nouvelle-Aquitaine; EU (ERDF)(European Commission); BRGM(Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM)); OCA Technical Committee (BRGM); OCA Technical Committee (ONF); OCA Technical Committee (Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region); OCA Technical Committee (DREAL Nouvelle-Aquitaine); OCA Technical Committee (Gironde); OCA Technical Committee (Landes); OCA Technical Committee (Pyrenees-Atlantiques departements, Intermunicipal agency for the Arcachon Basin); GIP Littoral Aquitain; GIP ATGeRi (Regional Planning and Risk Management); DDTM5 (Gironde); DDTM5","This study was conducted as part of the Aquitaine Coastal Observatory's program (OCA) on Adaptation to Climate Change, funded by the Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region, DREAL Nouvelle-Aquitaine, the EU (ERDF) and the BRGM, and with contributions from the study's advisory committee: members of the OCA Technical Committee (BRGM, ONF, Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region, DREAL Nouvelle-Aquitaine, the Gironde, Landes and Pyrenees-Atlantiques departements, Intermunicipal agency for the Arcachon Basin), GIP Littoral Aquitain, GIP ATGeRi (Regional Planning and Risk Management) and DDTM5 (marine areas directorates for the Gironde, Landes, Pyrenees-Atlantiques and Charente-Maritime departements).",,50,19,19,2,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,MAR 1,2020,185,,,,,,,,105059,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.105059,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.105059,,,19,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,KH3FX,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000510533000015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Research implies that building modelling tools play an important role in the design phase. The results indicate that hourly facade adjustment can have a significant impact on GHG emissions and energy consumption reduction without compromising the comfort level. Optimization is proven to be an essential part of the inverse modelling phase, which provides the best possible option defined by the user for the characteristics that distinguish climate adaptive building shells.

This paper presents 9 fundamental principles that should be considered when designing adaptation policy, for example, a sound understanding of the potential regional effects of climate on human and ecological systems is required to target appropriate investments in adaptive responses. The distribution of potential impacts across different populations and the mechanisms by which these impacts occur are also key to effective adaptation measures. Options for coping with climatic changes must be considered in the context of multiple stressors. Further, adaptation is likely to exhibit varying levels of effectiveness as demonstrated by current efforts to deal with climate variability. Potential adverse side effects of adaptive strategies must also be accounted for to avoid solutions that are worse than the problem.

Increasing complexity of the urban context, gradual loss of tacit knowledge and decreasing social awareness are at the same time leading to inadequate choices with respect to urban flood risk management (UFRM). The European Flood Risk Directive emphasises the need for non-structural measures aimed at urban resilience and social preparedness. The Three Points Approach (3PA) provides a structure facilitating the decision making processes dealing with UFRM. It helps to accept the complexity of the urban context and promotes transdisciplinarity and multifunctionality. The 3PA introduces three domains wherein water professionals may act and where aspects valued by different stakeholders come into play: (1) technical optimisation, dealing with standards and guidelines for urban drainage systems; (2) spatial planning, making the urban area more resilient to future changing conditions; and (3) day-to-day values, enhancing awareness, acceptance and participation among stakeholders. Based on in-depth interviews conducted in The Netherlands and Denmark, we describe the complexity of decision making in practical UFRM and explain how the 3PA can be used when organising participatory processes. We introduce a theoretical framework characterising the large range of aspects involved in decision making related to UFRM and evaluate the usefulness of the 3PA in dealing with it. We conclude that the 3PA offers water managers and operators an efficient communication tool and thinking system, which helps to reduce complexity to a level suitable when organising strategy plans for UFRM and urban adaptation to climate change.","[Fratini, C.

A sustainable and resilient transportation system therefore requires information on the temporal and spatial pattern of risks induced by climate change and the assessment of resulting vulnerabilities. Such analyses in the past were usually made separately for each mode of transport based on different observational and climate model datasets and using different methodological approaches to analyse climatic changes and their impacts on the transport infrastructure. Within the research network BMDV Network of Experts an intermodal perspective is taken on transportation. Common observational and climate model datasets as well as a standardized analysis framework were coordinated and agreed upon to form the basis for comparable climate impact assessments for roads, railways and inland waterways.

First, the study maps the extent of coastal hazards for the baseline year of 2010 using a GIS-based inundation model. An overlay in GIS demonstrates the influence of spatial plans for the projection year of 2030. This allows for calculating the economic losses of the planned developments. The case study shows that the current provincial spatial plans direct land use conversions along the northern coast of Java to continue to occur in the future. This could significantly decrease the regional capacity in dealing with the exposure to coastal inundation. The analysis also demonstrates that a total area of 55,220 ha of land prone to inundation, consisting of protected area (1488 ha), fishponds (32,916 ha) and agricultural land (20,814 ha), is planned to be converted into industry (13,399 ha) and settlements (41,821 ha). Thus, these areas will be also prone to inundation in 2030. This change would potentially lead to an economic loss of 246.6 billion USD. The spatial plans issued by the national and provincial governments for regulating the future land use on the northern coast of Java have not integrated measures against hazards related to global sea level rise. Meanwhile, many existing developments have already been affected by coastal inundation. Rather than reducing the exposure towards coastal flood hazards, the case study shows that spatial plans could even increase the risk of climate-related hazards and cause higher economic losses. These findings provide a different perspective on the role of spatial planning for climate change adaptation than what is stated in the literature.","[Suroso, Djoko Santoso Abi; Firman, Tommy] Bandung Inst Technol, Sch Architecture Planning & Policy Dev, Bandung, Indonesia",Institute Technology of Bandung,"Suroso, DSA (corresponding author), Bandung Inst Technol, Sch Architecture Planning & Policy Dev, Bandung, Indonesia.",dsuroso@pl.itb.ac.id,"Firman, Tommy/V-2980-2019","Firman, Tommy/0000-0002-9708-0902",Ministry of Agrarian and Spatial Planning (MASP); Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA); MASP; JICA,Ministry of Agrarian and Spatial Planning (MASP); Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA); MASP; JICA,"The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Agrarian and Spatial Planning (MASP) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for supporting the study on integrating climate change adaptation into spatial planning policies.

However, a holistic relationship between these two concepts is rarely studied which this research aims to assess by conducing an empirical study in Pakistan in the context of rural flooding. A total of 120 samples are collected using household survey from four rural communities in two different districts. Indicators are chosen through rigorous literature review and categorized into human, social, economic, physical and natural assets. A total of 24 and 19 indicators for vulnerability and capacity respectively are used to develop the resultant index. Results show that the two analyzed districts have a similar pattern of vulnerabilities; however, in both districts, capacities differ with respect to different livelihood categories. A significant negative correlation is observed in the study area which confirms the relationship theorized in literature between vulnerability and capacity. The methodology adopted in this study can also be replicated to pragmatically validate the relationship between both of these concepts for future extreme climatic events and disasters.","[Jamshed, Ali; Birkmann, Joern] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning IREUS, Stuttgart, Germany; [Rana, Irfan Ahmad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Mirza, Usman Maqsood] Univ Stuttgart, Master Program Infrastruct Planning MIP, Stuttgart, Germany",University of Stuttgart; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; University of Stuttgart,"Jamshed, A (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning IREUS, Stuttgart, Germany.",ali_jam89@hotmail.com; irfanrana90@hotmail.com; usman.mirza@daad-alumni.de; joern.birkmann@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de,"Birkmann, Joern jb/J-5736-2015; Jamshed, Ali/AAF-6809-2020; Jamshed, Ali/J-8592-2018; Rana, Irfan Ahmad/C-2560-2017; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Rana, Irfan Ahmad/0000-0002-3157-1186; Jamshed, Ali/0000-0003-4802-1225; Birkmann, Joern/0000-0001-8733-3964","Higher Education Commision, Pakistan [SAP-50020940]; German Academic Exchange Service [PIN=91549672]","Higher Education Commision, Pakistan; German Academic Exchange Service(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD))","The authors would like to thank the Higher Education Commision, Pakistan, (SAP-50020940) and German Academic Exchange Service (PIN=91549672) for providing funding to the first author to carry out research work.

In climate change literature, the focus has been on developing a new dedicated policy domain for climate adaptation. Yet, empirical evidence shows that in practice actors are searching for solutions that not only serve climate adaptation, but integrate the adaptation objective in existing policy domains (e.g., urban planning, water management, public health). The integration of adaptation in other policy domains, also called mainstreaming climate adaptation, can stimulate the effectiveness of policy making through combining objectives, increase efficient use of human and financial resources and ensure long-term sustainable investments. A better understanding of the process of mainstreaming is, however, lacking. The article introduces a conceptual model for mainstreaming climate adaptation to enhance our understanding of the concept as well as the barriers and opportunities that influence these integration processes and to explore strategies for overcoming barriers and creating opportunities. Two Dutch case studies-related to urban planning-are used to illustrate the value of the model. The cases demonstrate the dynamic process of mainstreaming and raise discussion of the appropriate criteria for evaluating mainstreaming in relation to the aims of climate adaptation. The paper concludes with an exploration of specific strategies to facilitate the mainstreaming of adaptation in existing and new policy domains.","[Uittenbroek, Caroline J.; Runhaar, Hens A.

A challenge for the local populations is improving their adaptation capacity to climate change hazards in a sustainable way. This study deals with the impacts of climate change-associated hazards and adaptation capacity in coastal communes of the Ky Anh district, Ha Tinh province along the coast in Central Vietnam. A combination of the Stakeholder Delphi technique and the DPSIR (drivers-pressures-states-impacts-responses) framework was used. Delphi questionnaires allowed assessing the consensus among the respondents of a stakeholder group. Twenty questions and 20 statements were listed reflecting the DPSIR components. Thirty-six panel members, which were randomly selected from four stakeholder groups which included local authorities, farmers, fishermen, and fish traders, were involved in a two-round Delphi process. The results show that, both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors are main drivers (D); migration, calamities, population growth, mineral mining, aquaculture processing, and agriculture are main pressures (P); changes in the frequency of extreme weather events, increasing intensity of storms, floods, and droughts indicate main states (S); changes in agricultural land use and productivity are main impacts (I); construction of and upgrading dykes and irrigation systems should be the principal responses (R) in the vision of the local stakeholders. The Kendall's W value for the second round is 0.681, indicating a high degree of consensus among the panel members and confidence in the ranks. Overall, the study advocates developing sustainable ecosystems, an upgraded New Rural Planning, and renewable energy strategies as the main local adaptations to climate change hazards in this area.","[An Thinh Nguyen; Dang, Giang T.

Of 812 articles identified, 22 peer-reviewed articles that directly addressed health co-benefits or risks of adaptation were included in the review. The co-benefits and risks identified in the literature most commonly relate to improvements in health associated with adaptation actions that affect social capital and urban design. Health co-benefits of improvements in social capital have positive influences on mental health, independently of other determinants. Risks included reinforcing existing misconceptions regarding health. Health co-benefits of urban design strategies included reduced obesity, cardiovascular disease and improved mental health through increased physical activity, cooling spaces (e.g., shaded areas), and social connectivity. Risks included pollen allergies with increased urban green space, and adverse health effects from heat events through the use of air conditioning.

However, empirical studies regarding the emergence, causes and sustenance of adaptation barriers remain limited. This research identifies key contextual causes of adaptation barriers in water institutions in the mountainous Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh in northern India. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with representatives from twenty-six key governmental, non-governmental, academic and research institutions in the State with responsibilities spanning domestic water supply, irrigation and hydropower generation, environmental monitoring and research. It identified low knowledge capacity and resources, policy implementation gaps, normative attitudes, and unavailability and inaccessibility of data and information compounded with weak inter-institutional networks as key adaptation barriers. Although these barriers are similar to those reported elsewhere, they have important locally-contextual root causes. For instance, inadequate resources result from fragmented resources allocation due to competing developmental priorities and the desire of the political leadership to please diverse electors, rather than climate scepticism. The identified individual barriers are found to be highly inter-dependent and closely intertwined which enables the identification of leverage points for interventions to maximise barrier removal. For instance, breaking down key barriers hindering accessibility to data and information, which are shaped by systemic bureaucracies and cultural attitudes, will involve attitudinal change through sensitisation to the importance of accurate and accessible data and information and the building trust between different actors, in addition to institutional structural changes through legislation and inter-institutional agreements. Approaching barriers as a system of contextually interconnected cultural, systemic, geographical and political underlying factors enriches the understanding of adaptation enablers, thereby contributing to achieving a better adapted society.

Developing countries face significant challenges for contextualizing global-scale scientific research into national political dynamics and downscaling global frameworks to sub-national levels, where the most affected are presumed to live. This article critiques the ways in which the politics of representation and climate science are framed and pursued in the process of climate policy development, and contributes to an understanding of the relative effectiveness of globally framed, generic policy mechanisms in vulnerable and politically volatile contexts. Based on this analysis, it also outlines opportunities for the possibility of improving climate policy processes to contest technocratic framing and generic international adaptation solutions. Policy relevance Nepal's position as one of the countries most at risk from climate change in the Himalayas has spurred significant international support to craft climate policy responses over the past few years. Focusing on the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) and the Climate Change Policy, this article examines the extent to which internationally and scientifically framed climate policy in Nepal recognizes the unfolding political mobilizations around the demand for a representative state and equitable adaptation to climate risks. This is particularly important in Nepal, where political unrest in the post-conflict transition after the end of the civil war in 2006 has focused around struggles over representation for those historically on the political margins. Arguing that vulnerability to climate risk is produced in conjunction with social and political conditions, and that not everyone in the same locality is equally vulnerable, we demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of the politics of representation for climate policy making in Nepal. However, so far, this policy making has primarily been shaped through a technocratic framing that avoids political contestations and downplays the demand for inclusive and deliberative processes. Based on this analysis, we identify the need for a flexible, contextually grounded, and multi-scalar approach to political representation while also emphasizing the need for downscaling climate science that can inform policy development and implementation to achieve fair and effective adaptation to climate change.","[Ojha, Hemant R.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Social Sci, Kensington Campus, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Ojha, Hemant R.; Dhungana, Hari] Southasia Inst Adv Studies, POB 23499, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Ghimire, Sharad] Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Pain, Adam] Danish Inst Int Studies, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Box 7012,Ulls Vag 28A, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Pain, Adam] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Box 7012,Ulls Vag 28A, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Nightingale, Andrea] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Global Studies, Box 700, S-40384 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Khatri, Dil B.] ForestAct Nepal, POB 12207, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Khatri, Dil B.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, POB 12207, Kathmandu, Nepal",University of New South Wales Sydney; American University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Gothenburg; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Ojha, HR (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Social Sci, Kensington Campus, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;Ojha, HR (corresponding author), Southasia Inst Adv Studies, POB 23499, Kathmandu, Nepal.",h.ojha@unsw.edu.au,"Khatri, Dil/AAM-8716-2020; Ojha, Hemant/C-7490-2011","Ojha, Hemant/0000-0003-2654-4092; Nightingale, Andrea Joslyn/0000-0001-5343-9576","Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs 'Climate Change and Rural Institutions', DFC [11-026DIIS]; British Academy; Southasia Institute of Advanced Studies; Alliance for Social Dialogue","Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs 'Climate Change and Rural Institutions', DFC; British Academy; Southasia Institute of Advanced Studies; Alliance for Social Dialogue","This article is based on the findings of various research projects, including the one funded by the Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs 'Climate Change and Rural Institutions', DFC no. 11-026DIIS (first, third, fifth, and sixth co-authors), the British Academy (first and fourth co-authors), a fellowship project of the Southasia Institute of Advanced Studies and Alliance for Social Dialogue (second co-author).

However, climate change and urbanisation have put significant pressure on ecosystems and compelled nations and territories in Oceania to urgently adapt. This article, with a focus on Pacific Island Oceania but some insight from Aotearoa New Zealand, reviews key literature focused on ecosystem health and human health and wellbeing in Oceania and the important potential contribution of nature-based solutions to limiting the negative impacts of climate change and urbanisation. The inextricable link between human wellbeing and provision of ecosystem services is well established. However, given the uniqueness of Oceania, rich in cultural and biological diversity and traditional ecological knowledge, these links require further examination leading potentially to a new conceptualisation of wellbeing frameworks in relation to human/nature relationships. Rapidly urbanising Oceania has a growing body of rural, peri-urban and urban nature-based solutions experience to draw from. However, important gaps in knowledge and practice remain. Pertinently, there is a need, potential-and therefore opportunity-to define an urban design agenda positioned within an urban ecosystem services framework, focused on human wellbeing and informed by traditional ecological knowledge, determined by and relevant for those living in the islands of Oceania as a means to work towards effective urban climate change adaptation.","[Kiddle, Gabriel Luke; Blaschke, Paul] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Te Kura Tatai Aro Whenua, Te Herenga Waka, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Pedersen Zari, Maibritt; Chanse, Victoria] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington Sch Architecture, Te Kura Waihanga, Te Herenga Waka, Wellington 6011, New Zealand; [Kiddle, Rebecca] Hutt City Council, Lower Hutt 5010, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; Victoria University Wellington,"Kiddle, GL (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Te Kura Tatai Aro Whenua, Te Herenga Waka, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.",luke.kiddle@vuw.ac.nz; maibritt.pedersen@vuw.ac.nz; paul@blaschkerutherford.co.nz; victoria.chanse@vuw.ac.nz; Becky.Kiddle@huttcity.govt.nz,,"Kiddle, Gabriel/0000-0002-4059-9834; Pedersen Zari, Maibritt/0000-0003-4664-7558",Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund award; Te Herenga Waka-Victoria University of Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation Strategic Research Fund award,Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund award(Royal Society of New Zealand); Te Herenga Waka-Victoria University of Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation Strategic Research Fund award,This research was funded by the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund and two Te HerengaWaka-Victoria University ofWellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation Strategic Research Fund awards.,,99,3,3,9,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2021,13,22,,,,,,,12660,10.3390/su132212660,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132212660,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XH1MP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000725206000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is multidisciplinary study area with promising applications in the field of urban microclimate simulations, supporting climate-resilient redevelopment actions at both the city and neighborhood levels. The CLARITY CSIS (Climate Services Information System, available at ), developed within the H2020 CLARITY project, is an innovative hazard/impact modeling tool that takes into account short- to long-term climate change scenarios and urban microclimate variability. Disaster risks associated with climate change, such as heat waves and floods, are concentrated in limited periods of the year and therefore not adequately represented by annually averaged values. To this aim, new datasets have been extracted from Regional Climate Models to estimate the frequency of extreme temperatures and precipitation events until 2100, and a novel modeling methodology has been developed to capture the effect on the urban microclimate due to specific built environment features. The wide amount of data generated by satellite earth observations and made available at pan-European level through the Copernicus datasets (e.g., Urban Atlas, European Settlement Map, etc.) has been processed through specific algorithms and GIS spatial analysis tools to extract detailed information related to key parameters linked to urban morphology and surface types. In addition to the screening service available at the pan-European level through the CLARITY CSIS, an expert service workflow allows increasing the resolution of hazard and impact simulations at 250 m, by exploiting detailed land use datasets provided by local end-users and assessing the DRR/CCA potential of city-wide adaptation plans, as well as of specific district redevelopment projects. This paper will present the features of CLARITY CSIS and the results of Expert Services implemented for the City of Naples, focusing on the methods adopted to implement hazard/impact assessments and how information from climate services is tailored to support the integration of different DRR/CCA strategies within urban plans and projects.","[Zuccaro, Giulio] Univ Naples Federico II, PUNIVS LUPT Study Ctr, Dept Struct Engn & Architecture, Naples, Italy; [Leone, Mattia Federico] Univ Naples Federico II, PUNIVS LUPT Study Ctr, Dept Architecture, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II,"Leone, MF (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, PUNIVS LUPT Study Ctr, Dept Architecture, Naples, Italy.",mattia.leone@unina.it,,"LEONE, MATTIA FEDERICO/0000-0003-2434-509X",EU [730355],EU(European Commission),"CLARITY project has received funding from the EU H2020 R and I program (Grant no. 730355).

In 2007/2008, Ku-ring-gai Council considered the various methods and selected two for review to inform Council's own adaptation plan. The models reviewed were the Australian Greenhouse Office model and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) model. These models were promoted as suitable for local government decision-making. The review found both models can identify key risks, and prioritise risks according to their magnitude. However, the capacity of these models to analyse effective and efficient adaptation appears limited, as they address only the first part of a very complex planning scenario. To plan effective risk-management options, a model needs to be able to evaluate the effect an option may have on reducing risk and highlight where an option may result in unintended consequences. In addition, the model must identify trade-offs or impacts, inform whether a response will increase resilience or reduce vulnerability across financial, social and environmental sectors, and satisfy due diligence in regard to the ecologically sustainable development principles. Both models have useful qualities and provide a basis on which to commence adaptation planning. However, the ICLEI model appears to be a superior guide to adaptation planning. Further development and refinement of these methods are required before a systematic, positive course can be charted for adaptation in local government.","[Scott, J.; Weston, C.] Ku Ring Gai Council, Pymble, NSW 2073, Australia",,"Scott, J (corresponding author), Ku Ring Gai Council, POB 1056, Pymble, NSW 2073, Australia.",jscott@kmc.nsw.gov.au,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,17,EIANZ-ENVIRONMENT INST AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND,MELBOURNE,"GPO BOX 211, MELBOURNE, VIC 3001, AUSTRALIA",1448-6563,1322-1698,,AUSTRALAS J ENV MAN,Australas.

It is of great practical importance to assess the impacts of climate-induced heat stress on labor productivity and to develop effective adaptation strategies. In this paper, an integrated optimization-based productivity restoration modeling framework is proposed for the first time to develop the optimal policies for adaptation to climate change. To address underlying uncertainties associated with climate and labor management systems, we take into account ensemble projections from five global climate models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) and inexact system costs. The system costs, including direct and indirect costs such as management costs, energy costs, and labor costs, are presented as interval numbers due to inherent uncertainty caused by population growth, technology development, and other social-economic factors. Uncertain information can be effectively communicated into the optimization processes in this study to generate optimal and reliable decision alternatives. We find that the increased Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) will lead to a large reduction in labor capacities over China except for the Tibetan Plateau under both RCPs by the end of the 21st century. The less developed regions tend to achieve the minimum system cost by having labor productivity recovered through working overtime due to the relatively low cost of overtime. This could result in more heat-related work injuries in the less developed regions. Since the less developed regions are not heat-prone areas in China, the changing climate would be a more dangerous threat and cause more damages to these regions where the residents are less acclimatized to heat stress. Moreover, we obtain a range of minimum system costs from 1.86 to 8.97 billion dollars under RCP2.6 and from 9.42 to 32.31 billion dollars under RCP8.5 (about 0.2% of China's GDP in 2019, 0.01% of China's GDP projected in 2100 under a sustainable socio-economic development scenario) for the restoration of labor productivity in a warming climate. We argue that urgent actions are needed to mitigate global warming impacts on labor productivity.","[Zhu, Jinxin; Wang, Dagang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shuo; Zhang, Boen] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Xueting] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Labor Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cai, Yanpeng] Guangdong Univ Technol, Inst Environm & Ecol Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Capital University of Economics & Business; Guangdong University of Technology,"Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",shuo.s.wang@polyu.edu.hk,"Zeng, Xueting/HGA-5899-2022; Zhang, Boen/GPK-7523-2022; Wang, Shuo/I-3017-2013","Zhang, Boen/0000-0002-4633-3033; Wang, Shuo/0000-0001-7827-187X; Zeng, Xueting/0000-0003-0540-5851",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51809223]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme [25222319],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme,CMIP5 data used in this paper are freely available at https://esgfnode.llnl.gov/projects/cmip5/.We acknowledge and thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Supplementary Information Table S1) in the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling (which is responsible for CMIP5) for generating their model outputs and making them available.

The study found that public finance mechanisms that imposed fiscal burdens on those who directly benefit from hazard reduction were rated as more acceptable than others. Significantly, visualisations and data on local economic damage and return on investment of potential adaptation options further increased acceptability ratings. The question of whether a development fee for adaptation or any other public purpose supported by private funds is a legal issue that depends on a test called the rational nexus. One concern of this article is to explore options for such fees to cover adaptation to climate change. This raises issues about the potential conflict with the community-wide and intergenerational nature of long-term adaptation. We also explore the relevance of environmental attitudes using the 'new environmental paradigm' (NEP) scale and political party affiliation.

The basic crop cultivated is maize, which is still the main source of nutrients for a large portion of the rural population in the country. Within the project Capacity Building for Stage II Adaptation to Climate Change in Central America, Mexico and Cuba, we analyze the strategies developed by maize producers in the central region of the country to cope with climatic adverse events. Impact on rainfed maize due to climate variability and climate change conditions are studied using a crop simulation model. Several adaptation measures can be evaluated using that model. However, the effect of other stressors must be considered in an assessment of the adaptive capacity of small farmers to climate variability and change. Key stakeholders' 'nvolvement in the region helped us to decide which of the adaptive measures could be viable under the current conditions and under future climatic conditions. The construction of greenhouses, the use of compost, and dripping irrigation, were some of the techniques selected with the participation of the stakeholders. The enthusiastic responses to these measures allow us to consider that they can prevail in the future, under climate change conditions. However, the adaptation to climate change includes -besides the stated techniques- the generation of the capacities to cope with climatic adverse events, that is, to enhance the adaptive capacities to climate change among the key stakeholders.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Atmosfera, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, Escuela Agrobiol, Tlaxcala, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Conde, C (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Atmosfera, Circuito Exterior,Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",conde@servidor.unam.mx,,,,,,,35,36,43,0,38,CENTRO CIENCIAS ATMOSFERA UNAM,MEXICO CITY,"CIRCUITO EXTERIOR, MEXICO CITY CU 04510, MEXICO",0187-6236,,,ATMOSFERA,Atmosfera,JUL 1,2006,19,3,,,,,181,194,,,,,,14,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,066VL,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000239258300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Heavy precipitation events are a common part of climatic variability; but little attention is given to its impact on livelihoods as compared to droughts in research and policy domains. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on both quantitative and qualitative research methods and data. Rainfall data are analyzed using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). This is compared with quantitative analysis of crop yields and complemented by narratives of farmers from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Findings - The results show that heavy precipitation events often lead to low food crop productivity and this suggests that the latter is vulnerable to the former. Originality/value - Although some adaptation is occurring through a wide range of local measures, these are inadequate for eliminating vulnerability. Thus, additional policy measures are recommended for enhancing farmer adaptation, including: incorporating climate change adaptation policies, including adaptation to heavy precipitation into District Development Planning; building human resource capacity for effective implementation of climate change adaptation policies at district levels; improving market access to seed through improved market infrastructure and rural transportation; establishing Community Seed Banks (CSBs) as back up sources of seed; promoting nursing and transplant as an alternative planting method for millet and guinea corn; promoting low costs solar drying technologies for drying food crops; and supporting livelihood diversification through credit and business development services.","[Derbile, Emmanuel Kanchebe] Univ Dev Studies, Planning & Management Dept, Fac Planning & Land Management, Navrongo, Ghana; [Kasei, Raymond Abudu] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Fac Sci Appl, Navrongo, Ghana",University for Development Studies; University for Development Studies,"Derbile, EK (corresponding author), Univ Dev Studies, Planning & Management Dept, Fac Planning & Land Management, Navrongo, Ghana.",uds@hotmail.com,,,,,,,44,9,9,0,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

This study focused on urban society, specifically on residents, the housing and real estate sector, and municipal administration in the cities of Frankfurt and Stuttgart, and investigated ways to enhance BGI in line with their perceptions, expectations and requirements. A particular emphasis was placed on periods of hot, dry weather. During future workshops, actor analysis, expert interviews and two expert work shops, the positions, level of knowledge and attitudes of the various groups were examined and barriers to BGI identified, in addition to discussions about measures to overcome these barriers. The results showed that within urban society the greatest support for BGI comes from residents, followed by municipal employees, while actors in the housing and real estate sector are the most reluctant. It became evident that there is a need for action to overcome a range of barriers. Overall, political backing, alliances between stakeholders, encouragement of the housing and real estate sector to take action, and a focus on initiating action in selected urban areas are recommended for successful enhancement of BGI.

This paper applies a pathways lens as a hindsight tool to provide new understanding about past change and adaptation relevant for improving future adaptation pathways approaches. Four case studies of past adaptations to change are examined: Solomon Islands Communities, Canadian forest-dependent communities, a Transylvanian village, and responses to climate adaptation policies in Australia. The results highlight that responses to change in these diverse case studies involve complex transitions that gradually create new conditions and trajectories; manifest as multiple but inter-related pathways of change and response at different social or spatial scales (e.g. different paths for different households or communities); have legacies and continuities across time that affect future pathways of change; are affected by power in complex ways; and can create further change and need for adaptation. Analyses also highlight that when working with prospective adaptation approaches as a response to climate change there is a need to consider: (1) underlying assumptions, values and principles associated with the future; (2) the existence of inter-connected multiple pathways and their implications for reinforcing existing social inequalities; and (3) how understanding past change provides inspiration for new and transformative futures. Overall, the paper concludes that shifts towards analyses for change rather than simply about change, such as adaptation pathways, will require more careful consideration of underlying ontological assumptions about the relationships between past, present and future.","[Fazey, Ioan; Lyon, Christopher; Moug, Peter] Univ Dundee, Sch Environm, Perth Rd, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Wise, Russell M.] CSIRO, Black Mt Labs, Clunies Ross St, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Campeanu, Claudia] Univ Bucharest, Sch Sociol & Social Work, 9 Schitu Magureanu St, Bucharest 010181, Romania; [Davies, Tammy E.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Geosci, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland; [Davies, Tammy E.] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, POB 3060 STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada",University of Dundee; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Bucharest; University of St Andrews; University of Victoria,"Fazey, I (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Sch Environm, Perth Rd, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",i.fazey@dundee.ac.uk,"Wise, Russell M/G-5463-2010; Fazey, Ioan/ABB-3403-2021; Lyon, Christopher/T-9426-2019; Campeanu, Claudia/ABG-8943-2020","Wise, Russell M/0000-0002-5882-5123; Campeanu, Claudia/0000-0002-4916-5493; Davies, Tammy/0000-0003-2535-1328; Moug, Peter/0000-0002-5156-8865; Lyon, Christopher/0000-0003-2319-2933",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The Canadian forest communities research by Christopher Lyon was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Standard Research Grant, J.R.

Science, in turn, relies on data-in this case 1) risk-related data on hazards, exposure and vulnerability, and 2) data on associated loss and damage outcomes. The latter, data on losses and damage, are also post 2015 international policy outcome indicators at the highest level, required for countries' monitoring of progress in reducing disaster risk, adapting to climate change, and achieving sustainable development. Although the quantity and accessibility of loss and damage data are improving, a number of issues continue to constrain their potential. These include needs for more consistent cataloguing of hazards and extreme events, more systematic and accurate documentation of per-event losses and damage, more precise cross-referencing of hazard events with associated loss and damage, and improved standardization and interoperability among databases. We identify measures for improvement in this regard, both for research purposes and for post-2015 international policy implementation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared two climate-sensitive small-scale fisheries (SSFs) - an Inuit community in the Canadian Arctic and the Coastal-Vedda in Sri Lanka - to broaden our understanding of how fisheries-dependent Indigenous communities respond and adapt to climate change impacts. We used three steps to achieve this comparative study. To do this, we developed a resilience-based conceptual framework to empirically assess adaptations in two SSF communities, based on a literature review. Using the proposed framework and collecting qualitative field data over three years (2016-2019) to investigate how different remote SSFs experience and respond to climate change, we assessed Inuit and Coastal-Vedda case studies. The framework provided the structure for data analysis and conceptual guidance for two empirical assessments and the comparative analysis. Finally, we carried out the comparative analysis across the case studies using content analysis, identifying adaptive strategies, sources of resilience, and characteristics of successful adaptation. Additionally, we used discourse analysis to develop sources of resilience and characteristics of successful adaptation. Two key adaptive strategies emerged in common across the two communities - diversification and adaptive co-management. Eight sources of resilience that underpin adaptive capacity: i) use of diverse kinds of knowledge; ii) practice of different ways of learning; iii) use of community-based institutions; iv) efforts to improve human agency; v) unique worldviews; vi) specific cultural attributes that keep up with adaptation; vii) effective social networks; and viii) a high level of flexibility. Definitive characteristics that need to promote successful community adaptation: continuous learning through knowledge co-production; capacity-building to improve human agency; a place-specific nature (rootedness); collective action and partnerships through community-based institutions; and flexibility.","[Galappaththi, Eranga K.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ford, James D.] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Bennett, Elena M.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Berkes, Fikret] Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Bennett, Elena M.] McGill Univ, Bieler Sch Environm, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; University of Leeds; McGill University; University of Manitoba; McGill University,"Galappaththi, EK (corresponding author), 705-805 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",eranga.research@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Ford, James/A-4284-2013; Bennett, Elena/A-9553-2008","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Berkes, Fikret/0000-0001-8402-121X",JDF (Canadian Institute of Health Research-CIHR); JDF (Social Science and Humanities Research Council-SSHRC); JDF (ArcticNet); International Development Research Centre (IDRC) [108279-008]; SSHRC doctoral fellowship [752-2016-0148],JDF (Canadian Institute of Health Research-CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); JDF (Social Science and Humanities Research Council-SSHRC); JDF (ArcticNet); International Development Research Centre (IDRC); SSHRC doctoral fellowship,"We sincerely appreciate the support of Inuit and Coastal-Vedda fishers.

Such places will suffer deleterious impacts as climate change impacts are increasingly realized. As societies try to adapt to these impacts, managed or planned retreat-aimed at moving people and assets away from vulnerable locations-is gaining increased attention. Despite this increased attention, systematic literature reviews of the retreat literature remain scarce. This paper undertakes such review and uncovers a marked increase in retreat scholarly research papers in the past 5 years. An analysis of 135 managed and planned retreat journal articles is completed. Findings include a strong emphasis on regional or local case studies exploring governance, policy or institutional settings and levers across a range of geographies. Property rights and market interventions, such as compensation schemes, evidence the prevalence of neoliberal predilections. This emphasizes the importance of renewed engagement with political economy scholarship vis-a-vis climate change adaptation, also supported by the sharp increase in the evidenced social and environmental justice impacts.

Data was collected from 246 randomly sampled households from 14 villages at Linthipe Extension Planning in Dedza district in Malawi. The multivariate probit model was employed to understand the influence of sociodemographic, farm-level, and institutional factors in the application of climate-smart agriculture in the study area. Findings from this study indicate that there are differences in the adoption and use of climate-smart agriculture technologies in bean production amongst different gender categories. More women compared to men and youths tend to use fertilizer, use improved seeds and plant early in order to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Most men adopt and use irrigation, whilst the youth mostly adopted and used pesticides and conservation agriculture practices. The study recommends policies that would ensure the promotion of gender-responsive climate-smart agriculture technologies, improved access to inputs, and capacity building through training.","[Nchanji, Eileen Bogweh; Cosmas, Lutomia] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kabuli, Hilda; Chisale, Virginia; Matumba, Anne] Dept Agr Res Serv, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Nyamolo, Victor Onyango] Egerton Univ, Agr Econ, Njoro, Kenya",Egerton University,"Nchanji, EB (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr, Nairobi, Kenya.",e.nchanji@cgiar.org,,,,,,,40,1,1,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

Unlike what most people would guess, coastal communities have not advanced much in their preparedness for a climate that is changing fast, despite their extensive exposure to climate hazards. If not true worldwide, at least that is what is happening in the majority of small and medium communities in the coast of New England, in the Northeast of US. This article explores data collected in a web survey conducted with city officials of coastal communities in the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, aiming to verify barriers to address climate change adaptation at the local level. The results of the survey showed many similarities between the challenges experienced by these small coastal communities. We suggest that, in presenting the main themes of the research, including special attention to the barriers encountered, this knowledge can contribute to the creation of a more climate-friendly region, thus helping to design and implement future climate change policies at the local level.","[Mesquita-Emlinger, Ana] Salem State Univ, Dept Geog, Salem, MA 01970 USA",Massachusetts System of Public Higher Education; Salem State University,"Mesquita-Emlinger, A (corresponding author), Salem State Univ, Dept Geog, Salem, MA 01970 USA.",aemlinger@salemstate.edu,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,9,"UNIV NACL, ESCUELA CIENCIAS GEOGRAFICAS",HEREDIA,"APDO 86, HEREDIA, 3000, COSTA RICA",1011-484X,2215-2563,,REV GEOGR AM CENT,Rev.

The effect of such changes on environmental impacts must be assessed, if the environmental goals of agriculture are also to be achieved in the future. We therefore assess the environmental impacts of adaptation scenarios previously developed with a purely economic perspective, for two case study regions in Switzerland. We use life cycle assessment at the whole-farm level, which enables the consideration of multiple environmental impact indicators, allowing us to identify potential trade-offs. We assess a simulated mixed livestock and arable crop farm representative of average farms in the two case study regions. The simulated farm is economically optimized for a reference scenario (current situation) and four future scenarios combining a climate change scenario representing a worst case change signal, and various price and policy scenarios. Results show that environmental impacts tend to increase in the future climate. Farms tend to extensify production, leading to a decrease in eco-efficiency, even more so if a decrease in agricultural product prices is assumed: socio-economic conditions may have even more influence than climate change, suggesting that there is a high potential for policy-makers to influence and mitigate the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity and the associated environmental impacts. The impacts of irrigation water use on aquatic biodiversity are revealed to be an important trade-off with farm economic optimization in the future. It is therefore recommended that aquatic biodiversity impacts be considered in assessments of agricultural adaptation to climate change. Policies directly targeting restriction of water use do not resolve this trade-off, although they do reduce impacts on aquatic biodiversity. Broader and more integrative policies are therefore required to support agricultural adaptation to the future climate while mitigating environmental impacts. In addition, different regions are found to react in a different way, suggesting that differentiated policies may be required for specific regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Bangladesh, China, India, and Myanmar (BCIM), primary rice producers and consumers, have been experiencing the impacts of climate change for decades. This study examines climate-induced changes in BCIM's rice yield from a meta-analysis based on a 1.5 degrees C climate change scenario and then presents a Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model to simulate the consequent international impacts on rice production, price, trade, and self-sufficiency. Results show that a 1.5 degrees C scenario will cause a substantial rice yield loss of 5.39%, 12.44%, and 3.87% in China, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, respectively, but will lead to an increase of 8.62% in rice yield in India. Further, global trade responds to climate change, resulting in decreases in paddy and processed rice production for most countries and larger domestic price fluctuations only for BCIM. Rice production loss under a 1.5 degrees C scenario is dampened through trade to adapt to climate change, especially for China, as its paddy rice production loss (0.30%) is far less than the yield loss (5.39%). BCIM countries will adjust their import and export structure with little change in rice self-sufficiency. This study concludes with policy recommendations to adapt to climate change guiding more open rice trade regimes and developing rice varieties. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

And while the severity of climate impacts on African development should not be underestimated, in this paper I argue that the vulnerability of smallholders in Sao Tome and Principe should be considered in the broader political economic and historical context of progressing depeasantisation and proletarianisation of global agricultural labour. Moreover, I posit that certain smallholders' vulnerability can actually increase as a result of both autonomous and externally planned adaptation strategies, the latter most commonly promoted by governments and their international development partners. To substantiate these arguments, the paper combines theoretical insights from labour geography and critical adaptation studies with ethnographic data collected in Liberdade - a village in the small island nation of Sao Tome and Principe - which participated in a nationwide climate change adaptation project. I trace local smallholders' vulnerability back to the country's political economic history and complement this by an investigation of the changing labour relations at the community level. Here, I analyse the autonomous adaptation strategies pursued by the residents and critically assess the localised effects of planned adaptation embodied by the project, with a specific focus on how they affect local labour relations. I conclude by providing some reflections on addressing the current pitfalls of planned adaptation.","[Mikulewicz, Michael] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow Caledonian University,"Mikulewicz, M (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",michael.mikulewicz@gcu.ac.uk,"Mikulewicz, Michael/AAU-9365-2021",,University of Manchester; Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland [RIG007851],University of Manchester; Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland,"University of Manchester 2014-17; Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, Grant/Award Number: RIG007851",,40,10,10,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-0894,1475-4762,,AREA,Area,SEP,2021,53,3,,,,,422,430,,10.1111/area.12630,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/area.12630,,MAY 2020,9,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,UE3PT,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000535844100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper reviews the status of climate change and environmentally induced migration in China, and then presents an empirical case study in Shangnan County in northwest China, where a specific GRP called the Massive Southern Shaanxi Migration Program' (MSSMP) has been initiated in response to climate change-related impacts. The results showed that the MSSMP helped local residents to adapt better climate change by reducing exposures to risk, enabling mobility, providing financial incentives, raising living standards, and improving emotional status. Furthermore, the MSSMP added additional benefits for migrants compared with traditional GRPs by respecting voluntary participation, preparing for future risks, and reducing social isolation via a short relocation distance. However, GRPs could also be seen as a maladaptation to climate change because they disproportionately increase the burden on the most vulnerable community members, such as those who are financially disadvantaged, new migrants, and people who are left behind. The paper further suggests that the GRPs should be designed by involving multiple adaptation strategies as supplements for GRPs, and broadening the political schemes to consider the special needs of vulnerable groups. This study contributes to an understanding of the roles of GRPs in sustainable climate change adaptation, thereby facilitating the design, organization, and implication of future similar programs.","[Lei, Yinru; Cui, Lijuan] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Wetland Res, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yinru; Cui, Lijuan] Beijing Key Lab Wetland Ecol Funct & Restorat, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yinru; Cui, Lijuan] Beijing Hanshiqiao Natl Wetland Ecosyst Res Stn, Beijing 101399, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yinru; Finlayson, C.

This paper focuses on the role of social capital, which is increasingly identified as having a significant role in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. We focus on public perceptions of the social costs and benefits arising from two management options (managed retreat/realignment and hold-the-line), the resulting level of policy acceptability, and how this acceptability is mediated by social capital parameters within coastal communities. These issues are examined by means of a quantitative social survey implemented in Romney Marsh (east Sussex/Kent, UK), an area facing significant impacts from climate change. We tested two models through path analysis with latent structures. The first correlates respondents' perceived costs and benefits with the level of public acceptability of the two policy options. In the second model, we introduce social capital variables, investigating the impacts on perceived social costs and benefits of the policy options, and the overall effect on the level of public acceptability. Our findings demonstrate: (1) perceived social costs and benefits of proposed policy options influence the level of public acceptability of these policies; (2) these social costs and benefits are connected with the level of public acceptability; and (3) specific social capital parameters (i.e. social trust, institutional trust, social networks and social reciprocity) influence perceived policy costs and benefits, and also have a significant impact on the level of public acceptability of proposed policy options.","[Jones, N.; Clark, J.

The flooding CRVA is based on a comprehensive list of 14 primary indicators and 35 socio-economic sub-indicators. Our results indicate that high levels of socio-economic vulnerability related to flooding are concentrated in the northern and eastern regions of Austria. When integrating a climate hazard proxy, statistically significant risk hotspots (>90% confidence) can be identified in central-northern Austria and towards the east. Furthermore, we established a typology of regions following a spatially enabled clustering approach.

Over the past two decades, numerous scientific publications have identified potential adaptations, but their suitability from legal, policy, financial, internal capacity, and other management perspectives has not been evaluated for any protected area agency or organization. In this study, a panel of protected area experts applied a Policy Delphi methodology to identify and evaluate climate change adaptation options across the primary management areas of a protected area agency in Canada. The panel identified and evaluated one hundred and sixty five (165) adaptation options for their perceived desirability and feasibility. While the results revealed a high level of agreement with respect to the desirability of adaptation options and a moderate level of capacity pertaining to policy formulation and management direction, a perception of low capacity for implementation in most other program areas was identified. A separate panel of senior park agency decision-makers used a multiple criterion decision-facilitation matrix to further evaluate the institutional feasibility of the 56 most desirable adaptation options identified by the initial expert panel and to prioritize them for consideration in a climate change action plan. Critically, only two of the 56 adaptation options evaluated by senior decision-makers were deemed definitely implementable, due largely to fiscal and internal capacity limitations. These challenges are common to protected area agencies in developed countries and pervade those in developing countries, revealing that limited adaptive capacity represents a substantive barrier to biodiversity conservation and other protected area management objectives in an era of rapid climate change.","[Lemieux, Christopher J.] Univ Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Ctr Appl Sci, Ontario Protected Areas, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Scott, Daniel J.] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo; Wilfrid Laurier University; University of Waterloo,"Lemieux, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Ctr Appl Sci, Ontario Protected Areas, 75 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",clemieux@wlu.ca,"Scott, Daniel/AAB-6190-2020","Scott, Daniel/0000-0001-7825-9301; Lemieux, Christopher/0000-0002-4780-2006",Natural Resources Canada [A1393]; Fulbright Canada; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Natural Resources Canada(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service); Fulbright Canada; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This research would have not been completed without the gracious support of Barton Feilders, Rob Davis, and Bob Davidson (Ontario Parks), Paul Gray (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources), Tom Beechey (Canadian Council on Ecological Areas), David Welch (formerly Parks Canada Agency), Stephen Murphy (Centre for Applied Science in Ontario Protected Areas, University of Waterloo) and Fulbright Canada (Michael Hawes, Fulbright Canada Secretariat; Chris Kirkey, Centre for the Study of Canada, SUNY-Plattsburgh; and, Jill Baron, U.S. Geological Survey, Colorado State University).

Mainstreaming climate adaptation objectives into existing policies, as opposed to developing dedicated adaptation policy, is widely advocated for public action. However, knowledge on what makes mainstreaming effective is scarce and fragmented. Against this background, this paper takes stock of peer-reviewed empirical analyses of climate adaptation mainstreaming, in order to assess current achievements and identify the critical factors that render mainstreaming effective. The results show that although in most cases adaptation policy outputs are identified, only in a minority of cases this translates into policy outcomes. This implementation gap is most strongly seen in developing countries. However, when it comes to the effectiveness of outcomes, we found no difference across countries. We conclude that more explicit definitions and unified frameworks for adaptation mainstreaming research are required to allow for future research syntheses and well-informed policy recommendations.","[Runhaar, Hens; Wilk, Bettina; Uittenbroek, Caroline] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Environm Governance Grp, POB 80,115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Runhaar, Hens] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Persson, Asa] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Sci LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden",Utrecht University; Wageningen University & Research; Stockholm Environment Institute,"Runhaar, H (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Environm Governance Grp, POB 80,115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.;Runhaar, H (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",h.a.c.runhaar@uu.nl; asa.persson@sei-international.org; c.j.uittenbroek@uu.nl; christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,"Persson, Åsa/ABD-8096-2021; Runhaar, Hens A.C./L-5395-2013","Runhaar, Hens A.C./0000-0001-7790-097X; Persson, Asa/0000-0002-8886-5046",,,,,33,85,86,3,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

However, the observed level of adaptation is insufficient from an economic perspective. We address this puzzle by adding a psychological perspective to explain actors' behaviour. Based on existing meta-analytic evidence we discuss micro- (i.e. individual-), meso- (i.e. group-) and macro- (i.e. society-) level factors that may contribute to more engagement in adaptation and provide recommendations on how to address them. The results show that the strongest predictors of individual adaptation behaviour are people's beliefs whether adaptive actions will be effective in protecting them from climate-related hazards (outcome expectancy), the degree to which people believe that they are able to engage in adaptive actions (self-efficacy) and their emotional reaction to climate change. Equally strong on a meso-level are behavioural norms and cultural aspects on a macro-level. We recommend that decision-makers create more transparency about the cause-effect chain between adaptation activity and desired adaptation effects to strengthen individuals' sense of efficacy. Furthermore, inducing reflection on social norms through communicative interventions may contribute to motivate adaptive actions by individuals and organisations. Key policy insights Psychological factors play an important but underestimated role in explaining adaptation behaviour. If people believe that they can address the risks of climate-related hazards they will show stronger adaptation behaviour. This insight can be used to incentivise more investments in adaptation. Social norms and cultural values are linked to adaptation behaviour. Public communication campaigns and other policy interventions can help to change social norms, and they should be tailored to the cultural values of societies. The influence of social norms and cultural values can be stronger than individual-level variables such as beliefs and preferences. People underestimate the extent to which others are willing to contribute to society, in particular in societies scoring high on individualism and masculinity. This can prevent people from investing in adaptation.","[Bechtoldt, Myriam N.; Goetmann, Alexander] EBS Univ Business & Law, Wiesbaden, Germany; [Moslener, Ulf; Pauw, W.

In the coming decades this vulnerability is unlikely to subside as the effects of climate change become more intense. Railway stakeholders in GB are strongly engaged with understanding climate change impacts on the railway system and how the industry could adapt to these impacts. Since 2010, Network Rail and RSSB have supported research into these topics under the Tomorrow's Railway and Climate Change Adaptation programme. Under this programme, an analogue study was performed to determine whether lessons could be learned from other countries' weather management. Two types of analogue were used to identify suitable locations. First, climate data from 20 models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) were used to identify regions with similar present-day climate to that projected for GB in the future. The analogue locations were found to be largely insensitive to the climate indicators and the methods used to compare climate at different locations. Next, railway networks in many countries were studied to find those with similar physical and operational characteristics to the GB network. The regions with both climate and railway analogues are France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Denmark. As part of a wider aim to support the GB railway network's weather resilience and climate change adaptation (WR/CCA) activities, focused stakeholder engagement has been undertaken with representatives of most of these countries' railways. This targeted approach is complementary to a broader collation of existing WR/CCA measures used globally.","[Sanderson, M. G.; Hanlon, H. M.; Palin, E. J.; Clark, R.

After a decade of climate change adaptation research within the Australian National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, we synthesize the National Adaptation Research Plans for marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. We identify the key, globally relevant priorities for ongoing research relevant to informing adaptation policy and environmental management aimed at maximizing the resilience of natural ecosystems to climate change. Informed by both global literature and an extensive stakeholder consultation across all ecosystems, sectors and regions in Australia, involving thousands of participants, we suggest 18 priority research topics based on their significance, urgency, technical and economic feasibility, existing knowledge gaps and potential for cobenefits across multiple sectors. These research priorities provide a unified guide for policymakers, funding organizations and researchers to strategically direct resources, maximize stakeholder uptake of resulting knowledge and minimize the impacts of climate change on natural ecosystems.

These challenges are evaluated with regard to the state of the art, research interest, and regulatory issues, providing an assessment of the advances and defining research gaps in the literature review. The review shows that climate resilience mainly deals with larger systems, whereas the field is still developing at the building level. One of the main challenges identified is the institutional response. Many publications state that it is necessary to revise policies and develop legislation; however, this is sometimes hindered by uncertain climate change predictions. the EU legislation currently provides partial coverage of resource efficiency and climate mitigation in the building sector, while the national legislation is delayed. The current situation can impair the competitiveness of the national building sector, causing it to lag behind the goals set for achieving sustainability. From the cost perspective, immediate short-term actions are seen as more expensive, because delays can result in increased risks for major investments. The authorities are currently choosing between rapid and delayed actions, balancing the costs of early actions and the reciprocal costs of delay.","[Kristl, Ziva] New Univ, European Fac Law, Nova Gorica, Slovenia; [Senior, Coline; Salaj, Alenka Temeljotov] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Kristl, Z (corresponding author), New Univ, European Fac Law, Nova Gorica, Slovenia.",ziva.kristl@epf.nova-uni.si; coline.senior@ntnu.no; alenka.temeljotov-salaj@ntnu.no,"KRISTL, Živa/HKV-5509-2023; Kristl, Živa/AAV-1273-2021; Salaj, Alenka Temeljotov/AAI-9208-2020","KRISTL, Živa/0000-0002-9706-2907; Salaj, Alenka Temeljotov/0000-0002-4139-5278",,,,,77,6,6,3,8,URBAN PLANNING INST REPUBLIC SLOVENIA,LJUBLJANA,"TRNOVSKI PRISTAN 2, P P 4717, LJUBLJANA, 1127, SLOVENIA",0353-6483,1855-8399,,URBANI IZZIV,Urbani Izziv,JUN,2020,31,1,,,,,101,111,,10.5379/urbani-izziv-en-2020-31-01-004,http://dx.doi.org/10.5379/urbani-izziv-en-2020-31-01-004,,,11,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,NJ2JM,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000565871600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective of this study was to speculate how a range of arable land use patterns, resulting from various policy driven choices, could be introduced into a farming system, and how they would affect the risks associated with nutrient leaching. The case study area included 720 ha of arable fields in southern Finland. Climate change scenarios were calculated using averages of 19 climate models and emission scenarios B1, A1B and A2. Four crop choice and allocation storylines were developed according to policy objectives: increased protein self-sufficiency, increased winter cover for reducing nutrient loading, diversification, and monoculture for cereal production. Grasslands and leys were not included in any of the production scenarios. Impacts of these land uses on sediment loading and nitrogen leaching were simulated using WSFS and INCA modelling. We found that while adaptation to climate change must include consideration of crop choices, there are conflicts associated with allocations and rotations for various market and policy situations. The expected increase in nutrient loading in the simulations caused by climate change was moderate. The increase can partly be compensated for by changes in farmland use, more in the shorter term than in the longer term to mid-century. To reduce suspended sediment load in the changed climate, vegetation cover in winter was important. For nitrogen leaching, adjusting the N balance at parcel level was more important than vegetation cover. In the future, adaptation at cropping system level is potentially an efficient way to manage nutrient load risks.","[Rankinen, Katri; Granlund, Kirsti; Sippel, Kalle; Forsius, Martin] Finnish Environm Inst, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland; [Peltonen-Sainio, Pirjo; Ojanen, Hannu; Hakala, Kaija] MTT Agrifood Res Finland, FI-31600 Jokioinen, Finland; [Laapas, Mikko] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Helenius, Juha] Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",Finnish Environment Institute; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Helsinki,"Rankinen, K (corresponding author), Finnish Environm Inst, POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland.",katri.rankinen@ymparisto.fi,"Hakala, Kaija/E-3745-2017","Hakala, Kaija/0000-0002-0172-1892; Ojanen, Hannu/0000-0003-3758-353X; Rankinen, Katri/0000-0001-8744-1420; Helenius, Juha/0000-0001-6933-404X; Forsius, Martin/0000-0003-0125-5120",EU,EU(European Commission),"We would like to thank coordinators of VACCIA Action 7 Kati Komulainen and Torsti Schulz, as well as the project coordinators and the many colleagues in the project.

It also puts forward some locally derived adaptation strategies to climate change that can have a positive impact on water resources in the Chtouka Alt Baha region. Historical baselines of precipitation and temperature were derived using satellite data respectively from CHIRPS and CRU, while future projections of temperature and precipitation were extracted from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment database (CORDEX). Projections were also generated for two future periods (2030-2049 and 2080-2099) under two Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Regional climate models and satellite data outputs were evaluated by calculating their bias and RMSE against historical baseline and observed data. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, temperature in the region shows an increase by 2 degrees C for the 2030-2049 time period, and by 4 to 5 degrees C towards the end of the 21st century. According to the RCP4.5 scenario, precipitation shows a reduction of 10 to 30% for the period 2030-2049, up to 60% for 2080-2099. Outputs from the climate change projections were used to force the HEC-HMS hydrological model. Simulation results indicate that water deficit at basin level will likely triple towards 2050 due to increase in water demand and decrease in aquifer recharge and dam storage. This alarming situation, in a country that already suffers from water insecurity, emphasizes the need for more efforts to implement climate change adaptation measures. This paper presents an assessment of 38 climate change adaptation measures according to several criteria. The evaluation shows that measures affecting the management of water resources have the highest benefit-to-effortsxatio, which indicates that decision makers and stakeholders should increasingly focus their efforts on management measures.

Yet, the discourse on urban climate change adaptation has only recently gained momentum in the political and scientific arena. This paper reviews the recent climate change adaptation strategies of nine selected cities and analyzes them in terms of overall vision and goals, baseline information used, direct and indirect impacts, proposed structural and non-structural measures, and involvement of formal and informal actors. Against this background, adaptation strategies and challenges in two Vietnamese cities are analyzed in detail, namely Ho Chi Minh City and Can Tho. The paper thereby combines a review of formalized city-scale adaptation strategies with an empirical analysis of actual adaptation measures and constraints at household level. By means of this interlinked and comparative analysis approach, the paper explores the achievements, as well as the shortcomings, in current adaptation approaches, and generates core issues and key questions for future initiatives in the four sub-categories of: (1) knowledge, perspectives, uncertainties and key threats; (2) characteristics of concrete adaptation measures and processes; (3) interactions and conflicts between different strategies and measures; (4) limits of adaptation and tipping points. In conclusion, the paper calls for new forms of adaptive urban governance that go beyond the conventional notions of urban (adaptation) planning. The proposed concept underlines the need for a paradigm shift to move from the dominant focus on the adjustment of physical structures towards the improvement of planning tools and governance processes and structures themselves. It addresses in particular the necessity to link different temporal and spatial scales in adaptation strategies, to acknowledge and to mediate between different types of knowledge (expert and local knowledge), and to achieve improved integration of different types of measures, tools and norm systems (in particular between formal and informal approaches).","[Birkmann, Joern; Garschagen, Matthias] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Kraas, Frauke] Univ Cologne, Dept Geog, Cologne, Germany; [Nguyen Quang] UN HABITAT, Hanoi, Vietnam",University of Cologne,"Birkmann, J (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, Hermann Ehlers Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",birkmann@ehs.unu.edu,"Birkmann, Joern jb/J-5736-2015; Kraas, Frauke/E-3781-2010","Kraas, Frauke/0000-0002-3498-6758; Birkmann, Joern/0000-0001-8733-3964",,,,,80,52,53,2,114,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

The analytical framework developed here is then applied to the riparian corridor of the Mapocho River in Santiago, in order to discuss its current and potential contributions to tackling climate change. The discussion is based on the evaluation of three key ecosystem services: (1) cooling effects, (2) routes for non-motorized transport, and (3) flood mitigation. The integration of concepts of green infrastructure, ecosystem services and adaptation/mitigation of climate change, provide an appropriate framework to clarify how urban green spaces can contribute to address global warming and the negative effects of climate change. In Santiago, currently the main contribution of Mapocho River's riparian corridor is to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by acting as an important route for non-motorized transport, particularly for cycling. Currently its contribution to the reduction of atmospheric temperatures and to flood mitigation is limited. The development of a riparian greenway along the Mapocho River could help improve the provision of the three evaluated ecosystem services and thus constitute an important connector in the green infrastructure system in Santiago to address mitigation and adaptation to climate change.","[Vasquez, Alexis E.] Univ Chile, Dept Geog, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Vasquez, AE (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Geog, Santiago, Chile.",alexvasq@u.uchile.cl,"Vásquez, Alexis E/I-3529-2013","Vásquez, Alexis E/0000-0002-3869-3071",,,,,57,17,25,5,73,"PONTIFICA UNIV CATOLICA CHILE, INST GEOGRAFIA",SANTIAGO,"AV VICUNA MACKENNA 4860, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0379-8682,0718-3402,,REV GEOGR NORTE GD,Rev.

These indicators were chosen as representative of the potential of these strategies to improve the soil physical condition. That for, the effectiveness of conservation agriculture (CA), crop rotations (ROT), additions of organic matter (ExO), irrigation (IRR) and innovative grassland management (GSS) was assessed by monitoring soil bulk density (BD) and soil available water holding capacity (AWHC) in a network of 159 agricultural fields across homogeneous agro-climatic zones in the region. A sampling protocol designed to compare groups of plots with or without adaptive practices, and with equal soil characteristics within each zone, allowed to determine the effect size of each strategy (measured as response ratios, RR, calculated as the relative value of BD and AWHC in fields with adaptive management vs. without). Both parameters responded to soil and crop management, although the observed effect was highly variable. Only the ExO strategy showed an overall positive effect on BD. ROT, IRR and GSS displayed no effect and, in the case of CA, the effect was negative. In terms of AWHC, although the results within the zones were heterogeneous, the overall effect associated to the strategies ROT, ExO, IRR and GSS was neutral, and only CA resulted in an overall negative effect. The observed variability in terms of the effectiveness of the five strategies tested in this region highlights the need to understand the complexity of interrelationships between management and dynamic soil properties at the regional scale.","[Anton, Rodrigo; Ruiz-Sagaseta, Alberto; Arricibita, Francisco Javier; Enrique, Alberto; Soto, Isabel de; Virto, Inigo] Univ Publ Navarra, IS FOOD, Dept Ciencias, Pamplona 31006, Spain; [Orcaray, Luis] Inst Navarro Tecnol & Infraestruct Agroalimentari, Area Innovac, Secc Sistemas Sostenibles, Villava 31610, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Virto, I (corresponding author), Univ Publ Navarra, IS FOOD, Dept Ciencias, Pamplona 31006, Spain.",rodrigo.anton@unavarra.es; alberto.ruiz@unavarra.es; lorcaray@intiasa.es; arricibita@unavarra.es; alberto.enrique@unavarra.es; isabelsonsoles.desoto@unavarra.es; inigo.virto@unavarra.es,"Echeverría, Luis Orcaray/Q-2810-2019; Virto, Inigo/L-9915-2015; de Soto García, Isabel Sonsoles/M-4063-2015","Echeverría, Luis Orcaray/0000-0002-9832-1448; Virto, Inigo/0000-0002-7682-4570; de Soto Garcia, Isabel Sonsoles/0000-0002-4681-5892; Anton, Rodrigo/0000-0002-7005-1423",European Commission LIFE program [LIFE 16 IPC/ES/000001]; Universidad Publica de Navarra,European Commission LIFE program; Universidad Publica de Navarra,"This research was funded by the European Commission LIFE program (Project LIFE Nadapta, LIFE 16 IPC/ES/000001).

Economic instability, lack of access to basic services, and environmental degradation are perceived as greater threats to community well being than increasing seasonal variability and flooding.

Particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of climate change is the transportation sector, which fully relies on the uninterrupted accessibility of the road network. With the Swedish Government adopting a National Adaptation Strategy in 2018, creating a coordinated cross-disciplinary strategy underpinned by international frameworks, new ambition levels regarding climate change adaptation efforts have been established. Identifying particularly vulnerable parts of the road network is an essential step for National Road Authorities (NRAs) in early planning stages to prioritize adaptation efforts around high-risk areas to safeguard the road network. By utilizing both publicly and commercially available climate-related data, as well as applying and assessing new terrain analysis techniques, a large-scale vulnerability assessment is carried out for Halland County in southwestern Sweden by assessing three climate-adjusted extreme weather events (a 100-year pluvial flood event, a 100-year fluvial flood event, and an extreme coastal storm surge event) projected to exacerbate in the region. The study demonstrates how a GIS-based screening method, specifically adapted for NRAs or similar stakeholders, may provide quick overviews of potentially at-risk areas along road networks through a simple vulnerability index assigned to individual road segments. Further studies are recommended to compare modeled results to recorded flood events if available and incorporate updated climate change trajectories from upcoming IPCC reports.","[Johnsson, Isabelle] Swedish Transport Adm, Vikingsgatan 2-4, S-41104 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Balstrom, Thomas] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resources, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Johnsson, I (corresponding author), Swedish Transport Adm, Vikingsgatan 2-4, S-41104 Gothenburg, Sweden.",isabelle.mia.johnsson@gmail.com,"Balstrøm, Thomas/AHI-0567-2022","Balstrøm, Thomas/0000-0002-5328-5914",,,,,62,1,1,9,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Advance warning of meteorological conditions from seasonal climate models can therefore potentially anticipate unusually strong epidemic events, building resilience and adapting to possible changes in the frequency of such events. Here we present validation of a process-based, dynamic malaria model driven by hindcasts from a state-of-the-art seasonal climate model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. We validate the climate and malaria models against observed meteorological and incidence data for Botswana over the period 1982-2006; the longest record of observed incidence data which has been used to validate a modeling system of this kind. We consider the impact of climate model biases, the relationship between climate and epidemiological predictability and the potential for skillful malaria forecasts. Forecast skill is demonstrated for upper tercile malaria incidence for the Botswana malaria season (January-May), using forecasts issued at the start of November; the forecast system anticipates six out of the seven upper tercile malaria seasons in the observational period. The length of the validation time series gives confidence in the conclusion that it is possible to make reliable forecasts of seasonal malaria risk, forming a key part of a health early warning system for Botswana and contributing to efforts to adapt to climate change.","[MacLeod, Dave A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England; [Jones, Anne; Caminade, Cyril; Morse, Andrew P.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Di Giuseppe, Francesca] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Caminade, Cyril] Univ Liverpool, Dept Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Morse, Andrew P.] NIHR, Hlth Protect Res Unit Emerging & Zoonot Infect, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Oxford; University of Liverpool; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Liverpool,"MacLeod, DA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England.",macleod@atm.ox.ac.uk,,"Morse, Andrew/0000-0002-0413-2065; Di Giuseppe, Francesca/0000-0001-9829-0429; MacLeod, Dave/0000-0001-5504-6450; Caminade, Cyril/0000-0002-3846-7082",NERC [NE/H524757/1]; European Union FP7 project Quantifying Weather and Climate Impacts on Health in Developing Countries (QWeCI) [243964]; European Union FP7 project HEALTHY FUTURES [266327]; End-to-End Quantification of Uncertainty for Impacts Prediction (EQUIP) Natural Environmental Research Council [NE/H003487/1]; NERC [NE/H003487/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H003487/1] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Union FP7 project Quantifying Weather and Climate Impacts on Health in Developing Countries (QWeCI); European Union FP7 project HEALTHY FUTURES; End-to-End Quantification of Uncertainty for Impacts Prediction (EQUIP) Natural Environmental Research Council; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The authors would like to jointly thank Madeline Thomson (IRI) for providing the extended Botswana dataset, as well as the anonymous reviewers, whose comments helped improve the manuscript.

Contextually, a typical superior bureaucratic framework with its decision-making power centred on climate adaptation projects funding prevails in Bangladesh. This paper deploys the concepts of Weberian bureaucracy and super-bureaucracy and its governance pattern to explore the power attributes of climate bureaus and associated bureaucratic practices and decision-making behaviour regarding adaptation funding in climate adaptation governance. The study employs all climate adaptation development projects (n = 573) financing in Bangladesh. The analysis finds that the general administration cadre employees rather than technical professionals are involved in multiple decision-making processes, including appraisal and approval and monitoring and evaluating projects holding powerful pivotal positions both centrally and locally. These super bureaus also expand their power resources in climate adaptation policy by governing big adaptation projects, keeping the project director position, and approving the said position. The power capabilities and interests of the super-bureaus accrue by creating new climate institutions too. The decision-making behaviour and governance pattern underpin a state of super-bureaucracy, which are not supportive enough of innovative policy-making through inclusive participation and collective decision-making for governing dynamic climate adaptation policy.","[Rahman, Md Saifur; Giessen, Lukas] Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Trop & Int Forestry, Pienner Str 7, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany; [Rahman, Md Saifur; Giessen, Lukas] European Forest Inst, Bonn, Germany; [Rahman, Md Saifur] Minist Publ Adm, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Sarker, Pradip Kumar] Georg August Univ, Chair Grp Forest & Nat Conservat Policy, Gottingen, Germany; [Sarker, Pradip Kumar] Thunen Inst Int Forestry & Forest Econ, Hamburg, Germany; [Giessen, Lukas] Bogor Agr Univ, IPB, Bogor, Indonesia",Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Gottingen; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Bogor Agricultural University,"Rahman, MS (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Trop & Int Forestry, Pienner Str 7, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany.",saifur69@yahoo.com,,"Sarker, Pradip Kumar/0000-0002-1861-4030",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; DAAD,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),This work was supported by Alexander von Humboldt Foundation: [Grant Number N/A]; DAAD: [Grant Number N/A].,,112,1,1,1,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The term agnostic adaptation has emerged to refer to actions that address climate change's effects without acknowledging its existence or human causes. Although prevalent, agnostic adaptation has yet to be the focus of significant empirical research. Most studies of climate silence and denial examine the absence of action rather than its paradoxical presence. This article, by contrast, explores how action and silence coexist and even serve to reinforce each other. It draws on fieldwork in Staten Island, New York City's most politically conservative and only predominantly white borough, where residents mobilized after Hurricane Sandy in favor of government buyouts of their damaged homes that would pay them to relocate rather than rebuild in place. The areas that received buyouts have been lauded from afar as exemplary sites of community-led climate adaptation in one of its most radical forms, managed retreat. On the ground, however, those who participated in the push for retreat were largely silent on the topic of climate change, which was not seen as politically enabling or efficacious to discuss. Agnostic adaptation minimized conflict, made for more tractable claims, and maintained relations of power but in so doing offered protection to only a select few. These findings point to the practical effects of climate silence as it exists in relation to climate talk, both of which share omissions, erasures, and forms of agnosticism that narrow the space for transformative action.","[Koslov, Liz] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Koslov, Liz] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Koslov, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Koslov, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",koslov@ucla.edu,,,"Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Completion Fellowship; New York University's Institute for Public Knowledge and Department of Media, Culture, and Communication; Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Completion Fellowship; New York University's Institute for Public Knowledge and Department of Media, Culture, and Communication; Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Funding for this research was provided by a Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Completion Fellowship and by New York University's Institute for Public Knowledge and Department of Media, Culture, and Communication.

We determined whether bus stop shelters and tree canopy surrounding bus stops moderated the effect of warm season temperatures on ridership in Austin, Texas, and whether shelters and trees were equitably distributed. For bus stops (n = 2271) of Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority, boardings per bus were measured 1 April-30 September 2019. Air temperature data originated from the Camp Mabry weather station. Tree canopy was calculated by classification of high-resolution aerial imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program. Data on race, ethnicity, poverty level, median age, and bus commuters within census tracts of bus stops originated from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. Using multilevel negative binomial regression models, we found that shelters did not moderate the effect of high temperatures on ridership (p > 0.05). During high temperatures, each one-percent increase in tree canopy was associated with a lesser decrease (1.6%) in ridership compared to if there were no trees (1.7%) (p < 0.001). In general, shelters and trees were equitably distributed. Insignificant or modest effects of shelters and trees on ridership during high temperatures may be attributed to the transit dependency of riders. For climate change adaptation, we recommend tree planting at bus stops to protect from ridership losses and unhealthy exposure to extreme heat.","[Lanza, Kevin] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth Austin, Michael & Susan Dell Ctr Hlth Living, Austin, TX 78701 USA; [Durand, Casey P.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth Houston, Dept Hlth Promot & Behav Sci, Michael & Susan Dell Ctr Hlth Living, Houston, TX 77030 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston,"Lanza, K (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth Austin, Michael & Susan Dell Ctr Hlth Living, Austin, TX 78701 USA.",Kevin.L.Lanza@uth.tmc.edu; Casey.P.Durand@uth.tmc.edu,"Lanza, Kevin/ABD-8011-2020","Lanza, Kevin/0000-0002-5259-6745",Michael & Susan Dell Foundation - Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [78106],Michael & Susan Dell Foundation - Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,"This research was funded by the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation.

They disassemble complex phenomena to gain insights and deepen understanding. Specific subsets of indicators have been developed to describe sustainability, human development, vulnerability, risk, resilience and climate change adaptation. Nonetheless, insufficient quality and availability of data often limit their explanatory power. Spatial and temporal resolution are often not at a scale appropriate for monitoring. Socio-economic indicators are mostly provided by governmental institutions and are therefore limited to administrative boundaries. Furthermore, different methodological computation approaches for the same indicator impair comparability between countries and regions. OpenStreetMap (OSM) provides an unparalleled standardized global database with a high spatiotemporal resolution. Surprisingly, the potential of OSM seems largely unexplored in this context. In this study, we used machine learning to predict four exemplary socio-economic indicators for municipalities based on OSM. By comparing the predictive power of neural networks to statistical regression models, we evaluated the unhinged resources of OSM for indicator development. OSM provides prospects for monitoring across administrative boundaries, interdisciplinary topics, and semi-quantitative factors like social cohesion. Further research is still required to, for example, determine the impact of regional and international differences in user contributions on the outputs. Nonetheless, this database can provide meaningful insight into otherwise unknown spatial differences in social, environmental or economic inequalities.","[Feldmeyer, Daniel; Sauter, Holger; Birkmann, Joern] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Meisch, Claude] Minist Environm Climat & Dev, Adm Gest Eau, L-4361 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Meisch, Claude] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Ecol Ecosyst & Landscape Ecol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Stuttgart; University of Innsbruck,"Feldmeyer, D (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",daniel.feldmeyer@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; claude.meisch@eau.etat.lu; holger.sauter@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; joern.birkmann@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de,"Birkmann, Joern jb/J-5736-2015","Birkmann, Joern/0000-0001-8733-3964; Meisch, Claude/0000-0003-2219-2333; Sauter, Holger/0000-0001-7356-2790",,,,,42,11,11,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

In response, scholars have increasingly identified barriers to adaptation in the literature. But, despite this progress, knowledge of barriers that hamper adaptation in developing countries remains limited, especially in relation to underlying causes of vulnerability and low adaptive capacity. To further improve understanding of barriers to adaptation and identify gaps in the state-of-the-art knowledge, we undertook a synthesis of empirical literature from sub-Saharan Africa focusing on vulnerable, natural resource-dependent communities and livelihoods. Our review illustrates that: (1) local-level studies that reveal barriers to adaptation are diverse, although there is a propensity for studies on small-holder farmers; (2) many of the studies identify several barriers to adaptation, but appreciation of their interactions and compounded impacts remains scarce; and (3) most of the barriers uncovered relate broadly to biophysical, knowledge, and financial constraints on agricultural production and rural development. More hidden and under-acknowledged political, social, and psychological barriers are rarely mentioned, unless captured in studies that specifically set out to investigate these. We finish our review by highlighting gaps in understanding and by suggesting future research directions, focusing on issues of social justice. We argue that research on barriers needs to start asking why these barriers emerge, how they work together to shape adaptation processes, who they affect most, and what is needed to overcome them.

Their distribution at the interface of the terrestrial and marine environments means that assets and operations associated with SLS are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate variability and climate change from both the land and the sea. For Australia, this is particularly pertinent given that the east coast is projected to experience SLR that is higher than global average. This study describes how a probabilistic modelling approach (Bayesian belief networks (BBNs)) and participatory modelling techniques were used to help elicit information on the key adaptive capacity determinants influencing the ability of Australian SLS to implement climate change adaptation options. 10 BBNs were developed across four stakeholder workshops at four locations within Australia. Results of this participatory modelling show that most determinants of adaptive capacity broadly related to funding, knowledge, equipment, communication and community support. For each workshop, the BBNs indicated broad consensus in the beliefs of the stakeholders for these broad and perhaps well-known determinants of effective adaptation. Conversely, there was less agreement between the stakeholders regarding the more specific determinants as evidenced by the results of the sensitivity analyses and in the levels of debate between the stakeholders. This highlights that as the determinants of adaptive capacity become more nuanced, there is more likely to be an imperfect, and less likely to be a shared, understanding of the system by the stakeholders. Overall, the approach used in this study has shown to be effective in exploring adaptive capacity at the community level and to improve community understanding and awareness of coastal hazards and climate change risks.

One of the major controversial issues in climate change adaptation studies is deeply uncertain nature of such changes. This study aimed at planning optimal agricultural adaptation measures under deep climate uncertainty in a semi-arid basin in Iran (Tashk-Bakhtegan Basin) using a simulation-optimization (S-O) approach. To fulfil this objective, a modified version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) entitled SWAT-PARS was used to simulate the status of the basin regarding water resources and agricultural sector. By combining the SWAT model with a NSGA-II based robust optimization model, the optimal and robust type and location of robust agricultural management measures under climate uncertainty were determined. For this purpose, deficit irrigation, irrigation efficiency increase, cropping pattern change and cropping date change were considered as effective adaptation measures in the agricultural sector. The robustness of optimal measures was analyzed by a multi objective robust decision making approach using satisficing and regret robustness assessment methods. The robustness analysis of management strategies under climate change indicated different prioritization of strategies by satisficing and regret robustness assessment indicators. According to the results, irrigation management measures, and changes in the cropping pattern and date have been recommended in most strategies provided by different robustness methods. Most measures recommended have been able to reduce system vulnerability concerning in groundwater's quantitative changes and calorie of agricultural products, but did not cause any significant change in the system concerning inflow to the lake.","[Abbasi, Hamid; Delavar, Majid; Nalbandan, Roya Bigdeli] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Shandany, Mehdy Hashemy] Univ Tehran, Coll Aburaihan, Dept Irrigat Engn, Tehran, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University; University of Tehran,"Delavar, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, Tehran, Iran.",m.delavar@modares.ac.ir,"Hashemy Shahdany, Seied Mehdy/M-5663-2013; Delavar, Majid/AFP-1708-2022","Hashemy Shahdany, Seied Mehdy/0000-0001-9962-1437; Delavar, Majid/0000-0003-3897-8007",,,,,60,3,3,4,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

It is now clear that climate change and its devastating impacts cannot be resolved by new technology or governance alone. They require a broader, cultural shift. As a result, the role of human beings 'inner dimensions' and related transformations is attracting increased attention from researchers. Recent advances in neuroscience suggest for instance that mindfulness can open new pathways towards sustainability. However, the role of mindfulness in climate adaptation has been largely ignored. This paper is the first exploratory empirical investigation into linking individuals' intrinsic mindfulness (as opposed to outside mindfulness interventions) to pro- and reactive climate adaptation. Based on a survey of citizens at risk from severe climate events, we explore if, and how individual mindfulness is correlated with climate adaptation at different scales. The results show that individual mindfulness coincides with higher motivation to take climate adaptation actions or to support them, especially actions that are 'other-focused' or support pro-environmental behaviour. Mindfulness may also corroborate the acknowledgement of climate change and associated risk perception, and it may steer people away from fatalistic attitudes. We conclude with a call for more research into the relationship between human beings' inner dimensions and climate adaptation in the wider public domain.","[Warnsler, Christine; Brink, Ebba] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Warnsler, Christine] Global Dev Inst, Global Urbanism Res Grp, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Warnsler, Christine] Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci CNDS, Uppsala, Sweden; [Warnsler, Christine] Lund Univ, CRAM, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Lund University,"Warnsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, LUCSUS, Box 170, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",christine.warrisler@lucsus.lu.se,,,Swedish Research Council FORMAS through the Sustainable Urban Transformation for Climate Change Adaptation project [2011-901],Swedish Research Council FORMAS through the Sustainable Urban Transformation for Climate Change Adaptation project,"This research has been conducted in the context of the Contemplative Sustainable Futures Program at LUCSUS, Lund University.

The objective of this paper is to point out and discuss aspects that comprise climate vulnerability, especially regarding the climate perceptions understood as an element for the development of community adaptation strategies. The first part presents two study cases and the second part presents propositions for developing climate adaptation strategies based on the results of these cases. The paper focuses on two aspects: the perception of climate dynamics and the relationship between vulnerability and local climate dynamics. In order to establish the relationship between climate dynamics and the level of vulnerability perceived, a qualitative approach was adopted. Field data collection consisted of observing local civil association meetings and conducting semi-structured interviews with local actors. Although both communities studied are strongly affected by climate events, their perception of climate influences is essentially different. The difference in perception arises mainly from the different context in which climate events acquire meaning, rather than any ability of assigning meaning to possible climate change. To understand the dynamics of establishing an adaptation strategy, the motivational problems would be a stimulus, a causative agent of reflections on the conditions of vulnerability to climate change and reflection about their limit-situations. The final propositions present Adaptation learning process pre-steps framework that emerges from the description of contrasts in perceptions/cognitions observed between the two study cases. It is a model for the visualization of different and better living conditions, the unknown-viable, which enable social actors to become aware of capacity of acting and governance.

The region has prioritized adaptation to climate change and has implemented many adaptation actions over the past 20 years. However, the region is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of tropical cyclones (TC). This paper analyses the impacts of TC on the region between 1980 to 2019. It aims to examine the economic loss and damage sustained by the region, identify the sectors most impacted, and ascertain the perspectives of key stakeholders on the factors that hinder building resilience. Statistical analysis techniques and semi-structured interviews were to unpack and understand the dataset. The paper finds that economic loss and damage has gradually increasing between 1980 to 2009 with a drastic increase between 2010 to 2019. The paper highlights the agriculture, housing, transport, and utility sectors as the most impacted. The findings also call to attention the need for increased access to adaptation financing for SIDS, the disadvantages of the income status that hinders building resilience, and the need for increased Early Warning Systems. The paper recommends revising the per capita national income as an eligibility criterion for accessing concessional development finance assistance, a comprehensive EWS for the countries in the region, and consideration of debt relief for countries affected by TC.","[Lewis, Clint T.

However, with the development of secondary and tertiary industries in developing countries, an increasing number of agricultural laborers have migrated away from rural areas to seek off-farm employment, which reduces livelihood vulnerabilities and may hinder the adoption of crop diversification strategies. There is still a lack of case studies that address how labor migration affects crop diversification. To fill in this gap, we first propose a theoretical framework to address the impact of labor migration on crop diversification under the background of climate change; then, with the data collected from 499 households in the Hehuang Valley (HV), Tibetan Plateau, we explore the factors influencing crop diversification by employing Tobit model. The results show that: (1) crop diversification in the HV exhibits a downward trend due to climate change, with the crop diversification index dropping from 1.026 in 2009 to 0.884 in 2016. (2) Labor migration is obvious in the HV, and households without migrant laborers are more likely to adopt crop diversification strategies to combat climate change risks. (3) Household size, crop subsidies, crop income, and agricultural equipment inputs have significant positive effects on crop diversification, whereas farmers' perceptions of precipitation change, income of migrant laborers, workplace of migrant laborers and the average area of cultivated plots have significant negative effects. The findings of this study provide empirical evidence for understanding the impact of labor migration on crop diversification for adapting to climate change, and can help decision makers formulate effective measures to improve crop diversification by addressing key factors in priority, so as to ensure food security in the HV.","[Zhang, Yihao; Wu, Ya; Yan, Jianzhong; Peng, Ting] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yihao; Wu, Ya; Yan, Jianzhong] Southwest Univ, State Cultivat Base Ecoagr Southwest Mt Land, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yihao] Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China",Southwest University - China; Southwest University - China; Chongqing University,"Yan, JZ (corresponding author), 2 Tiansheng Rd, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.",yanjzswu@126.com,,"Zhang, Yihao/0000-0003-2734-0358","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program [2019QZKK0603]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171098, 42004187]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20040201]",Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This work was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (No. 2019QZKK0603) , the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 42171098, 42004187) and Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDA20040201) .",,88,5,5,18,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,FEB,2022,113,,,,,,,,105928,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105928,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105928,,,11,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1L3DG,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000799171200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, recent research indicates that public health agencies in the United States have done little to prepare the public for predicted climate change impacts, largely due in response to a lack of resources and priority. This study surveyed Environmental Health (EH) Directors across the United States to determine the extent to which individual level attitudes and beliefs influence the adoption of climate change adaptation programming in a department. The results indicate that an EH Director's perception of the health risk posed by climate change explained 27% of the variance in the number of climate change impacts being addressed. Furthermore, the study found that environmental attitude and political views made strong, unique contributions in explaining the variance in risk perception. The results provide evidence that individual-level attitudes and beliefs, as well as organizational-level barriers influence the adoption of climate change adaptation programs in public health agencies. As a result, increasing EH Directors' perception of risk by highlighting the likelihood and severity of localized impacts may increase the adoption of adaptation programming despite existing organizational barriers (e.g., lack of resources). Given the fact that risk perception has been shown to influence behavior across cultures, these findings are also useful for understanding the influence of individual decision makers on public health programming around the world.","[Syal, Sana S.; Wilson, Robyn S.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Mac Crawford, J.; Lutz, Jonathan] Ohio State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Wilson, RS (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",wilson.1376@osu.edu,,"Wilson, Robyn/0000-0002-0092-9632",Ohio State University,Ohio State University(Ohio State University),"The authors would like to thank the Environmental Health Directors who participated in the survey.

There is also a clear scientific consensus that transformative changes in agricultural systems and practice are needed as a response to the effects of climate change. A great variety of factors that influence the transition to organic farming have been found and identified over time. To understand the dynamics that lead farmers to move to organic farming, it is necessary to examine the relationship between these factors. In this study, we investigated the impacts of certain factors on the possibility of Hungarian farmers' conversion to organic production in the context of climate change adaptation. This dynamic was studied using descriptive and exploratory techniques on a cross-sectional sample. While the study supported certain well-established facts, it also yielded some surprising findings. One of our findings is that the transition to organic farming does not seem to be motivated by the perception of bad weather events, which is somewhat surprising. This outcome contradicts the frequently claimed idea that organic farming may be a successful adaptation strategy.","[Kiraly, Gabor] Inst Agr Econ, Social Res Dept, Sustainabil Res Directorate, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Giuseppina, Rizzo] Univ Palermo, Dept Agr Food & Forest Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Toth, Jozsef] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Inst Dev Enterprises, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Toth, Jozsef] Sapientia Hungarian Univ Transylvania, Fac Econ Sociohuman Sci & Engn, Miercurea Ciuc 530104, Romania",University of Palermo; Corvinus University Budapest; Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania,"Kiraly, G (corresponding author), Inst Agr Econ, Social Res Dept, Sustainabil Res Directorate, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",kiraly.gabor@aki.gov.hu,,"Toth, Jozsef/0000-0001-6833-0426; RIZZO, Giuseppina/0000-0002-8103-7512; Kiraly, Gabor/0000-0001-7728-6367","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office [120563]","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary)","Research was supported by the Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office, Grant No. 120563, Innovation resilience in food production and consumption.",,124,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,OCT,2022,12,10,,,,,,,2435,10.3390/agronomy12102435,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12102435,,,16,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,5N9PA,,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000872116700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Epistemic uncertainty refers to a perception about the level of information about a phenomenon. Aleatoric uncertainty is a perception that a phenomenon occurs at random and no new information will reduce uncertainty while response uncertainty refers to the perception of the efficacy of an action to reduce a risk. Epistemic and response uncertainty explained a large portion of variance of farmers' attitudes towards adaptation and their willingness to use weather and climate outlook tools. Aleatoric uncertainty however did not add or added only a small portion of variance explaining farmers' attitudes climate adaptation or use of climate tools. Our results indicate that climate scientists should not treat farmers' uncertainty as a monolithic concept, but instead embrace its multidimensionality. We also suggest that reception of expert-led presentations or tools that have a lot of modeling data, which are often layered with statistical uncertainty, can negatively influence farmers' model uncertainty.","[Singh, Ajay S.] CSU, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Eanes, Francis] Bates Coll, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA; [Prokopy, Linda S.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Singh, AS (corresponding author), CSU, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA.",Singh@csus.edu; feanes@bates.edu; Lprokopy@purdue.edu,,"Singh, Ajay/0000-0002-5576-8178",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

The integration of DRR with adaptation is globally recognized as a rational use of resources benefiting both areas. There is a substantial literature on the topic, but little on the practice of implementing such integration on the ground. This paper presents some of these experiences at national and agency levels in the south-west Pacific and outlines possible future directions to support policy and practice. Based on the perspectives of practitioners from Australia, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands, it explores institutional changes with country examples, and the range of constraints and enabling factors in integrating adaptation with DRR and EM practices. The Australian aim of spreading responsibility for CCA and DRR integration through mainstreaming across departments and agencies was seen as effective in increasing whole-of-government approaches. However, in both Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands the concentration of information, responsibility and actions through a single focal point was more effective in reducing overlap and providing a clearer picture of what was being implemented, by whom and where. The findings demonstrate a need to consider the experiences arising from practical implementation of the integration agenda and to document the lessons from this experience in a way that can inform policy and practice.","[Nalau, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Nalau, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Griffith Inst Tourism, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Handmer, John] RMIT Univ, Coll Sci Engn & Hlth, Ctr Risk & Community Safety, Sch Math & Geospatial Sci, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Dalesa, Malcolm] Govt Vanuatu, VMGD, Private Mail Bag 9054, Nambatu, Port Vila, Vanuatu; [Foster, Holly] Off Fire Serv Commissioner, Dept Justice, Level 26,121 Exhibit St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Edwards, Jill] Australasian Fire & Emergency Serv Author Council, Level 5,340 Albert St, East Melbourne, Vic 3002, Australia; [Kauhiona, Hudson] Govt Solomon Isl, Minist Environm Climate Change Disaster Managemen, Climate Change Div, POB 21, Honiara, Solomon Islands; [Yates, Loti] Govt Solomon Isl, Minist Environm Climate Change Disaster Managemen, Natl Disaster Management Off, POB 21, Honiara, Solomon Islands; [Welegtabit, Shadrack] Govt Vanuatu, Natl Disaster Management Off, Private Mail Bag 9054, Nambatu, Port Vila, Vanuatu; [Foster, Holly] Emergency Management Victoria, Level 26,121 Exhibit St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.;Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Inst Tourism, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.",j.nalau@griffith.edu.au,"Nalau, Johanna/V-5692-2018","Nalau, Johanna/0000-0001-6581-3967",National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,This paper is based on a project funded by the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility.,,20,29,29,0,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

An income stabilization tool (IST) is provided to compensate drastic drops in income, including those caused by climatic events. The present study examines some aspect of its application focussing on Mediterranean irrigation area where frequent water shortages may generate significant income reductions in the current climate conditions, and may be further exacerbated by climate change. This enhanced loss of income in the future would occur due to a change in climate variability. This change would appreciably reduce the probability of weather conditions that are favourable for irrigation, but would not significantly increase either the probability of unfavourable weather conditions or the magnitude of their impact. As the IST and other insurance tools that protect against adversity and catastrophic events are only activated under extreme conditions, farmers may not consider them to be suitable in dealing with the new climate regime. This would leave a portion of the financial resources allocated by the RDP unused, resulting in less support for climate change adaptation.","[Dono, Gabriele; Cortignani, Raffaele; Giraldo, Luca] Univ Tuscia, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Pasqui, Massimiliano] CNR, Rome, Italy; [Roggero, Pier Paolo] Univ Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",Tuscia University; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); University of Sassari,"Dono, G (corresponding author), Univ Tuscia, Dept Sci & Technol Agr Forestry Nat & Energy, Via San Camillo de Lellis Snc, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",dono@unitus.it,"Cortignani, Raffaele/ABF-9897-2021; Pasqui, Massimiliano/F-8259-2010; Pasqui, Massimiliano/M-9971-2019; Roggero, Pier Paolo/D-2580-2012","Cortignani, Raffaele/0000-0002-2685-9783; Pasqui, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0926-362X; Pasqui, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0926-362X; Roggero, Pier Paolo/0000-0002-7269-4334; Dono, Gabriele/0000-0002-0272-178X",Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,"This study was carried out under the Agroscenari (http://www.agroscenari.it/) and the MACSUR (http://www.macsur.eu/) projects funded by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

Temperature projections indicate further warming, but models do not agree as to seasonal distribution of changes in precipitation. This article reviews evidence for climate change and its impacts in Poland, in the context of observations and projections. It also reviews various aspects of climate change mitigation policy in the country whose energy supply is more coal-dominated than any other country. This is one reason why climate change mitigation efforts are modest and climate policy largely passive. The dramatic decline of industrial production involving a rapid decline in CO2 emissions during 19891992 was the crucial element of the Poland's position in the negotiations of international agreements. The European Union (EU) accession in 2004 tied Poland to EU climate policy. This cautious approach is largely in harmony with public attitudes. Poles are aware of climate change, but it is not considered as a priority issue and public opinion is divided about the issues of mitigation. Adaptation to climate change impacts in Poland is driven by the fact that observed impacts are not very large and there is no persuasive attribution of these impacts to greenhouse gas emissions. Reactive adaptation to climate change is preferred over anticipatory adaptation. There are several special care areas in Poland in terms of adaptation: the mountains; the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea; and the river valleys.

Studies on climate change adaptation recognize the importance of specific area-based research for designing policies to respond to climate change. This study, therefore, was applied at the district level to examine farmers' preference for climate change adaptation strategies and the factors determining their preference. The objective of this study is to identify and model factors that influence farmers' preference of adaptation strategies to counter the impacts of climate change in the case of Dera District, North Shoa, Oromia, Ethiopia. Cross-sectional study design was used with the questionnaire being administered on a multistage sample of 460 households from selected kebeles in the district. Descriptive statistics, multinomial logit, and count regression analysis were used to analyze the collected data. The study revealed that the farmers perceived that temperature had been increasing and rainfall had been decreasing over the last 10 years. The results also indicated that planting trees was the most preferred and frequently applied adaptation strategy to climate change while changing planting dates was the least. The results from the multinomial logit, Poisson regression, and negative binomial analysis showed that age, source of information, household size, education level of household head, distance to output market, distance to input market, agroecological locations of the farm, tropical livestock unit, size of the farm, tenure, grade of the farm, distance of the farm, formal extension service, farmer-to-farmer extension, credit service, rainfall expectation, and temperature expectations were significant factors in determining the adaptation strategies preferred by the farmers.","[Belachew, Tadesse Ayele] Salale Univ, Dept Stat, Coll Nat Sci, Fiche, Ethiopia; [Ababu, Dereje Gebeyehu] Mettu Univ, Dept Stat, Coll Nat Sci, Mettu, Ethiopia",,"Belachew, TA (corresponding author), Salale Univ, Dept Stat, Coll Nat Sci, Fiche, Ethiopia.",tadeayele2003@gmail.com,"Belachew, Tadesse Ayele/AAD-5438-2022; Ababu, Dereje Gebeyehu/AED-2542-2022","Ababu, Dereje Gebeyehu/0000-0002-6236-9968; Belachew, Tadesse Ayele/0000-0002-1634-0558",,,,,16,1,1,0,3,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-7667,1687-7675,,APPL ENVIRON SOIL SC,Appl.

The objectives were (1) to determine biochar impacts on crop yields and soil properties of a tropical soil and (2) to evaluate biochar's potential as a climate change adaptation tool. EPIC was validated using results of a 4-yr experiment performed on an Amazonian Oxisol amended with biochar at rates of 0, 8, and 20 Mg ha(-1). Simulated yields of corn on biochar amended soil were significantly greater than control yields (p < 0.05). Simulated soil pH increased from original 3.9 to 4.19, CEC increased from 9.76 to 11.5 cmol(c) kg(-1), and SOC also increased. After validation, EPIC was used to simulate the impacts of the same biochar rates applied at 4 year intervals on corn yields and soil properties over the next 20 years. Soil CEC increased from 11.1 cmol(c) kg(-1) to 20.2 cmol(c) kg(-1) for the highest biochar application rate. Soil pH increased from 3.9 to 5.64. SOC increased up to 2.59 % for the highest biochar application rate with decreased topsoil D-b from 1.11 Mg m(-3) to 0.97 Mg m(-3). Long-term corn yields were slightly decreased. Although the results are biochar-, dose-, and soil-specific, biochar additions to tropical soils hold promise as a climate change adaptation tool resulting in increased soil carbon sequestration and improved soil properties.","[Lychuk, Taras E.] Univ Maryland, Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Lychuk, Taras E.] Univ Maryland, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Izaurralde, Roberto C.] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Izaurralde, Roberto C.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Hill, Robert L.] Univ Maryland, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [McGill, William B.] Univ No British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Williams, Jimmy R.] Blackland Texas AgriLife Res & Extens Ctr, Temple, TX 76502 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Northern British Columbia,"Lychuk, TE (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, 1204 HJ Patterson Hall, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",tlychuk1@umd.edu; cizaurra@umd.edu; rlh@umd.edu; mcgill@umbc.ca; jwilliams@brc.tamus.edu,"Izaurralde, Roberto Cesar/E-5257-2019; Lychuk, Taras/ABI-8405-2020","Izaurralde, Roberto Cesar/0000-0002-8797-9500; ","DOE Office of Science; Department of Environmental Science and Technology, University of Maryland, College Park; Fulbright Commission","DOE Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Department of Environmental Science and Technology, University of Maryland, College Park; Fulbright Commission","The project was supported by the DOE Office of Science under the Carbon Sequestration in Terrestrial Ecosystems (CSiTE), the Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences Program, the Regional Climate Modeling Program and by the Department of Environmental Science and Technology, University of Maryland, College Park.

Farmers are often thought to do so intuitively, because many climate change impacts will manifest in similar ways to the weather and climate variability that farmers have always faced. However, there is little evidence to suggest whether farmers are already doing this, how they should go about it, and how hard it might be. Here we show that commercial grain farmers in South Africa (N = 90), as a uniquely informative group, are struggling to mainstream climate change risk management despite their apparent incentive, capacity and willingness to adapt. They perform large-scale, highly mechanized, input-intensive grain farming like their peers in higher-income countries (e.g., the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia), but without the government subsidies, crop insurance and irrigation more common in other regions. They are therefore motivated to adapt proactively because they are more vulnerable to the financial harms of weather and climate risks. Our data show that they are explicitly sensitive to the risks of climate change, generally expressing concern for its potential impacts, reporting observed changes, proposing possible adaptations, and expressing the desire to adapt proactively, However, their mental models of climate change (n = 30) are linguistically and structurally isolated from their mental models of weather and other 'normal' risks. They are therefore implicitly insensitive to climate change, making it unlikely that they will adapt proactively and rationally to this uncertain risk that they otherwise appear well-equipped to manage.","[Findlater, K.

These dense concentrations of population, economic activity, and consumptionthe majority of which are in the Global Southare often extremely vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea level rise and extreme weather. This paper unpacks these complexities through a case study of Metropolitan Manila, the capital of the Philippines, which represents an example of double exposure to climate change impacts and globalization. The city is experiencing tremendous population and economic growth, yet Manila is plagued by frequent natural disasters, congestion, inadequate infrastructure, poverty, and income inequality. The need for metro-wide planning and infrastructure transformations to address these problems is widely recognized, but governance challenges are a major barrier. Drawing on fieldwork, interviews, and other primary and secondary sources, I argue that climate change and globalization, in combination with Manila's historical and physical context, critically shape metro-wide infrastructure planning. Focusing on electricity and green infrastructure, I find that the largely decentralized and privatized urban governance regime is perpetuating a fragmented and unequal city, which may undermine urban climate resilience. This study extends the double exposure framework to examine how global processes interact with contextual factors to critically shape urban infrastructure planning, and how the resulting system conforms to theorized characteristics of urban climate resilience. In doing so, I help to connect emerging literatures on double exposure, urban infrastructure planning, and urban climate resilience.","[Meerow, Sara] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Meerow, S (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",sara.meerow@asu.edu,"Meerow, Sara/J-8037-2019","Meerow, Sara/0000-0002-6935-1832","Marshall Weinberg Population, Development, and Climate Change Fellowship; Rackham International Research Grant; Menakka and Essel Bailey Fellowship","Marshall Weinberg Population, Development, and Climate Change Fellowship; Rackham International Research Grant; Menakka and Essel Bailey Fellowship","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author(s) would like to thank Marshall Weinberg Population, Development, and Climate Change Fellowship, the Rackham International Research Grant, and the Menakka and Essel Bailey Fellowship for funding the research.",,107,34,34,16,113,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

Exploration of the roles national, state and local health departments (LHDs) play in advancing climate change planning and actions to protect public health is a developing arena of research. This paper presents insights from local public health departments in California, USA on how they addressed the barriers to climate adaptation planning with support from the California Department of Public Health's Office of Health Equity Climate Change and Health Equity Section (OHE), which administers the California Building Resilience Against Climate Effects Project (CalBRACE). With support from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative (CRSCI), CalBRACE initiated an adaptation project to seed climate planning and actions in county health departments. In this study, we compared the barriers and strategies of twenty-two urban and rural LHDs and explored potential options for climate change adaptation in the public health framework. Using key informant interviews and document reviews, the results showed how engagement with CalBRACE's Local Health Department Partnership on Climate Change influenced the county departments' ability to overcome barriers to adaptation through the diversification of funding sources, the leveraging strategic collaborations, extensive public education and communication campaigns, and the development of political capital and champions. The lessons learned and recommendations from this research may provide pathways and practices for national, state and local level health departments to collaborate in developing protocols and integrating systems to respond to health-related climate change impacts, adaptation and implementation.","[Holmes, Tisha Joseph] Florida State Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Holt, Ava] Florida A&M Univ, Sch Business & Ind, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA; [English, Dorette Quintana] Calif Dept Publ Hlth, Climate Change & Hlth Equ Sect, Off Hlth Equ, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University; California Department of Public Health,"Holmes, TJ (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",ttholmes@fsu.edu; ava.holt@famu.edu; dqe1@att.net,,"Holmes, Tisha/0000-0003-4754-9060",Florida State University Council on Research Creativity Committee on Faculty Research Support (COFRS) program internal seed grant [000032879],Florida State University Council on Research Creativity Committee on Faculty Research Support (COFRS) program internal seed grant,This research was funded by the Florida State University Council on Research Creativity Committee on Faculty Research Support (COFRS) program internal seed grant #000032879.,,61,0,0,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

With this technology, otherwise unused stream/spring water is stored in large ice towers during the winter. The surplus melt water generated in spring is used to satisfy irrigation water demands. Recent studies have shown that, during AIR construction, over 75% of the water sprayed is lost. In order to reduce these water losses, different fountain scheduling strategies implemented on two AIRs under identical weather conditions were compared. In one scheduling strategy, the fountain was operated manually (non-scheduled fountain) whereas in another it was operated via an automation system (scheduled fountain). The automation system computed recommended discharge rates using real-time meterological input and location metadata. Scheduled fountains produced similar ice volume while consuming one-tenth of the water the non-scheduled fountain used. Simulations converting non-scheduled fountains into scheduled fountains showed a threefold improvement in water-use efficiency. Overall, these results show that automated fountain water supply management can increase water-use efficiency of AIRs and reduce their maintenance without compromising their meltwater production.","[Balasubramanian, Suryanarayanan; Hoelzle, Martin] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Balasubramanian, Suryanarayanan] Himalayan Inst Alternat, Ladakh, India; [Waser, Roger] Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Luzern, Switzerland",University of Fribourg,"Balasubramanian, S (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Fribourg, Switzerland.",suryanarayanan.balasubramanian@unifr.ch,,"Hoelzle, Martin/0000-0002-3591-4377; Balasubramanian, Suryanarayanan/0000-0002-8027-8808",University of Fribourg; Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship; Glaciers Alive Association,University of Fribourg; Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship; Glaciers Alive Association,This work was supported and funded by the University of Fribourg and by the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship (SB).

Inland waterway transport is one of the main economic activities developed in the Rhine, and the effects of climate change on this activity are of great concern for skippers, the industry and policy-makers. This paper aims to identify whether longer and more frequent dry periods projected in the Rhine River will turn into a physical limitation that prevent inland waterway transport companies from guaranteeing reliable transportation to their customers, and - if so - when such a situation might take place. Based on the adaptation turning point approach, we propose a four step method to identify critical time periods for future climate change adaptation. According to our results, the inland waterway transport sector will start facing insurmountable problems associated with low water levels within the time span 2081-2095. The adaptation turning point approach provides analysts with a dynamic appraisal method that allows options to be ranked with timing of period of effectiveness and the time span needed for implementation as criteria. This increases flexibility of planning and allows for uncertainty about changing future conditions.","[Riquelme-Solar, M.; van Slobbe, E.; Werners, S.

Farmers agreed to implement climate adaptive farming which combines organic farming, biological pest control and drought-resistant seedlings from local varieties. Findings The processes to adaptation required collective actions, paradigm shift and it also constitutes trial and error processes. Acceptance to innovation is mostly one of the major challenges. Working with contact farmers and advance farmers is the key to the community organizing strategy for innovation and adaptation. Research limitations/implications - This case study is limited to the adaptation program funded by Indonesia Climate Change Trust Fund in four farmer groups in Purwosari Sub-District, GunungKidul district and Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. Practical implications - Trainings and direct assistance to climate adaptive farming have benefitted the farmers that they are able to increase the farming production and reduce the risk of crop failure.

The interconnected risks caused by these extreme disaster events are triggering a chain effect, forcing us to respond to these crises through changes in our living environment, which affect the atmosphere, the biosphere, the economy including the availability of energy, our cities, and our global society. Moreover, we have to confront the abnormal consequences of untypical, rapid changes of extreme events and fast switches between extreme states, such as from severe drought to devastating flooding. Recognizing this new situation, it is crucial to improve the adaptation capacity of our societies in order to reduce the risks associated with climate change, and to develop smarter strategies for climate governance. High-quality development must be science-based, balanced, safe, sustainable, and climate-resilient, supported by the collaborative governance of climate mitigation and adaptation.

We combine a systematic review and content analysis to review 136 peer-reviewed articles (published between 2008 and 2020) on urban climate justice in adaptation in order to: (1) review the emergence of the discourse on climate justice's pillars (i.e., distributive, procedural, and recognitional justice) vis-`a-vis urban climate adaptation; (2) investigate the correlations between climate justice and the adaptive urban form interventions (GBI, adaptive land uses, and urban design measures); and (3) identify the spatial and scalar connections between the climate justice pillars and the adaptive urban form interventions. The findings reveal several trends, including: a deficit of empirical studies that deploy the climate justice pillars for assessing adaptive urban form interventions; an overemphasis on normative suggestions and/or critiques without clarifying how to advance climate justice; a dearth of urban design discussions on climate justice; a particular lack of connections between recognitional justice and urban form; and last, a dearth of studies that investigate the justice outcomes of adaptive urban form interventions across multiple spatial and temporal scales.","[Mohtat, Niloofar; Khirfan, Luna] Univ Waterloo, Sch Planning, Fac Environm, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Mohtat, N (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Sch Planning, Fac Environm, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",nmohtat@uwaterloo.ca; lkhirfan@uwaterloo.ca,,"Khirfan, Luna/0000-0003-4978-7521",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [435-2016-0243]; SSHRC,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR); SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The funding for this research project was provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) under file number 435-2016-0243.

This prompts the question under which conditions these new responsibility arrangements can be justified as they may raise serious ethical concerns. Without paying due attention to these ethical concerns, climate adaptation policy may be unsuccessful and even be considered illegitimate. This paper aims to address this topic by exploring some examples of climate adaptation responses and their associated ethical challenges. The examples from the water domain differ in terms of their primary beneficiaries and the extent to which they are prone to collective action problems. Discussion of the examples shows that any shift of responsibilities towards citizens should be accompanied by a governmental responsibility to make sure that citizens are indeed able to assume these responsibilities and a responsibility to see to it that the greater involvement of responsibilities does not create disproportional inequalities.","[Doorn, Neelke; Brackel, Lieke; Vermeulen, Sara] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Dept Values Technol & Innovat, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Doorn, N (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Dept Values Technol & Innovat, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",N.Doorn@tudelft.nl; A.K.C.Brackel@tudelft.nl; S.Vermeulen@tudelft.nl,"Vermeulen, Sara/GYI-9105-2022","Vermeulen, Sara/0000-0001-5248-0286; Brackel, Lieke/0000-0002-0353-1291; Doorn, Neelke/0000-0002-1090-579X",Dutch National Research Council NWO [Vidi.195.119],Dutch National Research Council NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This research was funded by the Dutch National Research Council NWO, grant number VI.

It is well documented that climate-change adaptation planning on a local scale benefits from a stakeholder-led or bottom-up process. However, to date, few bottom-up, practical adaptation pathways exist for Indigenous Australians. This paper describes the development of a planning tool that supports Indigenous rangers' plan for climate-change impacts on cultural heritage sites. To date, a limited number of methodologies for managing climate-change impacts on heritage sites have been developed internationally. Importantly these are not geared to a bottom-up planning process. By contrast, many generic adaptation decision-support tools exist that support bottom-up planning. These tools commonly begin with a scoping phase. The scoping phase of a tool that supports Indigenous rangers manage climate-change impacts on heritage sites is described. A validation model, consisting of central assumptions behind each element of the scoping phase, is then set out. Future testing in the field would involve assessment of the tool through confirmation or otherwise of these assumptions. The first two assumptions in the validation model are then addressed: that Indigenous rangers perceive climate-change impacts on heritage sites and that planning for them is a priority need. Previous literature has not addressed these questions in detail. Only if positive responses are gained for these foundational assumptions can future testing of the tool be justified. Results from preliminary fieldwork undertaken in northern Australia found Indigenous rangers in two out of three case studies perceive impacts on heritage sites, and regard addressing these impacts as a priority.","[Carmichael, Bethune] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Carmichael, Bethune] Charles Darwin Univ, Alice Springs, NT 0871, Australia",Australian National University; Charles Darwin University,"Carmichael, B (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",bethune.carmichael@cdu.edu.au,,,Australian National University; Charles Darwin University; Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project [DP120100512]; ARC Linkage Project [LP110201128]; Australian Research Council [LP110201128] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian National University(Australian National University); Charles Darwin University; Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project(Australian Research Council); ARC Linkage Project(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The author wishes to acknowledge the invaluable input of the Djelk rangers, especially Victor Rostron, Greg Wilson, Ivan Namarnyilk, Obed Namirriki, Alfie Galaminda, Daryl Redford and William Dennis; Djelk support staff, Dominic Nicholls, Alys Stevens, Alex Ernst; and traditional owners, especially Wayne Campion, Helen Williams and Matthew Ryan.

The CDC established the Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) framework in 2010 to encourage local and state public health engagement in climate change adaptation. However, even after a decade of the BRACE initiative, the elements that affect the adoption and implementation of climate and health programming by S/THAs are not well understood.MethodsUsing an implementation science framework, this study sought to further understand and define the barriers and facilitators that determine the breadth and success of climate change and health activities undertaken by state health agencies (SHAs). We conducted focus groups with representatives from SHAs with and without climate and health programs, and analyzed data using the framework method for qualitative research.ResultsThis study identified funding, state and agency-level prioritization, staff capability and capacity, and political will and polarization as factors that influence the readiness for implementation and implementation climate for climate and health activities.ConclusionsAs the impacts of climate change intensify, S/THAs will need to expand resources and capacity, and seek advocacy and assistance from external organizations in order to support the level of engagement required to strengthen climate resilience.

Autodesk Ecotect Analysis software was used to model and calculate the shading, sunlit and shading-sunlit indexes (as climate adaptability evaluating indicators). Next, statistical analyses were conducted to determine the relation of calculated indexes and geometrical parameters and aspect ratios of the courtyards. The results reveal that the overall level of climate adaptability of courtyards for the whole year was average (51%), it was higher for the summer period (73%) and lower for the winter (20%). Furthermore, the geometrical parameters of the courtyards have opposite effects on shading-sunlit performance in summer and winter.

Rapid action from all scientific fields, including behavioral medicine, is needed to contribute to both mitigation of, and adaption to, climate change. Purpose This article aims to identify potential bi-directional associations between climate change impacts and health-related behaviors, as well as a set of key actions for the behavioral medicine community. Methods We synthesized the existing literature about (i) the impacts of rising temperatures, extreme weather events, air pollution, and rising sea level on individual behaviors (e.g., eating behaviors, physical activity, sleep, substance use, and preventive care) as well as the structural factors related to these behaviors (e.g., the food system); and (ii) the concurrent positive and negative roles that health-related behaviors can play in mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Results Based on this literature review, we propose a first conceptual model of climate change and health-related behavior feedback loops. Key actions are proposed, with particular consideration for health equity implications of future behavioral interventions. Actions to bridge the fields of behavioral medicine and climate sciences are also discussed. Conclusions We contend that climate change is among the most urgent issues facing all scientists and should become a central priority for the behavioral medicine community.","[Chevance, Guillaume; Fresan, Ujue; Lloyd, Simon J.; Ballester, Joan; Litt, Jill; Cvijanovic, Ivana] ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain; [Hekler, Eric] Univ Calif San Diego, Herbert Wertheim Sch Publ Hlth & Human Longev Sci, San Diego, CA USA; [Hekler, Eric] Univ Calif San Diego, Qualcomm Inst, Ctr Wireless & Populat Hlth Syst, San Diego, CA USA; [Edmondson, Donald] Columbia Univ, Ctr Behav Cardiovasc Hlth, Irving Med Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Litt, Jill] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Araujo-Soares, Vera] Univ Twente, Hlth Technol & Serv Res, Enschede, Netherlands; [Bernard, Paquito] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Phys Act Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bernard, Paquito] Univ Inst Mental Hlth Montreal, Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada",ISGlobal; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Columbia University; NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Twente; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Chevance, G (corresponding author), ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain.",guillaume.chevance@isglobal.org,"Edmondson, Donald/G-7486-2016; Lloyd, Simon/ABH-8249-2020","Lloyd, Simon/0000-0002-9728-8674; Edmondson, Donald/0000-0002-4518-8196","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CEX2018-000806-S]; State Research Agency through the Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa 2019-2023 Program [CEX2018-000806-S]; Generalitat de Catalunya through the CERCA Program; La Caixa Junior Leader Grant 2020 (Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant) [847648]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [865564]; Ministry of Science and Innovation (MCIU) [RYC2018025446-I]; Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Institut Universitaire de Sante Mentale de Montreal; Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); State Research Agency through the Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa 2019-2023 Program; Generalitat de Catalunya through the CERCA Program; La Caixa Junior Leader Grant 2020 (Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; Ministry of Science and Innovation (MCIU); Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Institut Universitaire de Sante Mentale de Montreal; Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante(Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec)","G.C. and U.F. were supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and State Research Agency through the Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa 2019-2023 Program (CEX2018-000806-S), and by the Generalitat de Catalunya through the CERCA Program.

Emissions from the agriculture sector (e.g. GHG emissions, and release of pesticides, herbicides, and nutrients) is causing global warming as well as damaging the environment, and in return climate change is stressing agriculture globally. The bewildering relationship between adaptative measures and risk of maladaptive outcomes demands a better understanding concerning What, where and how to implement adaptive measures. This article is one step towards a deeper understanding of what, where and how related questions on climate change adaptation in connection to constraints of carrying capacities and risks of maladaptation. A GIS based framework was employed for generating risk maps for identification of nutrient surplus and discharge hotspots i.e. Where to implement?. Moreover, extensive in-depth interviews and a questionnaire survey were conducted to explore perceptions on carrying capacities, resources management, climate change adaptation measures and risk of maladaptive results, i.e. What and how to implement?. Furthermore, the data collected from the questionnaire survey and interviews was employed to ameliorate the analytical model, previously developed, based on the initial work of Juhola et al. (2016) and Neset et al. (2019a), which could help guide planners, advisors, and farmers for better understanding of adaptation and maladaptive risks.

Such transformational adaptation is rapidly emerging as a serious topic in agriculture. This paper provides an overview of the topic as it applies to agriculture, focusing on the Australian situation. It does so by first defining transformational adaptation, distinguishing it from other more incremental but overlapping modes of climate change adaptation and positing its emergence in agriculture as a response to both drivers and opportunities. The multiple dimensions of transformational adaptation are highlighted before two types or cases are focussed upon in order to tease out issues and highlight two major examples of transformation in agriculture in the past. Four key issues about climate change adaptation in agriculture particularly pertinent for transformational adaptation are then reviewed: the identification, level, distribution and management of the costs of adaptation; the definition, potential for and need to avoid maladaptation; the capacity demands that this level of adaptation presents; and the role of government in adaptation. Overall, transformational adaptation poses potential great gains but also great risks. It reinforces the realisation that agricultural research can no longer remain insulated from off-farm, non-science or non-agricultural knowledge or processes. Support and guidance of transformational adaptation requires that we understand how Australian agriculture is currently, and could be, positioned within the landscape, rural communities, and broader social, political and cultural environment.","[Rickards, L.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Land & Environm, Carlton, Vic 2010, Australia; [Howden, S.

This paper explores commercial farmers' perceptions of and responses to shifting climates in the Little Brak River area along South Africa's south coast. It aims to evaluate changes in the climate experienced in the area by comparing quantitative statistical analyses of temperature, rainfall and wind data recorded from 1967 to 2009, with qualitative historical narratives and formulated perceptions of change for the same period. This was undertaken in order to test the robustness of the narratives and to understand how farmers' perceptions and experiences drive their climate-related decisions. The narratives revealed that the farmers perceived a gradual but dramatic shift in climate over almost four decades, including increasing temperatures, changing annual rainfall patterns and shifts in predominant wind direction, mirrored by the recorded weather data that show similar results to the narratives. It is evident that farmers' experience with shifting climates has played a large part in driving their adaptive decision-making, but financial capital of these commercial farmers has also been a major factor enabling certain responses. This research contributes to the growing local and regional evidence of variability and change to climate systems, and documents how people have already responded to change in order to help build locally relevant climate change adaptation approaches that could potentially benefit a wider range of farmers.","[Wiid, Nicholas; Ziervogel, Gina] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.",gina.ziervogel@uct.ac.za,"Ziervogel, Gina/AAG-2945-2019","Ziervogel, Gina/0000-0003-4219-6809",,,,,45,25,28,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0373-6245,2151-2418,,S AFR GEOGR J,S.

Numerous approaches, methodologies and conceptualizations have been proposed for analyzing adaptive capacity at different scales. Indicator-based assessments are usually applied to assess and quantify the adaptive capacity for the use of policy makers. Nevertheless, they encompass various implications regarding scale specificity and the robustness issues embedded in the choice of indicators selection, normalization and aggregation methods. We describe an adaptive capacity index developed for Italy's regional and sub-regional administrative levels, as a part of the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan, and that is further elaborated in this article. The index is built around four dimensions and ten indicators, analysed and processed by means of a principal component analysis and fuzzy logic techniques. As an innovative feature of our analysis, the sub-regional variability of the index feeds back into the regional level assessment. The results show that composite indices estimated at higher administrative or statistical levels neglect the inherent variability of performance at lower levels which may lead to suboptimal adaptation policies. By considering the intra-regional variability, different patterns of adaptive capacity can be observed at regional level as a result of the aggregation choices. Trade-offs should be made explicit for choosing aggregators that reflect the intended degree of compensation. Multiple scale assessments using a range of aggregators with different compensability are preferable. Our results show that within-region variability can be better demonstrated by bottom-up aggregation methods.","[Marzi, Sepehr; Mysiak, Jaroslav; Santato, Silvia] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venice, Italy; [Marzi, Sepehr; Mysiak, Jaroslav; Santato, Silvia] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dorsoduro 3246, I-30123 Venice, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Marzi, S (corresponding author), CMCC Fdn, Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venice, Italy.;Marzi, S (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venice, Italy.",sepehr.marzi@unive.it,"Mysiak, Jaroslav/A-8683-2019","Mysiak, Jaroslav/0000-0001-9341-7048; Marzi, Sepehr/0000-0002-8318-3767; santato, silvia/0000-0003-4650-1612",European Union [730482],European Union(European Commission),This publication is part of the project CLARA Climate forecast enabled knowledge services that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Grant Agreement No 730482.,,62,13,13,1,12,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Building municipal capacities for citizen participation in adaptation is important to enabling such transformational changes but remains challenging. By applying capacities distilled from the literature on Urban Transformative Capacity and Participatory Climate Governance in a Swedish municipal case, this study aims to disentangle key limits for, and innovations to strengthen, local capacities for citizen participation in transformative climate adaptation. Interviews with municipal officials, focus groups with citizens, and document analyses were employed to analyse how climate adaptation and citizen participation are governed, and how these policy areas are interacting and could be bridged. The study points at conditions that foremost prevent bridging established policies and practices on adaptation and citizen participation, stemming from the different logics and distribution of responsibility within, and lacking collaboration between, these separated policy areas. The analysis concludes that potential ways to enable citizen participation in adaptation involve: broadening the geographical boundaries of deliberations; redefining the target groups for participation; co-designing participation targets, approaches and evaluation; and developing new ways to analyse and act on the patterns in the citizen inputs received.","[Glaas, Erik; Hjerpe, Mattias; Storbjork, Sofie] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden; [Wihlborg, Elin] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn Polit Sci, Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Glaas, E (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Linkoping, Sweden.",erik.glaas@liu.se,,,,,,,45,2,2,5,13,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

The research, undertaken with agricultural NGO FARM-Africa, centres upon subsistence farming communities in the Kenyan Districts of Mwingi and Kitui, where a succession of droughts has blighted agricultural production in recent years. Discussions with FARM-Africa staff highlight how recent climate variability and possibly climate change, is already affecting project-level operations. In particular, the interaction between the secondary impacts of climate hazards and livelihood responses presents a challenge to local staff as there is no obvious means of reflecting the complexity of local experiences and impacts within project planning processes. In response, drawing upon discussions with Farmer Groups, a matrix for each community was developed comprising environmental, social and agro-economic hazard (drought) consequence indicators and corresponding measures under 'extreme', 'severe' and 'moderate' scenarios. This paper concludes that a structured approach to gathering locally held knowledge on the consequences of climate hazards appears to present a potentially valuable means of exploring the complex web of interactions between climate, livelihoods and vulnerability. Such community-generated information can be used to inform future project planning and community decision making, increasing the likelihood of achieving locally appropriate adaptation outcomes.","[Pringle, Patrick; Conway, Declan] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Pringle, P (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",paddypringle@yahoo.co.uk,"Conway, Declan/HCH-7778-2022","PRINGLE, PATRICK/0000-0003-0090-044X; Conway, Declan/0000-0002-4590-6733",,,,,29,17,17,0,36,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

For many rural communities, challenges to available capital, infrastructure and knowledge systems need to be identified to adequately address climate change adaptability. In this study, social capital and information networks are examined as local adaptation strategies to mitigate specific risks and vulnerabilities to wildfire. We examine survey data collected from 683 owner-occupied rural central Oregon households, where localized climate change manifestations present risks to residents through increased wildfire occurrence and severity. Results indicate that social network ties to professionals knowledgeable on climate change and/or wildfires have no statistical impact on perceptions of climate change or associated local risks. Such social network ties are, however, mediated by a social capital measure of governmental trust for climate change. Results also indicate residents with higher perceptions of adaptation capacity to mobilize for collective action had greater concern for localized risks while residents with higher views of community solidarity had less concern. Clarifying these relationships adds to our understanding of social networks, community level social capital, and concerns for generalized climate change versus localized manifestations of risk as adaptation strategies for forested rural communities.","[Jacobs, Derric B.] Portland State Univ, Environm Sci & Management, SRTC B1-18,1719 SW 10th AVE, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Cramer, Lori A.] Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 404 Bexell Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Portland State University; Oregon State University,"Jacobs, DB (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Environm Sci & Management, SRTC B1-18,1719 SW 10th AVE, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",derric.jacobs@pdx.edu; lcramer@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,115,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

One solution is to develop multifunctional rooftop systems, which use underexploited urban rooftop spaces. Two main options have been to add greenery by installing extensive green roofs (EGRs) or to generate renewable energy by installing photovoltaic panels (PVs). Recently, combining the two systems on one rooftop (EGR-PV) to harvest both benefits has gained attention. Not every rooftop is suitable for such installations, which makes it difficult to estimate the scale of space a city can expect from rooftops to add greenery, renewable energy, or both. This study presents a geographical potential model using building parameters, a building stock layer, and LiDAR data to simultaneously identify the potential for installing EGRs, PVs, and EGR-PVs on rooftops, highlighting the competition and synergy between EGRs and PVs at the building level. As an empirical illustration to support future multifunctional urban rooftop space planning, Amsterdam was used as a case study. The results show that 47 % of rooftops are suitable for EGRs, which could expand the current greenery space by 6 %, and 55 % are suitable for PVs which could sufficiently provide electricity to households by 2030. Moreover, competition exists for 3.2 %, whereas synergy exists for 42 % of the existing rooftops.","[Slootweg, Mike; Hu, Mingming; Zelfde, Maarten van 't; Tukker, Arnold] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands; [Vega, Solmaria Halleck] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Social Sci, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Leeuwen, Eveline] Amsterdam Inst Adv Metropolitan Solut, NL-1018 JA Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Slootweg, Mike] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, Ind Ecol Dept, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Wageningen University & Research; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Slootweg, M (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, Ind Ecol Dept, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands.",h.j.slootweg@cml.leidenuniv.nl; hu@cml.leidenuniv.nl; solmaria.halleckvega@wur.nl; zelfde@cml.leidenuniv.nl; eveline.vanleeuwen@wur.nl; tukker@cml.leidenuniv.nl,,"Slootweg, Mike/0000-0002-4674-7914",Dutch Research Council (NWO) though Merian Fund Cooperation China-The Netherlands (CAS) Green Cities 2019' [482.19.704],Dutch Research Council (NWO) though Merian Fund Cooperation China-The Netherlands (CAS) Green Cities 2019',The research receives financial support from Dutch Research Council (NWO) though Merian Fund Cooperation China-The Netherlands (CAS) Green Cities 2019'.

However, the urgent need for GUIS in order to meet the Paris Agreement, has not translated into an easy implementation thereof. This paper proposes a circular design methodology (CDM) where the combination of research and practice contributes to minimize both current skepticism and barriers when implementing GUIS. It includes a community engagement process to better understand their sensitivity and build consensus on GUIS. Additionally, GUIS are implemented, in a series of pilot projects and specific research is applied to comprehend the environmental benefits derived from these GUIS. The paper argues that GUIS represent a significant opportunity to respond to climate change risks as well as to achieve other urban benefits; however, in order to overcome existing barriers and skepticism, the proposed CDM reaches for more consensual urban solutions and drives uptake and implementation of GUIS, contributing to move from pilot project to common practice.","[Laurenz, Jon; Belausteguigoitia, Jone; de la Fuente, Ander] Univ Basque Country, Sch Architecture, Architecture 137, San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Laurenz, Jon; Belausteguigoitia, Jone] Elkarte Txikia, Lurstudio Koop, Bilbao 48005, Spain; [Roehr, Daniel] Univ British Columbia, Sch Architecture & Landscape Architecture, Greenskinslab, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of Basque Country; University of British Columbia,"Laurenz, J (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Sch Architecture, Architecture 137, San Sebastian 20018, Spain.;Laurenz, J (corresponding author), Elkarte Txikia, Lurstudio Koop, Bilbao 48005, Spain.",jonlaurenz@lurstudio.com; jonebelauste@lurstudio.com; ander.delafuentea@ehu.eus; droehr@sala.ubc.ca,,,European Commission through LIFE 2016 program,European Commission through LIFE 2016 program,"The Project LIFE Good Local Adapt, included in the article as a case study, was funded by the European Commission through the LIFE 2016 program.",,57,1,1,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,DEC,2021,10,12,,,,,,,1376,10.3390/land10121376,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10121376,,,24,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YA8JW,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000738573800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, examining climate change and society as a historical narrative drawing upon politics, economics, and settlement patterns does not provide a direct link between climate and society. Given that most inhabitants of the premodern world engaged in agriculture and/or pastoralism, examining chronological correlations between climate and foodways, not as a historical narrative but as a longterm socioenvironmental process, has the potential to identify direct societal adaptations to a changing environment. From South Greece there is evidence for drier conditions at the end of the Late Bronze Age. Is the disappearance of writing, art, and many known settlements at the end of the Bronze Age an example of collapse in the face of inability to adapt to climate change? This is a difficult question to answer given the coarse resolution of many of our archaeological and climatic datasets. Settlement faunal records suggest that food production systems became increasingly homogenous in Late Bronze Age Greece, potentially due to an elite control over various production systems that promoted intensification of certain products. However, in the first millennium B.C.E., animal husbandry, specifically, and food production systems, more broadly, became more heterogenous, and a proportional increase in goats in areas with less rainfall was likely an adaptive response to the drier climate. This paper examines the adaptive relationship between foodways and climate and argues for a process driven approach when explaining social responses to ancient climate change.","[Dibble, Flint] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Class, HB 6086,Reed Hall,15 Coll St,Room 207, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Dibble, Flint] Amer Sch Class Studies Athens, Malcolm H Wiener Lab Archaeol Sci, 54 Souidias St, GR-10676 Athens, Greece; [Finne, Martin] Uppsala Univ, Dept Archaeol & Ancient Hist, Box 626, S-75126 Uppsala, Sweden",Dartmouth College; Uppsala University,"Dibble, F (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Class, HB 6086,Reed Hall,15 Coll St,Room 207, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",wfdibble@gmail.com,,"Dibble, Flint/0000-0001-6693-2888","Swedish Research Council [421-2014-1181, 201902868]; American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Malcolm H.

Different meanings of change are examined in the context of climate change. The term adaptation is similarly analyzed. Based on the understanding of those terms, four notions are defined and outlined in relation to decision-making for climate change adaptation: Ignorance versus Ignore-ance, surprise, foreseeability, and forecasting by analogy. The conclusions explore the interlinkages between society and the environment as well as how to turn lessons identified into lessons that are actually learned in order to be implemented.

A total of 121 smallholder farmers were randomly selected from three vulnerable rural farming communities in northern Ghana through a mixed methodological approach involving household surveys, interviews and focus group discussions. Data were analysed using descriptive and binary logistic regression with the help of IBM SPSS statistical software package integrated with qualitative thematic analysis involving transcription, categorization and interconnecting. The results show that majority (95.9%) of the smallholders have observed climatic changes in their local ecology with manifestations involving protracted drought (95.9%), unpredictable rainfall pattern (94.2%), high temperature (99.2%), strong winds (66.9%) and frequent flood events (99.2%). As a consequence, smallholders have observed that changes in temperature (99.2%) and rainfall patterns (97.5%) result in decreased agricultural output. In resolving the impacts, these smallholders employ preferred livelihood adaptive strategies involving non-farm diversification (51.2%), crop diversification (75.2%), changes in farm location (76.9%) and agrochemical application (100%) with moderate or high levels of effectiveness across space. The logistic regression results revealed that factors such as age, gender and access to credit significantly influenced smallholder farmers' observation and adaptation to climate change and variability. The findings suggest the need for a location-specific climate adaptation policy. By this, the local knowledge, adaptive capacity and resilience of smallholder farmers could be built upon to mitigate their vulnerability to food insecurity and poverty.","[Asante, Felix] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog & Rural Dev, Kumasi, Ghana; [Guodaar, Lawrence] Univ Adelaide, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Arimiyaw, Saasi] Sciences Po, Paris Sch Int Affairs, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Adelaide,"Asante, F (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog & Rural Dev, Kumasi, Ghana.",fasante.cass@knust.edu.gh,,"Asante, Felix/0000-0002-0601-6877; Guodaar, Lawrence/0000-0003-3227-6709",,,,,94,10,10,6,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-4645,2211-4653,,ENVIRON DEV,Environ.

As climate change has escalated, the management of such dangers has grown in importance and urgency, particularly among states with long coast lines. Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction have attracted attention from policymakers in Southeast Asia, which is one of the most disaster-prone regions. Coastal community resilience, however, is not determined by climate and disaster risks alone, but by other factors as well. Waste pollution is an environmental threat that may affect those who are dependent on marine resources. These multiple factors contribute to coastal resilience and are, in fact, addressed separately as different issues; therefore, conflicts or synergies in respective countermeasures often become oversights in the policy-making processes. Through a case study of key Philippine stakeholders, including fishing communities, we identified impacts of climate change, natural hazards, and waste on the livelihoods of community residents and the interplay among these factors. We aim to better understand the situation on the ground and contribute by improving policy recommendations for coastal communities.

This paper investigates how impacts of climate change on wheat anthesis date will influence impacts on fusarium ear blight in UK mainland arable areas. A wheat growth model was used for projections of anthesis dates, and a weather-based model was developed for use in projections of incidence of fusarium ear blight in the UK. Daily weather data, generated for 14 sites in arable areas of the UK for a baseline (1960-1990) scenario and for high and low CO2 emissions in the 2020s and 2050s, were used to project wheat anthesis dates and fusarium ear blight incidence for each site for each climate change scenario. Incidence of fusarium ear blight was related to rainfall during anthesis and temperature during the preceding 6 weeks. It was projected that, with climate change, wheat anthesis dates will be earlier and fusarium ear blight epidemics will be more severe, especially in southern England, by the 2050s. These projections, made by combining crop and disease models for different climate change scenarios, suggest that improved control of fusarium ear blight should be a high priority in industry and government strategies for adaptation to climate change to ensure food security.","[Madgwick, James W.; West, Jon S.; White, Rodger P.; Semenov, Mikhail A.; Townsend, James A.; Fitt, Bruce D.

This article attempts, through an extensive literature review, to understand convergences and divergences in perceptions of urban green spaces (UGSs) of city dwellers around the world and to identify gaps in the existing research. Additionally, the article explores research into the benefits associated with urban green spaces, including health (e.g., physical and mental), social (e.g., social networks and social relationships), economic (e.g., employment and income generation), and environmental (e.g., ecosystem services and biodiversity). This article further seeks to identify the extent to which urban residents have been found to perceive the roles UGSs can play in climate change adaptation and mitigation, and cultural exchange. Based on studies conducted in different countries over the past decade, this paper integrates environmental, social, cultural, and economic aspects of urban greening to provide insight into the similarities and differences in perceptions of urban green spaces and suggest approaches to building climate change resilient urban communities. This paper finds justification for: encouraging the use of integrated, multidisciplinary approaches, using innovative tools, for both the study and practical development of UGSs; conducting a greater number of studies of newer urban areas in developing countries; and considering the diverse disadvantages as well as the advantages of UGSs in order to support the continued development and expansion of this critical climate-friendly infrastructure. The more that residents' perceptions of and attitudes toward UGSs are incorporated into the design of such spaces, the more successful they will be at providing the myriad benefits they have the potential to offer.","[Haq, Shah Md Atiqul] Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sociol, Sylhet, Bangladesh; [Islam, Mohammad Nazrul] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Environm Policy Inst EPI, Corner Brook, NL, Canada; [Ahmed, Khandaker Jafor] Univ Adelaide, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Chowdhury, Mohammed Thanvir Ahmed] North East Univ Bangladesh, Dept Appl Sociol & Social Work, Sylhet, Bangladesh",Shahjalal University of Science & Technology (SUST); Memorial University Newfoundland; University of Adelaide,"Haq, SMA (corresponding author), Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sociol, Sylhet, Bangladesh.",shahatiq-soc@sust.edu,"Ahmed, Khandaker Jafor/J-5487-2019; Atiqul Haq, Shah Md/L-2195-2019","Ahmed, Khandaker Jafor/0000-0003-4409-5710; Atiqul Haq, Shah Md/0000-0001-9121-4028",,,,,69,3,3,16,38,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9634,,FRONT SUSTAIN CITIES,Front.

This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the progress made in mainstreaming climate adaptation into sectoral policies in CA based on insights from Cameroun. To achieve this, 30 strategic policy documents published by the government of Cameroun covering different aspects of climate adaptation were exploited. Additional information was obtained from interviews with 27 stakeholders working in relevant government ministries/institutions and international organizations. Results show that significant progress has been made to mainstream climate adaptation into the forestry and energy sectors. This has been facilitated by the putting in place of national policies that consider climate change impacts and mitigation/adaptation in these sectors. Meanwhile, little progress has been recorded in the water and agricultural. The lack of progress in these sectors can be attributed to the absence of national policies that take into account climate change impacts in these sectors. Overall results show that the National Adaptation Plan of Action has played a key role in enhancing the mainstreaming of climate adaptation into sectoral policies in Cameroun. Notwithstanding the progress recorded, many obstacles such as the lack of human and financial resources still exist. Stakeholders proposed a series of potentially useful solutions to tackling obstacles hindering cross-sectoral mainstreaming initiatives. This paper contributes to contemporary debates on the extent to which adaptation mainstreaming is happening at national level in sub-Saharan Africa, and reveals the obstacles that need to be addressed in order to sustain this initiative in CA and other regions of the continent.","[Nkiaka, Elias] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Nkiaka, Elias; Lovett, Jon C.] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Nkiaka, E (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",nkiaka@gmail.com,"Nkiaka, Elias/Q-9494-2019","Nkiaka, Elias/0000-0001-7362-9430",Commonwealth Scholarship Commission,Commonwealth Scholarship Commission,The authors wish to extend their sincere gratitude to the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission for providing the funds used to carry out fieldwork in Cameroun and a PhD scholarship award to the first author.

This study aims to investigate the potential impact of climate change on the hydrology of the Aipe river basin in Huila, Colombia. The abcd Thomas model (four parameters) was calibrated and validated for the stream flows of the Aipe catchment (1992-2012). The sensitivity and identifiability of the parameters were evaluated using the Monte Carlo Analysis Toolbox (MCAT). The results show the ability of the model to simulate the monthly stream flow (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0,89). The most influential parameters are: a (water storage in the soil) and c (contribution to the aquifer). From the simulated scenarios, the baseline (1992-2012) was estimated to be an average flow of 15,44 m(3)s(-1); the trend extrapolation scenario estimated a rate 13,79 m(3)s(-1) (-10,64%); while for the multi-model assembly scenario it was 9,34m(3)s(-1) (-39,47%) and for the A2 scenario it was 5,74m(3)s(-1) (-62,60%).

These hazards adversely affect drinking-water systems and thereby reduce access to safe drinking-water. Effective adaptation implementation minimizes the damaging impacts of these hazards. However, research on the enablers of and barriers to effective adaptation in low-income countries is lacking. This study maps enablers and barriers to climate change adaptation of water systems in coastal low-income countries using evidence from Viet Nam and the Philippines, countries which experience frequent extreme climate events. Interviews were carried out with staff from 29 water utilities and government agencies. A systematic framework for diagnosing barriers to climate change adaptation was used to analyze the responses. Five factors were identified as relevant to effective adaptation: partnerships; financial resources; human and technical resources; leadership and political will; and awareness of climate change. The factors identified were related to all the elements of the framework-actors, system of concern, and context-and were relevant to the three phases of the adaptation process (understanding the problem, planning the adaptation, and managing the implementation). Our findings can assist water system managers in diagnosing barriers to effective adaptation that may exist and identifying relevant partnerships and resources that will aid in overcoming these barriers.","[Ojomo, Edema; Bartram, Jamie] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Water Inst, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Rosenau Hall 144,135 Dauer Dr,CB 7431, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"Bartram, J (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Water Inst, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Rosenau Hall 144,135 Dauer Dr,CB 7431, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",jbartram@email.unc.edu,,"Bartram, Jamie/0000-0002-6542-6315","Climate Change Resilient Development project, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [CCRDACD0006]","Climate Change Resilient Development project, United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID))","This study was made possible through support of the Climate Change Resilient Development project, United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-Grant Number CCRDACD0006.

This article addresses this lacuna in existing literature and argues that climate change brings a new way of conceptualizing vulnerability to the traditional understanding of social protection, thereby altering who is targeted and how.

Adaptation strategies for crop production followed by the farmers at selected study locations had ranged from 6-30 per cent only, and this was mainly due to lack of awareness about the actual cost associated with adaptation and non-adaptation of these strategies. Design/methodology/approach - Hence, this study aims to address the cost of adaptation for rice using joint probability distribution of rainfall and crop prices. Findings - Cost of adaptation varied from INR2,389 to 4,395/ha for System of Rice Intensification (SRI); INR646 to 1,121/ha for alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and INR8,144 to 8,677/ha for well irrigation (WI), whereas expected cost for not using these technologies has ranged from INR6,976 to 9,172/ha for SRI; INR4,123 7,764/ha for AWD and INR10,825 to 17,270/ha for WI. Hence, promotion of the adaptation technologies itself will minimize the income losses to the farmers. Research limitations/implications - Even though, there are many ways for farmers (other than technology), to adapt to climate change (such as out-migration to cities, selling farm assets, focus on children's education, etc.), this report, given the framework of the major research study undertaken, addresses only farm-level adaptation of the technologies to enhance farm income. Originality/value - Public-private partnership in providing the technologies at cheaper costs, capacity building in handling the technologies and creating awareness about the technologies to minimize the expected cost of adaptation are suggested to improve the adoption level.","[Palanisami, Kuppanan; Kakumanu, Krishna Reddy] Int Water Management Inst, Hyderabad Off, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Ranganathan, C.

Men and women from 10 coastal communities in three provinces (Quebec, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island) were interviewed to better understand how both sexes perceived and reacted to extreme weather events. Their responses were recorded based on their experiences, personal and community levels of preparedness, as well as help received and effects on their lives. Most importantly, the findings denote that more men were personally prepared and more active in the community than women. More men recognized a deficiency in help at the community level, and were critical of government in particular, addressing a lack of financial interventions and support. Women were forthcoming with their emotions, admitting to feeling fear and worry, and their perceptions in terms of impacts and actions were closer to home. The results support what others have shown that in rural and coastal communities the traditional division of labor may influence and lead to a gender bias in terms of actions and gradual adaptation in communities. There is a need to better understand how these sometimes subtle differences may affect decisions that do not always consider women's roles and experiences in the face of extreme events.","[Vasseur, Liette; Thornbush, Mary] Brock Univ, Dept Biol Sci, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Thornbush, Mary] Brock Univ, Dept Geog, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Plante, Steve] Univ Quebec, Dept Soc Terr & Dev, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada",Brock University; Brock University; University of Quebec,"Thornbush, M (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 500 Glenridge Ave, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",lvasseur@brocku.ca; mthornbush@brocku.ca; steve_plante@uqar.ca,"Thornbush, Mary/AAM-8401-2021","Thornbush, Mary/0000-0001-9354-2797",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada through Coastal Communities Challenges Community-University Research Alliance,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada through Coastal Communities Challenges Community-University Research Alliance,"The authors are grateful to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for funding this research through the Coastal Communities Challenges Community-University Research Alliance.

This paper examines collaborations among actors in the process of climate information production and dissemination in the Namibian agricultural sector. The aim is to investigate the extent to which subsistence farmers are integrated into the collaboration process and the impact of the collaboration on the nature and accessibility of disseminated information. Key informant interviews and a questionnaire survey were used for data collection. Using network analysis, we estimated the networks' density, clustering coefficient, and degree centrality. The study found that both the climate information production and dissemination networks have a high overall clustering coefficient (78% and 77%, respectively) suggesting a high rate of collaboration among the actors in the networks. However, the frequency of interactions between the actors in both the information production and dissemination networks and subsistence farmers remains very low. Nearly all surveyed farmers reported that they meet with information providers only once in a year. The effect of this poor interaction is reflected in the poor occurrence of feedback learning, which is needed to optimize channels of information dissemination to subsistence farmers and enhance the robustness of disseminated information. We recommend innovative communication means via mobile phone, promotion of peer-to-peer learning, flexible collaboration relations with more space for feedback from the users of climate information, and more attention to long-term forecasts and their implications for adaptive actions.","[Ofoegbu, Chidiebere; New, Mark] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Ofoegbu, Chidiebere] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Swedish Species Informat Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden",University of Cape Town; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Ofoegbu, C; New, M (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.;Ofoegbu, C (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Swedish Species Informat Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden.",ofoegbu.c@gmail.com; mark.new@uct.ac.za,"New, Mark/A-7684-2008; Ofoegbu, Chidiebere/Q-8372-2019","New, Mark/0000-0001-6082-8879; Ofoegbu, Chidiebere/0000-0002-8920-9411","International Development Research Centre, Canada (IDRC); Dept. for International Development, United Kingdom (DFID); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences","International Development Research Centre, Canada (IDRC); Dept. for International Development, United Kingdom (DFID); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences","Research for this article was part of work on the project Adaptation at Scales in Semi-Arid Regions (ASSAR).

It is essential to have a better understanding of farmers' assessments of the efficacy of adaptive behaviors for formulating appropriate adaptation policies and improving farmers' ability to adapt to climate change. Based on survey data from interviews with farmers in the Loess Plateau, the features of farmers' perceived adaptation efficacy are analyzed. Three multiple linear regression models are used to analyze farmers' perceived efficacy of adaptive behaviors and identify factors influencing those assessments in terms of farmers' demographical and social factors, their perception of climate change, their perception of climate change effects and the average temperature and precipitation from 2005 to 2015 in this area. The results are as follows: (1) Generally, the adaptive behaviors with high perceived adaptation efficacy were used by most respondents. Measures with relatively low perceived adaptation efficacy were not commonly adopted, such as migration, buying insurance, changing planting and harvesting time. (2) The factors affect the perceived efficacy of adaption behavior in decreasing order are as follows: perception of climate change, the average precipitation, and demographical and social factors. Perception of local natural disasters, perception of planting and harvesting time, crop yield and diseases and insect pests caused by climate change were found to affect farmers' adaptation assessments. The key demographical and social factors influencing farmers' assessments were non-farming income, farming income, farmland quantity, gender, the frequency of watching TV and going to the market.

The approach, which was tested in the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 degrees C (SR1.5) to assess 23 adaptation options, is underpinned by a systematic review of recent literature, expert elicitation, and iterative peer review. It responds to the challenge of limited agreement on adaptation indicators, lack of fine-scale adaptation data, and challenges of assessing synergies and trade-offs with mitigation.

Some castles and fortifications have a high level of structural instability due to their high exposure to changing environmental conditions, especially those in direct contact with the sea. This article focuses on identifying the level of risk posed by climate change to coastal fortifications in the Canary Islands. The methodology implemented identifies the exposure and vulnerability of these fortifications, based on a scorecard assigning values of risk to rising sea levels. Four risk categories were selected based on their exposure to either coastal flooding, coastal erosion or coastline retreat, and taking into account its sensitivity through a structural analysis of buildings. There are currently fifteen coastal fortifications from the Early Modern Period in this archipelago and two have been identified as being especially threatened by rising sea levels. Results highlight a need to increase their adaptive capacity, incorporating changes in legislation, including climate change adaptation measures as a basic strategy in cultural heritage management. Options such as the construction of submerged defenses or dikes in order to dissipate the force of the waves could be successful adaptation measures, considered from the perspective of preserving both the landscape and the environment of these historical sites. This assessment provides support to policy makers for the management of coastal fortifications in the context of climate change. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Yet, partnerships are not a panacea and more research is required to understand the role that they can play in disaster risk management and particularly disaster risk reduction. This paper investigates how partnerships can incentivise flood risk reduction by focusing on the UK public-private partnership on flood insurance. Developing the right flood insurance arrangements to incentivise flood risk reduction and adaptation to climate change is a key challenge. In the face of rising flood risks due to climate change and socio-economic development insurance partnerships can no longer afford to focus only on the risk transfer function. However, while expectations of the insurance industry have traditionally been high when it comes to flood risk management, the insurance industry alone will not provide the solution to the challenge of rising risks. The case of flood insurance in the UK illustrates this: even national government and industry together cannot fully address these risks and other actors need to be involved to create strong incentives for risk reduction. Using an agent-based model focused on surface water flood risk in London we analyse how other partners could strengthen the insurance partnership by reducing flood risk and thus helping to maintain affordable insurance premiums. Our findings are relevant for wider discussions on the potential of insurance schemes to incentivise flood risk management and climate adaptation in the UK and also internationally.

The paper has two objectives. One is to critically review present vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies employed by the state, private sector, non-governmental organisations, community-based organisations and households. The other is to discuss vulnerabilities and identify adaptation and resiliency strategies which are considered most applicable beyond the 1.5 degrees C limit. The Caribbean Region is the focus of the paper. A key finding of the paper is that temperature change above the 1.5 degrees C limit set by the Paris Conference of the Parties will make the natural and human systems of SIDS even more highly vulnerable than they are already. Another finding is that Caribbean states have implemented various innovative climate change adaptation strategies, but their relevance should the 1.5 degrees C target be exceeded, requires further exploration. The paper is useful to policymakers, decision-makers and finance agencies in search of practical solutions to avert the implications for Caribbean settlements, economies and ecosystems should the temperature warming exceed 1.5 degrees C.","[Mycoo, Michelle A.] Univ West Indies, Dept Geomat Engn & Land Management, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine,"Mycoo, MA (corresponding author), Univ West Indies, Dept Geomat Engn & Land Management, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",michelle.mycoo@sta.uwi.edu,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,63,47,46,4,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

These agricultural reforms, however, do not exist in isolation. They work in conjunction with water policy reform to reshape agricultural systems and the people who manage these landscapes. While there has been significant research on agrarian change under neoliberal reform, few scholars have conducted empirical studies that examine how agricultural policy leverages water policy reform to generate changes across agricultural landscapes. Drawing on the case study of the Piura River basin in Northern Peru, this paper first explores how the IWRM inspired 2009 Water Resources Law furthers the state's agricultural development priorities by shifting water toward agro-export production. Secondly, this study demonstrates how climate change is being discursively mobilized as an emerging driver of water scarcity to legitimize these water reallocations. Thirdly, this case highlights how these water reallocations work in concert with the reinstatement of targeted agricultural support programs that seek to transform smallholder farmers into agro-export entrepreneurs but with meaningful exclusions. This study contributes to the limited scholarship on the 2009 Water Resources Law in Peru and also raises broader questions regarding how IWRM water management, climate change adaptation discourse, and agricultural development policy collectively promote the globalization of smallholder agriculture.","[Mills-Novoa, Megan] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, POB 210137, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Mills-Novoa, M (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, POB 210137, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",mmillsnovoa@email.arizona.edu,"Segura, Renato/AAV-8757-2020","Mills-Novoa, Megan/0000-0002-1780-9266",U.S. Agency for International Development U.S. National Academies of Sciences Project [PEER II 2-359]; NSF [DEB-101049]; Tinker Foundation; University of Arizona's Social and Behavioral Sciences Research Institute,U.S. Agency for International Development U.S. National Academies of Sciences Project(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Tinker Foundation; University of Arizona's Social and Behavioral Sciences Research Institute,"The author appreciates the mentorship of Drs.

Despite relatively high biodiversity, the temperate forests in East Asia have lacked a comprehensive regional evaluation of potential climate change impacts. Here, we assess the level of climate change exposure of the Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests Biome of East Asia by 2070. These temperate forests occupy 18 ecoregions, five countries, and 102 provinces. We categorize climate change exposure by classifying baseline (1960-1990) climate conditions for the current geographic distribution of five temperate forest types within each ecoregion and within the biome. We then measure the level of change under four future climates: a warmer or a hotter future climate and under reduced emissions (RCP4.5) or with emissions continuing unabated (RCP8.5). By 2070, using the RCP8.5 emission scenario, 24.5-65.7% of these forests enter non-analog or the most marginal 1% of baseline climate conditions. These results reveal the need for extensive transboundary governmental coordination, including forest preservation actions among 51 of 54 provinces that will retain some forest locations in climatically stable or low-risk conditions. Furthermore, among 96 provinces with forests that will be highly exposed, 90 will require transboundary climate change adaptation strategies because these forests span their borders, including the border areas of China, the Russian Federation, and North Korea. The analytical approach of this study could serve as a template for supporting transboundary institutional coordination to address climate change.","[Choe, Hyeyeong] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Ecol Landscape Architecture Design, Chunchon 24341, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Thorne, James H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Kangwon National University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Choe, H (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Ecol Landscape Architecture Design, Chunchon 24341, Gangwon Do, South Korea.",hychoe@kangwon.ac.kr,,"Choe, Hyeyeong/0000-0003-2130-1622",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2019R1G1A1005770],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT),"We appreciate the global data depositories for public use including the World Wildlife Fund, USGS Land Cover Institute, WorldClim, and Natural Earth.

Despite growing evidence that NbS can reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts in general, understanding of the mechanisms through which this is achieved, particularly in the Global South, is lacking. To address this, we analyse 85 nature-based interventions across the rural Global South, and factors mediating their effectiveness, based on a systematic map of peer-reviewed studies encompassing a wide diversity of ecosystems, climate impacts, and intervention types. We apply an analytical framework of people's social-ecological vulnerability to climate change, in terms of six pathways of vulnerability reduction: social and ecological exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Most cases (95%) report a reduction in vulnerability, primarily by lowering ecosystem sensitivity to climate impacts (73% of interventions), followed by reducing social sensitivity (52%), reducing ecological exposure (36%), increasing social adaptive capacity (31%), increasing ecological adaptive capacity (19%) and/or reducing social exposure (14%). Our analysis shows that social dimensions of NBS are important mediating factors for equity and effectiveness. This study highlights how understanding the distinct social and ecological pathways by which vulnerability to climate change is reduced can help harness the multiple benefits of working with nature in a warming world.","[Woroniecki, Stephen; Spiegelenberg, Femke A.; Key, Isabel] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies, Environm Change Unit, Linkoping, Sweden; [Woroniecki, Stephen; Chausson, Alexandre; Turner, Beth; Seddon, Nathalie] Univ Oxford, Dept Biol, Nat Based Solut Initiat, Oxford, England; [Turner, Beth] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Etud Foret, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Key, Isabel] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Changing Oceans Grp, Edinburgh, Scotland; [Md.

Vulnerability maps are used to direct attention to geographic areas where impacts on society are expected to be greatest and that may therefore require adaptation interventions. Under the Green Climate Fund and other bilateral climate adaptation funding mechanisms, donors are investing billions of dollars of adaptation funds, often with guidance from modeling results, visualized and communicated through maps and spatial decision support tools. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of 84 studies that map social vulnerability to climate impacts. These assessments are compiled by interdisciplinary teams of researchers, span many regions, range in scale from local to global, and vary in terms of frameworks, data, methods, and thematic foci. The goal is to identify common approaches to mapping, evaluate their strengths and limitations, and offer recommendations and future directions for the field. The systematic review finds some convergence around common frameworks developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, frequent use of linear index aggregation, and common approaches to the selection and use of climate and socioeconomic data. Further, it identifies limitations such as a lack of future climate and socioeconomic projections in many studies, insufficient characterization of uncertainty, challenges in map validation, and insufficient engagement with policy audiences for those studies that purport to be policy relevant. Finally, it provides recommendations for addressing the identified shortcomings.

While the mainstreaming of climate adaptation into policy documents is relatively easy, the implementation of these policies seems to be more problematic. Barriers to climate adaptation often occur during this stage as the implementation of the policies is generally undertaken by other actors than the policy-makers. These actors act based on organizational routines. As organizational routines aim to provide stability, they tend to be reaffirmative. Reorganizing the resources and practices of these actors to initiate mainstreaming then proves difficult. Consequently, the routines could prevent change that might be necessary to address new policy objectives such as climate adaptation. An analytical framework consisting of four self-reinforcing mechanisms is used to understand and explain why and how organizational routines can hamper the mainstreaming of climate adaptation during implementation. A case study is used to illustrate organizational routines as possible barriers. The paper concludes by stating that to optimize the possibilities of mainstreaming climate adaptation, a change in routines is necessary. In order to stimulate change in organizational routines, the focus should be on reflecting on existing routines, legitimacy building and learning.","[Uittenbroek, Caroline J.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Human Geog & Spatial Planning, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Uittenbroek, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Environm Governance, Utrecht, Netherlands.",c.j.uittenbroek@uu.nl,"Uittenbroek, Caroline/C-3186-2017","Uittenbroek, Caroline/0000-0003-3191-1707",,,,,36,33,33,4,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-908X,1522-7200,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

The results showed that the grain-filling duration of maize would be shortened 6-15 days in the future as a result of climate change. Thus, potential maize yield would decrease by 2-32%, and rainfed maize yield would decrease by 0-24% during 2010-2099 relative to 1976-2005. In response to climate change, adaptive measures should be taken to overcome its projected impact. The adoption of new cultivars while maintaining the same pre-flowering and post-flowering duration in the future as in the present would help to improve potential maize yield by 50-61% in three time slices (2030s, 2050s, and 2070s) and would be a better choice for high yields in the future. The cultivars that would maintain the same post-flowering duration in the future as in the present would be a better choice than the cultivars that would maintain the pre-flowing periods for summer maize in China. Adjusting sowing dates would be another important way to extend post-flowering periods and further improve maize yield. If the maize cultivar currently used was adopted, delaying the sowing date would improve the potential maize yield by 2-25%. If future maize cultivars that maintained the growing period even as warmer temperatures accelerate phenological development were adopted, delaying the sowing date would improve the potential maize yield by 0-8.9%. The interactive effect of sowing and cultivars was quantified. Based on the findings of this study, future maize cultivars maintaining the growing period were adopted, and delaying the sowing date could still improve potential maize yield worldwide. Two regional adaptation strategies to climate change could offset the potential reduction of maize production worldwide, which would provide farmers and policy-makers with explicit guidance.","[Lv, Zunfu; Li, Feifei; Lu, Guoquan] Zhejiang A&F Univ, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Dept Agron, Key Lab Qual Improvement Agr Prod Zhejiang Prov, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China; [Lv, Zunfu] Zhejiang A&F Univ, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China",Zhejiang A&F University; Zhejiang A&F University,"Lv, ZF (corresponding author), Zhejiang A&F Univ, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Dept Agron, Key Lab Qual Improvement Agr Prod Zhejiang Prov, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China.;Lv, ZF (corresponding author), Zhejiang A&F Univ, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China.",lvzunfu@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [31701322],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31701322).,,39,21,21,20,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

While differences are expected between these quantitative and qualitative sources due to the fact that there is often a gap between any extreme weather event and its impact, there was less difference than expected. However, these gaps are significant because politicians, policy makers and emergency preparedness planners do, or at least should, take into account the perceptions of those most directly affected by climate extremes and understand the instances.

The need for distributed risk governance and citizen engagement is increasingly recognised; however, few empirical studies systematically assess interactions between citizens and municipalities in climate risk management and adaptation. Here, we develop an explorative framework, applied to three Swedish municipalities, to map existing adaptation interactions' and analyse how responsibilities for climate adaptation manifest and are (re)negotiated. The results show that adaptation planners rarely consider collaborations with citizens, despite positive adaptation outcomes from related local processes. Structures and mechanisms for systematic monitoring and learning are also lacking. We argue that fostering collaborations with citizens - to support long-term adaptation and reduce the adaptation burden of those most at risk - requires consideration of four strategic issues: proactive engagement; equity and responsibilisation'; nature-based approaches; and systematic adaptation mainstreaming. Finally, we discuss how our analytical framework can contribute to further theorising municipalities' engagement with citizens on climate risk. (c) 2017 The Authors.

This advanced review synthesizes knowledge on how, by whom and where adaptation actions can be taken in the agriculture and industrial sectors to reduce these transboundary climate risks (TCRs). We find a material difference in the literature on TCRs in agriculture as compared with industrial sectors. Operational and market risks, in particular reductions in food availability, dominate in agriculture, while supply chain and trade-related risks are highlighted for industry. While the origin of the risk (source) is the primary target of adaptation to agricultural TCRs, the general governance structure, such as UNFCCC and WTO deliberations, are important targets in both sectors. Adaptation at the country of destination and along the trade network is of minor importance in both sectors. Regarding the type of adaptation option, agriculture heavily relies on trade policy, agricultural adaptation, and adaptation planning and coordination, while in industry knowledge creation, research and development, and risk management are seen as essential. Governments and the international community are identified as key actors, complemented by businesses and research as critical players in industry. Some measures, such as protectionist trade policies and irrigation, are controversial as they shift risks across countries and sectors, rather than reduce them. While more research is needed, this review shows that a critical mass of evidence on adaptation to TCRs is beginning to emerge, particularly underscoring the importance of international coordination mechanisms.

We model adoptions of crops, livestock, and forests. Both specialized and diversified enterprises are modelled. This paper finds that livestock, forests, and a diversification into crops, livestock, and forests are key adaptation strategies. Under the UKMO (United Kingdom Meteorological Office) scenario, a livestock-only enterprise would expand by 4 per cent, a crops-livestock-forests by 3 per cent, and a forests-only by 3 per cent. Adaptation behaviours are closely tied with ecosystem changes under global warming. A livestock-only would increase especially in the grasslands. A crops-livestock-forests enterprise expands into xeromorphic forests. A crops-livestock expands in Andean grasslands and tall grasslands. A forests-only expands in the coasts and woody zones. A crops-only enterprise decreases across South America.","Univ Sydney, Fac Agr & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Seo, SN (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Agr & Environm, RD Watt A04, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",niggol.seo@sydney.edu.au,,"Seo, S.

J,"Sovacool, BK",,,,"Sovacool, Benjamin K.",,,"Bamboo Beating Bandits: Conflict, Inequality, and Vulnerability in the Political Ecology of Climate Change Adaptation in Bangladesh",WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,political economy; disempowerment; dispossession; displacement; resilience; elite capture,INTEGRATING MITIGATION; CHAR; LIVELIHOODS; POLICY; PERSPECTIVES; COMMUNITIES; RESPONSES; DRIVERS; DROUGHT; HAZARDS,"Bangladesh contributes little to global greenhouse gas emissions, yet it is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Based on semi-structured research interviews as a conduit to a literature review, this paper shows how the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment impede the vitality of its climate change adaptation efforts. Enclosure refers to when adaptation projects transfer public assets into private hands or expand the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when adaptation projects limit access to resources or marginalize particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when adaptation projects intrude on bio-diversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when adaptation projects aggravate the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsen concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. In the case of Bangladeshi, climate change policies implemented under the country's National Adaptation Program of Action have enabled elites to capture land through public servants, the military, and even gangs carrying bamboo sticks. Exclusionary forms of adaptation planning exist at both the national and local scales. Climate protection measures have encroached upon village property, char (public) land, forests, farms, and other public commons. Most egregiously, community coping strategies for climate change have entrenched class and ethnic hierarchies ultimately trapping the poor, powerless, and displaced into a predatory patronage system that can aggravate human insecurity and intensify violent conflict. Planners and practitioners of adaptation need to become more cognizant of the potential for projects to harm others, or admit complicity in the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment, if they are ever to be eliminated.

Building capacities to cope with climate change requires going beyond simply providing 'more knowledge' on climate impacts to policy makers. Instead, climate adaptation can be understood as a multi-step social process in which individuals and organizations need to learn how to (1) manage different framings of the issues at stake while raising awareness of climate risks and opportunities, (2) understand different motives for, and generate adequate incentives or sanctions to ensure, action, (3) develop feasible options and resources for individual and collective transformation and collaboration and (4) institutionalize new rights, responsibilities and feedback learning processes for climate adaptation in the long term.

The model helps us grasp the effects of climate change perception and hypothetical shifts in destination attractiveness, as well as threat and coping appraisals in light of tourists' adaptation intentions in coastal destinations. We collected a total of 333 on-site valid questionnaires from domestic tourists at Kenting National Park in Taiwan and analysed the structural relationships in the aforementioned study constructs using structural equation modelling. Our findings show that when tourists have a higher level of perception regarding global climate change, they believe that destination attractiveness will decrease. When presented with scenarios of hypothetical shifts in destination attractiveness, tourists with higher levels of adaptation intention will perceive greater levels of threat to tourism behaviours, as well as higher effectiveness in adaptive measures. We confirmed that the proposed theoretical framework for tourists' adaptation intention toward climate change is useful; the framework also sheds light on tourists' acknowledgement of hypothetical alterations in destination attractiveness caused by climate change, in addition to their psychological adaptations.

A theoretical framework was developed to assess bank climate change strategic actions based on five categories: management commitment, emissions reduction, product development, organizational involvement and external relationship development. A sample of international banks from 15 countries in four regions was analysed. Significant differences were found in the level of climate change strategic actions by banks across regions. North American banks had the highest scores on management commitment and product development. Australian banks were the top performers in external relationship development. European banks were ranked first in emissions reduction. Asian banks received the lowest score in all the categories of climate change strategic actions. The research is a unique comparative exploratory study of the strategic actions taken to address climate change in the international banking industry. The theoretical contribution of this article is its link between the theory of organizational adaptation and the climate change actions that banks practice. The research is beneficial for bank executives to develop effective environmental actions that will increase climate change mitigation and adaptation globally but particularly in Asia, which is the critical region for climate change actions.","[Buranatrakul, Thanita] Thammasat Univ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Swierczek, Fredric William] Thammasat Univ, Thammasat Business Sch, Bangkok, Thailand",Thammasat University; Thammasat University,"Buranatrakul, T (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Business Adm Div, 999,Phuthamonthon 4 Rd, Phutthamonthon 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.",thanita-bur53@tbs.tu.ac.th,,,,,,,61,4,4,4,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0972-1509,0973-0664,,GLOB BUS REV,Glob.

Although such zoning regulations can be effective in limiting trends in flood risk, they also have adverse impacts on society, for instance by limiting local development of areas near the water. In order to judge whether proposed land-use or zoning policies are a net benefit to society, they should be accepted or rejected based on a societal cost-benefit analysis (CBA). However, conducting a CBA of zoning regulation is complex and comprehensive guidelines of how to do such an analysis are lacking. We offer guidelines for good practice. In order to assess the costs and benefits of zoning as a climate change adaption strategy, they should be assessed at a societal level in order to account for public good features of flood risk reduction strategies, and because costs in one area can be benefits in another region. We propose a multistep process: first, determine the spatial extent of the zoning policy and how interconnected the zoned area is to other locations; second, conduct a CBA using monetary costs and benefits estimated from an integrated hydro-economic model to investigate if total benefits exceed total costs; third, conduct a sensitivity analysis regarding the main assumptions; fourth, conduct a multicriteria analysis (MCA) of the normative outcomes of a zoning policy. A desirable policy is preferred in both the CBA and MCA.

In this context, the potential role of salt marshes to adapt the Wadden Sea's flood defences was explored in the Netherlands Wadden Region Delta Programme. This paper provides an overview of the steps taken by the programme in developing a climate change adaptation strategy so that others might learn from its experiences. The second aim is to summarize the knowledge generated by the programme on the potential role of salt marshes as part of a climate change adaption strategy. Explorative modelling results indicate that Wadden Sea salt marshes affect wave heights, even under extreme conditions. Therefore, a salt-marsh zone in front of the Wadden Sea dikes that could keep pace with sea level rise may result in a reduced dike reinforcement task. A salt marsh potential map gives a rough impression of locations that are potentially interesting for salt marsh conservation and development, based on the current situation, on available information about abiotic conditions for salt marsh formation and the habitats present in the coastal zone. Besides elongated stretches were seminatural salt marshes are already present or developing, several stretches along the Dutch Wadden Sea coast have favourable abiotic conditions for salt marsh development. However, the prospects for integrating salt marshes into flood defences depend also on other aspects. Various nature conservation agreements are in effect with their associated obligations. Furthermore, the foreseen value of salt marsh development compared to traditional reinforcements, in terms of both costs and benefits, must be considered.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Earth Syst Sci Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"van Loon-Steensma, JM (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Earth Syst Sci Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",Jantsje.vanLoon@wur.nl,,"van Loon-Steensma, Jantsje M./0000-0002-6181-7829",Knowledge for Climate Programme (theme 1),Knowledge for Climate Programme (theme 1),"This work was supported by the Knowledge for Climate Programme (theme 1).

In the. second, I attempt to sketch an approach to ethical deliberation that better handles and sensitizes us to the complex concerns that arise in such situations, referring to an interdisciplinary research project, Institutional Adaptations to Climate Change, as a way to illustrate how this ethic would work.

Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the authors used the vulnerability to resilience model and binary logit model to analyse the factors influencing household decisions to adapt. Findings - Households with increased access to climate information through extension services were likely to have better adaptation abilities. It was also shown that younger farmers were likely to adapt to climate change given their flexibility to adopt new techniques and their access and use of modern information and technology. Larger households were found to have higher probability of adapting as most adaptation strategies are labour intensive. Household's possession of livestock and access to credit significantly enhanced adaptation. However, households with higher farm income have lesser incentives to adapt to because their current farming practices might already be optimum. Research limitations/implications - Given that most of the smallholder farmers are vulnerable, such as women-headed households and the elderly, who are labour constrained, there is need for research and development of labour saving technologies to increase resilience to climate change and vulnerability. Originality/value - These findings underscore the importance of enabling farmer access to information and better technologies which enable them to increase adaptive capacity and resilience.","[Jiri, Obert; Mafongoya, Paramu L.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Jiri, Obert] Univ Zimbabwe, Fac Agr, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Chivenge, Pauline] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Zimbabwe; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT),"Jiri, O (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.;Jiri, O (corresponding author), Univ Zimbabwe, Fac Agr, Harare, Zimbabwe.",obertjiri@yahoo.co.uk,"Chivenge, Pauline/AAF-9976-2019","Jiri, Obert/0000-0001-9588-2410","National Research Foundation of South Africa through the Research Chair: Agronomy and Rural Development, University of KwaZulu-Natal","National Research Foundation of South Africa through the Research Chair: Agronomy and Rural Development, University of KwaZulu-Natal","This study was funded by the National Research Foundation of South Africa through the Research Chair: Agronomy and Rural Development, University of KwaZulu-Natal.",,50,16,16,5,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

(Sweden),CITIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Adaptation; Malmo ?; Activism; Vulnerability,GOVERNANCE; DISCOURSE; MOVEMENT; JUSTICE; RISK,"Climate change adaptation is rising on the agenda of cities. However, critics have argued that urban adaptation efforts largely focus on preserving economic growth while overlooking the root causes of unequal vulnerability to climate impacts, giving rise to climate injustices. In response, literature on transformational adaptation has politicized these issues but it has remained largely conceptual, particularly in relation to the question of which actors can define and advance transformative approaches. Furthermore, existing empirical studies focus on positive cases while ignoring why these issues more commonly are not politicized. In this article, we add empirical rigour to these debates through an investigation into Malmo center dot's climate politics. We analyse what enables or inhibits the role of three political outsiders - disadvantaged communities, climate movements and social justice activists - in politicizing urban climate adaptation. We find that, while the most vulnerable social groups struggle with climatic impacts and experience difficulties in politicizing these issues, climate movements remain focused on climate mitigation and largely ignore local adaptation. In turn, we highlight the untapped capacity of social justice activism to act as social infrastructure for adaptation. Our findings suggest that alliances between the victims of adaptation injustices and local activist groups could support the politicization of those grievances by responding to emerging needs and by building policy-oriented pressure for transformational adaptation. However, we identify several factors that limit this potential, thereby contributing to an understanding of why social movements sometimes do not live up to their transformational potential.","[Rosa, Salvatore Paolo De] Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Biskopsgatan 5, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [de Moor, Joost] Ctr European Studies & Comparat Polit, Sci Po, 27 Rue St Guillaume, F-75337 Paris, France; [Dabaieh, Marwa] Malmo Univ, Fac Culture & Soc, Dept Urban Studies, S-20506 Malmo, Sweden; [Rosa, Salvatore Paolo De] Charlotte Muncks Vej 4,1th, Copenhagen 2400, Denmark",Lund University; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Malmo University,"Rosa, SPD (corresponding author), Charlotte Muncks Vej 4,1th, Copenhagen 2400, Denmark.",Salvatore_paolo.de_rosa@lucsus.lu.se,,"de Moor, Joost/0000-0002-0413-9590; De Rosa, Salvatore Paolo/0000-0001-9655-1533","Svenska Forskningsrdet Formas [2017-01962_3, 2018-02800, 2017-01980]; Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC: ES/M010163/1]; Stockholm University",Svenska Forskningsrdet Formas; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Stockholm University,"This work was supported by the Svenska Forskningsrdet Formas [2017-01962_3, 2018-02800 and 2017-01980] , the Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC: ES/M010163/1] and Stockholm University.",,78,2,2,10,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,NOV,2022,130,,,,,,,,103848,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103848,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2022.103848,,JUL 2022,11,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,3B1LZ,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000827711100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, a gap remains between public understanding, scientific knowledge about climate change, and changes in behaviour to effect adaptation. 'Serious games'-games used for purposes other than entertainment-are one way to reduce this adaptation deficit by enhancing opportunities for social learning and enabling positive action. Games can provide communities with the opportunity to interactively explore different climate futures, build capability and capacity for dealing with complex challenges, and socialise adaptation priorities with diverse publics. Using systematic review methods, this paper identifies, reviews, synthesises and assesses the literature on serious games for climate change adaptation. To determine where and how impact is achieved, we draw on an evaluation framework grounded in social learning, to assess which combinations of cognitive (knowledge and thinking), normative (norms and approaches) and relational (how people connect and network building) learning are achieved. Results show that factors influencing the overall success in influencing behaviour and catalysing learning for adaptation include generating high levels of interand intra-level trust between researchers, practitioners and community participants; strong debriefing and evaluation practices; and the use of experienced and knowledgeable facilitators. These results can help inform future game design, and research methodologies to develop robust ways for engaging with stakeholders and end users, and enhance learning effects for resilient climate futures.","[Flood, Stephen; Cradock-Henry, Nicholas A.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, 54 Gerald St, Lincoln 7608, New Caledonia; [Flood, Stephen] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Blackett, Paula] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Gate 10 Silverdale Rd Hillcrest, Hamilton 3216, New Zealand; [Edwards, Peter] New Zealand Forest Res Inst Ltd, Scion, 86-90 Lambton Quay, Wellington 6143, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; Scion,"Flood, S (corresponding author), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, 54 Gerald St, Lincoln 7608, New Caledonia.;Flood, S (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.",floodS@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Edwards, Peter/H-5773-2019","Edwards, Peter/0000-0002-7025-4124; Flood, Stephen/0000-0001-8206-737X; Cradock-Henry, Nicholas/0000-0002-4409-9976; Blackett, Paula/0000-0001-7399-7727","Resilience to Nature's Challenge National Science Challenge, New Zealand's Ministry for Business Innovation and Employment; Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research Strategic Science Investment Funding; New Zealand's Natural HazardsResearch Platform","Resilience to Nature's Challenge National Science Challenge, New Zealand's Ministry for Business Innovation and Employment; Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research Strategic Science Investment Funding; New Zealand's Natural HazardsResearch Platform","We would like to thank our respective institutions for their support.
